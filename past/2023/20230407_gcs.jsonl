Space correspondent Kristin Fisher will bring us moment-by-moment reporting from the launch, along with a team of experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nArtemis I will carry an unconventional crew when it’s expected to lift off Wednesday on a journey around the moon.\n\nRather than astronauts, a mannequin named Commander Moonikin Campos will helm the Orion spacecraft, with two mannequin torsos called Helga and Zohar along for the ride.\n\nThe Artemis program aims to land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon and eventually deliver astronauts to Mars.\n\nThe inaugural mission will test out the new Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft and multiple components designed to make deep space travel safer for humans.\n\nCommander Moonikin Campos (left) and twin torsos Helga and Zohar will be the crew for Artemis I. NASA\n\nMannequins in a spacecraft with enviable views of the moon may sound like some sort of joke, but these three passengers will serve as canaries in the coal mine of space.\n\nOrion will travel 40,000 miles (64,373 kilometers) beyond the moon, breaking the record set by Apollo 13, to go farther than any spacecraft intended to carry humans.\n\nThis is far from low-Earth orbit, where the International Space Station circles the Earth. Orion’s future crews will be exposed to deep space radiation – especially once they venture for longer stays on the moon and set off for Mars.\n\nMoonikin’s mission\n\nCommander Moonikin Campos’ name, picked via a public contest, is a nod to Arturo Campos, a NASA electrical power subsystem manager who aided in the troubled Apollo 13’s safe return to Earth. The mannequin, sporting the Orion Crew Survival System suit, can collect data on what future human crews might experience.\n\nCommander Moonikin Campos will test out a flight suit intended for future astronauts. Ben Smegelsky/NASA\n\nThe suit has been designed for Artemis astronauts to wear during launch and reentry, and it is outfitted with two radiation sensors.\n\nIt can sustain a crew member for up to six days in the event of an in-space emergency, something that has never been attempted before, said Dustin Gohmert, Orion Crew Survival Systems project manager at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n“You can almost think of it as a personalized spacecraft – a secondary but much more personalized spacecraft that protects the crew member, provides them pressure, oxygen, cooling and any other life-sustaining functions that are needed,” Gohmert said.\n\nDummies were in place for drop tests in new seats to simulate the Orion spacecraft's environment. NASA\n\nWith new safety features, Commander Moonikin Campos’ seat resembles that of a race car’s, with a cocoon forming around its occupant, he said. The seat has shock absorbers in case of landing in rough seas or other scenarios.\n\nPhantom twins\n\nTwin mannequins Helga and Zohar have a separate mission. The two torsos are based on phantoms, used for radiation treatment planning in hospitals, said Thomas Berger, Helga and Zohar principal investigator at the German Aerospace Center.\n\nThe phantoms Helga and Zohar will experience deep space radiation inside Orion. StemRad\n\nBoth phantoms are made of materials that mimic the soft tissue, organs and bones of a woman. Their epoxy resin forms even resemble human lung and brain tissue to test how radiation passes through the human body.\n\nThe torsos have more than 5,600 sensors and 34 radiation detectors to measure how much radiation exposure occurs within different organs during the mission.\n\nThe mannequins are part of the Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment, or MARE, a collaboration between the German Aerospace Center, the Israel Space Agency, NASA and institutions across multiple countries.\n\nZohar will wear AstroRad, a radiation protection vest, to test how effective it could be if future crews encounter a solar storm, while Helga will be unprotected.\n\nThe AstroRad vest was tested on the International Space Station in January 2020. NASA\n\nSolar storms unleashed by the sun can last for days or weeks. The developers of AstroRad hope that the vest would allow future Artemis crews to continue performing daily activities despite space weather. The vest is made of thousands of shielding cores that can protect vital human organs against solar energy particles.\n\nCombating space radiation\n\nDifferent organs have different susceptibilities to space radiation, said Ramona Gaza, the MARE science team lead at Johnson Space Center.\n\nThe MARE project aims to measure the differences between how specific organs, such as the brain, respond to radiation.\n\nPreviously, different limits of radiation exposure have been set for astronauts on the space station.\n\nA June 2021 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine suggested a new standard limit for all astronauts regardless of age or gender: 600 millisieverts of radiation over the course of a career, Gaza said.\n\n“Millisieverts measure the health effect of low doses of ionizing radiation on the human body,” according to the report.\n\nResults from sensors on Artemis I, including those of a new suit, could provide data for future missions. NASA\n\nNot all scientists have accepted previous studies showing discrepancies in the different responses between men and women to radiation, Gaza said.\n\nData returned by the Artemis I mission could have an impact on the standard limit for male and female astronauts.\n\n“The United States of America is half men, half women. Well, space should be at least that,” said Reid Wiseman, chief of the Astronaut Office at Johnson Space Center. “So if we cannot make these spacecraft equitable, and we can’t fly any type of person on them, then we need to look at our systems and reevaluate.”\n\nMeanwhile, NASA’s astronauts are doing everything they can to prepare for the Artemis missions by training in virtual reality situations and in environments that simulate lunar conditions, he said.\n\nThe agency hopes to announce the Artemis II crew, slated to take astronauts on a similar journey around the moon, later this year, according to Wiseman. Artemis II is expected to launch in 2024.\n\n“To me, it’s just the most awe-inspiring moment that we’ve had here at NASA,” Wiseman said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/world/artemis-1-moon-rocket-apollo-explainer-scn/index.html", "title": "Why NASA is returning to the moon 50 years later with Artemis I", "text": "Turn to CNN for live coverage from Kennedy Space Center in Florida this week. Space correspondent Kristin Fisher will bring us moment-by-moment reporting from the launch, along with a team of experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s time to go back to the moon.\n\nAlmost 50 years after the last Apollo mission ventured to the lunar surface, NASA has established a program that promises to land humans on unexplored lunar regions and eventually the surface of Mars – and it all begins with Artemis I.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that the Artemis program is named for the twin sister of Apollo from Greek mythology. Artemis will pick up where the famed Apollo program left off in 1972 by sending crewed missions to the moon, but in a new way.\n\nGoals of the Artemis program include landing diverse crews of astronauts on the moon and exploring the shadowy lunar south pole for the first time. The ambitious effort also aims to establish a sustained presence on the moon and create reusable systems that can enable human exploration of Mars and perhaps beyond.\n\nBut none of this is possible without first taking one big leap. When Artemis I launches on November 16, the uncrewed mission will test every new component that will make future deep space exploration possible before humans make the journey in 2024 and 2025 aboard Artemis II and Artemis III, respectively.\n\nThe mission team expects liftoff of the new Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on Wednesday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nAfter launching from Earth, Artemis I will go on a 25.5-day mission. During the journey, the Orion spacecraft will travel 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) beyond the moon – 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometers) farther than the record set during Apollo 13. This path mimics the journey that the Artemis II crew will take in 2024.\n\nIt will be the farthest that any spacecraft built for humans has flown, according to NASA officials.\n\nHistoric launchpad 39B is no stranger to monster rockets, as NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pointed out at a news conference earlier in August. It was once the home of the Saturn V rocket, which carried the Apollo missions to the moon and lifted off with 7.6 million pounds of thrust. The SLS rocket will punch off the pad with 8.8 million pounds of thrust.\n\n“As we embark on the first Artemis test flight, we recall this agency’s storied past, but our eyes are focused not on the immediate future but out there,” Nelson said.\n\n“It’s a future where NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon. And on these increasingly complex missions, astronauts will live and work in deep space and we’ll develop the science and technology to send the first humans to Mars.”\n\nA new generation of exploration\n\nReturning to the moon, with an eye on an eventual trip to Mars, requires a new ride.\n\nLessons learned from the Apollo and shuttle programs informed the design of the Space Launch System rocket, the world’s most powerful rocket. The mega moon rocket will propel the spacecraft almost 1,000 times farther than the International Space Station’s location in low-Earth orbit. The SLS rocket will boost Orion to a speed of 22,600 miles per hour (36,370 kilometers per hour) to escape Earth’s gravity and reach the moon.\n\n“It’s the only rocket that’s capable of sending Orion and a crew and supplies into deep space on a single launch,” said John Honeycutt, Space Launch System program manager at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nAtop the rocket is the Orion spacecraft, designed to carry a crew through deep space and safely return the astronauts to Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft has a crew module, a service module and a launch abort system that has the capability to take the spacecraft and its crew to safety during any emergency that could occur during launch or ascent. Orion’s trajectory through space will test the craft’s ability to maintain communication with Earth beyond the moon and protect its crew from radiation.\n\nBeneath Orion is the European Service Module.\n\n“It’s the power house side of the vehicle where it’s got the primary propulsion, power and life support resources we need for Artemis I,” said Howard Hu, Orion program manager at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft has hardware and software that will allow future crews to have complete insight into what’s happening with their vehicle when they are thousands of miles from home, Hu said.\n\nOne of the biggest trials for Orion may be testing its heat shield, the largest one ever built.\n\nWhen the spacecraft returns to Earth in October, it will face temperatures half as hot as the sun’s surface and hit the top of Earth’s atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour (40,200 kilometers per hour) – that’s 32 times the speed of sound, Nelson said.\n\n“Orion will come home faster and hotter than any spacecraft has before at 32 Mach,” Nelson said. “On the space shuttle, we were at 25 Mach, which is about 17,500 miles an hour (28,160 kilometers per hour).” (Mach 1 is the speed of sound.)\n\nThe heat shield has been tested on Earth, but returning from space is the one true test that simulations can’t completely replicate.\n\n“Re-entry will be great to demonstrate our heat shield capability, making sure that the spacecraft comes home safely, and of course for future missions, protecting the crew,” Hu said.\n\nThe ultimate test\n\nAll of the objectives for the inaugural Artemis flight will demonstrate capabilities necessary for when Orion carries humans to deep space. The list includes an overall safe flight, the performance of the SLS rocket, testing the heat shield and retrieving the spacecraft once it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nOrion won’t carry a crew on this initial mission, but it will be full of data from the flight – including sensors attached to some very necessary passengers. Three mannequins will ride aboard Artemis I to simulate what humans might experience, and the data from their sensors will reveal how much vibration they experienced, as well as radiation exposure and the utility of their flight suits and radiation vests.\n\nBecause Artemis I is a test flight, the Artemis team is willing to take more risks, said Mike Sarafin, NASA’s Artemis I mission manager. Taking these risks now can eliminate issues when actual crew are aboard, he said.\n\nBut more than all of the data and science the mission team will garner is the idea of resuming human space exploration by taking a big step forward from Apollo to Artemis.\n\n“Artemis I shows that we can do big things things that unite people, things that benefit humanity – things like Apollo that inspire the world,” Nelson said. “And to all of us that gaze up at the moon, dreaming of the day humankind returns to the lunar surface: Folks, we’re here, we are going back and that journey, our journey, begins with Artemis I.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/tech/spacex-launch-crew-4-wednesday-scn/index.html", "title": "SpaceX launches another historic astronaut mission | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts — including the first Black woman to join the International Space Station crew — successfully docked with the ISS Wednesday evening, kicking off a five-month mission.\n\nNASA TV/YouTube\n\nThe astronauts had spent 16 hours orbiting aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft after a pre-sunrise launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 3:52 am ET. The capsule, which is fully autonomous, circled the Earth more than ten times, maneuvering closer to the ISS before making a gentle, precise contact with one of the space station’s docking ports at 7:37 pm ET. The spacecraft’s hatch, which provides a safe airlock between the capsule and the space station, was opened about 90 minutes later, allowing the astronauts to leave the spacecraft and enter the ISS for the first time.\n\nSpaceX Crew-4 arrives at the International Space Station on April 27 2022. NASA TV/YouTube\n\nThis mission, called Crew-4, marks a return to the crewed launches that SpaceX conducts in partnership with NASA after the company concluded the first all-private mission to the space station for wealthy paying customers on Monday.\n\nOn board are NASA astronauts Kjell Lindgren, Robert Hines, and Jessica Watkins, and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, who is flying on behalf of the European Space Agency.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Crew-4.\n\nWhat makes this flight historic?\n\nJessica Watkins is the first Black woman to join the space station crew for an extended stay.\n\nThough more than a dozen Black Americans — including four Black women — have traveled to space since Guion Bluford became the first to do so in 1983, no Black woman has had the opportunity to live and work in space for an extended period, as the ISS has enabled more than 200 astronauts to do since 2000.\n\n“This is certainly an important milestone I think both for our [space] agency and for the country,” Watkins said during a press conference last month. “I think it really is just a tribute to the legacy of the black women astronauts that have come before me as well as to the exciting future ahead.”\n\nShe has a long history with NASA, having begun her career there as an intern, and she previously held roles at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where she worked with the Curiosity Mars rover. A trained geologist, she’s studied the surface of the red planet.\n\nWatkins’ crew mates refer to her by the nickname “Watty.”\n\nWho else is on this mission?\n\nThis mission’s crew is one of the first to include just as many women as men.\n\nCristoforetti, who was on one previous mission to the ISS in 2014-2015, is the sole woman in ESA’s astronaut corps. But Cristoforetti told reporters last month that the situation was “bound to end very soon.”\n\n“We definitely expect to to have some some great female [ESA] colleagues by the end of the year,” she added.\n\nCristoforetti, a veteran of the Italian Air Force who’s earned her fighter pilot wings, joined ESA in 2009.\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Falcon 9 rocket used to launch the Crew-4 mission as seen on the launch pad Saturday, April 23 at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Joel Kowsky/NASA\n\nHines is a 22-year veteran of the US Air Force, and this marks his first time to travel to space since he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2017.\n\nLindgren, the commander for this mission, is certified in emergency medicine, and prior to being selected to take to the skies himself, he used to work as a flight surgeon on the ground at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, supporting other astronaut missions. Lindgren was born in Taiwan and spent much of his childhood in England before moving to the United States and attending the US Air Force Academy.\n\nThis group of four astronauts has spent months training together, and they even took some time to do some extracurricular bonding. Watkins noted they went on a kayaking trip in Eastern Washington “just to get to spend some time getting to know each other and understanding how we all function…and what makes each of us tick, and I think that’s going to be really crucial.”\n\n“We get along great. It is just such a joy to have these folks on this team,” Lindgren added.\n\nHow did they get to space?\n\nThe crew traveled aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which, since entering service in 2020, has now launched seven crewed missions.\n\nThough SpaceX designed the Crew Dragon to be reusable and three capsules are already in service, Crew-4 is flying aboard a brand new spacecraft, which they named “Freedom.”\n\nThe Crew Dragon was developed by SpaceX under a $2.6 billion contract with NASA as part of the “Commercial Crew Program.” The idea behind the program was to move NASA into a customer role — allowing private companies to design, build and test a new spacecraft to serve NASA astronauts while still giving the company ownership over the vehicle.\n\nSince SpaceX controls the vehicle, it has the ability to sell seats to whomever it wishes, hence the all-private mission that the company just concluded and one previous space tourism mission that took off in September last year.\n\nAt NASA, the program has been deemed a success, and the space agency is adopting the same contracting method for several vehicles involved in its efforts to explore the moon.\n\nWhat will they do in space?\n\nNow that they’ve arrived on the ISS, the crew will get caught up with the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS — including three NASA astronauts and an ESA astronaut that were part of SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission, and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThere’ll be about a five-day handover period, during which the Crew-3 astronauts will help the Crew-4 astronauts settle in, before Crew-3 returns home aboard their own SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nThen the Crew-4 astronauts will set to work on all the science experiments and space station maintenance duties they have on their to-do list.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on the aging of immune systems, organic material concrete alternatives, and cardiorespiratory effects during and after long-duration exposure to microgravity,” according to NASA. “These are just some of the more than 200 science experiments and technology demonstrations that will take place during their mission.”\n\nCrew-4 is slated to return from space in September, shortly after SpaceX launches its Crew-5 mission.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/01/tech/space-business-year-in-review-scn/index.html", "title": "2021: The year of billionaires going to space | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAmerican Airlines is placing a bet on a future in which supersonic jets might return to the skies, shuttling passengers on some routes at speeds roughly twice as fast as current commercial aircraft.\n\nJeff Bezos and Richard Branson each took supersonic joy rides to the edge of space, finally bringing their competing private-sector spacecraft into operation after around two decades of promises. Celebrities such as 90-year-old “Star Trek” actor William Shatner and “Good Morning America” co-host Michael Strahan followed soon after. Another billionaire self-funded a historic, three-day mission aboard a SpaceX orbital capsule that flew higher than any human has traveled in decades.\n\nAnd all that promises to just be the beginning.\n\nThe trio of space billionaires — Branson, Bezos and Elon Musk — have their eyes set squarely on the future. Over the past year, their visions continued to bump up against one another, stirring up plenty of controversy and one-upmanship.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the most memorable moments the commercial space industry had to offer in the last year.\n\nBranson v. Bezos\n\nBranson’s and Bezos’ space companies have for years been working to develop spacecraft capable of taking paying customers on brief, supersonic trips to the edge of space, promising to usher in an age in which booking a flight to view the Earth from space is as easy as jetting across the Atlantic. (Musk’s SpaceX, it should be noted, is not in the suborbital tourism game. Its rockets and spacecraft take much longer and more dangerous treks into Earth’s orbit.)\n\nWe’re not quite there yet. But both billionaires pledged to kick off their respective suborbital space tourism businesses by taking the rides themselves, both as a show of their confidence in their vehicles’ safety and some strategic PR.\n\nJeff Bezos spoke about his flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard into space during a press conference on July 20, 2021 in Van Horn, Texas. Bezos and the crew that flew with him were on the first human spaceflight for the company. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBezos, founder of the rocket firm Blue Origin, planned to become the first person ever to travel to space aboard a spacecraft his own company developed, setting his sights on a July 20 launch. (Blue Origin even auctioned off a ticket to ride alongside him for a whopping $28 million, though that auction winner did not ultimately fly.)\n\nThen, Branson swooped in, announcing days later that he planned to hop on the next flight of the rocket-powered space plane developed by his company, Virgin Galactic, on July 11 — nine days before Bezos’ mission.\n\nThat set off an immediate wave of speculation that — although Branson has repeatedly said in interviews he doesn’t view his competition with Bezos as a “race” — there was a bitter rivalry brewing behind the scenes.\n\nRichard Branson takes off on July 11, 2021 from a base in New Mexico aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel bound for the edge of space. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBoth billionaires’ flights ended without apparent issue, with the men emerging from their respective spacecraft outfitted in custom flight suits and beaming for the cameras.\n\nAdding to the spectacle, both flights also carried some notable crewmates for the billionaires.\n\nBezos was joined by 82-year-old Wally Funk, who famously trained for NASA’s Mercury program in 1961 but never went to space, and then-18-year-old Oliver Daemen, the son of a wealthy businessman. The pair became the oldest and youngest people, respectively, ever to travel to space. (Funk’s record was bested shortly after by the 90-year-old William Shatner.)\n\nBranson took with him Virgin Galactic executive Sirisha Bandla, who became only the second Indian-born woman to fly to space and back.\n\nShaping up suborbital space\n\nBezos’ successful July launch catapulted the company into a busy rest of the year spent flying some high-profile figures as “honorary guests” — meaning they didn’t have to pay for tickets. Shatner took his suborbital excursion in October, a feat widely celebrated by “Star Trek” fans that was followed by an Amazon video special on the flight. Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of famed astronaut Alan Shepard, flew in December.\n\nWilliam Shatner and the NS-18 crew inside the capsule, floating around. Blue Origin\n\nWhile Blue Origin was sending celebrities to space, Virgin Galactic faced significant delays. A report from the New Yorker revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson’s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear. Still, the company is delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades.\n\nBlue Origin, meanwhile, has faced its own controversies, though none that have indicated specific safety issues with its rocket or spacecraft.\n\nRather, a group of 21 current and former employees co-signed a letter alleging the company operates a toxic work environment where “professional dissent” is “actively stifled.” Blue Origin responded to the claims by saying it has “no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.”\n\nInspiration4 flies higher\n\nThough Musk does not have any apparent plans to join one of SpaceX’s missions, his company continued to prove its technology chops. It drastically expanded its space-based internet service, Starlink, growing the constellation to include roughly 2,000 satellites. Its Dragon spacecraft also launched and returned astronauts to and from the International Space Station this year, and it topped the billionaire space tourism competition with a historic space tourism mission of its own.\n\nSpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission, self-funded by billionaire payments platform CEO Jared Isaacman, sent Isaacman and three other people, none of whom were professional astronauts, on a three-day trip to orbit that traveled even higher than the International Space Station — higher than any human has traveled this century.\n\nThe passengers floated around the capsule, played songs, created works of art and kept in touch with ground control as their 13-foot-wide capsule whisked around the planet once about every 90 minutes, traveling at more than 17,500 miles per hour.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Inspiration4 crew launched from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on September 15, 2021. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe mission was intended to raise money for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a cause to which Isaacman donated $125 million and a public fundraiser fetched more than $118 million. Musk promised to donate $50 million.\n\nThe whole thing went off (almost) without a hitch.\n\nStill, all the billionaires-in-space news generated plenty of backlash, including from high-profile figures such as the United Nations secretary general and Prince William.\n\nA “disease is spreading in our world today: a malady of mistrust,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in September, adding that includes “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on earth.”\n\nBezos v. Musk\n\nPlaying out in the background of all the space tourism hype was a tense battle pitting the two wealthiest people on the planet against each other.\n\nBezos and Musk each want their own companies to be at the center of NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the moon this decade. But after initially planning to bring on more than one contractor to build the lunar lander for the job, NASA later said it only had enough money for one — and it went with Musk’s SpaceX. It awarded $2.9 billion to the company.\n\nBlue Origin fought that decision all year, saying NASA unfairly favored SpaceX. Meanwhile, the PR offensives and twitter battles began.\n\nBut a federal judge delivered a major blow to Blue Origin in November by ruling in favor of NASA and SpaceX. That put the future of the Bezos-owned company’s plans to build a lunar lander into question.\n\nThe ordeal highlighted how important government contracts are to the viability of the commercial space industry. Though these companies are private, their revenue streams still rely heavily on taxpayer money.\n\nAnd the battle over NASA’s moon lander contract queued up what are sure to be more high-profile battles and an interesting few years ahead, as NASA and its contractors map out a path back to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/01/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/tech/spacex-launch-crew-4-crew-dragon-walkup-scn/index.html", "title": "SpaceX to launch another historic astronaut mission tomorrow ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAmerican Airlines is placing a bet on a future in which supersonic jets might return to the skies, shuttling passengers on some routes at speeds roughly twice as fast as current commercial aircraft.\n\nThis mission, called Crew-4, will mark a return to the crewed launches that SpaceX conducts in partnership with NASA after the company concluded the first all-private mission to the space station for wealthy paying customers on Monday.

NASA’s human spaceflight lead, Kathy Leuders, said during a press conference Tuesday that the safety teams recognized they needed to take things “one step at a time.”\n\n“This is the time where you’ve got to rest and get ready to fly and still be watching the hardware and making sure you’re making the right decision,” Leuders said.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Crew-4.\n\nWhat makes this flight historic?\n\nWatkins will become the first Black woman to complete such a mission.\n\nThough more than a dozen Black Americans — including four Black women — have traveled to space since Guion Bluford became the first to do so in 1983, no Black woman has had the opportunity to live and work in space for an extended period, as the ISS has enabled more than 200 astronauts to do since 2000.\n\n“This is certainly an important milestone, I think, both for our [space] agency and for the country,” Watkins said during a press conference last month. “I think it really is just a tribute to the legacy of the Black women astronauts that have come before me as well as to the exciting future ahead.”\n\nShe has a long history with NASA, having begun her career there as an intern, and she previously held roles at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where she worked with the Curiosity Mars rover.

It is just such a joy to have these folks on this team,” Lindgren added.\n\nHow are they getting to space?\n\nThe crew will travel to the ISS aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which will mark the seventh crewed mission since entering service in 2020.\n\nThough SpaceX designed the Crew Dragon to be reusable and three capsules are already in service, Crew-4 will fly aboard a brand new spacecraft.\n\nThe astronauts get to select the name for their capsule, and this group chose Crew Dragon “Freedom.”\n\nThe Crew Dragon was developed by SpaceX under a $2.6 billion contract with NASA as part of the “Commercial Crew Program.” The idea behind the program was to move NASA into a customer role — allowing private companies to design, build and test a new spacecraft to serve NASA astronauts while still giving the company ownership over the vehicle.\n\nSince SpaceX controls the vehicle, it has the ability to sell seats to whomever it wishes, hence the all-private mission that the company just concluded and one previous space tourism mission last September.\n\nNASA has deemed the program a massive success, and the space agency is adopting the same contracting method for several vehicles involved in its efforts to explore the moon.\n\nWhat will they do in space?\n\nAfter arriving Wednesday evening, the crew will be greeted by the cohort of astronauts already aboard the ISS — including three NASA astronauts and an ESA astronaut who were part of SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission — and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThere’ll be a five-day handover period, during which the Crew-3 astronauts will help the Crew-4 astronauts settle in, before Crew-3 returns home aboard their own SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nThen the Crew-4 astronauts will set to work on all the science experiments and space station maintenance duties they have on their to-do list.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on the aging of immune systems, organic material concrete alternatives, and cardiorespiratory effects during and after long-duration exposure to microgravity,” according to NASA. “These are just some of the more than 200 science experiments and technology demonstrations that will take place during their mission.”\n\nA SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts — including the first Black woman to join the International Space Station crew — successfully docked with the ISS Wednesday evening, kicking off a five-month mission.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/world/ufos-nasa-team-study-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA announces team of scientists who will study mysterious 'UFO ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOfficials at NASA selected a team of 16 scientists and experts who will delve into the mysteries surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena — more popularly known as unidentified flying objects or UFOs. The independent study kicked off Monday.\n\nThe group will include experts across numerous disciplines — including astrobiology, data science, oceanography, genetics, policy and planetary science — as well as retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, a former fighter pilot and test pilot and retired US Navy captain.\n\nAn independent study on unidentifiable objects in the sky by a NASA-selected team started October 24. Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe space agency, which first announced it was forming the group in June, previously revealed that the team would be led by astrophysicist David Spergel, who is president of the Simons Foundation in New York City. ​​\n\nThe new group won’t necessarily seek to determine exactly what the UAPs, which have been seen moving through restricted military airspace over the past several decades, are. Rather, the team will look to hash out exactly how it’s best for NASA to approach further study of the phenomenon.\n\nThe space agency has already noted that the limited number of observations of UAPs has made it difficult to draw scientific conclusions about the nature of such events.\n\n“Without access to an extensive set of data, it is nearly impossible to verify or explain any observation, thus the focus of the study is to inform NASA what possible data could be collected in the future to scientifically discern the nature of UAP,” according to a NASA news release.\n\nThere have been several studies of UAPs carried out by various arms of the US government, including a Pentagon report that was declassified in June 2021, though none have given the public a clear answer about what the UAPs could be. Officials at NASA have been thinking about how to study UAPs in a formal way for a long time, but they wanted to ensure that they approached it in the right way, said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, in June.\n\nThis study, expected to last about nine months, will also be entirely unclassified and within the public domain.\n\n“Exploring the unknown in space and the atmosphere is at the heart of who we are at NASA,” Zurbuchen said in a Friday statement. “Understanding the data we have surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena is critical to helping us draw scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies. Data is the language of scientists and makes the unexplainable, explainable.”\n\nThe team will gather data on “events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena – from a scientific perspective,” the agency said.\n\nNASA said it was interested in UAPs from a security and safety perspective. There was no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin, NASA added. The study will begin this fall and is expected to take nine months.\n\nThe search for life\n\nNASA has long been tasked with finding life elsewhere, which is why astrobiology programs are part of the agency’s focus, Zurbuchen said. The Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of ancient life that may have once existed on Mars while future missions are being developed to seek signs of life on ocean worlds in our solar system. The agency seeks to explore the unknown in air and space, Zurbuchen said.\n\n“We’re looking for the question of whether certain environments are in fact part of, if you want, the ladder of life that got us to where we are,” he said during news conference Thursday.\n\nThe agency will approach the UAP study like they would any other science study – taking a field that is poor in data and making it worthy of scientific investigation and analysis.\n\n“There’s many times where something that looked almost magical turned out to be a new scientific effect,” Zurbuchen said.\n\nGiven the national security and air safety issues that have been raised with UAPs, scientists want to look at the observations and establish if these are natural or need to be explained otherwise.\n\nWhile talking about UAPs in a traditional science environment may be looked down on or regarded as something not related to science, Zurbuchen “vehemently opposes that.”\n\n“I really believe that the quality of science is not only measured by the outputs that come behind it, but also the questions we’re willing to tackle with science,” he said.\n\nThe intent of the study is to make a proposal for a research program that can be implemented once the researchers assess the data that exists and should be reviewed.\n\nThe full report will be made available to the public, and the research team will hold a public meeting to discuss the findings, said Daniel Evans, NASA Science Mission Directorate assistant deputy associate administrator for research, during the news conference. Like NASA’s other standard grant review panels, the budget estimated for this project is between a few tens of thousands of dollars and no more than $100,000, Evans said.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to anticipate what the study will reveal, Spergel said “we should be open to the idea that we’re looking at several different phenomena.”\n\n“I think we have to approach all these questions with a sense of humility,” Spergel said. “I’ve spent most of my career as a cosmologist. I can tell you, we don’t know what makes up 95% of the universe. So there are things we don’t understand. I hope this study moves us forward to understand these phenomena better. But at the end of the day, we may conclude that we still don’t understand many aspects of them and perhaps have a road map on how to make progress.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Katie Hunt", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

He was one of five Black and Hispanic teenagers wrongly convicted of assaulting and raping a white woman in New York’s Central Park.\n\nDuring that period Trump, who was a popular New York real estate mogul, bought a full-page newspaper ad demanding the state adopt the death penalty in reaction to the attack.\n\nAs president, Trump refused to apologize when the five were officially exonerated and evidence showed police illegally coerced a confession.\n\n— Phillip M.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, on the Judiciary Committee, James Comer of Kentucky on the Oversight and Accountability Committee and Bryan Steil of Wisconsin on the Administration Committee – asked Bragg to answer questions about his inquiry, which they said appeared politically motivated.\n\nBragg’s general counsel, Leslie Dubeck, rejected the request by saying the lawmakers had no legitimate basis to ask about a pending criminal matter. The chairmen wrote again saying they were justified in asking how a local prosecutor could alter a president’s policies by threatening criminal charges.\n\n“Your second letter asserts that, by failing to provide it, the District Attorney somehow failed to dispute your baseless and inflammatory allegations that our investigation is politically motivated,” Dubeck wrote. “That conclusion is misleading and meritless.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nJailed Trump exec cuts ties with lawyers:Former Trump Organization exec Allen Weisselberg cuts ties with attorneys\n\nEric and Donald Trump Jr. outraged by indictment\n\nTrump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. expressed outrage that the Manhattan District Attorney’s office has obtained a grand jury indictment against their father, calling it a witch hunt and politically motivated prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. took to the former president’s Truth Social media platform to describe the indictment as “Big news in the weaponization of our Govt against their political enemies.”\n\nEric Trump said the indictment came in response to his father’s third attempt to win the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"This is third world prosecutorial misconduct.

The difference is that as a former president, his Secret Service detail will accompany him.\n\n“There will still be a mug shot, fingerprints and lots of paperwork filled out as part of the booking process,” like other defendants, said former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nHow Trump's Republican rivals reacted:'An outrage': What Trump's potential rivals for 2024 are saying about his indictment\n\nBiden: ‘No comment’ on Trump indictment\n\nPresident Joe Biden stayed silent Friday about Trump’s indictment.\n\nReporters asked Biden about the indictment multiple times as he left the White House early Friday for a trip to Mississippi. “I have no comment on Trump,” he said.\n\nBiden has nothing publicly about Trump’s legal troubles since the former president announced two weeks ago that he expected to face criminal charges.\n\n– Michael Collins and Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden refuses to talk Trump indictment:'No. I’m not going to talk about the Trump indictment': Biden refuses to comment on hush money case\n\nTrump’s GOP rivals: Indictment an ‘outrage’ and ‘un-American’\n\nTrump’s Republican rivals and potential opponents for the 2024 presidential nomination also slammed the charges as politically motivated:\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who is weighing a bid, told CNN the unprecedented indictment was “nothing more than a political prosecution” and an “outrage.”\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley told Fox News Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was trying to take “revenge.”\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is considering a run, said the “weaponization of the legal system” is “un-American.”\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov.

He is reviewing Trump’s role in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, and the discovery of classified documents at his estate Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPotential New York charges such as falsifying business records are relatively mundane compared to allegations Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election. But Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney and now a law professor at the University of Michigan, said the evidence for falsifying business records would be fairly straightforward based on documents and is a common charge in New York.\n\n“It certainly does not raise the level of overturning an election, but this case is comparable to other cases that get filed on a regular basis in New York against defendants for falsifying business records,” McQuade told USA TODAY. “Trump should not get a pass on this case in New York just because he also faces potential charges in Georgia and in federal court.\"\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nOther countries charge their leaders:Charges against Trump would be a first in US. But other countries? They routinely charge leaders.\n\nStormy Daniels: 'No joy' from indictment, lawyer says\n\nDaniels said a few weeks ago she would “dance down the street” if Trump were indicted. But on Thursday, the woman at the center of the investigative storm feels bad that he was charged, although it means the judicial system is working, according to her lawyer.\n\n“She was surprised, honestly, even though it was mostly expected,” her lawyer, Clark Brewster told USA TODAY. “But on behalf of Stormy and honestly myself, there's no joy in seeing the man indicted.”\n\nDaniels wasn’t immediately aware of the indictment because she was out riding her horse.\n\n“The fact is that she feels bad that the guy has been charged,” Brewster said. “But on the other hand, truly, she knew what the facts were and she wants him to deal with the truth as well. So from that perspective, there's a degree of feeling like the system is working.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nHow does hush money work?:Trump indicted: How did Michael Cohen arrange hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal?\n\nGo deeper", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2023/04/04/trump-arraignment-new-york-case-embarrassing/11594882002/", "title": "Trump's entire presidency was 'unprecedented.'

Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with an alleged \"catch and kill\" scheme used to pay off people who might bring up embarrassing stories in advance of the 2016 presidential election. He’s innocent until proven guilty, same as any citizen, but still, for the country, it’s embarrassing.\n\nLike President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment by the House of Representatives.\n\nOr think former President Richard Nixon and Watergate.

They're doing that despite the fact that he has never stopped claiming the 2020 presidential election he lost was “rigged.” They started doing that before even seeing the charges he’s facing and the evidence behind those charges.

A payment of $130,000, to be exact. The allegation is that Trump had sex with her while his wife, Melania, was home with their newborn son, then he paid Daniels to keep quiet about the affair before the presidential election.\n\nCutting away the potential crimes, this is a former president mixed up with a person known for films like “The Witches of Breastwick.”\n\nIt’s embarrassing.

It is all but guaranteed not to be the last – in short order, perhaps not even the last for this president. Perhaps not even the last for him before spring turns to summer.\n\nFor all the uncertainties, a new chapter has opened in American politics and law.\n\n\"Firsts matter,\" said Lawrence Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. In this \"first,\" a former president was arrested and fingerprinted and pleaded not guilty to allegations both tawdry (paying hush money to a porn star) and profound (trying to influence an election).\n\nNow the debate begins over whether this new world and its changed assumptions will strengthen the nation's democracy or weaken it. Did Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg prove that no person is above the law? Or has he sparked a generation of other pursuits of presidents in the courts, warranted or not?\n\nHow does it play in Des Moines?\n\nSome pundits focused on more immediate concerns: What does this mean for the Iowa caucuses?\n\nReports of his pending indictment boosted Trump with Republican voters in some national polls and prompted almost all his potential rivals to unite behind him in calling his treatment an outrage, whether they wanted to or not. Trump's legal travails, not inflation or crime or President Joe Biden's record, are the issues that now dominate the GOP race.\n\nEven the calendar seems destined to entangle them. Judge Juan Merchan set the next court date for Dec. 4, weeks before the Iowa caucuses launch the Republicans' primary season.\n\nHours after his arraignment, Trump was more the defiant candidate than the chastened defendant when he addressed a friendly crowd back home in Florida at Mar-a-Lago. Despite Merchan's instructions to avoid incendiary rhetoric and attacks on the legal system, Trump denounced Bragg as a \"criminal\" and Merchan as \"a Trump-hating judge with a Trump-hating wife and family.\"\n\n\"This fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election, and it should be dropped immediately,\" he railed.\n\nRead the Trump indictment: Donald Trump charged with crimes in New York\n\nWhat are Trump's 34 charges?:He's accused of falsifying business records in hush-money payments\n\nTrump goes on offensive after arraignment:Hours after arrest, Donald Trump attacks Manhattan district attorney in Mar-a-Lago speech\n\nBut his 27-minute speech – a short one, by his standards – also underscored the reality that Bragg and Merchan and a New York jury may soon be the least of his problems. He called on Georgia officials to drop their investigation into his alleged efforts to overturn Biden's victory there in the 2020 election, and he derided the Justice Department's special counsel, Jack Smith, as a \"lunatic.\"\n\nSmith is investigating Trump's efforts to reverse his election defeat, including the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the former president's removal and retention of classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nBoth investigations seem to be nearing conclusion. In January, Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis said decisions in the Georgia case were \"imminent\" on whether to bring charges. In Washington, Smith issued subpoenas in January for Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, a move into Trump's innermost circle that typically would be done near the end of such inquiries.\n\n\"This is just the 'amuse bouche' before the real meal of the federal indictments to come,\" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. That is, the appetizer. \"Those are more important not just because they are more substantial on the face of it (insurrection vs. paying off a porn star?) but because they were crimes allegedly committed while president, not before.\"\n\nAn accumulation of indictments, if they follow, will make it harder for Trump to argue he is the victim of an overzealous prosecutor. The consequential nature of the charges will also make it harder to dismiss them as small-bore, as personal, as none of the public's business.\n\nTakeaways from Trump's arrest and speech:Takeaways: Donald Trump was arrested Tuesday.

On his final day in office, Bill Clinton reached a deal with prosecutors in the Monica Lewinsky affair, giving up his law license for five years and paying a fine.\n\nBut it had never happened before, a history that made Tuesday's indictment so breathtaking.\n\nTrump doorman story:Indictment details $30,000 payment to doorman who claimed he had info on a child\n\nTrump's legal team in New York:Who's on Donald Trump's legal team?

The outline of those payments became public only after he was elected in 2016 and more details were revealed in sworn testimony as Trump served in the White House.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s office acknowledged late Thursday that Trump’s lawyers had been notified. Trump attorney Joe Tacopina said Trump was expected in New York by Tuesday for arraignment.\n\n“This evening we contacted Mr. Trump’s attorney to coordinate his surrender… for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal,” a spokesperson for District Attorney Alvin Bragg said.\n\nWho is Michael Cohen?:Former Trump lawyer is a key witness in New York probe of ex-president\n\nAlvin Bragg v.

Trump is a victim of a corrupt and distorted version of the American justice system and history. He will be vindicated.”\n\n– David Jackson and Erin Mansfield\n\nLike other defendants, Trump will likely be fingerprinted and have his mug shot taken\n\nNo one knows how former President Donald Trump will react to the indictment, and whether he will turn himself in willingly or not. But once he is arrested and taken into custody, the former president will be read his rights, known as a Miranda warning, about how he has the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney and that what he says can be used against him in a court of law.\n\nTrump will then be processed just like any other defendant and given a booking number, former prosecutors and law enforcement officials told USA TODAY. “There will still be a mug shot, fingerprints and lots of paperwork filled out as part of the booking process,” said former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner. “We will see a mug shot, but I do not think we're going to see a perp walk.”\n\nA “perp walk” is when authorities parade a suspect before the media. In some cases, some defendants have chosen to be taken into custody that way in an effort to make a statement about their arrest and the charges against them. But one of Trump’s lawyers, Joseph Tacopina, appeared to rule that out, saying Trump would turn himself in and voluntarily self-surrender.\n\nUnderscoring the unprecedented nature of the case, Trump is expected to be accompanied to his arraignment by his Secret Service detail, as former presidents are afforded such protection for life.\n\n– Josh Meyer and Kevin Johnson\n\nTrump's statement attacks the indictment\n\nTrump put out a lengthy statement attacking what he called \"Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history.\"\n\nIn a post filled with invective, Trump also claimed that Democrats and others have been out to get him since he announced his first president run in June of 2015. He cited a litany of past investigations, including Russia election interference in 2016 and two impeachments during his presidency.\n\n\"Now they’ve done the unthinkable - indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant Election Interference,\" Trump claimed. “Never before in our Nation’s history has this been done.\"\n\nTrump also condemned Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, claiming without evidence he is doing the \"dirty work\" of President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump also said the indictment will \"backfire massively\" on Biden and the Democrats, and that he will win the presidency anyway in 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden White House won’t comment on Trump indictment\n\nThe White House has no comment on Trump’s indictment, spokesman Andrew Bates told USA TODAY.\n\nThe decision not to weigh in comes as President Joe Biden has said nothing publicly about Trump’s legal troubles since the former president announced that he expected to face criminal charges.\n\nThe White House last week condemned violent protests that Trump warned could result from an indictment and said the federal government has not tracked any specific security threats tied to an indictment.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nPhotos:Trump presidency in photos\n\nPence: Trump indictment ‘outrageous’\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said the indictment “smacks of a political prosecution.”\n\n“I think the unprecedented indictment of a former president of the United States on a campaign finance issue is an outrage,” Pence told Wolf Blitzer on CNN. “It appears to millions of Americans to be nothing more than a political prosecution.”\n\n- Bart Jansen and David Jackson\n\nWhat does Trump indictment mean?\n\nAn indictment is not the same as an arrest; it's a formal charge of a crime, while an arrest is when a person is taken into custody.\n\nGlenn Kirschner, a former prosecutor, previously told USA TODAY that authorities often negotiate the surrender of a high-profile defendant like Trump to avoid the spectacle of a “perp walk” in which the person is paraded before the media as they enter the courthouse or police station.\n\n“There will be no reason to cuff him and walk him into police headquarters to be booked,\" Kirschner said. “There will still be a mug shot, fingerprints and lots of paperwork filled out as part of the booking process. “We will see a mug shot ... but I do not think we're going to see a perp walk.”\n\n– Ella Lee, Sarah Elbeshbishi and Josh Meyer\n\nSenate Majority Leader Schumer: Let legal system determine Trump’s fate\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Thursday that there should be no political influence of interference in Trump’s indictment. He encouraged supporters and critics of the former president to let the process proceed peacefully and according to law.\n\n“Mr. Trump is subject to the same laws as every American. He will be able to avail himself of the legal system and a jury, not politics, to determine his fate according to the facts and the law,” the New York senator tweeted.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nLaw enforcement has met on security for Trump indictment\n\nLaw enforcement officials have been meeting to assess the need for additional security in preparation for the former president’s indictment.\n\nLast week, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told USA TODAY that the agency had participated in meetings with Manhattan court authorities, the New York Police Department and other officials to discuss planning for Trump’s appearance in New York to answer the charges.\n\nAt that time, Cheatle said the agency has been provided no information related to the timing of a possible decision, and that \"no extraordinary measures\" have been required in the security effort.\n\n\"The Secret Service has a long-standing relationship with a lot of our law enforcement partners, both here in the National Capital Region and in the New York area,\" Cheatle said. She said the Secret Service coordinates daily with its law enforcement partners for any contingency, \"wherever we have protectees or our investigative missions.\"\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nCities brace for possible unrest\n\nCities are preparing for public responses to Trump’s indictment. The former president had called for protests last week amid the New York grand jury’s investigation.\n\nAs news broke out of his indictment Thursday night, Republicans in Trump's home county said they stood by the former president. And while the streets of Palm Beach County have been quiet in recent weeks, a few dozen gathered near Mar-a-Lago holding signs in support and waving Trump flags.\n\nPalm Beach County Republican Party Chair Michael Barnett said he stands behind Trump, and said that he demands that Trump \"be treated fairly and in accordance with the law ... as everyone is entitled to.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, we believe that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing and will emerge stronger than before,\" said Barnett, a longtime Trump ally who was appointed to the Palm Beach County commission by Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn New York City, the New York Police Department ordered every uniformed member to show up in full uniform on Friday as a “precautionary measure.” Last week, NYPD put up steel barricades outside the Manhattan Criminal Court and the Manhattan district attorney’s offices in preparation for the potential indictment.\n\n- Stephany Matat, Palm Beach Post\n\nStormy Daniels’ lawyer: ‘No one is above the law’\n\nThe attorney representing adult film star Stormy Daniels, a central figure in the hush money inquiry, said Thursday the indictment indicated that “no one is above the law.”\n\n“The indictment of Donald Trump is no cause for joy,” attorney Clark Brewster said. “The hard work and conscientiousness of the grand jurors must be respected. Now let truth and justice prevail.”\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy: House will hold DA Bragg ‘to account’\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., tweeted Thursday that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg “irreparably damaged our country” and interfered in a presidential election.\n\n“As he routinely frees violent criminals to terrorize the public, he weaponized our sacred system of justice against President Donald Trump,” McCarthy tweeted. “The American people will not tolerate this injustice, and the House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account.”\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nFormer House Speaker Pelosi: ‘No one is above the law’\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted Thursday that the Grand Jury “acted upon the facts and the law” in Trump’s indictment.\n\n“No one is above the law, and everyone has the right to a trial to prove innocence,” she tweeted. “Hopefully, the former president will peacefully respect the system, which grants him that right.”\n\nThe former speaker clashed with Trump during his time as president and initiated two impeachment inquiries into the former president.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is a grand jury?\n\nIn the state of New York, a grand jury “decides whether or not a person should be formally charged with a crime or other offense,” according to a handbook that the state’s court system hands out to grand jurors.\n\nGrand juries work in secret and only hear evidence from prosecution. There is no judge present in the proceeding. The grand jury’s vote to formally accuse someone of a crime is called an “indictment.” A grand jury also can vote to dismiss charges or accuse the person of a lesser offense.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nReps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise on indictment: ‘Outrageous’\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted one word Thursday evening in response to the news of Trump’s indictment: “Outrageous.”\n\nJordan is one of three Republican House committee chairs who called for testimony from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The GOP chairs said they have concerns Bragg’s investigation of Trump would become “a politically motivated prosecutorial decision.”\n\nHouse Republican Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana also called the indictment “outrageous.”\n\n“The sham New York indictment of President Donald Trump is one of the clearest examples of extremist Democrats weaponizing government to attack their political opponents,” the House’s second-ranking Republican tweeted Thursday.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nRep. Adam Schiff: Trump indictment counts, is ‘sobering and unprecedented’\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, who led the first impeachment against Trump over his dealings with Ukraine, called the indictment a “sobering and unprecedented development.” He said since Cohen went to prison for the hush money payment, it was just that Trump be charged for directing the payment. Schiff said “more grievous” charges are possible from Justice Department special counsel’s investigation and a Georgia district attorney’s inquiry.\n\n“If we are to be a nation of laws, then we must apply the law equally and to everyone, regardless of their station,” Schiff said. “To do otherwise, because holding a president accountable is controversial or provocative, will not bring order, but breed disorder, and disrespect of the law.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis statement says indictment is 'un-American'\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump’s best-polling Republican opening, is backing him on the New York indictment.\n\n“The weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head,” DeSantis said in a statement. “It is un-American.”\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg “has consistently bent the law to downgrade felonies and to excuse criminal misconduct,” DeSantis said. “Yet, now he is stretching the law to target a political opponent.”\n\nDeSantis also repeated that he would not help New York with any extradition request.\n\n“Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances,” DeSantis said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPro-Trump organization head denounces indictment\n\nAllies of Trump are denouncing the indictment, saying that it’s an effort to stop the former president from being reelected.\n\nTaylor Budowich, head of a pro-Trump organization called Make America Great Again Inc., said in a statement Thursday said there “was no crime” and instead is “the indictment of a failed nation.” Budowich added that he believes the indictment will fail and Trump will be reelected.\n\n“President Trump is promising to peacefully end the war in Ukraine, dismantle the deep state, and save our country by putting America first,” Budowich said in a statement. “For that, the political elites and powerbrokers have weaponized government to try and stop him.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nMichael Cohen: 'No one is above the law' – including a former president\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's lawyer and a key witness in the grand jury investigation, says Trump's indictment is only the beginning of a new chapter in the former president's legal saga.\n\n\"Now that the charges have been filed, it is better for the case to let the indictment speak for itself,\" Cohen said in a written statement. \"The two things I wish to say at this time is that accountability matters and I stand by my testimony and the evidence I have provided.\"\n\nCohen began by noting that Trump is the first president in history to be indicted. \"I take no pride in issuing this statement,\" he said, \"and wish to also remind everyone of the presumption of innocence; as provided by the due process clause.\"\n\nCohen added that \"I do take solace in validating the adage that no one is above the law; not even a former President. Today’s indictment is not the end of this chapter; but rather, just the beginning.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nOther legal jeopardy for Trump\n\nThe New York criminal case is the first to charge him criminally, but he faces legal jeopardy in several jurisdictions.\n\nTwo of his companies, Trump Corp. and the Trump Payroll Corp., were convicted in December of criminal tax fraud. The companies were fined a combined $1.6 million.\n\nIn Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is considering a range of potential charges, including election fraud, false statements and racketeering.\n\nA federal special counsel, Jack Smith, is investigating Trump’s role in interfering with the peaceful transfer of power to President Joe Biden and the unauthorized retention of classified documents at his Florida estate.\n\nPresidential historian on the significance of Trump indictment\n\nMatt Dallek, a presidential historian, said the indictment marks an inflection point in American democracy, and will test the system of equal justice under the law as perhaps no other case in recent history.\n\n“The indictment is good news for democracy, but it also reflects the turmoil and the challenges that Trump has posed to our system of governance, so it cuts both ways,” Dallek said. “It's significant because he is the first president or former President to be indicted. But it also raises the fundamental question of can he get a fair trial? And can the trial proceed without significant outbreaks of violence? And that's going to be a test for the rule of law in America and the stability of the two-party political system.”\n\n– Josh Meyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/04/trump-indictment-arraignment-new-york-live-updates/11588238002/", "title": "Trump charged with 34 felony counts in hush-money case, lashes ...", "text": "Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts Tuesday in New York, a historic moment as the first former president ever to face criminal charges and a dramatic backdrop for the 2024 presidential race as he campaigns again for the White House.\n\nTrump surrenders: Trump surrendered at Manhattan District Attorney's Office at 1:23 p.m. EST and was placed under arrest.\n\nTrump surrendered at Manhattan District Attorney's Office at 1:23 p.m. EST and was placed under arrest.

It’s sad,” Blanche said. “We’re going to fight it and we’re going to fight it hard.”\n\nBlanche described Trump as upset the district attorney brought a case that wasn’t justified.\n\nThe lawyers said Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan admonished everyone in the case, including witnesses, to consider their public comments.\n\n“He did not admonish the president,” lawyer Joe Tacopina said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump pleads not guilty in historic first case of criminal charges against a former president, reports say\n\nDonald Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday in New York to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the unprecedented case of the first criminal charges against a former U.S. president in history.\n\nHis plea came in response to a Manhattan grand jury’s indictment of Trump on Thursday.

Yes - technically\n\nThe term \"arrest\" in cases like this is a technical one – it usually applies to people who are busted at the scene of a crime or suspects who are flight risks or have already fled from the law.\n\nBut, yes, Trump was arrested Tuesday, the first former president in history to undergo that experience.\n\nTrump, indicted for business fraud, surrendered to authorities Tuesday and that led to an \"arrest\" and a reading of the allegations against him.\n\nAnd certainly Trump himself considered himself under arrest.\n\n\"Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse,\" he said on his Truth Social account. \"Seems so SURREAL — WOW, they are going to ARREST ME. Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump tweets about 'surreal' feeling of facing imminent arrest\n\nFormer President Donald Trump issued a short message on his TruthSocial social media platform just before surrendering to authorities at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office on Tuesday, saying his imminent arrest felt “surreal.”\n\n“Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse,” Trump posted minutes before arriving at the Hogan Building at approximately 1:23 p.m. “Seems so SURREAL — WOW, they are going to ARREST ME. Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!”\n\nTrump then left his black limousine, surrounded by his Secret Service protective detail and what looked like a few lawyers and aides ,entered the building and surrendered and was placed under arrest.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nTrump gives a wave before surrender\n\nDonald Trump arrived at the Manhattan courthouse Tuesday after a brief motorcade from his Trump Tower residence.\n\nWearing a serious expression, he exited an armored vehicle, gave a wave and turned with his Secret Service detail who escorted the former president to the custody of New York authorities.\n\nIt was less than dramatic, except for the television helicopters.\n\nAs the TV cameras whirred from above, Trump simply entered the district attorney's office – the Hogan building – surrounded by Secret Serve and what looked like a few lawyers and aides.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene in NY:As Marjorie Taylor Greene leads protest against Trump indictment, NYC mayor has a message for her\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels?\n\nStormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress central to the Manhattan hush money investigation, alleged that former President Donald Trump had consensual sex with her in 2006 – months after Melanie Trump gave birth.\n\nTrump’s then-attorney and personal fixer, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the 2016 election to silence claims that she had an affair with Trump after she was willing to go public about the scandal.\n\nDaniels’ longtime lawyer Clark Brewster told USA TODAY she was surprised when she heard the news about Trump's indictment, even though a few weeks ago, she said she would “dance down the street” if Trump was indicted.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhite House draws distinction between Trump case and Jan. 6\n\nPresident Joe Biden is staying silent on former President Donald Trump’s arraignment despite having had plenty to say about the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol because the incidents are very different, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.\n\nThe insurrection at the Capitol, she said, was an attack on democracy.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is being arraigned as part of an ongoing criminal investigation, Jean-Pierre added.\n\n“And so, it was a different moment and a different time,” she said when pressed on why Biden is using the fact that Trump’s case is continuing as a reason not to comment when he talked about Jan. 6 while criminal cases were being made against accused insurrectionists.\n\n“We’re not going to politically interfere from here,” Jean-Pierre emphasized about the Manhattan District Attorney’s case against Trump.\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nWhy was Trump indicted?\n\nAfter a years-long investigation, Trump was indicted by a grand jury last Thursday in connection with hush-money payments intended to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with the former president. Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, to make the payments to silence Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in the days before the 2016 election.\n\nWhile the payments were not necessarily illegal, the charges, soon to be unveiled Tuesday, are expected to allege that Trump falsified business records related to the hush-money payments.\n\nTrump and his legal team have denied wrongdoing and plan to fight the charges.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhite House: Biden not focusing on Trump’s arrest\n\nPresident Joe Biden, like the rest of the nation, may not be able to avoid seeing footage of his predecessor being arraigned in New York Tuesday.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he's paying attention, his spokeswoman said.\n\n“Of course, this is playing out on many of the networks here on a daily basis for hours and hours. So obviously he will catch part of the news when he has a moment to catch up on the news of the day,” Jean-Pierre said at her daily briefing. “But this is not his focus for today.”\n\nShe repeated past comments that the White House will not comment “on any ongoing case.”\n\n“Our focus right now is on the American people,” she said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChuck Schumer: Trump will get fair trial; protests must be peaceful\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump would get a fair trial that follows the facts and law. But Schumer, who fled the mob that ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, also insisted any protests against the charges must remain peaceful.\n\n“There’s no place in our justice system for any outside influence or intimidation in the legal process,” Schumer said in a statement. “AS the trial proceeds, protest is an American right but all protests must be peaceful.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump, Secret Service departed Trump Tower before short drive to court\n\nDonald Trump left his namesake Manhattan residence Tuesday afternoon on his way to surrender to New York authorities as the first former president to face criminal prosecution.\n\nAccompanied by his Secret Service detail, the former president’s motorcade is expected to travel the estimated four miles to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office where he will be processed and later arraigned.\n\nTrump’s surrender has been transformed into a public spectacle, as cameras have tracked his movements since leaving his Florida estate Monday.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nTrump mug shot not expected, lawyer says\n\nDonald Trump is not expected to be subjected to a mug shot following his surrender to New York authorities, the former president's attorney Joe Tacopina said Tuesday.\n\nThe attorney did not elaborate on the reason, but a person familiar with the matter said the decision was ultimately made by the district attorney's office.\n\nBecause Trump is the first former president in history to face criminal charges, there was much anticipation that such a photograph would go viral or that Trump could use it as a fundraising tool in his bid to reclaim the White House.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nWhat will happen after Trump is arraigned?\n\nThe arraignment marks the start of criminal proceedings. Bragg announced the indictment Thursday and is expected to unveil the detailed charges Tuesday.\n\nTrump is expected to have his mug shot and fingerprints taken, have the formal charges read and then plead not guilty “loudly and proudly,” his lawyer Joe Tacopina told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. But the details haven’t been nailed down because the Secret Service will accompany Trump, Tacopina said.\n\nTrump's New York arraignment comes as he's under investigation elsewhere\n\nHowever the New York case is resolved, Trump faces other investigations in Georgia over alleged election fraud and from the Justice Department over whether he incited the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack and the discovery of hundreds of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nTrump has boasted about overcoming previous investigations including special counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and two House impeachments that resulted in Senate acquittals over his dealings with Ukraine and his role in the Capitol attack.\n\nTrump to go on legal assault, experts say:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nTrump's arraignment spectacle:Donald Trump plans to turn his arraignment into a political spectacle. Here's how.\n\nTrump allies including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene rally near courthouse\n\nCheers, boos and whistles drowned out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., as she spoke briefly outside the Manhattan Criminal Court building before Donald Trump’s arraignment on criminal charges.\n\nOne attendee, Christina Lo, 61, a Manhattan retiree who supports Trump, called his indictment political persecution by Democrats.\n\n\"They had to wait until he declared his presidential run,\" she said.\n\nDion Cini, 54, of Brooklyn, carried a large “Trump or death” flag to show his support for the former president.\n\n“It’s a tragedy what’s happening in New York City today,” Cini said, adding the case could help the candidate running for the White House in 2024. “I think Donald Trump is going to get 20 points in the polls.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas and Zach Wichter\n\nNYC mayor's message to Greene:As Marjorie Taylor Greene leads protest against Trump indictment, NYC mayor has a message for her\n\nTrump could seek delays in criminal case: legal experts\n\nAfter New York charges against him are unsealed, Donald Trump could pursue a number of legal challenges that could delay any eventual trial, according to legal experts.\n\nTrump could try to dismiss the case, change the venue where it is heard and perhaps seek to have a new judge preside. If the charges are falsifying business records as expected, Sarah Krissoff, a former federal prosecutor, said Trump lawyers could claim the alleged violations are too old or exceed the statute of limitations of two to five years.\n\nTrump has said in a social media post Thursday that Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Mercan hates him, after presiding over a criminal case against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer.\n\n\"It is an understatement to say that he (Trump) has a litigious style,\" said Joshua Ritter, a former Los Angeles County prosecutor. \"You're going to see challenges to everything, every step of the way.\"\n\n– Kevin Johnson and David Jackson\n\nTrump expected to go on legal assault:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nDonald Trump blaming George Soros while fundraising off indictment\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to seek political donations after his indictment, using anti-Semitic tropes that blame Democratic philanthropist George Soros in addition to longstanding themes he’s used like attacking investigations of him as witch hunts.\n\nSoros is a frequent target of antisemitic attacks on the far-right even in his home country of Hungary. As recently as Sunday, according to an archive at politicalemails.org, a campaign email referred to Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor whose office brought the case to the New York grand jury, as “George Soros’ hand-picked and funded Manhattan DA.”\n\nMoney raised by these emails will be split between Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and a fund called Save America that has spent millions since the 2020 election paying lawyers who have worked for Trump, including on the case that prompted the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nHouse GOP chairmen oppose gag order on Trump as ‘unconstitutional’\n\nTwo House Republican chairmen opposed an anticipated gag order on Donald Trump pending his New York trial.\n\nReps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, head of the Judiciary Committee, and James Comer, head of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, called any potential order from Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan against Trump speaking about the charges unconstitutional.\n\n“We are deeply concerned by reports the New York District Attorney may seek an unconstitutional gag order,” the chairmen said in a joint statement. “To put any restrictions on the ability of President Trump to discuss his mistreatment at the hands of this politically motivated prosecutor would only further demonstrate the weaponization of the New York justice system.”\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump protests\n\nSteel barriers lined streets near the courthouse, roads were closed, and traffic was diverted across a swath of Manhattan on Tuesday in preparation for the arraignment of Trump.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday urged potential protesters to follow police instructions and threatened anyone who becomes violent with arrest. Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said the department has been preparing for the arraignment for weeks.\n\n\"I will remind everyone that violence and destruction are not part of legitimate lawful expression,\" he said at a briefing Monday. \"It will never be tolerated in our city.\"\n\nTrump called on his supporters to take to the streets of New York City and protest his arrest.\n\n-- John Bacon and Zach Wichter\n\nWhat time is Trump's arraignment? Trump's plans from NY to Florida\n\nAs it stands now, Trump is scheduled to leave his self-named tower around 1 p.m. for the trip to the district attorney's office and courthouse that should take about a half-an-hour, according to his schedule.\n\nAfter a formal surrender and processing, Trump is scheduled for arraignment at 2:15 p.m.\n\nThe schedule anticipates a 3 p.m. departure from the courthouse to the airport for the trip to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump is scheduled to arrive back at his Palm Beach home in time for an 8:15 p.m. speech to supporters.\n\nAll of this is subject to change depending on events.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat are the charges facing Trump?\n\nWitnesses before the Manhattan grand jury have described hush-money payments Trump directed former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen to make to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\nLegal experts expect a combination of misdemeanor charges alleging falsification of business records about the payments, combined with a felony such as a campaign finance violation.\n\nBut Trump has denied wrongdoing and Tacopina said there is no documentation of false business records.\n\n“All of the Tuesday stuff is very much up in the air except that we will very loudly and proudly say not guilty,” Tacopina said. “We’re not doing anything at the arraignment because that would be showmanship and nothing more because we haven’t even seen the indictment.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Trump indicted: How did Michael Cohen arrange hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal?\n\nTrump judge expected to be same as for Trump Organization case\n\nThe New York judge tentatively assigned to preside at Donald Trump’s arraignment is familiar with players in the former president’s orbit.\n\nActing Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan oversaw the fraud trial of Trump's namesake real estate company and the related Trump Payroll Corporation, which ended in December with a conviction and $1.6 million in fines.\n\nMerchan also oversaw the sentencing of former Trump financial chief Allen Weisselberg, whose testimony in the fraud case helped secure the convictions.\n\nTrump has harshly criticized Merchan in posts on his social media company, Truth Social.\n\n\"The Judge 'assigned' to my Witch Hunt Case, a 'Case' that has NEVER BEEN CHARGED BEFORE, HATES ME,\" Trump wrote in one post.\n\n– Kevin Johnson, Josh Meyer, David Jackson\n\nWhat is an arraignment?:What the legal proceeding means ahead of Trump's appearance Tuesday.\n\nWho is judge in Trump arraignment?:Juan Merchan, judge in Trump Organization trial, expected to preside at Trump arraignment\n\nLawyers for Trump, Cohen argue against each other’s credibility\n\nTacopina and Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, foreshadowed the fight over credibility in any eventual trial.\n\nTacopina called Cohen a convicted liar who \"is constitutionally incapable of telling the same story the same way twice.\" Tacopina said there is no documentation of Trump falsifying business records.\n\n“I know there is no such evidence,” Tacopina said. “Michael Cohen is a pathological, convicted liar.”\n\nDavis said Cohen and other witnesses have provided testimony and documentation. Cohen has already been imprisoned in part because he arranged for $280,000 in hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.\n\n“Michael Cohen submitted a lot of documentation,” Davis said. “There are other documents from other people and other testimony from other people.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nNew York mayor warns Trump protesters to ‘control yourselves’\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday urged potential protesters for Donald Trump’s arraignment – he singled out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. – to be on their best behavior and threatened anyone who becomes violent with arrest.\n\n“While there may be some rabble-rousers thinking about coming to our city tomorrow, our message is clear and simple: control yourselves,” Adams said.\n\nHe said there were no specific threats. But he said people like Greene, “who is known to spread misinformation and hate speech,” are expected to visit the city. New York Young Republicans announced she would attend a 10:30 a.m. rally Tuesday at Collect Pond Park.\n\n“While you are in town, be on your best behavior,” Adams said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is a grand jury?:Here's what to know about the jury that voted to indict Trump.\n\nStormy Daniels says she's received death threats since Trump indictment\n\nStormy Daniels says she is “kind of numb” now that the hush-money investigation stemming from her alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2006 has led to his criminal indictment – and that it has prompted death threats against her.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told the Times UK that the charges by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office amount to a vindication of her efforts to hold the former president accountable. But in her first interview since Trump’s indictment last Thursday, she said the as-yet-unspecific charges have put her in more personal danger than ever before.\n\n“The first time it was like gold digger, slut, whore. You know, liar, whatever and this time it's like, ‘I'm gonna murder you,’ “ she said of the threatening messages she has been getting.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nStormy Daniels faces threats:Stormy Daniels' accusations against Trump prompt post-indictment death threats, she says", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/trump/2023/03/31/donald-trump-indictment-live-updates-nbc-reports-30-fraud-charges/70068359007/", "title": "Trump indictment Friday updates: - Former President's kids strike ...", "text": "Former President Donald Trump was indicted Thursday by a Manhattan grand jury investigating a hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe indictment is unprecedented and represents the first criminal charges against a former U.S. president.\n\nTrump is currently staying at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach.\n\nTrump attorney Joe Tacopina told NBC's \"Today\" show that Trump was expected in New York by Tuesday for arraignment. Trump will surrender to New York authorities but won't consider a plea deal, his lawyer said. A hearing is scheduled for 2:15 p.m.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Trump and his aides were surprised the indictment came so quickly. Times reporter Maggie Haberman reported that Trump was angry but seemed more worried about the indictment's political consequences. On Thursday night, Trump was seen having dinner with his wife, Melania, and her parents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nWhat are Trump's children saying about the indictment?\n\nFormer President Trump's children struck markedly different postures on his indictment in social media postings Thursday and Friday.\n\nHis eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took his father's side and even used rhetoric in the spirit of the nation's 45th president. On his online show \"Triggered,\" he likened the decision to indict as “stuff that would make Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot, it would make them blush,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nAnother son, Eric, followed suit, using Twitter to call the indictment “third world prosecutorial misconduct” and “the opportunistic targeting of a political opponent in a campaign year.”\n\nTrump's daughter, Ivanka, one of his closest advisers during his early years in the White House, was far more guarded in a post on Instagram.\n\n“I love my father, and I love my country. Today, I am pained for both,\" she wrote. \"I appreciate the voices across the political spectrum expressing support and concern.”\n\nNBC News: Trump may be facing 30 counts of document-related charges\n\nCiting two sources familiar with the grand jury proceedings, NBC News New York is reporting that former President Donald Trump could be facing about 30 charges of document-related fraud.\n\nThe news station also is saying that prosecutors are unlikely to ask for the indictment to be unsealed before Tuesday, so we may not know what the specific charges are until then.\n\nWhy was Donald Trump indicted? More on Stormy Daniels\n\nMany speculate the charges are about the Stormy Daniels hush-money case, in which Trump purportedly paid campaign money to an adult-film star so she wouldn’t disclose their affair while he campaigned for president in 2016.\n\nThe indictment usually remains unsealed until the defendant is arrested, which for Trump is scheduled to happen Tuesday. He’s expected to surrender in Manhattan Criminal Court and make his first appearance before a judge.\n\nIt is also unclear when Trump will leave Mar-a-Lago to surrender in New York.\n\nDonald Trump joined by his wife, Melania, for dinner after hearing the news\n\nDr. Gina Louden, co-chair of Women for Trump, was at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night and said the former president and his wife, Melania, were having a dinner at the club after the announcement of the indictment.\n\nShe posted photos on both Instagram and Twitter.\n\nWhat is an indictment? And why did the DA want one to charge Trump?\n\nAn indictment is a formal, written accusation of a crime, made by a grand jury, according to Black’s Law Dictionary.\n\nA grand jury decides only whether there is enough probable cause to charge someone. It does not infer guilt, said Michael Salnick, a Palm Beach County defense attorney. A jury, chosen during a trial, decides whether that person is guilty or not.\n\nA grand jury is a group of regular people that hears evidence and witnesses presented by a prosecutor in felony cases. While the target of an investigation may testify, they do not present a defense during those proceedings.\n\nGrand juries in New York have between 16 and 23 people. Their service can vary from two weeks to a month. They’re chosen from the same group of people who are called for jury service.\n\nThe grand jury meets and takes a vote on the evidence in secret.\n\nWhen the proceedings are over, the grand jury either indicts the defendant, lodging criminal charges, or issues “no true bill,” meaning they did not find probable cause to charge the person.\n\nState and U.S. attorneys can choose to charge a defendant with a crime without asking a grand jury to consider the case. It’s their choice. Joe Abruzzo, the Palm Beach County clerk of court, said putting charges in front of a grand jury provides an \"extra layer of protection for the district attorney.\"\n\nIn Palm Beach County, state attorneys have used grand juries in death-penalty cases. One notable exception was Jeffrey Epstein, who was indicted in 2006 for soliciting a prostitute.\n\nFederal prosecutors have a wider range of crimes they send to grand juries. For example, federal prosecutors in Palm Beach County sent their cases in the 2000s for a grand jury to decide whether certain county commissioners were corrupt.\n\nAlvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, is a state-level prosecutor like Aronberg. This case is not federal, like the one in which Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen was convicted.\n\nWhat's likely next for Trump?\n\nTrump can voluntarily turn himself in, which his lawyers said he will do.\n\nIf Trump were to change his mind and refuse a voluntary appearance, then Florida officials would get involved. As a Palm Beach County resident, New York would seek a court order to force Trump's extradition, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said.\n\nNormally, such a motion would go to Florida's governor, an interesting twist given Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely believed to be readying his own 2024 Republican presidential primary challenge to Trump.\n\nBut DeSantis said Thursday he won't help extradite Trump to New York if Trump refuses to go willingly. It was a reversal from what the governor said last week about the impending indictment, a statement that drew criticism from the former president.\n\n\"Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda,\" DeSantis said, referring to liberal political activist George Soros.\n\nAsked last week about helping Trump fight extradition, DeSantis said: “We are not involved in this, won’t be involved in this.\"\n\nThere's a third scenario: If DeSantis refused to be involved, a federal judge would have to sign the extradition order. Likely, this federal judge would be in Palm Beach County, Aronberg said\n\nWhere is Donald Trump on Friday?\n\nApparently, the former president stayed put at Mar-a-Lago. He hasn't been seen publicly.\n\nHis private airplane remains parked at Palm Beach International Airport.\n\nSeveral cars were parked along the side of the road leading to Mar-a-Lago on Friday afternoon. A group of about a half-dozen people lined the side of the road, some waving signs that read \"Trump 2024.\" A PBSO security tower was stationed nearby and Palm Beach Police vehicles were seen sporadically patrolling the route.\n\nThere was more activity near Mar-a-Lago late Thursday and early Friday. Palm Beach police spokesman Capt. Will Rothrock said about two dozen demonstrators showed up by the time Thursday night was over. A crowd of about the same size was present Friday between Trump supporters and national media, police said.\n\nTrump indictment: One of these 3 things likely will happen next\n\nTrump has been indicted. Have other former U.S. presidents been indicted? No, but these came close.\n\nCan he? Now that Donald Trump is indicted, can he still run for president in 2024?\n\nVideo: Trump plane at Palm Beach International Airport day after indictment\n\nA livestream, courtesy of TV station ABC 7 in Chicago, shows real-time footage of Trump's aircraft at PBIA.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, it wasn't going anywhere, and hadn't for the past several days. He could leave for New York as late as Tuesday morning and be on time for a 2:15 p.m. hearing.\n\nWill Trump get a mug shot?\n\nThat is likely. Trump is expected to be treated like every other person facing criminal allegations and be required to follow the same procedures: fingerprints and a mug shot, Salnick said.\n\nOne thing to note: It may not be available to the public if there are any security concerns.\n\n\"Since this is such an unprecedented thing, one doesn't know if it will be done differently,\" Salnick said.\n\nTrump will have Secret Service protection throughout the entire process, Abruzzo said, as would every othe rformer president. New York officials will decide whether to handcuff him.\n\nWill Trump go to jail?\n\nIt's impossible to say today, but it's unlikely, according to Aronberg and Abruzzo.\n\nAuthorities tend to negotiate surrendering a high-profile defendant like the former president. Aronberg said the former president most likely won't spend time in jail and will allowed to return home.\n\n\"This seems to be a potentially low-level crime, where I personally would be surprised if he spent any time incarcerated,\" Abruzzo said.\n\nWho is Joe Tacopina? And why does his name sound familiar?\n\nJoe Tacopina is Donald Trump’s personal attorney representing him in the Stormy Daniels case.\n\nTacopina, 56, is a self-described zealous bulldog defense attorney who has represented celebrities, athletes and other well-known people.\n\nThey include Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder, Michael Jackson, Alex Rodriguez, Meek Mill, YG, Sean Hannity, Don Imus, Swiss Beatz, American Singer Ne-Yo, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Sarah Wallace, Kimberly Guilfoyle, NFL Players Association director DeMaurice Smith and Rapper A$AP Rocky.\n\nWho is likely going to be the judge?\n\nIt’s expected to be Juan Merchan, who has been an acting justice with the State Supreme Court since 2009.\n\nMerchan was born in Colombia and came to the United States when he was 6. He grew up in Queens, like Trump.\n\nHe also presided over the case in which the Trump Organization's former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, as well as the tax fraud trial in which the family's company was found guilty on 17 counts including charges of conspiracy and falsifying business records. Trump lashed out at the judge on social media Friday.\n\nStaff writers Holly Baltz, Stephany Matat, Carol Rose and Julius Whigham II contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/30/what-happens-after-trump-indictment/11573340002/", "title": "A Donald Trump mugshot?

He will enter a not guilty plea, according to his lawyer, Joe Tacopina.\n\nIn one departure from the usual process, Trump is not expected to be subjected to a mug shot, Tacopina told USA TODAY on Tuesday. The Trump attorney did not elaborate on why that is the case, but a person familiar with the matter said the decision was ultimately made by the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nBecause Trump is the first former president in history to face criminal charges, there was much anticipation that such a photograph would go viral or that Trump could use it as a fundraising tool in his bid to reclaim the White House.\n\nTrump indictment:Former president will surrender, won't consider plea deal: live updates\n\nTrump will be taken into custody and, for the most part, processed just like any other defendant, including a booking number, former prosecutors and law enforcement officials told USA TODAY. “There will still be ... fingerprints and lots of paperwork filled out as part of the booking process,” as with other defendants, said former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner.\n\nUnderscoring the unprecedented nature of the case, it is expected that Trump will be accompanied through the process by his Secret Service detail. Former presidents are afforded such protection for life.\n\nMore:'An outrage': What Trump's potential rivals for 2024 are saying about his indictment\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s office acknowledged late last Thursday that Trump’s lawyers had been notified of the indictment, but the details have not been made public. “This evening we contacted Mr. Trump’s attorney to coordinate his surrender … for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal,” a spokesperson for District Attorney Alvin Bragg said.\n\nAnd while some accommodations are being made during the booking process, getting Trump to the courthouse could be another matter entirely.\n\nGiven his special stature, Trump's first appearance could be a relatively calm event, with special efforts made by prosecutors and police to shield him from the kind of \"perp walk\" that authorities sometimes force other defendants to endure. That means a march – often in handcuffs – past the throngs of New York media. In some cases, some defendants have chosen to be taken into custody that way in an effort to make a statement about their arrest and the charges against them.\n\nWhat we know about Trump indictment:Donald Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges. What we know\n\n\"It's safe to say it will be a complete circus, and that’s an understatement,\" said Matt Dallek, a presidential historian.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the New York Times reported that Trump likely will not have his mug shot taken due to his public stature, the determination he is not a flight risk and the security complications posed by having his photo taken.\n\nCiting \"several people with knowledge of the matter,\" the Times said law enforcement officials have discretion over whether they need to take a mug shot.\n\nBesides the fact that everyone knows who Trump is and what he looks like, the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building \"does not have the equipment necessary to take Mr. Trump’s mug shot,\" the Times said. \"That means doing so would require that he be taken to either the Police Department’s Central Booking facility or to the Manhattan Detention Complex, which would entail more movements for the former president.\"\n\nJosh Meyer is domestic security correspondent for USA TODAY.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, said it will hold a hearing April 17 in New York City, titled “Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan,” focusing on crime in the city and accusing Bragg of fostering “a dangerous community for New York City residents.”\n\nThe hearing “will examine how Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s pro-crime, anti-victim policies have led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents,” the committee said in a statement.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s office hit back and called the hearing “a political stunt.”\n\n“Don’t be fooled, the House GOP is coming to the safest big city in America for a political stunt. This hearing won’t engage in actual efforts to increase public safety, such as supporting national gun legislation and shutting down the iron pipeline,” a spokesperson said in a statement on Twitter Monday.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nHouse Judiciary hearing to focus on violent crime in Manhattan\n\nHouse Republicans have ramped up their criticisms of Bragg by focusing on crime in New York, arguing violence runs rampant in the city while the Manhattan district attorney focuses on prosecuting former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump surrendered to law enforcement in Manhattan last Tuesday as the first former president to be criminally charged. Trump pled not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a series of hush-money payments to women who claimed to have had sex with him.\n\nThe House Judiciary hearing Monday will include witness testimony from victims of crime in the city, though the committee has not announced the witnesses.\n\nRelated:Photos capture unprecedented indictment and arraignment of former President Donald Trump\n\n“We’ll be hearing from victims who are suffering under DA Bragg’s pro-crime policies,” Arizona Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, member of the committee, said Monday on Twitter. “If Bragg can spend resources indicting President Trump, he should be able to address the soaring crime in NYC.”\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s office refuted the claim that crime was rising in New York City, citing New York Police Department Data that showed violent crimes were decreasing. The office also took aim at Jordan, chair of the Judiciary Committee, pointing out that the murder rate in New York City is lower than the murder rate in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n“If Chairman Jordan truly cared about public safety, he could take a short drive to Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Akron, or Toledo in his home state, instead of using taxpayer dollars to travel hundreds of miles out of his way,” the spokesperson saidin the statement on Twitter.\n\nTrump indictment:Amid seedy but simple allegations, critics decry case as politically motivated\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman, whose district represents a large portion of the city and where the hearing will take place, said Jordan “is not welcome in my district” and echoed the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office sentiments on crime.\n\n“If Jordan truly cared about public safety, he’d be having a field hearing in Nashville, Tennessee or Louisville, Kentucky, where the most recent of the daily mass shootings have killed more innocent Americans,” Goldman told The Hill in a statement. “Chairman Jordan is not welcome in my district for this political stunt that is simply a further waste of taxpayer money to support Donald Trump’s legal defense.”\n\nHouse GOP target Bragg after Trump indictment and arrest\n\nLeading up to Trump’s historic indictment by a Manhattan grand jury, House Republicans launched an investigation into the Manhattan District Attorney’s office as its own investigation into Trump drew to a close.\n\nEarlier in March, Jordan and two other House Republican chairs, James Comer of Kentucky, head of the Oversight Committee and Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, head of the Administration Committee, sent a letter to Bragg asking him to testify before Congress about “what plainly appears to a politically motivated prosecutorial decision.”\n\nBragg’s office rejected the request, defending its investigation and telling the GOP chairs they had no authority to step in on what was a state investigation.\n\nOpinion:How strong is the case against Donald Trump? Why Alvin Bragg better get it right.\n\nThe two continued in a back and forth leading up to Trump’s arrest, with the feud escalating last Thursday after Jordan issued a subpoena to Mark Pomerantz, an attorney who helped lead the Trump investigation before resigning last year.\n\nBragg decried the subpoena and said it was an “attempt to undermine” Trump’s ongoing criminal case.\n\n“The House GOP continues to attempt to undermine an active investigation and ongoing New York criminal case with an unprecedented campaign of harassment and intimidation.” Bragg said in a statement posted on Twitter last Thursday. “Repeated efforts to weaken state and local law enforcement actions are an abuse of power and will not deter us from our duty to uphold the law.”\n\nBragg sues Jordan\n\nBragg on Tuesday sued Jordan, seeking to block the subpoena, saying the inquiry interfered with Trump's criminal case and Congress has no basis to involve itself in the case.\n\n\"Chairman Jordan’s subpoena is an unconstitutional attempt to undermine an ongoing New York felony criminal prosecution and investigation,” Bragg said in a statement. “As our complaint details, this is an unprecedented, illegitimate interference by Congress that lacks any legal merit and defies basic principles of federalism.\"\n\nMore:Manhattan DA Bragg sues House Rep.

The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nHear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/doj-investigation-trump-documents-timeline/index.html", "title": "Timeline: The Justice Department criminal inquiry into Trump taking ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe federal criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents ramped up this week in significant and unprecedented fashion, with the FBI executing a search warrant at Trump’s home at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nThe Justice Department inquiry is about documents that Trump removed from the White House as his term was ending in January 2021. Earlier this year, officials from the National Archives and Records Administration, known as NARA, recovered 15 boxes of presidential documents from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump’s lawyers previously worked with NARA to voluntarily turn over some documents, but the Mar-a-Lago search clearly indicates a new phase of the probe. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and claims the investigation is a politically motivated sham, intended to derail his potential bid to return to the White House.\n\nHere’s a timeline of the key moments from the blockbuster investigation.\n\nMay 2021\n\nAn official from NARA contacts Trump’s team after realizing that several important documents weren’t handed over before Trump left the White House. In hopes of locating the missing items, NARA lawyer Gary Stern reaches out to someone who served in the White House counsel’s office under Trump, who was the point of contact for recordkeeping matters. The missing documents include some of Trump’s correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as the map of Hurricane Dorian that Trump infamously altered with a sharpie pen.\n\nFall 2021\n\nNARA grows frustrated with the slow pace of document turnover after several months of conversations with the Trump team. Stern reaches out to another Trump attorney to intervene. The archivist asks about several boxes of records that were apparently taken to Mar-a-Lago during Trump’s relocation to Florida. NARA still doesn’t receive the White House documents they are searching for.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nAfter months of discussions with Trump’s team, NARA retrieves 15 boxes of Trump White House records from Mar-a-Lago. The boxes contained some materials that were part of “special access programs,” known as SAP, which is a classification that includes protocols to significantly limit who would have access to the information. NARA says in a statement that some of the records it received at the end of Trump’s administration were “torn up by former President Trump,” and that White House officials had to tape them back together. Not all the torn-up documents were reconstructed, NARA says.\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nNews outlets, including CNN, report that NARA asked the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s handling of White House records and whether he violated the Presidential Records Act and other laws related to classified information. The Presidential Records Act requires all records created by a sitting president to be turned over to the National Archives at the end of their administration.\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nNARA informs the Justice Department that some of the documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago included classified material. NARA also tells the department that, despite being warned it was illegal, Trump tore up documents while he was president, and that senior officials in the Trump administration did not properly preserve their social media messages, draft tweets and deleted tweets.\n\nApril and May 2022\n\nOn April 7, NARA publicly acknowledges for the first time that the Justice Department is involved, and news outlets report that prosecutors have launched a criminal probe into Trump’s mishandling of classified documents. Around this time, FBI agents quietly interview Trump aides at Mar-a-Lago about the handling of presidential records as part of their widening investigation.\n\nApril 11, 2022\n\nThe FBI asks NARA for access to the 15 boxes it retrieved from Mar-a-Lago in January. The request was formally transmitted to NARA by President Joe Biden’s White House Counsel’s office, because the incumbent president controls presidential documents in NARA custody.\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department sends a letter to Trump’s lawyers as part of its effort to access the 15 boxes, notifying them that more than 100 classified documents, totaling more than 700 pages, were found in the boxes. The letter says the FBI and US intelligence agencies need “immediate access” to these materials because of “important national security interests.” Also on this day, Trump lawyers ask NARA to delay its plans to give the FBI access to these materials. Trump’s lawyers say they want time to examine the materials to see if anything is privileged, and that they are making a “protective assertion of executive privilege” over all the documents.\n\nMay 1, 2022\n\nTrump’s lawyers write again to NARA, and ask again that NARA postpone its plans to give the FBI access to the materials retrieved from Mar-a-Lago in January.\n\nMay 10, 2022\n\nDebra Steidel Wall, the acting Archivist of the United States, who runs NARA, informs Trump’s lawyers that she is rejecting their claims of “protective” executive privilege over all the materials taken from Mar-a-Lago, and will therefore turn over the materials to the FBI and US intelligence agencies. In a four-page letter, Wall says she reached this decision after consulting with top lawyers from the Justice Department and the White House Counsel’s office.\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department subpoenas Trump, seeking documents with classification markings that are still at Mar-a-Lago. Trump directs his staff to search for any remaining classified material, to comply with the subpoena, according to a lawsuit he later filed.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nNews outlets report that investigators subpoenaed NARA for access to the classified documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. The subpoena, which is part of the process to allow investigators to take possession of the documents from the NARA, is the first public indication of the Justice Department using a grand jury in its investigation.\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nAccording to a lawsuit the former President later filed, Trump invites FBI officials to come to Mar-a-Lago to retrieve the subpoenaed materials.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nFour investigators, including a top Justice Department counterintelligence official, visit Mar-a-Lago seeking more information about classified material that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators meet with Trump’s attorneys and look around the basement room where the documents are being stored. Trump briefly stops by the meeting to say hello to the officials, but he does not answer any questions. During the meeting, the federal officials deal with the grand jury subpoena for some of the sensitive national security documents on the premises, and they take away the subpoenaed documents. At some point later in June, a Trump lawyer sends a letter to the Justice Department inaccurately asserting that there aren’t any more classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJune 8, 2022\n\nTrump’s attorneys receive a letter from federal investigators, asking them to further secure the room where documents are being stored. In response, Trump aides add a padlock to the room in the basement of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nFederal investigators serve a subpoena to the Trump Organization, demanding surveillance video from Mar-a-Lago. Trump’s company complies with the subpoena and turns over the footage. CNN has reported that this was part of an effort to gather information about who had access to areas at the club where government documents were stored.\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\nThe FBI executes a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago – a major escalation of the classified documents investigation. The search focused on the area of the club where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are located. Federal agents remove boxes of material from the property. The search was the first time in American history that a former president’s home was searched as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nTrump sends a message through one his lawyers to Attorney General Merrick Garland, saying he has “been hearing from people all over the country about the raid” who are “angry,” and that “whatever I can do to take the heat down, to bring the pressure down, just let us know,” according to a lawsuit he later filed. Hours later, after three days of silence, Garland makes a brief public statement about the investigation. He reveals that he personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant, and that the Justice Department will continue to apply the law “without fear or favor.” Garland also pushes back against what he called “unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department.” Garland also announces that the Justice Department will ask a judge to unseal some of the search warrant documents, for the sake of transparency.\n\nAugust 12, 2022\n\nFederal Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart approves the unsealing of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant and its property receipt, at the Justice Department’s request and after Trump’s lawyers agree to the release. The warrant reveals the Justice Department is looking into possible violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records, as part of its investigation.\n\nAugust 22, 2022\n\nTrump files a federal lawsuit seeking the appointment of a third-party attorney known as a “special master” to independently review the materials that the FBI seized from Mar-a-Lago. In the lawsuit, Trump’s lawyers argue that the Justice Department can’t be trusted to do its own review for potentially privileged materials that should be siloed off from the criminal probe.\n\nAugust 27, 2022\n\nFederal District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who is presiding over Trump’s civil lawsuit, announces her “preliminary intent” to appoint a special master to examine the seized Mar-a-Lago materials.\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\nFederal prosecutors clash with Trump’s lawyers at a high-stakes court hearing in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of Trump’s lawsuit seeking the special master appointment.\n\nSeptember 5, 2022\n\nIn a major ruling, Cannon grants Trump’s request for a special master to review the seized materials from Mar-a-Lago. She says the special master will have the power to look for documents covered under attorney-client privilege and executive privilege. The outcome is a major victory for Trump.\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department appeals Cannon’s decision in the special master case. Prosecutors also ask Cannon to temporarily block two key parts of her ruling while their appeal plays out: First, the part where she blocked the Justice Department from using any of the seized materials in their criminal probe while the materials were being reviewed by the special master, and second, the part of her ruling that required the Justice Department to hand over classified documents to the special master.\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nCannon appoints senior Judge Raymond Dearie to serve as the special master and sets a November 30 deadline for the Brooklyn-based federal judge to finish his review of the seized materials. Cannon also rejects the Justice Department’s request to temporarily pause two key portions of her earlier ruling, which prosecutors claimed were hampering their ongoing criminal probe.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen Hannah Rabinowitz", "Marshall Cohen", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}]}

She and President Joe Biden are longtime women’s basketball fans, and the president attended several NCAA tournament games when Elena Delle Donne played for Delaware.\n\nThe Bidens also went to the men’s Final Four in 2016 when he was vice president.\n\nThe First Lady was spotted in a box opposite the team benches, sitting with tennis legend Billie Jean King and her wife, Ilana Kloss.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nWhat time does women's national championship game start?\n\nThe women's NCAA Tournament final is slated to begin at 3:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on ABC. Streaming is available via WatchESPN and ESPN+.\n\nLSU coach Kim Mulkey chooses tiger print for title game attire\n\nDALLAS – There was no denying that Kim Mulkey was going to pull out all the stops when it came to what she was going to wear for the national championship game.\n\nLSU women's basketball coach did not let down all those chomping at the bit to see what she would wear next.\n\nFor the Tigers' matchup with Iowa for the national title, Mulkey is wearing a full tiger-striped pant suit made entirely reversible, two-tone sequins.\n\nAfter many fans were disappointed with the lack of gaudy in her Elite Eight outfit she wore in the win over Miami in Greenville, South Carolina last weekend – an ensemble that featured a subdued yet bedazzled jacket with white pants – Mulkey stepped back into the flashy with her Final Four fit that was hot pink jacket with large pink flowers on the sleeves from shoulder to wrist.\n\n— Cory Diaz, Lafayette Daily Advertiser\n\nBetting guide: Iowa Hawkeyes favored in women's final\n\nOne of the craziest tournaments will conclude with the between No. 2 Iowa (31-6) and No. 3 LSU (33-2) on Sunday. Here's a quick look at some of the odds for Sunday's national championship game. All odds are according to Tipico.\n\nWho's favored?\n\nIowa is a minus-170 favorite against LSU, which is a plus-145 underdog.\n\nWhat's the spread?\n\nIowa is favored by 3 1/2 points over LSU.\n\nWhat's the over/under?\n\nThe over/under for the Iowa-LSU game is listed at 157 1/2 points.\n\nIowa star Caitlin Clark, like Steph Curry, has redefined what a good shot is in basketball\n\nDALLAS — There are times, occasionally during games and often during practice, when Iowa coach Lisa Bluder’s jaw drops.\n\nDid Caitlin Clark really just hit that shot, thread that pass or finish that layup in transition?\n\nYes, she did and she does — regularly. And it’s just as spectacular as you can imagine. Maybe more so.\n\nClark, the 2023 consensus national player of the year, has become one of the sport's biggest stars and walking highlight reel because of her how-did-she-see-that?! passes and unlimited shooting range. But for as talented and awe-inspiring as Clark herself is, Bluder deserves some credit too. Because she lets Clark be exactly who she is.\n\nBut as Bluder herself admits, it took time to cede control.\n\n— Lindsay Schnell\n\nLSU's Alexis Morris calls out Caitlin Clark's 'disrespectful' defense ahead of title game\n\nPretty much the entire basketball world was amazed by the stunning play and swagger of Caitlin Clark as Iowa knocked off previously undefeated South Carolina in the women's Final Four.\n\nOne that wasn't impressed, however, plays for Iowa's next opponent, LSU. The Tigers stand in the way of the Hawkeyes and one of the more incredible title runs the sport has ever seen.\n\nMore specifically, Tigers guard Alexis Morris doesn't think Clark can dare LSU to shoot from behind the arc the way she did against the Gamecocks.\n\n\"I don't think they can guard us that way,\" Morris said, according to Sports Illustrated. \"I don't think you can just leave me open on the perimeter or leave us open on the perimeter. Me personally, I find it very disrespectful, so I'm going to take that personally going into that game. You're going to have to guard us. That's just the competitor in me, and the will to win.\"\n\n— Blake Schuster, For The Win\n\nOPINION: Caitlin Clark, Iowa need to finish the job\n\nDALLAS — Friday night's win put Caitlin Clark in position to bring home Iowa’s first national championship. The Hawkeyes meet LSU Sunday afternoon in one of the most highly-anticipated — and unlikely — title games in the history of women’s basketball.\n\nWant evidence of just how in-demand this game, and this player, are? In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, tickets to Sunday’s national championship are more expensive than tickets to Sunday’s sold-out Taylor Swift show.\n\nAnother difference besides ticket prices: Swift will play the same show in dozens of stadiums around the world. But for for Clark & Co., this is likely a once-in-a-lifetime experience. That means they have to capitalize on the moment.\n\nIt’s noteworthy, to say the least, this year Iowa beat heavily favored, undefeated and overall No. 1 seed South Carolina. The Hawkeyes slayed the giant — but now they've got to take the castle, and the championship trophy.\n\n— Lindsay Schnell\n\nMorris reunion with Mulkey has NCAA title game finale at LSU\n\nAlexis Morris will finish her college career playing in a national championship game for Kim Mulkey, the coach who five years ago kicked the standout guard off another team.\n\nFor Morris, it has been quite a journey of growth and maturation from her freshman season at Baylor and through two other programs before a reunion with Mulkey at LSU that will end on the biggest stage.\n\n\"Every player just has that coach that’s for them. Coach Mulkey, she’s my coach,\" Morris said Saturday. \"I asked God, if you ever gave the opportunity (to play for her again), I will never waste that. I will literally maximize it, maximize the opportunity, and that’s what you’re witnessing.\"\n\nMulkey has known Morris since she was a seventh-grader at a private school in Beaumont, Texas. It was a difficult decision to dismiss her from Baylor's team in September 2018 after what was called an unspecified violation of team rules. The school didn't offer any details then and they haven never been detailed publicly by Mulkey or Morris, though the player does accept responsibility for what she called a “youthful mistake.”\n\n— Associated Press\n\nIowa's Caitlin Clark steals show with performance for the ages\n\nDALLAS – No way the Aliyah Boston and Caitlin Clark Showdown could live up to the hype. Not after two years of anticipation and sky-high expectations.\n\nTurns out, it was even better.\n\nClark met the moment and then some with a performance for the ages Friday night. Instead of shrinking under the pressure, she shined, draining 3-pointers, breaking ankles and firing pinpoint passes South Carolina could only watch whiz by. She finished with 41 points and eight assists in Iowa's 77-73 victory that snapped the defending champion's 42-game winning streak and sent the Hawkeyes to their first national title game.\n\n\"I think she’s the most phenomenal basketball player in America. I just don’t think there’s anyone like her,\" Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. \"She had the ball in her hands almost all the time tonight against some pretty good defensive players.\"\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nWomen's Final Four does big ratings for ESPN\n\nWith South Carolina's Aliyah Boston and Iowa's Caitlin Clark facing off in the women's Final Four on Friday night, ratings were expected to be high.\n\nThey were record-setting for ESPN, the network announced Saturday.\n\nESPN, which broadcast both NCAA Tournament semifinal games, said the LSU-Virginia Tech early game averaged 3.4 million viewers with a peak of 5 million across network platforms. That was up 57% from last year's early game.\n\nIowa-South Carolina averaged 5.5 million with a peak of 6.6 million, up 72% from last year's late game.\n\nBoth games drew record audiences for a college basketball game – men's or women's – on ESPN+, the network said.\n\n— Mike Brehm\n\nSouth Carolina star Aliyah Boston declares for WNBA Draft\n\nSouth Carolina star Aliyah Boston is declaring for the WNBA draft. She is projected to be the No. 1 overall pick.\n\n\"In this moment, I am truly breathless as I make the next best decision of my life,\" Boston said in a statement. \"I have decided to further pursue my dream by declaring for the 2023 WNBA Draft.\"\n\n— Jaylon Thompson\n\nDawn Staley calls out national media, Iowa coach's 'bar fight' comments\n\nDALLAS – Dawn Staley has heard enough.\n\nThe South Carolina women's basketball coach was asked about the way her team is labeled publicly for their physical style of play after being upset in the Final Four by Iowa. Staley set the record straight about her team, which she said \"exemplifies how you need to approach basketball on the court and off the court.\"\n\n\"We're not bar fighters. We're not thugs. We're not monkeys. We're not street fighters,\" Staley said. \"I do think that that's sometimes brought into the game, and it hurts.\"\n\n— Cora Hall, Knoxville News Sentinel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/indiana/2023/03/18/ncaa-tournament-indiana-womens-basketball-tennessee-tech-live-updates/70010161007/", "title": "NCAA Tournament: IU women's basketball vs. Tennessee Tech ...", "text": "The Indiana women's basketball team begins its quest for an NCAA Tournament title today.\n\nNo. 1 IU (27-3) hosts No. 16 Tennessee Tech (23-9) in the first round after the Golden Eagles' win over Monmouth in a play-in game on Thursday.

But she made 7 of 8 shots from the field and 5 of her 6 attempts from three.\n\nThe Tigers, who are in just year two of the Kim Mulkey era, were pretty good, too. LSU won the rebounding battles 36-26, turning 14 offensive boards into 14 second-chance points.

South Carolina has not been shooting especially well, connecting at a 40.4% clip, and it has still only managed to hit two 3-pointers on 15 attempts. But the Gamecocks have dominated second-chance opportunities thanks to a staggering 18-4 edge in offensive rebounds.\n\nSouth Carolina has 10 minutes to find an answer or its 42-game winning streak and bid for a second consecutive national title will end.\n\nHalf: No. 2 Iowa 38, No. 1 South Carolina 37; Clark, Boston in foul trouble\n\nThere were six lead changes in the last three minutes of the first half, but the Hawkeyes entered halftime with a one-point lead over the defending champion Gamecocks.\n\nZia Cooke leads South Carolina with 18 points, while the rest of the starters remain scoreless.

Elizabeth Kitley also turned in a double-double with 18 points and 12 rebounds. But it wasn’t enough for the Hokies, who were playing in their program’s first-ever Final Four.\n\n— Lindsay Schnell\n\n3Q: No. 1 Virginia Tech 59, No. 3 LSU 50\n\nVirginia Tech picked up right where they left off in the second quarter, outscoring LSU 25-18 to extend their lead to nine. The Hokies are surprisingly controlling the glass with 33 rebounds, including 10 offensive rebounds.\n\nKayana Traylor (17 points, nine rebounds, two steals) and Elizabeth Kitley (16 points, nine rebounds, three blocks) are both on double-double watch.\n\nAlexis Morris led the Tigers with 17 points. Angel Reese and LaDazhia Williams both added 14 points.\n\nHokies' Georgia Amoore sets NCAA single-tournament record\n\nDespite going 0-5 to start the game, Amoore rebounded to knock down a trio of threes to set a new NCAA Tournament record. She has hit 23 three-pointers throughout March Madness, the most made threes in a single tournament.

Hokies center Elizabeth Kitley has stepped up on both ends of the floor after Taylor Soule got in foul toruble. Kitley is two rebounds away from a double-double (12 points, eight rebounds). Georgia Amoore has six points from two made threes, tying the NCAA record for made three-pointers in a single tournament.\n\nThe Tigers were held scoreless in the last 4:48 of the half. Alexis Morris led the Tigers with 12 points, and Angel Reese added 10 points, but LSU was outrebounded 25-14 by the Hokies.\n\n1Q: No. 3 LSU 16, No. 1 Virginia Tech 13\n\nVirginia Tech got off to a slow start, shooting 25% from the field and 1-for-9 from three. Georgia Amoore missed her first five shot attempts before knocking down the Hokies’ sole three pointer of the quarter. Despite missing shots and seven turnovers, Virginia Tech was able to stay close to LSU thanks to nine offensive rebounds in the quarter. Taylor Soule headed to the bench early with two first-quarter fouls.\n\nAlexis Morris led the Tigers with eight points. LSU shot 43.8% from the field and didn’t attempt any three pointers.\n\nLSU cheerleaders rescue ball stuck behind backboard\n\nCheerleaders to the rescue!\n\nThe game ball got stuck behind the backboard in the opening seconds of the Final Four matchup between No. 1 seed Virginia Tech and No. 3 seed LSU following a turnover from the HokiesCayla King. Two LSU cheerleaders performed a stunt to free the ball for play to resume at American Airlines Center.\n\n“What were the odds of that happening in the first 33 seconds in the national semifinal,” ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said over the broadcast.\n\nVirginia Tech and LSU face off in first national semifinal\n\nThe No. 1 seeded Virginia Tech Hokies have tipped off against the No. 3 seeded LSU Tigers as each seek their first national championship.\n\nBoth teams feature a potent guard-post combo. LSU sophomore forward Angel Reese (23.2 ppg, 15.7 rpg) has been a double-double machine, leading the nation with 32 this season, but Virginia Tech senior center Elizabeth Kitley averages a double-double as well with 18.2 points per game and 10.7 rebounds.\n\nOut on the perimeter, Virginia Tech guard Georgia Amoore has had a breakout season; the junior is averaging 16.3 ppg, 5.0 apg and 3.0 rpg for the Hokies. LSU has its own star guard in Alexis Morris. The senior is averaging 14.9 ppg, 4.1 apg and 1.9 spg for the Tigers.\n\nLSU coach Kim Mulkey goes 'Pretty in Pink' for Final Four\n\nDALLAS – On the Final Four stage, you know Kim Mulkey's outfit was going to pop.\n\nAnd it certainly pops.\n\nFor LSU women's basketball's Final Four showdown against Virginia Tech inside American Airlines Center on Friday night (6 p.m., ESPN), Mulkey decided to go with a vibrant pink jacket accented by large, pink fabric flowers running from the shoulders down to the wrists on both arms.\n\nShe's wearing a white blouse and pants underneath her jacket, along with white heels. Mulkey is matching with her granddaughter, who walked into the arena hand-in-hand with Mulkey wearing a white dress with pink frills on the shoulders.\n\n— Cory Diaz, Lafayette Daily Advertiser\n\nKenny Brooks, in his seventh year at Virginia Tech, is part of elite company. His No. 1 seeded Hokies beat Ohio State 84-74 on Monday to clinch their ticket to the Final Four, a first for the program based in Blacksburg, Virginia. They play third-seeded LSU in the first national semifinal Friday at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nThe significance of the moment is not lost on Brooks, the only Black male head coach in the Power Five. (When Houston moves to the Big 12 in July, Ronald Hughey will become the second.)\n\n“Obviously it’s a topic I don’t shy away from,” Brooks said. “I know that when I was trying (to) make a name for myself, there wasn’t very many people that were doing it or advocated for people that looked like me.”\n\n— Lindsay Schnell\n\nDid Clark really just hit that shot, thread that pass or finish that layup in transition?\n\nYes, she did and she does — regularly. And it’s just as spectacular as you can imagine. Maybe more so.\n\nClark has become one of the sport's biggest stars and walking highlight reel because of her how-did-she-see-that?! passes and unlimited shooting range. But for as talented and awe-inspiring as Clark herself is, Iowa coach Lisa Bluder deserves some credit too. Because she lets Clark be exactly who she is.\n\n— Lindsay Schnell\n\nThe national semifinal between Iowa and South Carolina is being billed as “Aliyah vs. Caitlin,” and with good reason. Aliyah Boston, the South Carolina forward, and Caitlin Clark, the Iowa guard, have been the best players in college basketball the last two seasons, spawning superlatives and earning national accolades.\n\nSeeing them play each other is on every fan’s wish list, making Friday night’s game arguably the most anticipated of the Final Four – men’s or women’s.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nFans of women’s basketball have been clamoring the last two years for the Aliyah Boston and Caitlin Clark showdown, and those who just tuned in during March Madness have now joined the chorus. Well, the masses are finally getting what they want.\n\n\"Everybody has been talking about this matchup for a really long time. It's exciting that it's happening in the Final Four,\" Boston said Thursday.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nIowa's Caitlin Clark wins Wade Trophy, AP women's basketball POY awards\n\nThe Iowa women's basketball star won the Wade Trophy, the highest honor in women's college basketball, on Thursday, the same award Aliyah Boston won last season.\n\nClark is the first Hawkeyes player to ever win the award, which is presented by the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association. Earlier in the day, she was tapped as The Associated Press women's basketball Player of the Year. She received 20 of a possible 28 votes in the tally that was taken prior to the start of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nShe's raking in the awards.

South Carolina beat UConn 73-57 in November in the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas, relying on 22 points from Boston and a stifling defense that held the Huskies to just 3 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nUConn, the premier women’s basketball program for almost three decades, finds itself in the odd position of underdog. A 2-seed in the tournament, UConn had 11 starting lineups this season due to a mix of injuries and Covid illnesses.\n\nStill, UConn reached the Final Four by topping 1-seed NC State in an epic 91-87 win in double-overtime, the first time in women’s NCAA tournament history a game in the Elite Eight or beyond needed double overtime. They followed that up with a 63-58 win over another 1-seed in Stanford on Friday night to reach the title game.\n\nSouth Carolina has been the top-ranked team since the preseason and is 34-2 on the year, with each of its losses coming by 2 points or fewer.\n\nThe Gamecocks reached the Final Four by beating 10-seeded Creighton 80-50 and then dropping 1-seeded Louisville 72-59 on Friday to reach the title game. In the win over Louisville, Boston and her pink and purple braids scored 23 points and snagged 18 rebounds, the 29th double-double of her stellar season.\n\nThis was UConn’s 14th consecutive Final Four appearance stretching back to 2007.\n\nSouth Carolina has made the Sweet 16 every year since 2014 and won its first national championship in 2017.

The other half was settled Monday night.\n\nThe South Carolina Gamecocks and Virginia Tech Hokies will join Iowa and LSU in Dallas.\n\nNo. 1 South Carolina — the defending national champions — beat the second-seeded Maryland Terrapins. The Gamecocks are aiming to be the first repeat women's basketball champion since Connecticut won four straight national titles from 2013-16.\n\nIn the night's second game, another No. 1 seed, Virginia Tech fended off No. 3 seed Ohio State, 84-74. The Hokies have never reached the Final Four. The Buckeyes, meanwhile, last made the Final Four in 1993 when three-time Olympic gold medalist, WNBA champion and future Hall of Famer Katie Smith was a freshman.\n\nFollow along for updates on all the action from Monday's Elite Eight matchups:\n\nThe top-seeded Virginia Tech Hokies defeated the No. 3 seeded Ohio State Buckeyes, 84-74, on Monday in Seattle to earn the program's first trip to the Final Four.\n\nThe Hokies had an early lead with strong shooting from behind the arc, but the game was a fierce back-and-forth battle in the first half until they took control in the third quarter. Virginia Tech's largest lead was 13 points.\n\nVirginia Tech's Elizabeth Kitley was the game's co-leading scorer with 25 points and 12 rebounds. Georgia Amoore added 24 points despite being shaken up in the second quarter. For the Buckeyes, Taylor Mikesell also had 25 points.\n\nThey will face LSU on Friday in the national semifinals in Dallas.\n\nAfter a fierce duel in the first half, the Virginia Tech Hokies are starting to take control, up 63-55 over the Ohio State Buckeyes at the end of the third quarter in Elite Eight action.\n\nGeorgia Amoore made a leaping three-point shot right before the buzzer to give the Hokies an extra boost of momentum. The Australian has 15 points, tied for a team-high, after suffering an injury in the second quarter. Elizabeth Kitley also has 15.\n\n\"I'll go anywhere in the world to find another player like that,\" head coach Kenny Brooks said of Amoore during the ESPN broadcast. \"... Georgia's special to us. She makes us go. She is why we're here.\"\n\nOhio State's Taylor Mikesell is the game's leading scorer with 19 points.\n\nThe Virginia Tech Hokies are up 48-45 at the half over the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\nBoth teams have traded off the lead several times, but Virginia Tech went ahead again after a layup from Taylor Soule with 1:10 on the clock.\n\nThree players are in double digits for the Hokies, including Cayla King with 12, Soule with 11 and Elizabeth Kitley with 10. Georgia Amoore has eight, including a key three-point shot after going to the locker room when she slammed onto the court.\n\n“We just said she’s carried us this far, so we’ve got to do it for her,\" King said of the team's mentality when their leading scorer in the tournament went down.\n\nHokies guard Georgia Amoore was injured when Ohio State's Eboni Walker bumper her shoulder into her face with 8:31 on the clock in the second quarter. Amoore fell backwards and landed on her back. She laid on the court holding her face as her teammates ran over to check on her. She lurched as she stood to her feet with the help of a coach and walked with a wobble toward the bench. She was helped to the locker room with the help of two people.\n\nAmoore returned to the bench soon after and made a three-point shot after reentering the game.\n\nOhio State has surged ahead as the Buckeyes lead the Virginia Tech Hokies 23-22 after an intense first quarter of play.\n\nThe Hokies led from the start until Taylor Mikesell tied the game at 19 with a three-point shot with three minutes left in the quarter. Ohio State finally took the lead at 1:50 remaining when Jacy Sheldon made a layup. She followed that up with a jumpshot to close out the quarter.\n\nMikesell has nine points for Ohio State, while Cayla King has the same for the Hokies.\n\nThe second game of Monday night's action tipped off with buckets galore. Halfway through the first quarter, there are already five total three-point shots with the top-seeded Virginia Tech Hokies leading the No. 3 seeded Ohio State Buckeyes 17-14. Both teams are perfect from behind the arc.\n\nThe Hokies tipped off the action with back-to-back treys, one each from Kayana Traylor and Cayla King. King already has six points on the night as does Ohio State's Taylor Mikesell.\n\nIt was a rocky start, but No. 1 South Carolina is still in the running to defend their national championship after beating the No. 2 seeded Maryland Terrapins, 86-75, in Elite Eight action on Monday. The Gamecocks are headed to their third straight Final Four. This game marks a school-record 36th win of the season and their 42nd in a row dating to last year's NCAA Tournament.\n\nSouth Carolina star Aliyah Boston finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds for her 82nd career double-double.\n\n\"I'm super excited,\" Boston said on the ESPN broadcast after the game. \"The coaches did a great job on scout. We're going to the Final Four!\"\n\nSenior guard Diamond Miller led the Terrapins with 24 points. Abby Meyers finished with 14 points after fouling out in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter a slow start, Aliyah Boston powered the South Carolina Gamecocks to what's been another dominant performance. The senior forward exited the game with 4:20 on the clock and her team up 79-63. She finished the night with 22 points and 10 rebounds for her 82nd career double-double.\n\nSouth Carolina has all the momentum as it ended the third quarter up 62-50 over the Maryland Terrapins and are inching closer to a third straight Final Four appearance.\n\nThe Gamecocks went on a 7-0 run toward the end of the quarter and had a lead as large as 15.\n\nAliyah Boston and Zia Cooke each have 18 points for South Carolina, while Diamond Miller has 15 points for Maryland. Abby Meyers has 14 but got into foul trouble after leading the Terrapins most of the game.\n\nDespite South Carolina's surge, head coach Dawn Staley did not appear happy with her team's inconsistent performance. \"Cookie's gotta cook,\" she said on the ESPN broadcast.\n\nThe South Carolina Gamecocks might not have looked like themselves in the first quarter, but they shook off the dust and lead the Maryland Terrapins 38-30 at halftime.\n\nMaryland took nearly two minutes to score in the second quarter as South Carolina inched closer to the lead. Star forward Aliyah Boston put the Gamecocks ahead with a layup and 4:55 on the clock. South Carolina went 9-2 to close the period and were up by as many as 10 points.\n\nBoston is the leading scorer for the Gamecocks with 12 points and Zia Cooke added all nine of her points in the quarter.\n\nMaryland is staying alive with 14 points from senior guard Abby Meyers. She scored a layup with eight seconds on the clock to keep the Terrapins from going into the break down double digits.\n\nThe Maryland Terrapins are not making it easy for the South Carolina Gamecocks to reach the Final Four and are up 21-15 at the end of the first quarter. The Terrapins scored 12 unanswered points toward the end of the period as Dawn Staley's team failed to find a rhythm. South Carolina's Laeticia Amihere finally broke the streak with a pair of free throws.\n\nSenior guard Abby Meyers is the game's leading scorer with seven points for Maryland. For South Carolina, star forward Aliyah Boston has six points.\n\nCan Maryland buck the odds and topple undefeated South Carolina?\n\nIt’s not often that a No. 2 seed is considered a mammoth underdog to a top seed in the NCAA Tournament, but that’s exactly what the Maryland Terrapins (28-6) are as they head into an Elite Eight showdown with reigning national champion South Carolina.\n\nSouth Carolina has lost precisely two games in the past two seasons to Missouri and Kentucky in the 2021-22 season. The Gamecocks (35-0) have mostly steamrolled opponents this season and are riding a 41-game winning streak dating back to last year’s NCAA Tournament. Only five opponents have even kept the losses under single digits with two taking the Gamecocks to overtime – Stanford in November and Ole Miss in February.\n\nSo, Maryland coach Brenda Frese, who coached the Terrapins to the 2006 national championship, knows what her team is up against: experience, depth and size.\n\n“Obviously, to be undefeated and to look at the depth and the size that they have, you bring the players off the bench, and they just even get better, Frese told the Washington Post. “It’s got to rank up there as one of the best when you talk about all the size being on their roster.”\n\nMaryland is seeking its first Final Four since the Terrapins made back-to-back appearances in 2014 and 2015.\n\n— Ellen J. Horrow\n\nSouth Carolina guard savoring senior year ahead of WNBA draft\n\nSouth Carolina senior guard Brea Beal has an additional season of COVID-19 eligibility available but said she doesn't plan to use it and will declare for the 2023 WNBA draft.\n\n\"School is not for me, I'll tell you that, so I definitely have (made a decision),\" Beal said with a laugh. \"So much of my career I feel like a lot of things went unnoticed, so to be able to close out my senior year, to see a lot of people putting me in mocks or just talking about me, it shows that I'm beginning to get noticed and how valuable I can be.\"\n\nBeal has never been a headliner for the No. 1 Gamecocks, but she has anchored the starting lineup from the moment she set foot on campus. Last year, she earned All-American honorable mention honors for the first time in her career from the Associated Press and was named a finalist for Naismith Defensive Player of the Year alongside her teammate Aliyah Boston, the reigning winner of the award.\n\nESPN and The Athletic currently project Beal as the No. 7 overall pick in the WNBA draft on April 10.\n\n— Emily Adams, Greenville (South Carolina) News\n\nSouth Carolina, Virginia Tech guards are March Madness power couple\n\nOn the morning of the 2023 SEC championship game, the first thing South Carolina women's basketball point guard Kierra Fletcher did was text her girlfriend Kayana Traylor good luck.\n\nAt nearly the same time as Gamecocks tipped off against Tennessee on March 5, Traylor and Virginia Tech women's basketball were hoisting the ACC championship trophy. Fletcher and South Carolina went on to win the SEC title hours later.\n\n\"It was crazy, because right after we played I checked the score and I was like, 'Wow, they won,'\" Fletcher said. \"I called her as soon as I got time, and we were just talking about how crazy it was that both of us won the conference tournament together.\"\n\nTraylor, a 5-foot-9 senior guard for the Hokies, first connected with the Gamecocks' starting point guard on social media. They bonded over being from the Midwest — Fletcher is from Michigan and Traylor from Indiana — and have now been together for nearly three years.\n\nNow, South Carolina and Virginia Tech are the only 1-seeds left. If Virginia Tech beats Ohio State and the Gamecocks take down Maryland, Fletcher and Traylor will head to Dallas with a legitimate chance to face each other for the national championship.\n\n— Emily Adams, Greenville (South Carolina) News\n\nShould No. 1 seed Virginia Tech be worried about Ohio State's full-court press?\n\nIt didn't take a miracle for Ohio State to advance past the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1993. The Buckeyes, in a 73-61 win over Connecticut on Saturday, simply outplayed the Huskies for the majority of the game.\n\n\"As long as we play our game,\" Ohio State senior forward Eboni Walker said, \"we have the utmost confidence in ourselves and in each other.\"\n\nFor Ohio State, playing its game goes hand-in-hand with its full-court press. When the Buckeyes get their press set and start forcing turnover after turnover after turnover, as they did against the Huskies, they can be almost impossible to stop.\n\nNow, No. 1 seed Virginia Tech will have to grapple with Ohio State's press just as UConn did. During the Hokies' Sweet 16 win over Tennessee, the Lady Vols used their own press to come back from an 18-point deficit early in the third quarter to get within one point.\n\nVirginia Tech coach Kenny Brooks knows Ohio State will employ the full-court press Monday night and says his team will have to play smart but aggressive offense.\n\n\"We have to get downhill, break the pressure, and get some easy opportunities, and I think that that will kind of ease it up a little bit,\" Brooks said. \"But they have been doing it all year long. They're really good at it.\"\n\n— Bailey Johnson, The Columbus Dispatch\n\nLSU coach Kim Mulkey has no doubt South Carolina will be in Final Four\n\nKim Mulkey is already calling South Carolina in the Final Four.\n\nThe defending national champions don’t play their Elite Eight game against second-seeded Maryland until Monday night, but Mulkey doesn’t need to wait around for that. The top-seeded Gamecocks will be in Dallas next weekend, LSU’s coach said Sunday night.\n\n“South Carolina is going. I’m just telling you that, flat out,” she said after LSU clinched its own spot in the Final Four with a 54-42 win over Miami. “That’s nothing against who they play. I just know how good they are.”\n\nSouth Carolina thumped LSU by 24 points, 88-64, in their one meeting in the regular season. If Mulkey’s team sees the Gamecocks again, a national title would be on the line.\n\n“I’d sure love to be in that championship with them,” Mulkey said.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nIowa star proves she's college basketball's most electrifying (men's or women's) player\n\nTo get an idea of just how intoxicating Caitlin Clark’s game is, all you had to do Sunday — if you weren’t near a TV to watch her pile up 41 points, hand out 12 assists and grab 10 rebounds — was scroll Twitter.\n\nIn the second half as her Hawkeyes pulled away from Louisville and everyone in Climate Pledge Arena went on triple-double watch, Clark became the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter. And as Clark led No. 2 seed Iowa to its first Final Four since 1993, it became clear: the junior guard is the superstar women’s basketball needs, right when the game needs it.\n\nOn Saturday, women’s basketball bid an early goodbye to UConn, the program that had made an NCAA-record 14 consecutive Final Fours but will be watching from home this April. On Sunday, it said hello to Clark, the most electrifying player in college basketball, men’s or women’s. Her passes in transition causes gasps, her tendency to pull up from the logo makes opponents shake their heads.\n\nShe’s a transcendent talent, a player of the year candidate who elevates everyone around her and loves the big stage. Sunday when Iowa built as much as a 22-point lead she played to the crowd, motioning to fans to cheer louder, cupping her ear to see if they complied. Asked afterward what it’s like to have an entire arena wrapped around your finger, Clark leaned into the mic and admitted sheepishly, “I feel kinda powerful.”\n\n— Lindsay Schnell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/indiana/2023/03/12/indiana-womens-basketball-gets-no-1-seed-in-ncaa-tournament-2023-monmouth-tennessee-tech-march/69994289007/", "title": "Indiana women's basketball gets No. 1 seed in NCAA tournament ...", "text": "BLOOMINGTON — The Indiana women's basketball team knew it was coming, a No. 1-seed in the NCAA tournament. But it was still surreal to see Hoosiers' name on ESPN with a No. 1 next to it atop the Greenville 2 regional.\n\nThis is IU's ninth NCAA tournament appearance, and its first as a No. 1-seed, marking the third consecutive season it has received the highest seed in program history. It was a 3-seed last season (Sweet 16) and a 4-seed the year before (Elite 8).\n\n\"We had a pretty good idea that we would be a 1-seed but to actually see it on the big screen — that's something that, looking back on it, I might not have ever thought was possible,\" senior Grace Berger said. \"It's really special just to see where we came from when I first got here in 2018 to where we are now. It's definitely one of those moments where it kind of feels surreal.\"\n\n\"We're grateful,\" added coach Teri Moren, whose team will play Saturday (11:30 a.m., ESPN2) against the winner of Thursday's play-in game between Tennessee Tech and Monmouth. \"There's only 68 teams that get selected each year, and to not only be selected, but to also get that No. 1 seed — which has never happened in this program — is both thrilling and very humbling. We're grateful for the opportunity that's ahead of us.\"\n\nThat the Hoosiers are a No. 1-seed is a testament to the growth of both the program and the sport of women's college basketball as a whole, the continuation of a massive shift from the same few programs dominating the landscape to nationwide parity.\n\n\"It's really cool to see different teams getting those one seeds and being in those top-two, top-five teams, because in years past, it was pretty consistently the same team,\" Mackenzie Holmes said. \"To see how much the game has grown is just really cool.\"\n\nTo Holmes' point, IU was joined on the 1-line by defending national champion South Carolina, ACC champion Virginia Tech — which was in Bloomington for the WNIT championship game in 2018 — and Stanford, whose announcement as the final No. 1 over Big Ten tournament champion Iowa drew cheers from the players inside Assembly Hall.\n\nEven the other top seeds in IU's bracket are occupied by relatively new powerhouses with No. 2 Utah (25-3), which is coming off its first regular-season Pac-12 title in program history, No. 3 LSU (28-2) out of the SEC and No. 4 Villanova (28-6), which lost to UConn in the Big East championship game.\n\n\"(Virginia Tech) is a different team, just like Indiana is a different team that you don't really see as a No. 1, and I think it's so great for women's basketball,\" Moren said. \"It's also great for women's basketball fans who have been waiting for this moment in time. … It's changed everything and I can't tell you how good I think it is for our game as a whole.\"\n\nThe Hoosiers laid claim to a top-seed long before Sunday's selection show. Led by Holmes, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, they constructed a resume that includes notable nonconference wins over then-No. 11 Tennessee and then-No. 6 North Carolina, plus ranked Big Ten wins over Maryland, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio State and Iowa en route to the program's first-ever outright conference championship (second overall).\n\nIndiana's lone regular-season losses were on the road during conference play: At Michigan State on Dec. 29 with Berger sidelined due to injury, and at Iowa on a buzzer-beater by Caitlin Clark in the final game of the regular season. It avenged the loss to Michigan State in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals, before falling to Ohio State in the semifinals.\n\nIU has used the week since its trip to Minneapolis to rest and recover. They continued practicing, Moren said, but were able to \"shut down a little bit\" both physically and mentally. They ran shorter, more intense practice sessions, focusing on areas to improve upon following their past three games.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie. It was a challenge for these guys to come in every day and get excited about our improvements and what we were asking them to do,\" Moren said. \"But they handled themselves in the right kind of way.\"\n\n\"That Big Ten season is no joke, so afterwards we all took a deep breath and tried to get ourselves feeling good again,\" added Holmes.\n\nThe winner of Saturday's NCAA tournament game will advance to face either No. 8 Miami or No. 9 Oklahoma State in the second round.\n\nFirst- and second-round games will be played at Assembly Hall. Should IU advance, it would travel to Greenville, S.C. for the Sweet 16. Dallas will host this year's Final Four (March 31) and National Championship (April 2) games.\n\n\"Nothing against Seattle, but that's a long trip. We're thrilled with where we're being sent,\" Moren said of being placed in the Greenville regional. \"I don't know how these guys feel, but I think a great dose of sunshine is in our future — we hope.\"\n\nFollow Brian Haenchen on Twitter at @Brian_Haenchen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/usc/2023/03/12/south-carolina-womens-ncaa-tournament-2023-march-madness-bracket-opponent/69974985007/", "title": "In March Madness, South Carolina women's basketball gets top 1 ...", "text": "COLUMBIA — There were no surprises for South Carolina women's basketball as it watched the Selection Sunday show for its March Madness placement.

Baig\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe iPhone at 10 isn’t the only tech milestone being celebrated this week. A half-century ago marked the very first Consumer Electronics Show, the forerunner of the trade event held annually in Las Vegas.\n\nA quick tech tour down memory lane:\n\nIn 1967, the inaugural CES took place in New York City, where it attracted 17,500 attendees and 117 exhibitors, the main ones housed in one of two midtown Manhattan hotels. By way of comparison, more than 180,000 people attended the latest CES this past January in Vegas, a show with north of 4000 exhibitors\n\nThe roster of companies showcasing products during the first CES included 3M, Memorex (now MEM-CE), Motorola (now part of Lenovo), Panasonic-Matsushita, Philips, RCA (now a Technicolor brand), Sanyo Fisher (now part of Panasonic), Sharp, Sony, Toshiba, Westinghouse and Zenith (now part of LG).\n\nSo what was the hot tech during the LBJ administration?\n\nThe 1966-67 TV season was the first in which the three major TV networks — yes only three — broadcast their entire prime-time schedules in color, and this was considered the time when the sets themselves became \"affordable.\" Many companies slashed color TV pricing by about 5%-10%.\n\nAt that maiden CES, for example, GE showcased a 24-pound portable color TV that it billed as the “first under $200 set ever sold.”\n\nPortable TV was itself a fairly new category, although the definition of what was considered portable (up to 45 pounds) is debatable.\n\nHi-fi (stereo) components, mostly two-channel stereo receivers and phonographs/turntables, were also in vogue. As were hi-fi speakers, including floor-standing, bookshelf and \"console\" models. Stereo consoles consisted of large credenza-type furniture units, often with TVs built-in.\n\nOther products at CES back then included the Sony/Sony-Superscope (H-130, H-131), a “Pocket Cassette-Corder, that was a thicker version of the Sony Walkman that would debut about a dozen years later, minus the headphones that the Walkman had. It cost less than $100 and ran on 4 AA batteries.\n\nPortable audio generally consisted of transistor radios of varying sizes, and “party player” record players with built-in speakers. Kids could stack a dozen or so “45 RPM” records on them.\n\nFormat wars have often defined CES and the electronics industry through the years, and that was the case even in 1967. The debate was over the emerging 8-track cartridge versus cassette formats. Consumers back then could still purchase reel-to-reel tape recorders.\n\nAmong the most interesting tidbits to emerge from the first CES was a print advertisement Ford-owned Philco ran in a show publication. Philco was predicting what TV would look like in 1999 on the cusp of the 21st century.\n\n“If you plan to sell much color TV in 1999, you'd better brush up on your holography,” the ad proclaimed.\n\n“3-D color TV that lets you see round corners — holographic TV — will be quite common in middle-income homes by 1999. So will color TV telephones, electronic education systems and electronic organs that let you play a full orchestra.\n\n“The home entertainment business is going to look very different just 32 years from now, and so is the appliance business. Big-selling items will be meal programmers, sonic-wave cleaners and micro-wave cookers.”\n\nPredictions, anyone, of what tech will look like 32 or 50 years from now?\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/06/ibm-mainframes-mark-50th-anniversary/7364535/", "title": "IBM mainframes mark 50th anniversary", "text": "Craig Wolf\n\nPoughkeepsie (N.Y.) Journal\n\nPOUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. -- On the eve of a milestone, one of the world's premier high-tech machines is simultaneously new and old. It's 50 years old, if you track back to its ancestors. It's shiny-new and state-of-the-art if you're talking about ones that come out of the plant today. That plant is IBM Corp.'s Poughkeepsie complex, and the machine is the mainframe computer.\n\nMonday is the half-century mark for the industrial-strength computers that Big Blue makes. The good news is that they do appear to have a future.\n\nAll of the mainframe's history is firmly planted in Poughkeepsie and Dutchess County, whose economy owes more to this single item than to any other thing made here.\n\nSo do legions of workers who wore IBM nametags over the generations and today still number an estimated 7,000, between the Poughkeepsie plant and the East Fishkill semiconductor complex.\n\nApril 7, 1964, was the day IBM announced to the world the product of its biggest investment ever, a computer called the System/360. It was its first system built on \"solid logic\" semiconductor technology and one in which different models could talk to each other — both novel at the time.\n\nToday's descendants are vastly more powerful. Today's largest mainframe can push through 52,000 business transactions per second.\n\nToday, they are known as System z. New models of high-end systems are in the works at the Poughkeepsie plant, but under wraps. On a recent tour offered to the Poughkeepsie Journal, there was plenty of work in progress on the manufacturing and test floors.\n\nIn the Development System Test area, 165 big systems run simultaneously with their doors open. One walks through aisles lined with mainframes. The noise would be deafening but for the earplugs that the manager, Frank Collura, advises visitors to wear.\n\nBig servers require a lot of air cooling and some have water cooling.\n\nEngineers sit in another, quieter room, managing tests to ensure these new boxes will run all the software they're supposed to. Mainframes are backward- and forward-compatible, meaning old programs and old data are accessible and new ones will be as well.\n\nSo what is the mainframe's future?\n\nIt's a vital question for the local economy that Big Blue built up. It's a question sharpened by the uncertainty that has been cast over the chip-making site in East Fishkill by reports that IBM is exploring possible sale of its semiconductor manufacturing business.\n\nVirginia Rometty, chairman, president and CEO of IBM, addressed hardware divestitures in the company's annual report.\n\n\"We are not exiting hardware,\" she said. \"IBM will remain a leader in high-performance and high-end systems, storage and cognitive computing, and we will continue to invest in (research and development) for advanced semiconductor technology.\"\n\nBut Larry Tucker of LaGrange is still troubled by the trend of shrinking jobs and increased outsourcing. He worked in many IBM jobs over a 35-year period, including some as a contractor, before it all ended about a year ago in another round of economizing.\n\nHe said the buildings where they do the hardware mainframes are not all IBM any more.\n\n\"They're run by another company,\" Tucker said.\n\nIBM has turned increasingly to Jabil Circuit Inc. for in-house outsourcing. That's when work formerly done by IBMers goes to a contractor whose people, often the same people who are now ex-IBMers, keep working inside IBM's plant.\n\nMost people there are still IBMers, a spokesman said in August.\n\nThis job-shifting is a way for IBM and other companies to save money and stay alive in a globally competitive economy, industry experts say.\n\n\"I loved the company in the old days,\" Tucker said. \"But everything changes. And that's life.\"\n\nThe IBM culture changed, too.\n\nH. Bryson Ainsley, 85, of the Town of Washington, remembers his first day working in an IBM mailroom, Jan. 10, 1949.\n\n\"I remember the day because I had my sincere suit on and a quiet tie, and I wore my blue oxford button-down shirt. The boss called me in and said, 'I just wanted to let you know, we wear white shirts in IBM.'\"\n\nWhat hasn't changed is IBM's strong sales culture. Ainsley sold mainframes, and even had a license plate that said BA360 on his Ford Thunderbird.\n\nHe remembers the big bet that IBM made on the System/360.\n\n\"It was the entire IBM treasure gambled on this one system,\" he said.\n\nThe cost then was $5 billion to develop it. In today's dollars, that's about $38 billion.\n\nIBM has had a drop in hardware sales, but its executives don't sound worried. Fourth-quarter mainframe sales fell 37 percent compared with a year ago. Executives explained that the current model of the System z line is near the end of its product cycle, and sales typically drop temporarily as buyers decide to wait and see what a new model can do.\n\n\"You get it out and it's hot for the first 12 or 18 months and then it levels off,\" said Joe Clabby, analyst with Clabby Analytics in Yarmouth, Maine. \"That's normal.\"\n\nClabby is among analysts who deem the future of the mainframe to be secure.\n\n\"No worries,\" he said. \"A huge portion of the world already runs mainframes in places where there's no other system that can do that job,\" Clabby said.\n\nMainframes have a certain stability in the market, though not much growth, said Brian Jeffery, managing director of International Technology Group, a consultancy in Santa Cruz, Calif.\n\n\"It's kind of Catch-22,\" he said. \"While there's not much new application growth in mainframes, I don't know any big mainframe users who are looking to get out of the mainframe at this point.\"\n\nGartner Research issued a paper in October that said the IBM mainframe market is \"far from dead,\" but predicted \"a growing interest among mainframe customers to migrate off this platform.\" Improvements in other, cheaper systems will attract smaller customers, Gartner said. IBM customers \"will struggle to justify the value proposition of this flagship IBM platform.\"\n\nClabby was skeptical that many mainframe customers would find anything suitable to move to.\n\nMainframes excel at high-volume transaction processing, a field that is growing as more people do more online banking, buying and other activities that require both speed and security.\n\nPatrick Toole Jr., general manager of IBM's System z, says banking, financial, retail, government and academia are the big client bases for his mainframe sales.\n\n\"What it always has been is high-volume secure transaction processing,\" Toole said.\n\nAnalyst Clabby said IBM has been telling conferences that mobile, the rising use of smartphones and portable digital devices, will be good for the mainframe.\n\n\"With mobile devices, all they want to do is interface with that data,\" Clabby said. \"Mainframe owns the data.\"\n\n\"I think that's a cogent argument that IBM's making that the mainframe can be and should be positioned as a server environment for mobile computing,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/03/22/young-and-restless-celebrates-50-years-daytime-drama/11524460002/", "title": "'The Young and the Restless' celebrates 50 years of drama | AP News", "text": "Mark Kennedy\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK — It all started on a late morning on a highway. A camera panned to the cab of a large semi-trailer truck. The driver wore a plaid shirt and a day's growth of beard. Next to him was a mysterious hitchhiker in expensive clothes that were ripped and a fresh head wound.\n\nHe got out at Genoa City. And he stayed.\n\nThat's how \"The Young and the Restless \" began on March 26, 1973, and a lot of people also stuck around Genoa City. The soap opera celebrates its 50th anniversary this month as the No. 1 daytime drama for 35 consecutive years, with fans growing up alongside the actors.\n\n\"I think a huge reason why the audience has stuck with us for so long is because we are the same people. We are family members. We show up every day — sometimes more than a regular family member,\" says Lauralee Bell, a star and daughter of the show's founders.\n\nCreated by the late William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell, \"The Young and the Restless\" concerns the goings-on of several Midwestern families, some of whom have a lot and some who don't. William Bell was head writer for decades, giving the show a singular vision, unusual for soaps.\n\nLauralee Bell, an Emmy-winner who plays good-girl Christine Blair Williams and first joined the show in 1983, says her dad would likely not be surprised by the show's new milestone. \"He said if you have two families that come from different backgrounds and good, solid characters, it's endless material.\"\n\nOne of the ways the show will celebrate its milestone is with a masquerade ball storyline starting Thursday and continuing through the following week. Creators promise \"surprise visits from fan favorites and secrets are revealed, forever changing the lives for the residents of Genoa City.\" \"Entertainment Tonight\" also plans a March 27 special.\n\nThe CBS soap has helped launch the careers of such primetime and film actors as Vivica A. Fox, David Hasselhoff, Adam Brody, Tom Selleck, Penn Badgley, Shemar Moore, Eva Longoria, Justin Hartley and the late Paul Walker. Eric Braeden plays the male lead Victor Newman, a villain of the highest quality who once kept his wife's lover locked in his basement.\n\nProfessor Elana Levine, who teaches media studies at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee and wrote \"Her Stories: Daytime Soap Opera and US Television History,\" says the staying power of soaps is that they get passed down from one generation to the next.\n\n\"What streaming TV has shown us is that serialized narratives and stories that continue from episode to episode are really appealing and engaging,\" she says. \"Soaps did that before anybody and are the maximum version of that because the story is going for decades.\"\n\nAmong the cake-flinging food fights and evil twins on \"The Young and the Restless,\" there have also been important firsts — it aired the first live facelift on TV, back in 1984, and when veteran actor Kristoff St. John died in 2019, the cast and crew held a funeral for his character, bringing tears to a returning Moore.\n\nIt became the first daytime drama with a character who had a mastectomy, it was the first soap opera to broadcast in HD and, perhaps most importantly, it welcomed leading Black actors in the 1980s before many other soaps.\n\n\"'The Young and the Restless' attracted a big African American audience starting at that time because they were putting Black characters, front center, more so than some of the other soaps were,\" says Levine.\n\nThat's a legacy Bell is proud of and she puts it squarely as a result of her parents, whom she calls hard-working creators who demanded a lot from their writers and actors, even their kids.\n\n\"My dad was not afraid of of being first. All the social issues he dealt with — date rape, AIDS, alcoholism, all of that. He really felt that if our audience bonded with these characters that they would learn,\" says Bell. \"If we could even help one person, it was worth it.\"\n\nShow veteran Melody Thomas Scott recalls a story that featured infant CPR, which is nothing like the adult version. \"I think Bill and Lee wanted the world to know the difference,\" she says. On the soap, a baby swallows a coin and Victor Newman — of course — becomes the hero by showing viewers the correct CPR technique.\n\n\"We got so many calls in our 'Y&R' office the day after that episode aired, some mothers in tears, so grateful,\" she says. \"That is the ultimate goal of sneaking in some social issues because it can save lives. It can change people's lives.\"\n\nOne of Bill Bell's hallmarks was telling stories in real time, for instance waiting for a couple's first hand holding, then waiting a while before their first kiss. \"If the audience doesn't believe it and grow with them. It's hard to buy sometimes,\" his daughter says. The soap always stayed in the realm of reality: No getting possessed by the devil in Genoa City.\n\nChristian Jules Le Blanc shocks 'Y&R' wife Tracey E. Bregman with a replacement Emmy\n\nScott is celebrating her 44th year on the show as Nikki Newman, a poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Her character has gone from a tempestuous, alcoholic stripper to the serial's luminous and resourceful leading lady.\n\nShe says the show has stayed true to Bill Bell's vision of a show with compelling characters played by beautiful people. Visually, the soap has stayed lush and elegant, with plenty of fresh flowers or candles onset. \"We look different from any other show,\" she says.\n\nBell not only had a knack for storylines — he also knew his actors. Scott recalls being surprised when Bell paired her bratty character with tycoon Victor Newman, two people she thought had nothing in common.\n\n'Young and the Restless' honors Kristoff St. John with 4-episode story arc this week\n\n\"We discovered that we had this chemistry that we certainly didn't expect. But I think Bill, in all of his wisdom, somehow saw it in us,\" she says. \"You can't force yourself to have chemistry with another actor. It just either is or isn't. So we are eternally grateful that Bill was so psychic in knowing that we would click.\"\n\nThe Bell family has continued to be part of the DNA of modern soaps, with Lauralee acting, her brother Brad serving as executive producer and head writer for sister soap \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" and brother Bill Jr. as president of the family production companies who made a deal for \"The Young and the Restless\" to be seen overseas, with versions in Israel, Canada, Turkey and France, among others.\n\n\"It was one of the first daytime soaps that got sold internationally,\" says Levine. \"I think that has been a key to its continued success and profitability. The money that any daytime soap brings in domestically has lessened over time and the audience has gotten smaller.\"\n\nIf any viewers need convincing the \"The Young and the Restless\" has penetrated popular culture, look for further than Mary J. Blige, who sampled the show's theme song in her 2001 hit \"No More Drama.\"\n\nThat mysterious man in the very first scene was Brad Elliot and ahead of him was plenty of drama — a love triangle with a pair of sisters, a marriage, the heartache of a miscarriage, a diagnosis of blindness and a divorce petition. Surgery restored his sight but his marriage never recovered. He left Genoa City after five years.

At 16, she was made an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a British army infantry regiment.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth is pictured in 1945 standing by an Auxiliary Territorial Service first aid truck wearing an officer's uniform. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nWartime offered her certain freedoms beyond the traditional constraints of royal life.\n\nIn 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service and spent four weeks getting her hands covered in oil and grease as she learned to drive and maintain military vehicles.\n\nWhen victory was declared in Europe, a uniformed Elizabeth mingled with jubilant crowds outside Buckingham Palace.\n\nPeacetime brought the return of Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a handsome young naval officer who had, by all accounts, won her heart when she was just 13. The pair married in Westminster Abbey in 1947. Their first son, Charles, was born just over a year later.\n\nA youthful monarch\n\nWith her father’s health in rapid decline, Elizabeth began accepting more official duties, taking his place at the annual “Trooping the Colour” military parade in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, while Elizabeth and Philip were on an official trip to Kenya, news came of her father’s death.\n\nShe was now Queen.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh wave at the crowds from the balcony at Buckingham Palace after her coronation, on June 2, 1953. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nThe next decade saw the young monarch settle into her role. After her coronation in 1953, she embarked on numerous official overseas trips, oversaw state openings of parliament, welcomed visiting leaders such as Dwight Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, and toured a coal mine.\n\nThese international forays came even as the disintegration of Britain’s empire hastened. India had gained independence from its colonial power in 1947, before Elizabeth became Queen. Dozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nThe Queen meanwhile embraced her role as Head of the Commonwealth, visiting almost all of its member states – starting with a lengthy Commonwealth tour in 1953 and 1954.\n\nIn 1964, the Queen became a mother for the fourth time as new son Edward joined Charles and fellow siblings Anne and Andrew. There was, however, barely any let-up in her busy schedule.\n\nBy the arrival of her third decade on the throne, she was in her element. Prince Charles was embarking on a military career, Princess Anne, an acclaimed horsewoman, was married – drawing huge crowds of well-wishers.\n\nWhile indulging in her own equestrian pursuits, she continued to throw herself into public life, clocking up dozens of overseas tours and official visits around the UK – one of which, in 1976, saw her become one of the first people to send an email.\n\nThere were family problems when her sister’s marriage collapsed, and constitutional issues as debate grew among Commonwealth countries about the role of the monarch, but these failed to dampen celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of her reign in 1977.\n\nAnother royal wedding followed in 1981 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer at London’s St Paul’s Cathedral. Millions of people around the world watched the ceremony on television, happily unaware it would usher in the most turbulent period yet of the Queen’s life.\n\nDivorce, fire and Diana’s death\n\nThe Queen’s 40th year on the throne, 1992, marked her lowest moment as three royal marriages fell apart. Princess Anne and Mark Philips divorced, Charles and Diana separated after claims of infidelities while Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew’s wife, was photographed topless with an American financial manager.\n\nTo cap it all, a huge fire ripped through Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. In the wake of the blaze, a furor broke out when it was suggested that public money be used to fund the restoration.\n\nThis year was not one “on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” the Queen said in a speech later. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an annus horribilis.”\n\nThese problems overshadowed the Queen as she made an historic visit to meet South African President Nelson Mandela in 1995, but criticism reached new heights in the wake of Diana’s tragic death in 1997, when the royals were accused of being aloof and out of touch amid widespread public outpourings of grief.\n\nThis marked a turning point.\n\nAfter days of silence, the Queen returned to London, talked to mourners and admitted there were lessons to be learned from Diana’s life. The gestures struck a chord with the public and criticism ebbed away.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nAfter Diana, the Queen’s popularity rebounded as she presided over what appeared to be a softer, more accessible and thoroughly modern royal family.\n\nThis was evident in 2005 when, to public approval, she assented to the previously unthinkable marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. It was capped eight years later when Britain’s parliament ended the principle of men taking precedence over women in the line of succession to the throne.\n\nShe witnessed two of her grandsons, Princes William and Harry, graduate as military officers in 2006 and five years later oversaw the marriage of William and Catherine, the woman who – as the wife of the now heir to the throne – will one day succeed her as Britain’s Queen. She also attended the wedding of Harry to Meghan Markle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor in May 2018.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry watch a flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace as part of events to mark the centenary of the RAF on July 10, 2018 in London. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nIn 2012, the Queen’s diamond jubilee was celebrated around the Commonwealth, culminating in a glittering river pageant on the Thames in London, and a concert showcasing some of the best music from her six decades on the throne.\n\nThree years later, she surpassed Queen Victoria’s 63-year-rule to become the longest-reigning British monarch and, in 2016, she marked her 90th birthday with a series of festivities and goodwill messages from around the world.\n\nIn February 2022, she marked the start of her platinum jubilee year, as she became the first British monarch to reign for 70 years.\n\nFamily upheaval\n\nThe Queen’s final years were punctuated by challenges as well as celebrations, however.\n\nAs the novel coronavirus swept through Britain in 2020, she gave two televised addresses in quick succession, one calling for unity in the face of the pandemic and the other, still amid a national lockdown, to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.\n\nBut while rallying the nation’s spirits, the Queen was facing upheaval within her own family. Less than two years after their spectacular Windsor Castle wedding, Harry and Meghan announced that they were stepping back from their roles as senior royals and leaving Britain.\n\nThey subsequently set up home with son Archie in California and, in a March 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, accused “the firm” of leaving Meghan unprotected against racist abuse and unfair media coverage, as well as having neglected her mental health concerns. The couple – whose daughter Lilibet, named in honor of the Queen, was born in June 2021 – also made a damaging allegation of racism by an unnamed member of the royal family, although Winfrey later said they had clarified that this was neither the Queen nor Prince Philip.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Andrew, often referred to as the Queen’s “favorite son,” had been forced to step back from public duties after a disastrous 2019 interview with the BBC over his association with prominent sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022, the Queen sought to distance the royal institution from a civil sex abuse lawsuit brought against Andrew in the United States by stripping him of his HRH status and royal patronages permanently. He subsequently settled the case out of court for an undisclosed figure and continues to reject the allegations against him.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021 in Windsor, England. Jonathan Brady/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nIn April 2021, the Queen suffered the loss of Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years and the longest-serving consort in British history. Pandemic restrictions meant she cut a lonely figure at his funeral, scaled back in terms of guests but still marked with military pomp.\n\nElizabeth returned to her royal duties within days, now a widow but still dedicated to a lifetime of service. She even continued with light duties after testing positive for Covid-19 in February 2022.\n\nBut as the year wore on, the monarch was forced to significantly slim down her diary due to mobility issues. On Tuesday, she met with outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace to do so.\n\nThe nation had come together to mark her platinum jubilee in June 2022 – a crowning achievement in a long and storied life.\n\nBy the time of her death in September, she had reigned for a little over 70 years – a constant, if regally distant, presence in the lives of several generations of Britons.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Barry Neild"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/09/06/the-worlds-most-important-event-every-year-since-1920/113604790/", "title": "History: The world's most important event every year since 1920", "text": "Angelo Young and John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nOver the past 100 years, we’ve witnessed some of the most profound changes in human history.\n\nBetween a pandemic, wars, technological developments, progress in civil rights, and breakthroughs in science and medicine, the old order has been swept away, sometimes giving way to freer forms of governing and sometimes not.\n\nCenturies-old empires crumbled as new ideologies – from communism to fascism – took root in many parts of the world. Wars in the early part of the 20th century led to the end of the colonial world and gave birth to new nations. These wars also cost millions of lives and trillions of dollars. These are the most expensive wars in U.S. history.\n\nThroughout the past century, technological innovations transformed our lives in ways we never dreamed. Progressive ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, African Americans, and the LGBTQ community demanded, and often won, equal rights – from the ratification of the 19th Amendment in the United States to the legalization of same-sex marriage in many countries around the world. Even so, recent civil rights protests tell us the fight for equality is not over.\n\nDunkin' or Starbucks:Among America's favorite brew-at-home coffee brands, which comes out ahead?\n\nPlanes, phones and automobiles:These are the top-selling products from each state in the US\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that is ravaging the world in 2020 reminds us that for all of our scientific breakthroughs, we’re still vulnerable to deadly viruses that can shut down economies and disrupt society. People are hoping science can save Earth from the devastating changes to the climate that continue to imperil the ecosystems of our planet. In the coming years, natural disasters may have an increasingly impactful role on the course of history. Here are 26 disaster scenarios caused by climate change.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Tempo drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list. Deciding the most important event in a given year is by its nature a subjective exercise. In reaching our decisions, we chose the event that had the most far-reaching impact, even if it was not necessarily the most famous event in a given year.\n\nThe world's most important event every year since 1920\n\n1920: Women's Suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population – in the beginning only white landowning males over the age of 21 – could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution was passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots, though the voting rights fight was far from over for many African American women, especially in the South.\n\n1921: Chinese Communists Rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire Shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto Earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes Monkey Trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist and former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,498 in 2020 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would rule that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. Starts Numbered Highway System\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh Nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the first person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop, making him one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany’s aircraft industry. Also, his infant son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart Crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street Crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve, and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh Rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building Completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nU.S. President Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler Becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR Elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler Consolidates Power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR Launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens Flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 400-meter relay.\n\n1937: UAW Changes Car Industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism Surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes, and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II Starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's Founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald’s Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches, and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes, and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu, and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald’s into one of the world’s largest restaurant chains.\n\n1941: Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed. The United States declares war on Japan the next day and three days later against Germany and Italy.\n\n1942: GIs Arrive in Europe\n\n• Date: Jan. 26\n\n• Location: Northern Ireland\n\nThe first U.S. troops destined to fight in Europe in the world's greatest war arrive in Northern Ireland. It is the beginning of a military buildup that would culminate in the invasion of France more than two years later. Before then, the United States was providing only material support to its ally across the Atlantic, while building up what President Roosevelt called the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" in anticipation for the inevitable entry of the United States into the war in Europe.\n\n1943: Invention of LSD\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Basel, Switzerland\n\nSwiss chemist Albert Hoffman had been studying the potential medicinal value of lysergic compounds when he accidentally exposed himself to LSD-25, which he had created years earlier in his lab. This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier. The plan is conceived during the Quebec Conference by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. The invasion starts at 6:30 a.m. on five beaches, and over the next 24 hours about 4,900 Allied soldiers are killed, many of them the instant the doors of their Higgins transport boats opened directly into German machine gun fire.\n\n1945: World War II Ends\n\n• Date: Sept. 2\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe surrender of Japan marks the end of World War II amid one of the most tumultuous years of the 20th century. Earlier in the year, leaders of three nations – Benito Mussolini, Franklin Roosevelt, and Adolf Hitler – die and Nazi Germany surrenders. Though the surrender of Japan was inevitable, the prospect of a horrific Allied assault on the Japanese mainland convinces the United States to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic bomb attacks, along with the entry of the Soviet Union in the war against Japan, compel the Japanese to surrender.\n\n1946: Baby Boom Starts\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nMore American babies are born – 3.4 million – in 1946 than in any year in U.S. history up to then. The number of births grows to 4 million per year from 1954 to 1964, the last year of the baby boomer generation, the biggest generation at that point in history.\n\n1947: India Gains Independence\n\n• Date: Aug. 15\n\n• Location: Washington D.C\n\nThe sun sets on the British Empire in India in 1947, as the Asian nation becomes the world's largest democracy. Independence is the culmination of decades of work by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indian nationalists committed to throwing off the yoke of British colonialism. The transition to independence comes at a price. The subcontinent is partitioned into two nations, Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Violence erupts between Hindus and Muslims as Hindus migrate to India and Muslims shift to Pakistan. It is estimated that 1 million people die during the migration.\n\n1948: Birth of Israel\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: Middle East\n\nAfter Israel declares its independence following a UN resolution, neighboring Arab states with troops from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia attack the former British-controlled Palestinian mandate. The Arab-Israeli War ended with an armistice that leaves Israel with some territories as Egypt and Jordan retains control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, respectively.\n\n1949: NATO Founded\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nWith the Cold War worsening, the Soviet Union detonates its first nuclear bomb and quickly exerts its influence over Eastern Europe. It attempts to do the same in Western Europe, which is still recovering from the massive destruction of World War II. To respond to the Soviet threat, U.S. and Western European allies form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast.

Gas prices have been rising steadily for the last eight weeks, and this latest milestone marks the 15th straight day that the AAA reading has hit a record price, and the 32nd time in the last 33 days.\n\nThe national average stood at $4.07 when the current run of price increases began April 15. The current price reading from OPIS represents 23% increase in less than two months.\n\nAnd the rising gasoline prices is doing more than just causing pain at the pump for drivers. They are a major factor in the prices paid by consumers for a full range of goods and services rising at the fastest pace in 40 years, according to the government’s inflation report Friday.\n\nInflation caused consumer confidence to hit a record low on Friday, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. Worries about what the Federal Reserve will do to battle inflation has sent US stocks plunging in recent months, wiping out billions in household wealth.\n\nWhile a $5 national average is new, $5 gas has become unpleasantly common in much of the country.\n\nData from OPIS, which collects the readings from 130,000 US gas stations used to compile the AAA averages, showed that 32% of stations nationwide, nearly one of every three, were already were charging more than $5 a gallon in readings Friday. And about 10% of stations across the nation are charging more than $5.75 a gallon.\n\nThe statewide average was $5 a gallon or more in 21 states plus Washington DC in Saturday’s reading.\n\n$6 gas could be next\n\nAnd gas prices are unlikely to stop there. With the summer travel season getting underway, demand for gasoline, coupled with Russian oil shipments cut off due to the war in Ukraine, oil prices are soaring on global markets.\n\nThe US national average for gasoline could be close to $6 later this summer, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said earlier this week about the demand for gas as people hit the road for long-anticipated getaways. “Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations.”\n\nThe highest statewide average has long been in California, where the average stood at $6.43 a gallon in Saturday’s readings. But the pain of higher prices is being felt across the country, not just in California or other high-priced states.\n\nCheap gas hard to find\n\nThat’s partly because the cheapest price wasn’t all that cheap — the $4.47 a gallon average price in Georgia gives it the cheapest statewide average. Less than 300 gas stations out of 130,000 nationwide were charging $4.25 a gallon or less in Friday’s reading from OPIS. For purposes of comparison, before the run-up in prices earlier this year, the record national average for gas had been $4.11, set in July 2008.\n\nAnd even in some states with cheaper gas prices, such as Mississippi, lower average wages mean that drivers there have to work more hours to earn the money needed to fill their tank than drivers in some of the higher priced gas states, such as Washington.\n\nThere are some early signs that people are starting to cut back on their driving in the face of the higher prices, but it’s still a modest decline.\n\nThe number of gallons pumped at stations in the last week of May was down about 5% from the same week a year ago, according to OPIS, even though gas prices have risen more than 50% since then. The number of US trips by car has slipped about 5% since early May, according to mobility research firm Inrix, although those trips are still up about 5% since the start of the year.\n\nThe chief concern is that consumers will cut back on other spending to keep driving which could push an economy already showing signs of weakness into recession.\n\nNumerous reasons for record prices\n\nBeyond the strong demand for gasoline, there is also a supply problem that’s driving up the price of both oil and gasoline. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the sanctions on Russia imposed in the United States and Europe since then is a major factor, since Russia was among the world’s leading oil exporters. But it is only part of the cause.\n\nOil is a commodity traded on global markets. The United States has never imported significant amounts of oil from Russia, but Europe has traditionally been dependent on Russian exports. The EU’s recent decision to ban oil tanker shipments from Russia sent oil prices soaring globally.\n\nThe price of a barrel of crude closed above $120 a barrel Friday, up from just less than $100 a month ago. Goldman Sachs recently predicted the average price for a barrel of Brent crude, the benchmark used for oil traded in Europe, will be $140 a barrel between July and September, up from its prior call of $125 a barrel.\n\nOther factors beyond Russia’s withdrawal from the global market are limiting supply. OPEC and its allies have sharply cut back oil production as demand for oil crashed in the early months of the pandemic, as much of the world’s businesses shut down and people stayed close to home. Global oil futures briefly traded in negative territory due to lack of space to store the glut of oil. Some oil producing nations slashed production in an effort to support prices, and some of that production is back online but not all of it.\n\nUS oil production and refining capacity also have not fully recovered to the pre-pandemic levels. And because prices are even higher in Europe, some US and Canadian refineries that would normally supply the US market with gas are exporting gasoline to Europe.\n\nMany oil companies have been slow to increase production, despite the high price that the oil could fetch, instead using those soaring profits to buy back their own stock in an effort to raise their share price. ExxonMobi has announced it intends to repurchase $30 billion of its stock, more than its total capital spending budget for the year.\n\n– CNN’s Matt Egan and Michelle Watson contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/health/fda-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-authorized/index.html", "title": "FDA authorizes Pfizer and Moderna's updated Covid-19 boosters ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized updated Covid-19 vaccine booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer. This is the first time updated Covid-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization in the United States.\n\nBoth are bivalent vaccines that combine the companies’ original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages.\n\nPfizer’s updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people age 12 and older. Moderna’s updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people age 18 and older.\n\nThe shots can be administered after they’re recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s vaccine advisory group is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to support recommending the boosters for use. Then, the CDC director must sign off on the recommendation.\n\nAn OK from the CDC would mean updated boosters could be administered within days – both to older people who may have received a booster just a few months ago and younger people who haven’t been eligible for an additional booster during the latest wave of cases.\n\nBooster shift\n\nThe updated vaccines do not replace shots for the primary series, but they do replace the booster people older than 12 receive.\n\n“With today’s authorization, the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not authorized as booster doses for individuals 12 years of age and older,” the FDA said.\n\nIndividuals ages 12 and up are eligible for the Pfizer bivalent booster if they have received their primary series and it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. Individuals ages 18 and up are eligible for Moderna boosters on the same schedule.\n\nPeople too young to receive an updated booster can still be boosted with the earlier vaccine.\n\nThe FDA said it will “work quickly” to evaluate future submissions for authorization of bivalent boosters for younger people. Pfizer said in a news release it expects to submit an application for authorization of its updated booster for children ages 5 through 11 in early October, and it’s working to prepare an application for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\n“We want to make sure that adults and the adolescents covered by this authorization are able to get the most up-to-date version of a booster vaccine, and that’s why we are no longer authorizing the monovalent – the original – booster for administration as a booster dose to those populations,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a news briefing.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series – and less than a third of the total population – has also gotten a booster.\n\nThere’s no plan yet to phase out the earlier vaccines used in the primary series, Marks said, but this is a “transitional year,” when people need to make sure they have a “good base upon which we build … which will help protect us against the unknown.”\n\n“If you’ve not yet received a booster dose, or it’s been several months since your last booster dose, now’s the time to consider getting one,” Marks said.\n\nOfficials defend swift authorization\n\nOn Wednesday, FDA officials defended their swift emergency use authorization of the updated Covid vaccine booster. Pfizer and Moderna submitted for authorization last week.\n\n“The public can rest assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these updated boosters meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization,” Marks said.\n\nThe agency has authorized these boosters after studies in mice, but ahead of the results of clinical trials in humans.\n\nThis is similar to the way annual flu vaccines are tested each year, but it’s a first for Covid-19 vaccines. The approach has generated some controversy among vaccine experts. In making the authorization, the agency did not call a new meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, who often weigh in on vaccine changes; the advisory group had offered its insight on updating the original vaccine in meetings over the summer.\n\n“We have been planning for and gathering input on our approach to updated boosters since earlier this year,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said during the news briefing. “The FDA has extensive experience with evaluating strain changes for influenza vaccines and is confident in the data supporting these latest booster authorizations.”\n\nIn addition to the animal data, the FDA said it was basing its decision on more than a year of experience with hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA vaccines given around the globe. They are also relying on human clinical trials of different bivalent vaccines that target the original Omicron strain. That vaccine has been authorized in the UK, but will not be available in the US. More than 1,400 participants were enrolled in clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines against BA.1.\n\nHuman studies of the bivalent boosters, which combine the companies’ original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages, have started, Marks said on Wednesday. Data from those studies is expected in another month or two.\n\nVaccine milestone\n\n“America is the first country in the world that has authorized a bivalent vaccine where the bivalent vaccine targets the viruses out there,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who is leading the White House Covid-19 response, said in a phone interview with CNN on Wednesday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We try to do this every year for the flu. We almost never hit it on the mark. This has taken a lot of work by FDA. It’s been about leaning into the science, leaning into some very good modeling. And then really demanding from the companies that they produce vaccines that are going to be that are going to be matched.”\n\nThe Omicron BA.5 subvariant has dominated transmission in the United States for more than two months. Last week, it caused 89% – nearly 9 out of 10 – new Covid infections in this country, according to the latest estimates from the CDC.\n\nA recent offshoot of the BA.4 variant, BA.4.6, has slowly grown in prevalence to claim second place. Across the country, it caused about 8% of new infections last week, but it has taken off more in the Midwest – Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska – causing an estimated 17% of new infections there.", "authors": ["Naomi Thomas Brenda Goodman", "Naomi Thomas", "Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/14/the-biggest-news-story-every-year-since-1950/40987857/", "title": "From the Korean War to Trump impeachment: The biggest news ...", "text": "John Harrington and Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nEach year there are major news events that capture the world’s attention.

Upon their return to Earth, the three astronauts are put in 21-day quarantine to ensure they did not bring back any lunar contagions.\n\n1970: Vietnam War turns to Cambodia\n\n• Date: April 29\n\n• Location: Eastern Cambodia\n\nAlthough the United States should be scaling back U.S. troop presence in Vietnam, President Richard Nixon approves an operation with the South Vietnamese to invade Cambodia to oust Northern Vietnamese forces there. The Cambodian incursion inflames anti-war protests in the United States as it is perceived to be an escalation of U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia.\n\n1971: Pentagon Papers\n\n• Date: Feb. 8\n\n• Location: Laos\n\nThe Pentagon Papers, a study by the U.S. Department of Defense about the country's involvement in the Vietnam war, are released and published first in The New York Times, then other newspapers. The documents expose several missteps and how several administrations have misled the American public about how involved the military was and about plans to escalate the war in 1964. They also reveal an expanded campaign in Cambodia and Laos, especially clandestine bombing in Laos, which today is considered the heaviest bombardment in history.\n\n1972: Nixon goes to China\n\n• Date: Feb. 21\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nNixon, a virulent anti-communist earlier in his political career, surprises the American public by traveling to Beijing for a week of talks in a historic first step towards normalizing relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Until this trip, the United States and communist China were de facto enemies, fighting proxy wars in the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and South Vietnam at the time of Nixon’s visit.\n\n1973: Roe v. Wade\n\n• Date: Jan. 22\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark 7-2 decision that will be known as Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court rules that under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, abortion is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The court adds that as the pregnancy develops the state can balance a woman’s right to privacy with its interest in preserving the “potentiality of human life.” As a result, states can ban abortion in the third trimester except in cases where a pregnancy affects a woman’s health.\n\n1974: Nixon resigns\n\n• Date: Aug. 8\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon announces his resignation amid impeachment proceedings stemming from the Watergate scandal and the administration’s attempt resist a congressional investigation. The scandal exposes abuses of power by the White House after five burglars were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. Nixon becomes the only president in U.S. history to resign.\n\n1975: Saigon falls\n\n• Date: April 30\n\n• Location: South Vietnam\n\nTwo years after the last American troops left Vietnam, communist troops from North Vietnam capture Saigon, ending nearly two decades of relentless war in the rice paddies and jungles of that Southeast Asian nation. The total number of fatal casualties for the United States is 58,220.\n\n1976: The Concorde changes air travel\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: London and Paris\n\nTwo supersonic Concorde jets take off simultaneously – one from London to Bahrain, operated by British Airways, and the other from Paris to Rio de Janeiro via Dakar in Senegal, operated by Air France – marking the first time paying passengers enjoy commercial travel at faster than the speed of sound. Though travel by one of the 16 Concordes ever put into service could slash travel time from New York to London in half, the high cost of maintenance, soaring ticket prices, as well as a fatal accident in 2000, would seal the fate of the narrow, slope-nosed aircraft.\n\n1977: Rise of the personal computer\n\n• Date: January\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nPersonal home computers began to emerge in the 1970s, but many of the earliest versions resembled calculators that would plug into televisions sets. By 1977, however, the desktop home computer begins to resemble the more modern versions – with an accompanying, attached or separate, computer screen and a magnetic tape or floppy disk storage device. The Commodore PET is unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago that year, while the first Apple II and Radio Shack’s TRS-80 also go on sale.\n\n1978: Cult's mass suicide\n\n• Date: Nov. 18\n\n• Location: Jonestown, Guyana\n\nMore than 900 people die in one of worst recorded acts of cult-related mass murder-suicide as nearly all the victims and perpetrators drink a powdered drink mix laced with cyanide. Most of the victims are Americans, devotees of Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones, a former Methodist-trained preacher who built a following and led the flock to Guyana. Among the dead are 276 children. A small number of cult defectors are killed by Peoples Temple gunmen who also slay Leo Ryan, California Congressman who had gone to Guyana to investigate Jonestown.\n\n1979: Islamic Republic born in Iran\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Tehran\n\nWorsening economic conditions, increasing discontent with the government, and wide support for religious leader in exile Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini end the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The shah and his family flee Iran in January 1979. On Feb. 11, the monarchy is dissolved, and on April 1, Khomeini declares Iran an Islamic republic. With support among the nation’s clergy and their many followers, he begins rebuilding Iranian society based on conservative Shiite religious principles. In November, a mob raids the U.S. embassy, taking more than 60 Americans hostage. The crisis would be influential in the following year's presidential election and would not fully resolve until January 1981.\n\n1980: Reagan elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the United States in an economic malaise and the Iranian hostage crisis hobbling the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan is elected the 40th president in a landslide. Reagan, who would serve two terms, was the oldest man elected president at the time. Reagan’s election changes the trajectory of American politics, ushering in an era of conservative leadership. During his tenure, he takes a more aggressive approach to the Soviet Union and increases defense spending. Reagan convinces Congress to cut taxes, a move that many economists credit with triggering an economic boom in the 1980s.\n\n1981: AIDS impacts America\n\n• Date: June 5\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a report about five gay men who had been diagnosed by local physicians with a rare form of pneumonia – the first reported U.S. cases of what would later become known as HIV/AIDS. The infectious autoimmune disease spreads so fast that by the end of the 1982, 500 Americans would die from what the CDC later calls acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The death toll would rise to 5,000 by 1985.\n\n1982: Mexico triggers regional debt crisis\n\n• Date: Aug 12\n\n• Location: Mexico City\n\nGlobal economic stagnation in the 1970s and early 1980s as well as excessive borrowing among Latin America’s biggest economies boils over when Mexico’s Finance Minister Jesús Silva-Herzog tells the U.S. Federal Reserve his country can no longer service its debt of $80 billion. After the announcement, lenders realize virtually every country in Latin America, led by Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, is not able to pay back loans. The crisis would lead to years of eroding wages, weak to negative economic growth, sky-high unemployment, severe austerity measures, and political instability – known as the “lost decade” in Latin America.\n\n1983: The internet is born\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe internet as we know it today – a seemingly endless collection of websites hosted on servers scattered across the globe – is still more than a decade away. At the beginning of 1983, however, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) – a small network for academics and researchers – transitions to the standard TCP/IP protocol of the World Wide Web. The protocol would become the internet's cornerstone and technical foundation as it allows expanded available address space. The protocol also decentralizes the network, thus also expanding accessibility.\n\n1984: Chemicals kill thousands in India\n\n• Date: Dec. 2\n\n• Location: Bhopal, India\n\nThe chemical disaster in Bhopal is still considered history’s worst industrial disaster. About 30 tons of methyl isocyanate, an industrial gas used to make pesticide, are released at a Union Carbide Corp. plant. About 600,000 poor residents of nearby shanty towns are exposed to a highly toxic compound that kills about 15,000 people and countless farm animals, according to Indian government estimates. The calamity leads to a generation of birth defects. To this day, locals claim the now-abandoned site is riddled with toxic materials left behind by Union Carbide, which was acquired by Dow Chemical in 2001.\n\n1985: Reagan, Gorbachev meet\n\n• Date: Nov. 19\n\n• Location: Geneva\n\nDespite his often bellicose criticisms of the Soviet Union, Reagan agrees to meet with his counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Geneva in the first meeting between leaders of the two Cold War foes in nearly a decade. Though the meeting yields little of substance, it initiates a closer relationship between the two men, who both seem committed to scaling back the nuclear arms race between the two nuclear superpowers.\n\n1986: Chernobyl disaster\n\n• Date: Apr. 26\n\n• Location: Prypyat, Soviet Union\n\nA combination of poor design and human error leads to a power surge in a reactor in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This leads to a massive explosion that puts highly radioactive material into the air. Soviet officials try to cover up the incident, but Swedish scientists notice the increased levels of radioactivity. It takes a little over a week for the radioactive emissions to be contained, but by then radioactive particles had already spread thousands of miles by wind currents to countries as far away as France. A 1,600 square mile area around the plant known as the “exclusion zone” is deemed unsafe, and more than 220,000 people have to be resettled. The radiation causes deformities in nearby livestock and cancer in many people near the blast. Though exact figures are hard to come by, the UN reports years later there were over 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children who were in the affected areas. The Chernobyl disaster is still considered the worst nuclear power failure in history.\n\n1987: Stock market tanks\n\n• Date: Oct. 19\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges 508 points, or more than 22%, on Oct. 19, 1987, later referred to as Black Monday. The drop, in percentage terms, is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\n1988: End of fighting in Iran-Iraq war\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Iraq-Iran border\n\nFrom 1980 to 1988, neighboring Middle East countries Iran and Iraq are engaged in a protracted war. It begins when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launches an attack on Iran in 1980, sensing an opportunity in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iraqi forces initially make incursions into Iranian land, but they lose the area gained in 1982 after Iran is able to mobilize its military and repel the Iraqi forces. Hussein seeks a peace deal that year, but Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini refuses. From 1982 to 1988, the fighting is characterized by sporadic missile launches, attacks on each others’ oil tankers, and the use of chemical weapons, mostly by the Iraqis. By 1988, Iran’s economy is in dire straits, forcing Iran to agree to a UN-brokered ceasefire. The two countries signed an official peace treaty in 1990. Anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million troops were killed in the war and up to 100,000 Kurds.\n\n1989: The Berlin Wall falls\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nCracks in the monolithic Soviet bloc are starting to appear in the 1980s, and the very symbol of communist repression comes crashing down in November, when the Berlin Wall is breached, ending a 28-year division of the city. During the day on Nov. 9, a spokesman for East Berlin’s Communist Party says that starting at midnight that day, citizens of East Germany would be free to cross the country’s borders. Almost immediately Berliners start slamming the wall with axes and sledgehammers. By nightfall, the celebration turns into what one observer calls “the greatest street party in the history of the world,” and the city is reunited. East and West Germany would reunite one year later.\n\n1990: Democracy in Poland\n\n• Date: Jan. 28\n\n• Location: Poland\n\nWith the hold of the Soviet Union and communism on East Europe loosening, Poland's ruling communist party votes to dissolve and become more moderate.

With Saudi Arabia secured, the United States implements Operation Desert Storm to push Iraqi forces back across the border with Kuwait in a military operation that lasts until a ceasefire takes effect in April.\n\n1992: Cold War ends\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Camp David, Maryland\n\nJust weeks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec. 26, 1991, U.S. President George H.W. Bush and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, meet at Camp David to formally declare the end of the Cold War that began shortly after the end of World War II. The meeting comes days after both countries announce they would stop aiming nuclear missiles at each other. Russia declares its 11 former communist satellite republics – from Armenia to Uzbekistan – independent.\n\n1993: The EU becomes reality\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Brussels\n\nThe Treaty of the European Union, also known as the Maastricht Treaty, goes into effect in November, after a rough series of political wrangling. Among other concessions, the treaty allows the U.K. and Denmark to opt out of the common euro currency. The treaty opens the way to removing border controls among member states and invites new members to join the union.\n\n1994: Rwandan genocide\n\n• Date: April-July\n\n• Location: Rwanda\n\nFor decades, Rwanda has been embroiled in a conflict between the country's two major ethnic groups – the Hutu and the Tutsi. Over 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people are killed, mostly Tutsis, but some moderate Hutus as well. When Tutsi militant group eventually gains control of the country, some two million Rwandans flee to nearby African nations. In 2008, three former Rwandan officials are convicted by an international court of organizing the genocide.\n\n1995: Domestic terror strikes Oklahoma\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Oklahoma City\n\nIn the deadliest domestic terrorist attack in U.S. history, anti-government radicals Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. They time the truck-bomb attack for a weekday morning in order to maximize casualties. For the murder of at least 168 people, including 19 children who were in a child-care center in the building, and the injury of hundreds of others, an unremorseful McVeigh is executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. Nichols is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\n'You can do better':Jeff Bezos ripped for $690K Australian wildfire relief donation\n\nCutting the cord:As prices go up, here's how you can still save money streaming\n\n1996: The dawn of cloning\n\n• Date: July 5\n\n• Location: Midlothian, Scotland, U.K.\n\nDolly the Sheep enters the annals of bioengineering when scientists at Scotland’s Roslin Institute become the first to not only successfully clone a mammal, but also the first to do so using an adult cell rather than an embryonic one. After 277 cell fusions that developed 29 embryos, the team manages to turn an udder cell into a virtually identical biological carbon copy of the sheep from which it came.\n\n1997: Machine tops chess champ\n\n• Date: May 11\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning notch a significant victory in 1997, when IBM’s Deep Blue machine defeats a world chess champion.

The catastrophe costs the lives of 88 people, and the fire consumes 18,500 homes and businesses. State and federal officials estimate that it would cost $3 billion to clean up debris. Climate change activists say the conflagrations are evidence that global warming is no longer a distant concern and that it is occurring now.\n\n2019: Trump impeached\n\n• Date: Dec. 18\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2019, Donald Trump becomes just the third U.S. president to be impeached. A whistleblower reveals that in July Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as cybersecurity company Crowdstrike. These requests were made just after Zelensky said Ukraine wanted to buy weapons from the United States. After the call comes to light, Democratic leaders file two articles of impeachment – for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They say Trump abused his power by using the office of the president to target a political opponent. The obstruction of Congress charge stems from accusations that Trump Administration officials tried to cover up the whistleblower’s report. Trump calls the investigation a “witch hunt” and denies any wrongdoing. The House passes both articles in a vote that goes almost entirely along party lines, moving the impeachment proceedings along to the Senate.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Highlights include the works: \"On the Boat,\" \"Boulevard des Capucines,\" \"Grainstack in Sunlight,\" and \"The Japanese Bridge.\"\n\n'Tintoretto 1519-1594' at the Palazzo Ducale in Venice\n\nNov. 1, 2018 - March 31, 2019\n\nTintoretto is considered \"the most Venetian of the Renaissance artists\" thanks to his work in the city’s palaces and churches. All of Venice will celebrate his legacy in 2018, which marks 500 years after his birth. The Doge’s Palace has collaborated with the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Gallerie dell’Accademia di Venezia to open the first Tintoretto exhibit in Venice in several years. The show features 50 signed paintings and 20 drawings by Tintoretto, lent by museums around the world, including the Prado and the Louvre.\n\n'Videogames' at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London\n\nThrough Feb. 24, 2019\n\nIn what’s being billed as “the first exhibition of its kind,” London’s Victoria and Albert museum takes on modern video gaming design and culture since the mid-2000s, when technological advancements changed the field. In the 40 years that video games have been around, they’ve transformed into a way of life for some and today’s designers, players and critics are pushing boundaries. The exhibit features sections on the creative process of developing games (including original prototypes and early character designs), interactive installations (including Minecraft), and a look into the social and political issues related to the hobby.\n\n'Pose and Variations: Sculpture in Paris in the Age of Rodin' at the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, Portugal\n\nOct. 26, 2018 - Feb. 4, 2019\n\nDrawn from its own collections and that of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum has gathered 30 sculptures in an exhibit on the art of the pose in 19-century French sculpture. Auguste Rodin’s work is featured, along with works by Jean-Antoine Houdon, Aimé-Jules Dalou, Paul Dubois, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Edgar Degas and Denys-Pierre Puech. Some of the sculptures focus on standard posing learned in the artists’ early stages of training, while others show them trying to distance themselves from their predecessors and contemporaries.\n\n'Van Gogh to Picasso: The Thannhauser Legacy' at the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain\n\nThrough March 24, 2019\n\nSince its arrival at the Guggenheim in New York City more than 50 years ago, the majority of the renowned Thannhauser Collection has never left New York. Now, nearly 50 works by impressionist, post-impressionist and early modern masters will be shown in Bilbao this fall. This exciting exhibit features paintings, sculptures and works on paper by Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. It also provides an inside look at how the collection came to be through archives documenting the Thannhauser family’s engagement with the famous artists.\n\n'Europe and the Sea' at the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin\n\nThrough Jan. 6, 2019\n\nWith over 43,000 miles of coastline along two oceans and four seas, Europe has proportionally more contact with bodies of water than any other continent. Most Europeans don’t think much of their connection to the sea, but Deutsches Historisches Museum hopes to change that with its exhibit this fall. Through 400 items, including paintings, photographs and artifacts, the exhibit addresses 2,500 years of maritime history, commerce, power, environmental threats, and Europe’s current refugee crisis as many attempt to reach the continent via the Mediterranean.\n\n'Oceania' at the Royal Academy of Arts in London\n\nThrough Dec. 10, 2018\n\nIn honor of its 250th anniversary and that of the year that Captain James Cook set sail on his first expedition to the Pacific, London’s Royal Academy of Arts presents the U.K.’s first major exhibition on the art of Oceania. The show features 200 works – created over the last 500 years – from Micronesia, Polynesia, New Guinea, Easter Island, Hawaii, New Zealand and more. This area represents nearly a third of the world’s surface and is rich in history, ritual and ceremony. Three main themes help organize the exhibit: transportation, settlement and trade.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/03"}]}

The cuts are in addition to a reduction announced last October that infuriated the Biden administration.\n\nThe ministry described the move as a “precautionary measure” aimed at stabilizing the oil market. The cuts represent less than 5% of Saudi Arabia’s average production of 11.5 million barrels per day in 2022.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nIraq said it would reduce production by 211,000 barrels per day, the United Arab Emirates by 144,000, Kuwait by 128,000, Kazakhstan by 78,000, Algeria by 48,000 and Oman by 40,000. The announcements were carried by each country’s state media.\n\nRecession may swamp unemployment systems:Economists expect a recession this year.

Russia had announced the unilateral reduction in February after Western countries imposed price caps.\n\nAll are members of the so-called OPEC+ group of oil exporting countries, which includes the original Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia and other major producers. There was no immediate statement from OPEC itself.\n\nThe cuts announced in October — of some 2 million barrels a day — had come on the eve of U.S. midterm elections in which soaring prices were a major issue. President Joe Biden vowed at the time that there would be “consequences” and Democratic lawmakers called for freezing cooperation with the Saudis.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Saudi Arabia denied any political motives in the dispute, with each saying it was focused on maintaining a healthy market price.\n\nOil prices have been falling\n\nSince those cuts, oil prices have actually trended down. Brent crude, a global benchmark, was trading at around $80 a barrel at the end of last week, down from around $95 a barrel in early October, when the earlier cuts were agreed.\n\nAnalysts Giacomo Romeo and Lloyd Byrne at Jefferies said in a research note that the new cuts should allow for “material” reductions to OPEC inventory earlier than expected and could validate recent warnings from some traders and analysts that demand for oil is weakening.\n\nKristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Gulf expert at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said the Saudis are determined to keep oil prices high enough to fund a raft of ambitious mega-projects linked to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the economy.\n\n“This domestic interest takes precedence in Saudi decision-making over relationships with international partners and is likely to remain a point of friction in U.S.-Saudi relations for the foreseeable future, even without taking into account the Russian dimension,” he said.\n\nU.S.-Saudi alliance faces growing strains\n\nSaudi Arabia’s state-run oil giant Aramco recently announced record profits of $161 billion from last year. Profits rose 46.5% when compared to the company’s 2021 results of $110 billion. Aramco said it hoped to boost production to 13 million barrels a day by 2027.\n\nThe decades-long U.S.-Saudi alliance has come under growing strain in recent years following the 2018 killing of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S.-based journalist, and Saudi Arabia’s disastrous war with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nAs a candidate for president, Biden had vowed to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over the Khashoggi killing, but as oil prices rose after his inauguration he backed off. He visited the kingdom last July in a bid to patch up relations, drawing criticism for sharing a fistbump with Crown Prince Mohammed.\n\nSaudi Arabia has denied siding with Russia in the Ukraine war, even as it has cultivated closer ties with both Moscow and Beijing in recent years, unnerving its longtime allies in Washington.

Some fear this may just be the beginning.\n\nCurrent and former energy officials tell CNN they worry that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the wake of years of underinvestment in the energy sector have sent the world careening into a crisis that will rival or even exceed the oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nUnlike those infamous episodes, this one is not contained to oil.\n\n“Now we have an oil crisis, a gas crisis and an electricity crisis at the same time,” Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency watchdog group, told Der Spiegel in an interview published this week. “This energy crisis is much bigger than the oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s. And it will probably last longer.”\n\nThe global economy has largely been able to withstand surging energy prices so far. But prices could continue to rise to unsustainable levels as Europe attempts to wean itself off Russian oil and, potentially, gas. Supply shortages could lead to some difficult choices in Europe, including rationing.\n\nJoe McMonigle, secretary general of the International Energy Forum, said he agrees with this depressing forecast from the IEA.\n\n“We have a serious problem around the world that I think policymakers are just waking up to. It’s kind of a perfect storm,” McMonigle, whose group serves as a go-between for energy producing and consuming nations, told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nThe extent of that perfect storm – underinvestment, strong demand and supply disruptions from the war – will have wide-reaching consequences, potentially threatening the economic recovery from Covid-19, exacerbating inflation, fueling social unrest and undermining efforts to save the planet from global warming.\n\nBirol warned of supply bottlenecks of gasoline and diesel, especially in Europe, as well as rationing of natural gas next winter in Europe.\n\n“It is a crisis for which the world is woefully unprepared,” said Robert McNally, who served as a top energy adviser to former US President George W. Bush.\n\nNot only are energy prices very high, but the reliability of the power grid is being challenged by extreme temperatures and severe drought. A US power grid regulator warned last month that parts of the country could face electricity shortages and even blackouts this summer.\n\n‘Our fears have borne out’\n\nInside the American struggle with rising energy prices 03:08 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\nFormer Obama energy adviser Jason Bordoff and Harvard University professor Meghan O’Sullivan wrote a piece in the Economist in late March warning that the world was on the cusp of “what may become the worst energy crisis since the 1970s.”\n\n“Since we wrote that, our fears have borne out,” Bordoff, co-founding dean of the Columbia Climate School, told CNN.\n\nOf course, there are key differences between today and the 1970s. Prices have not spiked nearly as much as they did then and policymakers have not resorted to extreme steps like price controls.\n\n“Were we to resort to price controls and price caps, then we could have shortages,” McNally said.\n\nWhen the war started, the West sought to avoid targeting Russia’s energy supplies directly because it was simply too critical to global markets. Russia is not just the world’s largest oil exporter, but it is the biggest natural gas exporter and a major supplier of coal.\n\nBut as the brutality of the war became clear to the world, that hands-off approach did not last, with the United States and other countries banning Russian energy imports.\n\nRussia retaliated against Western sanctions by restricting or even halting its shipment of natural gas to multiple European countries.\n\nThe European Union announced plans this week to phase out 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year. That move has raised the specter of further retaliation from Russia.\n\nThis tit-for-tat situation has only worsened the supply shortfall in energy markets that were already tight.\n\n“We have not yet seen how bad this energy crisis is going to get,” Bordoff said.\n\nAlready, US gasoline prices have surged by 52% over the past year to record highs, angering the public and contributing to the nation’s inflation crisis.\n\nPrices for natural gas, a vital fuel for heating homes and powering the electric grid, have nearly tripled over the past year in the United States. Natural gas prices have skyrocketed even further in Europe, though they are well off their worst levels.\n\n‘Putin just brought us there faster’\n\nToday’s energy turmoil is not simply the result of the war in Ukraine. It is also the byproduct of cratering investment in oil and natural gas, which are depleting resources that require massive sums of money just to maintain their production, let alone increase it.\n\nUpstream investment in the oil and gas sector stood at just $341 billion in 2021, 23% below the pre-Covid level of $525 billion and well below the recent peak in 2014 of $700 billion, according to the IEF.\n\nThis investment shortfall has been brought on by a series of factors, including a push among investors and governments to bet on clean energy, the uncertain future of fossil fuels and years of weak and volatile oil prices.\n\n“Because of the desire to bring down carbon emissions, we have a lot less appetite to invest in hydrocarbons. And that exacerbates the price volatility and makes it more difficult to resolve the supply side,” said Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities at Bank of America.\n\nEurope was already grappling with an energy crisis last year and prices for natural gas, coal and oil were high long before the first Russian tanks began rolling into Ukraine.\n\n“We were heading towards a crisis anyway. Putin just brought us there faster and sharper,” said McNally, who is now the president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nShortages and gas lines?\n\nThe 1973 oil crisis was marked by hours-long lines at gas stations, fuel shortages and panic.\n\nExperts said they worry about fuel shortages again today, although they view that as a greater risk in Europe than in the United States.\n\n“Fuel shortages are a global problem. You’re going to see that very soon, though maybe not in the US,” said Bank of America’s Blanch.\n\nBlanch said he thinks this risk is lower in the United States because the country remains one of the biggest oil producers on the planet and is a major exporter of energy. Europe, on the other hand, is more reliant on foreign oil and natural gas – especially from Russia.\n\nThe IEA chief warned of natural gas rationing in Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russia for gas.\n\nBlanch noted that sky-high natural gas prices have already shut down factories in Europe.\n\n“Europe is already in natural gas rationing mode,” he said.\n\n‘We have to be careful here’\n\nOctopus CEO on renewable energy: Less gas means 'less power and less leverage to Putin' 03:56 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\nEnergy experts told CNN they worry global policymakers are mismanaging the climate crisis, focusing too much on reducing supply and not enough on cutting the world’s appetite for fossil fuels.\n\n“We’re not doing nearly enough to reduce hydrocarbon demand consistent with our climate goals,” said Bordoff.\n\nFocusing on just one side of the equation risks not only price spikes but social unrest and turning the public off to climate action.\n\n“We have to be careful here because if we allow the public to equate high energy prices with the energy transition, we’re doomed,” said McMonigle. “You will essentially lose public support, probably permanently.”\n\nMcMonigle urged governments to send signals to investors that not only is it okay to still invest in fossil fuels, but it’s “necessary” for the world economy and progress in the energy transition.\n\nBut even if policymakers convince investors to ramp up investment, that would take considerable time to result in more supply.\n\nWhat could end the energy crisis\n\nOf course, no one can say with certainty exactly how all of this will play out. And there could be surprises that ease the supply crunch.\n\nFor instance, a diplomatic breakthrough that ends the war in Ukraine and allows sanctions to get lifted from Russia would be a gamechanger.\n\nBirol said other surprises that would ease the energy crisis include an Iranian nuclear deal, a deeper economic slowdown in China or an agreement by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to ramp up oil production.\n\nHe also reiterated that governments stand ready to release further emergency stockpiles of oil. However, even the record-setting release of US emergency stockpiles had just a modest and fleeting impact on gasoline prices.\n\nIn March, the IEA also urged governments around the world to consider drastic steps to slash oil demand, including reducing speed limits on highways, working from home up to three days a week where possible and car-free Sundays in cities.\n\nAnd there’s at least one other development that has been front-and-center lately and would ease the energy crisis: An economic recession, or at least one that’s deep enough to cause demand to collapse.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/business/gas-prices-five-dollars-national-june/index.html", "title": "Average US gas price hits $5 for first time | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFor the first time ever, a gallon of regular gas now costs $5 on average nationwide, according to AAA’s Saturday reading.\n\nThe record is hardly a surprise. Gas prices have been rising steadily for the last eight weeks, and this latest milestone marks the 15th straight day that the AAA reading has hit a record price, and the 32nd time in the last 33 days.\n\nThe national average stood at $4.07 when the current run of price increases began April 15. The current price reading from OPIS represents 23% increase in less than two months.\n\nAnd the rising gasoline prices is doing more than just causing pain at the pump for drivers. They are a major factor in the prices paid by consumers for a full range of goods and services rising at the fastest pace in 40 years, according to the government’s inflation report Friday.\n\nInflation caused consumer confidence to hit a record low on Friday, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. Worries about what the Federal Reserve will do to battle inflation has sent US stocks plunging in recent months, wiping out billions in household wealth.\n\nWhile a $5 national average is new, $5 gas has become unpleasantly common in much of the country.\n\nData from OPIS, which collects the readings from 130,000 US gas stations used to compile the AAA averages, showed that 32% of stations nationwide, nearly one of every three, were already were charging more than $5 a gallon in readings Friday. And about 10% of stations across the nation are charging more than $5.75 a gallon.\n\nThe statewide average was $5 a gallon or more in 21 states plus Washington DC in Saturday’s reading.\n\n$6 gas could be next\n\nAnd gas prices are unlikely to stop there. With the summer travel season getting underway, demand for gasoline, coupled with Russian oil shipments cut off due to the war in Ukraine, oil prices are soaring on global markets.\n\nThe US national average for gasoline could be close to $6 later this summer, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said earlier this week about the demand for gas as people hit the road for long-anticipated getaways. “Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations.”\n\nThe highest statewide average has long been in California, where the average stood at $6.43 a gallon in Saturday’s readings. But the pain of higher prices is being felt across the country, not just in California or other high-priced states.\n\nCheap gas hard to find\n\nThat’s partly because the cheapest price wasn’t all that cheap — the $4.47 a gallon average price in Georgia gives it the cheapest statewide average. Less than 300 gas stations out of 130,000 nationwide were charging $4.25 a gallon or less in Friday’s reading from OPIS. For purposes of comparison, before the run-up in prices earlier this year, the record national average for gas had been $4.11, set in July 2008.\n\nAnd even in some states with cheaper gas prices, such as Mississippi, lower average wages mean that drivers there have to work more hours to earn the money needed to fill their tank than drivers in some of the higher priced gas states, such as Washington.\n\nThere are some early signs that people are starting to cut back on their driving in the face of the higher prices, but it’s still a modest decline.\n\nThe number of gallons pumped at stations in the last week of May was down about 5% from the same week a year ago, according to OPIS, even though gas prices have risen more than 50% since then. The number of US trips by car has slipped about 5% since early May, according to mobility research firm Inrix, although those trips are still up about 5% since the start of the year.\n\nThe chief concern is that consumers will cut back on other spending to keep driving which could push an economy already showing signs of weakness into recession.\n\nNumerous reasons for record prices\n\nBeyond the strong demand for gasoline, there is also a supply problem that’s driving up the price of both oil and gasoline. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the sanctions on Russia imposed in the United States and Europe since then is a major factor, since Russia was among the world’s leading oil exporters. But it is only part of the cause.\n\nOil is a commodity traded on global markets. The United States has never imported significant amounts of oil from Russia, but Europe has traditionally been dependent on Russian exports. The EU’s recent decision to ban oil tanker shipments from Russia sent oil prices soaring globally.\n\nThe price of a barrel of crude closed above $120 a barrel Friday, up from just less than $100 a month ago. Goldman Sachs recently predicted the average price for a barrel of Brent crude, the benchmark used for oil traded in Europe, will be $140 a barrel between July and September, up from its prior call of $125 a barrel.\n\nOther factors beyond Russia’s withdrawal from the global market are limiting supply. OPEC and its allies have sharply cut back oil production as demand for oil crashed in the early months of the pandemic, as much of the world’s businesses shut down and people stayed close to home. Global oil futures briefly traded in negative territory due to lack of space to store the glut of oil. Some oil producing nations slashed production in an effort to support prices, and some of that production is back online but not all of it.\n\nUS oil production and refining capacity also have not fully recovered to the pre-pandemic levels. And because prices are even higher in Europe, some US and Canadian refineries that would normally supply the US market with gas are exporting gasoline to Europe.\n\nMany oil companies have been slow to increase production, despite the high price that the oil could fetch, instead using those soaring profits to buy back their own stock in an effort to raise their share price. ExxonMobi has announced it intends to repurchase $30 billion of its stock, more than its total capital spending budget for the year.\n\n– CNN’s Matt Egan and Michelle Watson contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/energy/german-industry-energy-prices/index.html", "title": "Rocketing energy costs are savaging German industry | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nGermany is bracing itself for a rough winter as soaring energy prices threaten to leave permanent scars on its manufacturing sector, a key engine of its economy.\n\nIndustrial production fell by 0.8% in August from the month before, according preliminary data released by the country’s statistics office on Friday. Supply chain bottlenecks caused by the coronavirus crisis and the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on producers, the office said.\n\nBut energy-intensive sectors, which include chemicals, glass and metals producers, fared even worse, slumping by more than 2% from July.\n\nCarsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, said in a Friday note that an economic contraction was “inevitable” while energy prices remain eye-wateringly high.\n\n“We don’t need a crystal ball to see a further weakening of German industry in the coming months. The full impact of higher energy prices will only be felt in the last months of the year,” he said.\n\nEnergy prices started rising last fall, and then shot even higher when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, sparking an energy standoff between Europe and Moscow.\n\nGermany’s manufacturing industry — which accounts for more than one fifth of the country’s economic output — is worried some of its companies won’t see the crisis through. Many are slashing production, while some are laying off staff and relocating parts of their operations abroad to cope.\n\nFrederick Persson, chief executive for central and eastern European at Prysmian Group, an Italian-owned cables manufacturer, told CNN Business that energy costs were “on a scale that [he had] never seen before.”\n\n“[Energy] has gone from being… a cost among others in the business to be something which has the capacity of basically closing the business down,” he said.\n\nEnergy costs at Prysmian’s six German factories are expected to soar to €20 million ($20 million) this year from just €5 million ($5 million) in 2021. Next year, costs are predicted to hit €35 million ($34 million) — a 600% rise from 2020.\n\nCable drums turn on the conductor and cabling machine at Prysmian cable factory in Schwerin, Germany, in April 2010. Jens Buettner/dpa/Zuma Press\n\nThe company relies on natural gas to power its machines, but wholesale prices in Germany shot up nearly 400% in the year to early September, though have since fallen back, data from the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services shows.\n\nDespite a successful race to fill gas storage facilities ahead of winter — Germany’s stores are currently 93% full, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe — energy costs continue to fuel consumer price inflation, which jumped to 10% in September.\n\nWithout its usual supply of Russian gas, the country is likely to severely deplete its stores over the winter — and continue paying whopping prices next year — even assuming households and businesses manage to slash their consumption, Stefan Schneider, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank Research, said in a report last week.\n\nMarc Schattenberg, a senior economist at the bank, told CNN Business that he expects to see as many as 2 million workers on furlough next spring as their employers battle high prices and shortages of gas. That’s roughly one third of the numbers furloughed at the height of the pandemic in April 2020.\n\nPrysmian has already made permanent cuts to its workforce. Persson said he had laid off about 10% of staff in his region, which covers Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic, over the past three months.\n\nLike other major economies, the prospect of a deep recession in Germany is becoming increasingly likely. That could herald a broader decline in the country’s industrial sector, which employs 7.5 million people.\n\nManufacturing output is predicted to drop by 2.5% this year, and by about 5% in 2023, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\n“We might consider this time as the starting point for an accelerated deindustrialization in Germany,” Eric Heymann, a senior economist at the bank, wrote in the report.\n\nSurviving the winter\n\nCompanies that require vast amounts of energy are scrambling to find ways to stay afloat. Not all are succeeding.\n\nAccording to a survey last month by the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI), two-thirds of paper producers on the continent have cut their production, while just over half have temporarily closed.\n\nPaper-making needs a lot of energy 24/7 to evaporate large quantities of water. Hakle, a toilet paper manufacturer in Germany, blamed soaring energy and material costs for its insolvency last month.\n\nThe headquarters of toilet paper maker Hakle in Duesseldorf, Germany. The company has filed for insolvency. Wolf von Dewitz/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\n“Surviving this winter is going to be a challenge,” Malgosia Rybak, CEPI’s climate and energy director told CNN Business.\n\nMany German manufacturers are small and medium-sized businesses — part of the country’s “Mittelstand” — and are often family-owned and deeply integrated into their communities. They are less able to absorb energy price shocks than industry behemoths.\n\nBut big companies such as Prysmian, one of the world’s largest cable producers, are also struggling. Persson said he has cut production in his region by 5% over the past six months.\n\nThere is help at hand. The German government has so far promised to spend nearly €300 billion ($294 billion) to help millions of households and businesses cope as prices soar. As much as €200 billion ($196 billion) of that support could be funded by government borrowing.\n\nSuch whopping sums have sparked criticism. Claude Turmes, Luxembourg’s energy minister, last week said the giveaways represented an “insane race” by governments to outspend one another.\n\n“There’s a risk that essentially Germany subsidizing its glass industry will kill the Czech glass industry,” Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at Bruegel, told CNN Business.\n\n“If one country can essentially afford to outbid everybody else on the energy market, yes, it’s a problem,” he said.\n\nMoving abroad\n\nGenerous handouts may be causing problems with its EU partners, but Germany believes the heart of its giant economy is at stake. Some manufacturers are already moving parts of their operations abroad.\n\nCompanies have relied on the steady flow of cheap gas from Russia since the 1990s to fuel their factories. That energy source is now “vanishing,” Zachmann said, pushing businesses to find alternate sources, or move energy-intensive activities to other countries.\n\nPrysmian has done just that. At the start of last year, Persson moved the gas-guzzling production of cable conductors from German factories to Hungary and the Czech Republic to save money. He has started to buy parts from Turkey, rather than make them in-house, to cut energy consumption.\n\n“[We are] trying to move away from Germany [for energy-intensive products] for the simple reason that it is very hard for us to sustain the production,” he said.\n\nSimilar pressures can be seen elsewhere in Europe. Germany’s BASF (BASFY) and Norway’s Yara International (YARIY), two chemicals giants, have slashed their production of ammonia — a key ingredient in fertilizer — on the continent due to high gas prices. Yara International (YARIY)’s European ammonia production is running at just 35% of its capacity, company CEO Svein Tore Holseter, told CNN Business.\n\nChemical company BASF's plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany.

Just 3% of companies said they plan to invest in the country, whereas 22% want to shift their investments abroad.\n\nBut some analysts are skeptical about how much damage the current crisis will inflict in the long term.\n\n“Energy-intensive branches [of industry] will relocate as energy prices will structurally stay on higher levels. But, in total, we do not expect a full-blown deindustrialization of the economy,” Stefan Kooths, research director at the Kiehl Institute for the World Economy, told CNN Business.\n\nDeutsche Bank’s Schattenberg is hopeful, and sees the next two years as a period of adjustment.\n\n“German industry, the so-called ‘Mittlestand’, the small and medium [sized] companies, are quite resilient and adaptable,” he said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/politics/climate-deal-joe-manchin/index.html", "title": "Climate deal struck by Manchin, Schumer would be biggest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSen. Joe Manchin’s stunning reversal on a clean energy package has suddenly put Democrats in a position to pass the largest climate investment in US history, and by far the biggest legislative win for the environmental movement since the Clean Air Act.\n\nWednesday night’s surprise resurrection of a deal on $369 billion worth of climate and energy text between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was a turn of events for critical climate measures that have died several times in the past year.\n\nThroughout it all, the package has hung on Manchin’s vote, and the West Virginia Democrat had a strong hand in the climate and energy provisions. His influence is felt in some provisions that promote coal, oil and natural gas – in a package that is ostensibly poised to incentivize renewable energy like solar and wind.\n\nBut despite the concessions on planet-warming fossil fuels, analysis from Schumer’s office suggests the measures would reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030, putting President Joe Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030.\n\nThis package, if approved through the Senate’s reconciliation process and passed by both houses of Congress, would be more than a massive legislative win for Democrats ahead of the midterms; it would help put the US back in a global position to lead on climate alongside the EU.\n\n“By a wide margin, this legislation will be the greatest pro-climate legislation that has ever been passed by Congress,” Schumer said in a statement Wednesday night. The agreement also got a seal of approval from Biden, who called it “historic” in a statement.\n\nClimate groups that despaired about the lack of Congressional climate action were surprised and mostly elated at Manchin’s turnaround on Wednesday night. Some groups are wary of Manchin’s demands on fossil fuels, including a provision that would mandate leasing public land and water for drilling before any could be used for renewable energy.\n\nStill, climate hawks in the Senate seemed ready to vote for the bill whenever it comes to the floor, saying the power of incentives for electric vehicles and renewables was too good to pass up. Schumer said he expects to bring the bill to the Senate floor next week, before lawmakers head home for August recess.\n\nIt’s coming not a moment too soon. Parts of the US, including the Pacific Northwest, are suffering under a punishing heatwave. Earlier this week, St. Louis was inundated with a record amount of rainfall, causing widespread flash flooding and killing at least one person. And more flooding hit Kentucky on Thursday. Just as it is causing global temperatures to rise, the climate crisis also plays a role in extreme rainfall events.\n\nLawmakers and advocates hope the spending package can start to turn the tide on the climate crisis.\n\nMassive cuts to planet-warming emissions\n\nWhen Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill passed last year, climate experts agreed it was the appetizer to big climate action.\n\nThe bipartisan bill had money for electric vehicle charging stations and modernizing the grid, but it didn’t have much in the way of helping US consumers buy electric cars or electric home heating systems. The importance of the new agreement struck by Schumer and Manchin is how it will incentivize American consumers and businesses to pivot toward clean energy.\n\n“The tax credits that help drive renewables onto the system can also help reduce the rates consumers [have] on their electric bill,” Ben King, a senior analyst at nonpartisan think tank Rhodium Group told CNN. “The transition to something like wind or solar helps mitigate against future price spikes like the ones we’re in today.”\n\nThe deal is meant to spur businesses to invest in electricity and power that is lower emissions; the very design of the tax credits is to reward those who reduce their emissions the most, according to a statement from Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden.\n\nThe parts of the new deal that will most directly impact everyday Americans are consumer tax credits that will lower the price tag of energy-efficient appliances and technologies like heat pumps, rooftop solar and electric vehicles.\n\nIt would also extend consumer tax credits for a full decade and extend electric vehicle tax credits. Consumers looking to buy an electric car could get up to $4,000 for a used electric vehicle and $7,500 for a new EV. However, there will be a lower income threshold for people who can use the tax credits – a key demand of Manchin’s.\n\nIt also puts $60 billion toward domestic clean energy manufacturing and $30 billion for a production credit tax credit for wind, solar and battery storage.\n\nSchumer’s office estimated the package would reduce US emissions 40% by 2030. A preliminary independent analysis from Rhodium Group seemed to agree. King told CNN the group’s first-look analysis showed the new deal could “plausibly” hit that goal.\n\nKing told CNN the 10-year clean energy tax credits pack the biggest punch for emissions reductions. Another big piece is funding to keep the country’s aging fleet of nuclear power plants online, continuing to produce electricity with zero-emissions energy.\n\nAnother key piece of the puzzle: the deal will help bring down both the cost of energy and the energy-efficient appliances Americans need to decarbonize their daily lives, King said. The bill promotes the manufacturing and purchase of heat pumps, for instance – home heating and cooling appliances that run on electricity and can replace gas or oil furnaces and separate air conditioning units.\n\n“All those things can combine to help get more heat pumps deployed,” King said. “A heat pump is more energy efficient than something like a furnace. The less electricity you’re consuming, the better off you are.”\n\nA fossil-fuel compromise\n\nThe provision that is giving climate advocates the most heartburn is one that would mandate the Department of Interior must lease at least 2 million acres of public land and 60 million acres of offshore waters for drilling before any could be used for renewable energy.\n\nTying future drilling directly to renewables was described as a “climate suicide pact,” according to Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n“More oil and gas leasing is completely incompatible with maintaining a livable planet, so we’re forced to fight this,” Hartl said in a statement. “This deal is unacceptable.”\n\nBut even among Senate climate hawks, it’s looking unlikely the drilling provision will sink the bill, given the massive investments in clean energy.\n\n“I can say it’s my least favorite part of the bill,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. “But we made a deal with Joe Manchin. And if somebody thought the deal would have nothing for fossil, they don’t understand Joe Manchin. What matters the most are emissions reductions; this bill achieves the emissions reductions that we need to attack the problem of the climate change. In order to get this bill passed, we had to compromise.”\n\nRhodium’s John Larsen told reporters Thursday that his group’s read of the provision is that it will prevent Biden or future presidents from banning new oil and gas leasing on public lands. But Larsen said it’s also not a dramatic expansion of that program.\n\n“It’s not any different than the historic average of lease sales,” Larsen said. “This isn’t some historic expansion of leasing compared to what’s happened over the last five to 10 years.”\n\nLarsen also pointed out that this provision means that administrations have to offer a certain number of lease sales, but doesn’t necessarily mean industry will develop them – especially with higher oil and gas royalty rates being implemented by the Biden administration.\n\nHartl said the Center for Biological Diversity will challenge “every single lease the Interior Department tries to approve” in the future.\n\nUS leadership on climate change\n\nIf Manchin and Schumer’s deal is passed before August recess, it will put the US on surer footing going into the next round of international climate negotiations.\n\nThe UN’s COP27 climate summit is set to take place in Egypt this November, where the US would have had to demonstrate progress toward Biden’s aggressive goal of slashing US emissions in half by 2030. Rhodium found that without the investments in a Congressional bill, the US was roughly on track to cut emissions by 24-35% by 2030, far less than Biden’s vow.\n\nAfter years of climate whiplash – President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris agreement; Biden pulled it back in – congressional investments are needed to put weight behind Biden’s words.\n\nThe congressional action doesn’t get Biden all the way to his goal; that will also take increased environmental regulations by federal agencies and action by individual states. But the federal investment, if passed, is the grease that would get the cogs turning towards clean energy and emissions reductions.\n\n“This could truly put us on the path to avoiding the worst impacts of climate change by cutting climate pollution in half by 2030,” Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for energy and environment policy at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement. “Congress appears ready to put a livable future back within reach at the last possible moment. Now, they need to finish the job and get climate done.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/energy/oil-uae-production-increase/index.html", "title": "Oil prices tumble after UAE says it wants OPEC to increase production", "text": "New York/Abu Dhabi CNN Business —\n\nThe oil market has been stretched incredibly thin, with few producers willing — or able — to replace Russian barrels banned by the United States and shunned by others. Enter the United Arab Emirates, which suggested it may be coming to the rescue.\n\nThe UAE’s ambassador to Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, told CNN Wednesday that the country wants to increase oil production and will encourage the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel to ramp up supply.\n\nOtaiba’s comments sent oil prices dropping like a rock Wednesday. US oil fell 12% to less than $109 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell 13% to $111 a barrel. It marked their steepest one-day decline in nearly two years.\n\nIf the UAE convinces its partners to turn on the spigots, it would mark a turnaround for the cartel, which at its meeting last week with allied producers — a group known as OPEC+ — agreed to stick with a plan of gradually adding oil to the market, defying pressure from developed economies to do more to ease prices.\n\nA key problem for the Saudi-led group: Russia is one of those allied producers.\n\nLast Wednesday, OPEC+ said in a statement that it would increase output by 400,000 barrels per day in April — a small fraction of Russia’s 10 million barrels per day crude oil production. The cartel had called the market “well-balanced,” despite oil prices having shot up 30% in the past two weeks.\n\n“The UAE cracked. They were one of the last holdouts,” Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, told CNN. “Now that they said it, you can expect the Saudis will say the same thing.”\n\nThe Biden administration banned imports of Russia’s crude and natural gas Tuesday, but Europe, which receives a great deal more Russian energy than the United States, has not. Still, sanctions on Russian banks and concerns about the ability to ship its oil have led to a shadow ban on the country’s energy industry, drastically reducing the amount of Russian oil supplied to the global market.\n\nThe West has been hopeful it could add oil from other sources, including from OPEC members Iran and Venezuela.\n\nBefore sanctions were applied on Iran, it produced about 4 million barrels per day. But the United States’ return to a nuclear deal with the country has proven elusive. The United States has also begun discussions with Venezuela, whose crude was sanctioned in 2019. But the economically crippled South American country wasn’t producing much oil even before the ban.\n\nOPEC, by contrast, has the ability to quickly ramp up supply as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have spare production capacity.\n\n“We favor production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels,” Otaiba said.\n\nThe UAE Ministry of Energy has not released a statement, but Otaiba’s comments were subsequently tweeted by the country’s embassy in Washington. It marks the first hint that an OPEC nation may be willing to keep oil prices from rising out of control. Some economists fear that drivers, air travelers and businesses could start to change their purchasing behavior if oil rises much further, potentially damaging the global economy.\n\n“The UAE has been a reliable and responsible supplier of energy to global markets for more than 50 years,” Otaiba said, “and believes that stability in energy markets is critical to the global economy.”\n\nEurope would no longer rely on Russia\n\nThe change in tune from OPEC may come from its sense of a unique opportunity. It could wean Europe off Russian oil and keep them buying OPEC crude.\n\n“The UAE is essentially saying to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, ‘Let’s use our spare capacity so that Europeans no longer have to rely on Russia,’” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Associates.\n\n“This is a 180-degree turnaround,” said Lipow, referring to the market’s interpretation of OPEC’s stance.\n\nLipow added that OPEC leaders are likely remembering what happened in 2008 when oil skyrocketed above $145 a barrel, only to crash months later when the world economy collapsed amid the financial crisis.\n\n“You can turn the world into a recession,” said Lipow.\n\nThe sharp decline in oil prices improves the outlook for prices at the pump. The national average rose to a record $4.25 a gallon on Wednesday, up by a staggering 60 cents in one week, according to AAA.\n\nInstead of hitting $4.50 a gallon, Lipow said current oil prices suggest the national average could top out around $4.35 a gallon.\n\n— CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman Becky Anderson", "David Goldman", "Becky Anderson"], "publish_date": "2022/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/natural-gas-ban-preemptive-laws-gop-climate/index.html", "title": "Cities tried to cut natural gas from new homes. The GOP and gas ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn 2019, the city council in Berkeley, California, held a stunning vote: it would ban natural gas hookups in all new building construction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the city’s impact on the climate crisis.\n\nNo gas furnaces in new homes, the council said. No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law. It’s meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It’s also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric.\n\n“Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline” to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. “The urgency is so great so sometimes we don’t have that luxury in time.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/energy/record-diesel-prices/index.html", "title": "Record diesel prices, tight supplies could be next blow to the US ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nDiesel prices are soaring to record levels, and record low inventories of the fuel in parts of the United States are sparking fears of worse to come.\n\nEven if you’ve never bought a gallon of diesel in your life, as is the case for most US drivers, high diesel prices can hit your wallet— and the US economy — in multiple ways.\n\n“The first way high diesel prices impact the economy is it makes it expensive to ship,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS, which collects gas price data for AAA. “The second way is possible disruptions in the supply chain. None of it is good.”\n\nLeading energy economist Phil Verleger worries that the tight supply could send the average US price of diesel to $10 a gallon by the end of the summer, up from its current record average price of $5.56, according to AAA. Diesel prices that high could put the brakes on the US economy, he said.\n\n“Until the invasion of Ukraine, we’ve never seen anything like this,” Verleger said. “The market is totally distorted. And we’re likely to see much slower economic activity as a result.”\n\nVirtually everything you buy is at some point shipped on a truck that runs on diesel. Trucking companies charge their customers a fuel surcharge when prices rise, raising the cost on whatever they’re delivering. Entire supply chains can be crippled if trucks don’t have the fuel they need to run.\n\nIt’s also critical for use in agriculture. Higher diesel prices could force farmers to scale back plantings or fertilizing, limiting already tight food supplies and driving up food prices beyond the added cost of transportation.\n\n“A lot of truckers just won’t be able to operate,” said Verleger. “If you’re a farmer, you may have to leave some acres fallow, or won’t fertilize as much. The macroeconomists don’t get this. It’s going to come back and haunt us all.”\n\nThe current national average for a gallon of diesel jumped more than 10% in the last month, and is 77% higher than a year ago. Prices in the Northeast are all well over $6 a gallon, and in a half-dozen states in New England as well as New York the prices have more than doubled over the last year.\n\nBy comparison, the national average price for regular gasoline, also at a record high, is $4.42 a gallon, up slightly less than 50% in the same period.\n\nWhy diesel supplies are low and prices sky high\n\nThe reasons for the shortages are varied, but the sanctions and reduced supply of Russian oil because of its invasion of Ukraine have played a major role.\n\nAlthough very little Russian crude oil or diesel came to the US market before the war, Europe is dependent on it. About half the cars in Europe run on diesel, in addition to trucks and freight trains. (Less than 5% of US passenger cars run on diesel.)\n\nThe average price of diesel has soared to between $7.27 and $8.95 a gallon across Western European countries, and it isn’t much cheaper in most of Eastern Europe.\n\nThose high prices have prompted a huge surge in exports of diesel to Europe from US and Canadian refineries that would normally be supplying US truck stops and trucking companies. Exports of US diesel to Europe since the start of April are up 36% compared to the same period a year ago, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nOil refineries are making as much diesel, and similarly expensive jet fuel, as possible with the oil they have, which is driving up the price of gasoline. But there is less US and Canadian refining capacity today than there was before the pandemic, as some refineries closed permanently, and others are being converted to refine renewable fuels rather than crude oil.\n\nDiesel futures prices are more than $1 a gallon below the current spot price, which might provide hope that prices could trend lower in coming months. But that also has discouraged diesel retailers and trucking companies from buying too much on the spot market. And Verleger said the current price of diesel means some companies can’t afford to buy as much supply as in the past due to limits on their credit lines.\n\nAll these factors mean that the supplies of diesel are very tight, particularly in the Northeast, where the EIA said the inventories are at a record low based on data that goes as far back as 1990. Supplies have dropped 36% since the week of February 25, when Russia invaded Ukraine, and are nearly 50% below where they stood a year ago.\n\nTruck stop operators say they’re scrambling to provide the diesel their customers need.\n\nBrad Jenkins, senior vice president of supply and distribution for Pilot Company, which operates more than 750 locations in the US and Canada, said that although diesel inventories are adequate in much of the country, there are “extremely low” inventories in Eastern states. In addition, he said refinery issues are creating tightness in the St. Louis and Indianapolis markets, and that Virginia and Georgia are also experiencing “tight availability.”\n\nLove’s Travel Stops, a chain of more than 500 truck stops across the country, said it has had “minimal outages” of diesel during low traffic hours at its East Coast locations and that it currently has “no plans to restrict purchases of diesel.”\n\nThe diesel shortage so far is manifesting itself in the form of sky high prices, not widespread outages or limits on purchases, said Kloza. “But stay tuned,” he cautioned.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/business/davos-global-economy-imf/index.html", "title": "Davos: IMF warns global economy faces 'biggest test' since WWII ...", "text": "Davos, Switzerland CNN Business —\n\nThe global economy is being brought to the edge of a precipice by crisis upon crisis.\n\nAs the first World Economic Forum to be held in person since 2020 opened in Davos, Switzerland on Monday, the International Monetary Fund said the economy faces “perhaps its biggest test since the Second World War.”\n\n“We face a potential confluence of calamities,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement.\n\nShe warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has “compounded” the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, weighing on the economic recovery and fanning inflation as the cost of food and fuel jumps.\n\nRising interest rates are adding to pressure on countries, companies and households with big piles of debt. Market turbulence and ongoing supply chain constraints also pose a risk.\n\nAnd then there’s climate change.\n\nThe head of the International Energy Agency urged countries to make the right investment choices in response to the fossil fuel shortages triggered by Russia’s attack on Ukraine.\n\n“Some people may well use Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an excuse for … a new wave of fossil fuel investments,” IEA chief Fatih Birol said during a discussion in Davos. “It will forever close the door to reaching our climate targets.”\n\nThe scale of the economic challenge was underscored by a new report from the OECD on Monday, showing that the combined GDP of the G7 countries shrank by 0.1% in the first quarter of the year, compared with the previous three-month period.\n\n“We cannot solve the problems if we focus on only one of the problems,” German economy minister Robert Habeck said. “If none of these problems are solved, I fear, we will see a global recession — with huge implications, not only for the climate, for climate protection, but for global stability.”\n\nTo limit economic stress, the IMF is calling for government officials and business leaders meeting in Davos to discuss lowering trade barriers.\n\nBut as countries battle growing dismay about the cost-of-living crisis at home, some are heading in the opposite direction, implementing restrictions on trade in food and agricultural products that can exacerbate shortages and push up prices globally.\n\nEarlier this month, India’s decision to ban the export of wheat sent the price of the grain soaring, even though it’s a relatively small exporter. Indonesia banned most exports of palm oil in April to protect domestic supplies, but will lift the ban this week.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Tokyo, President Joe Biden said Monday that a recession was not inevitable and he reiterated that the White House was considering removing some Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said do more harm than good for American consumers and businesses.\n\n“The biggest unturned stone the administration has is to lift the Trump tariffs on China. It wouldn’t be huge, but it would be larger than any other option they have,” said Jason Furman, who previously served as President Barack Obama’s top economic adviser.\n\nHe told CNN Business that the United States “is in the least bad shape of any economy in the world.” Consumers are worried about inflation, but they still have a big pot of savings, and spending remains strong.\n\n“I’m more worried about recession risks about one year and further in the future,” he said. “I think the Fed should be trying for a soft landing. I don’t know that they’ll succeed.”\n\nMeanwhile, China could see its economy shrink this quarter because of the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns in Shanghai, Bejiing and dozens of other cities, and the fallout of a real estate crisis.

She has over a decade of experience in EU energy policy. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nAs Russian troops remain camped across several of Ukraine’s frontiers, Europe and the United States are scrambling to prevent an incursion, with a flurry of diplomatic efforts and by bolstering their own troops in nearby NATO countries.\n\nSpeculation over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions have ramped up from mere threats to actual war, but officials and pundits in Europe are jittery about another threat as well: Moscow could reduce – or even stop – the flow of fossil gas that the continent so heavily relies on.\n\nThere has been much talk of what Russia is trying to achieve geopolitically by fostering this reliance – to break up NATO, to split the European Union or alienate the US from its Western allies – but these other concerns are also pressing.\n\nSoaring prices in a power crunch are driving millions of Europeans into energy poverty and the continent’s unfettered use of fossil gas is fueling the climate crisis. The solution should be self-evident – end our reliance on expensive, dirty, and overwhelmingly imported gas. This will require standing up to the powerful gas industry, and right now, far too few politicians seem willing to take this vital step.\n\nThis is by no means the first time Europe’s heavy reliance on Russian gas has been problematic. It was the same story during the last major flare-up with Ukraine in 2014, and Europe’s response – to simply find gas elsewhere – didn’t work then. It isn’t working now either.\n\nIn 2013, Russian imports accounted for around 27% of the European Union’s gas use. Instead of reducing reliance on Russia, nine years later, Europe remains more dependent on Russian gas than ever, with 38% of the EU’s supply now being piped from the country.\n\nEU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson has been holding urgent meetings with Azerbaijan and Qatar to boost the bloc’s gas supplies. Likewise, US President Joe Biden, a self-proclaimed climate champion, has been trying to ride to Europe’s rescue, and push his own ever-expanding plans for American liquefied natural gas exports.\n\nOn a practical level, it’s unlikely the US and its friends would be able to replace Russian gas in Europe quickly and effectively. Recent research by the Brussels-based think tank, Bruegel, concluded that in the event of a rupture in Russian gas, the EU would run short and have to start cutting gas use altogether.\n\nSo, if Europe can’t do without Russia for gas, the question must be asked: Why not do without the gas?\n\nEven if the US could bring a cavalry to Europe, more gas isn’t a long-term solution. The flag on the pipeline or ship is irrelevant – it’s Europe’s dependency on the fuel, regardless of where it’s from, that makes it so vulnerable to the vagaries of the global gas market.\n\nEurope’s addiction to gas, and indeed the world’s, will have a deep impact on the future of our planet. The idea peddled by many in the fossil fuel industry that gas can help tackle the climate crisis by replacing coal is false. The International Energy Agency has said that the world should stop adding more capacity for gas if it wants to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nIn the EU, gas is now responsible for more carbon emissions than coal. According to the European Commission’s own analysis, the continent must virtually eliminate fossil gas by 2050 to help keep global warming to 1.5C, although Global Witness believes it must be gone by 2035. Globally, between 2016 and 2019, fossil gas has been responsible for half of the increase in carbon dioxide emissions, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.\n\nMethane, which can leak from almost every step in the gas supply chain, has more than 80 times the global warming power than carbon-dioxide in the short term. Methane has driven more than a quarter of all global warming to date. Not to mention the health risks attached to gas exposure both for communities near infrastructure and even in homes. A recent study by Stanford University showed, stoves used for cooking often leak methane even when turned off.\n\nIt’s not just followers of geopolitical tensions or those in the climate movement that should be concerned with this gas addiction. A sharp rise in gas prices has forced households across Europe into the impossible choice between heating and eating. In the UK, 22 million have been told their energy bills will rise by about £700 ($950) a year, which will hit the poorest the hardest. Recent, but as yet unpublished, figures crunched by the Global Witness data team found that consumer gas prices in the Netherlands and Estonia over the past year have increased by a staggering 62% and 122%, respectively.\n\nAs European households suffer, it’s a very different picture for major fossil fuel firms. Shell recently announced its most profitable fourth quarter in almost a decade, posting almost $20 billion in profit for 2021. ExxonMobil and Chevron recorded a combined $38.6 billion in profits last year. With other oil and gas majors set to post similarly strong years in the coming days – including Russia’s own Gazprom, which saw record-breaking Q3 profits – it’s a pointer as to just why politicians continue to back gas, despite all its associated woes.\n\nEven with the tide turning against fossil fuels, many European lawmakers seem to continue to buy into the argument that the gas industry is vital for jobs and growth in their countries, even though the renovation and renewables sectors are already significant contributors to the economy with huge potential.\n\nThis is an industry that is directly benefiting from rising gas prices while ordinary citizens fall further into energy poverty and the climate crisis intensifies. It’s therefore no surprise that gas companies are pushing to keep gas locked in, using the two-pronged approach of lobbying and greenwashing. While announcing his company’s highest profits in eight years, the CEO of BP, Bernard Looney, called for even more investment into gas. And it’s clearly having the desired effect.\n\nIn December, the European Commission published its proposals to reform Europe’s gas market, in what could have been an opportunity to move towards the phaseout of gas. Worryingly, it chose to lock gas in for years to come, in line with calls from the gas industry.\n\nThe Commission’s proposals rest on the impossible assumption that fossil gas infrastructure – like pipelines – can eventually be used with substitutes by nascent technologies like hydrogen. In Europe’s existing networks, however, this would do little to reduce gas use, given most hydrogen is produced using fossil gas. There is little being done to challenge the power and influence of the fossil fuel companies at the heart of the gas market.\n\nAnother way is possible, but it requires a monumental shift. The huge political and financial support afforded to the fossil fuel industry needs to be redirected to give a much-needed boost for genuine solutions.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nModeling carried out by the Climate Action Network Europe and the European Environmental Bureau shows that the use of fossil gas could virtually be phased out by 2035. That would require accelerating deep renovations of Europe’s buildings, ramping up the deployment of renewable electricity technologies and the electrification of heating and transportation – all measures that are entirely realistic.\n\nThis includes accelerating the deployment of renewable energy, like wind and solar, so that we can replace gas with green electricity. Schemes to renovate large-scale buildings or to insulate homes and replace gas boilers with green heating solutions, like heat pumps and geothermal, would go a long way.\n\nBut, outrageously, the majority of the EU’s 27 member states still give more subsidies to fossil fuels than renewables.\n\nEurope’s deep gas dependency is impacting its citizens, the future of the planet and limiting its ability to shield from geopolitical threats. Already, rich big polluters in the gas industry – whether in Russia or elsewhere – are the only ones who stand to benefit from the status quo. European leaders should be putting in place plans to get Europe off gas as quickly as possible. This shouldn’t be a courageous act. It’s just common sense.", "authors": ["Tara Connolly"], "publish_date": "2022/02/14"}]}

Provide more support for patients and their families.” The issue is also deeply personal to Biden, as one of his sons, Beau Biden, passed away due to brain cancer. “It’s personal to so many of us.”\n\nBiden also singled out Maurice and Kandice Barron, a pair of guests invited by First Lady Jill Biden. Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far.

It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep.

This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023?

Can Biden get that price for all Americans?\n\nBiden touts legislative victories in infrastructure and manufacturing\n\nBiden championed his series of legislative victories that ranged from tackling the country’s supply chain shortage and sweeping investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\n“We’re gonna make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” Biden said, touting a bipartisan bill he signed that made investments to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\n“To maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world,” said Biden, pointing to the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “Folks, we’re just getting started.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy Bono is at SOTU:Here's why musician, advocate Bono is at Biden's State of the Union address\n\nBiden appeals to middle and working class people on manufacturing\n\nIn an appeal to middle class and working class people, Biden said he ran for president “to make sure the economy works for everyone” so that everyone can have pride in what they do for a living.\n\n“For decades, the middle class was hollowed out,” he said. “Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections.

But they do have something in common. Both are from California.\n\nThat gave them at least one thing to talk about as they stood on the rostrum, waiting for Biden’s speech to begin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden gets a Supreme Court majority for speech, if not policies\n\nAt least for tonight, President Joe Biden landed a majority of the Supreme Court.\n\nFive sitting Supreme Court justices stepped into the House chamber before the president’s remarks: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThat’s a decent turnout for an event some current and former justices have derided as a “political pep rally” and a “childish spectacle.”\n\nWhether the president can cobble together a majority for any of his policies pending at the court – on immigration, student loan debt relief or environmental rules – remains to be seen.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden to get bipartisan escort into House chamber\n\nBiden will be escorted into the House chamber by a bipartisan group of House and Senate officials, including Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nFace masks uncommon as pre-pandemic normality returns\n\nFew lawmakers were wearing face masks as they filed onto the House floor for Biden’s State of the Union speech.\n\nAnd unlike last year, members of Congress were allowed to bring guests, a return to pre-pandemic normality.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden will declare, according to speech excerpts the White House released in advance.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nBiden arrives at Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m. ahead of his 9 p.m. State of the Union speech.\n\n“Great shape, getting better,” Biden said when a reporter asked him, “What’s the state of the union?” before he departed the White House.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n5 big questions for Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nPoll: Republicans want GOP leaders to 'stand up’ to Biden\n\nIf Biden doesn’t find a receptive audience to his call for the two parties to work together, Republican voters could be the reason.\n\nMost Republicans (64%) want GOP congressional leaders to “stand up” to Biden on matters important to GOP, even if that makes it harder to address critical problems facing the country, according to recent polling from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAnd more are concerned that GOP lawmakers won’t focus enough on investigating the administration than the share worried that they will focus too much on investigations.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden approval rating hovering in low 40s ahead of speech\n\nBiden’s second State of the Union address Tuesday comes as he remains under water politically, with more than half of voters disapproving of his job performance, according to most polls.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC poll released this week found 42% of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, while 53% disapprove. That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol. Vice President Kamala Harris arrived ahead of him along with the majority of his Cabinet.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nPaul Pelosi arrives at State of the Union\n\nPaul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived at the State of the Union about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThis marks his first visit to a joint session of Congress since a video release of a brutal October attack that left him with head and hand injuries requiring surgery.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nLawmakers arrive for State of the Union\n\nIf handshakes across the aisle are any reliable indication, there was a hint of bipartisanship in the air as lawmakers arrived for President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union before a divided Congress.\n\nThere was also the smell of cigars in the House gallery hallways on the third floor, a sign of the changing guard and new House rules.\n\nSeveral guests and congresswomen were wearing white, as a nod to the suffragettes. That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit/index.html", "title": "Pelosi expected to visit Taiwan, Taiwanese and US officials say ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to visit Taiwan as part of her tour of Asia, according to a senior Taiwanese government official and a US official, despite warnings from Biden administration officials, who are worried about China’s response to such a high-profile visit.\n\nThe stop – the first for a US House speaker in 25 years – is not currently on Pelosi’s public itinerary and comes at a time when US-China relations are already at a low point.\n\nThe Taiwanese official added that she is expected to stay in Taiwan overnight.

China will take resolute responses and strong countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters, when asked about the fallout from Pelosi leading a congressional delegation to Taipei.\n\n“As for what measures, if she dares to go, then let’s wait and see,” Zhao added.\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, meeting with Malaysian politicians on August 2.

There is no reason for the Chinese rhetoric. There is no reason for any actions to be taken. It is not uncommon for congressional leaders to travel to Taiwan,” Kirby told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day.”\n\n“We shouldn’t be as a country – we shouldn’t be intimidated by that rhetoric or those potential actions. This is an important trip for the speaker to be on and we’re going to do whatever we can to support her,” Kirby continued.\n\nAsked if the US was prepared for fallout with China over the visit, Kirby said that “there is no change to our policy. No change to our focus on trying to keep a free and safe and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left, and Singapore President Halimah Yacob shake hands at the Istana Presidential Palace in Singapore, Monday, Aug. 1. Mohd Fyrol/Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information/AP\n\nThe issue of Taiwan remains one of the most contentious. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed it at length in a two-hour-and-17-minute phone call on Thursday, as tensions mounted between Washington and Beijing.\n\n“The question of Taiwan is the most sensitive, important core issue in China-US relations,” said Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang at the Aspen Security Forum in July.\n\nWhile Biden has said publicly the US military did not believe it was a good time Pelosi to visit Taiwan, he has stopped short of telling her directly not to go, according to two sources.\n\nAdministration officials have worked over recent weeks to apprise the House speaker of the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island of 24 million residents, including in briefings from Pentagon and other administration officials. But Biden did not believe it was his place to tell her she should not go, and he has avoided commenting publicly about her trip since his initial statement on July 21.\n\nCNN Beijing bureau chief on why the timing of Biden-Xi call is critical 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden said last month that the US military opposed Pelosi visiting Taiwan, though since then has refused to elaborate on the warnings. The White House has said it is up to the House speaker where she travels.\n\nStill, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently said he’d discussed a visit to Asia with Pelosi.\n\nThe administration takes extra care for Pelosi’s security when she travels overseas because she is in the presidential line of succession.\n\nAdministration officials are concerned Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nOfficials also believe the Chinese leadership doesn’t completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi’s potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi’s visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.\n\nWhy one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58 - Source: CNN\n\nPelosi has long been a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a black-and-white banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre, which said, “To those who died for democracy.” In recent years, she voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Chinese embassy to the United States has objected to her expected trip, which was planned for April before Pelosi tested positive for Covid-19, urging members of Congress to tell the speaker not to make it.\n\n“I would say there’s been a full-court press from the Chinese embassy to discourage a trip to Taiwan,” Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, the co-chair of Congress’ US-China working group, told CNN. “I just don’t think it’s their business to tell us what we ought to be doing. That was my message back.”\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the US, responded that his office is in “regular contact” with members of Congress, including Larsen.\n\n“On the Taiwan question, we have made our stance loud and clear,” Pengyu said. “The Embassy is making all our efforts to prevent the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the stability of China-US relations being damaged by the potential visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.”\n\n“We hope serious consequences could be avoided,” he added. “This is in the common interests of both China and the US.”\n\nMany Democrats and Republicans in Congress said it was Pelosi’s right to travel to Taiwan.\n\n“It is Speaker Pelosi’s decision alone on whether or not to travel to Taiwan, not any other country,” said Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood, Larsen’s Republican counterpart on the US-China working group. “In our democratic system – we operate with separate but equal branches of government.”\n\n“It is inappropriate for foreign governments, including the Chinese government, to attempt to influence the ability or the right to travel for the speaker, members of Congress, or other US government officials to Taiwan or anywhere else around the world,” he added.\n\nOther members appeared to be more cautious about the diplomatically sensitive trip.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, said she has “always supported Taiwan.”\n\nBut when asked whether a Taiwan trip now would send the wrong message, Chu said, “You could look at it two ways. One is that the relationships are very strained right now. But on the other hand, you could say maybe that’s when Taiwan also needs to be shown the strength and the support.”\n\nWhen asked what she thought, she said, “I leave it up to those who are going to make that decision.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Monday.", "authors": ["Eric Cheung Kylie Atwood Alex Rogers Kevin Liptak", "Eric Cheung", "Kylie Atwood", "Alex Rogers", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/southwest-airlines-service-meltdown/index.html", "title": "Flight cancellations: Why Southwest Airlines is melting down | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nA punishing winter storm that dumped multiple feet of snow across much of America led to widespread flight cancellations over the Christmas holiday. By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nA lack of tools\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/03/pence-documents-live-updates/11170329002/", "title": "FBI eyes Pence locations search, Southwest COO to testify: recap", "text": "Former Vice President Mike Pence's Indiana home and a Washington, D.C. office may soon be searched for additional classified records.

Wade was overturned, Americans are more dissatisfied with abortion policies in the U.S. than at any other point in Gallup’s 23-year-trend.\n\nA record high of 69% of American adults are dissatisfied with abortion laws according to a Gallup poll, while only 26% are satisfied. Of the 69% who are dissatisfied, 46% want less strict laws compared to 15% who want more strict laws.\n\nHalf of the women surveyed are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws and want less strict laws, an 18-percentage point increase over the past year. Meanwhile, 41% of men were dissatisfied and favored less strict laws, a 13-percentage point increase, over the past year.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Jan. 2 through Jan. 22, 2023 and is a reflection of how the public has responded to the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v.

I sure hope so. I mean it,\" Biden said, speaking Thursday at the University of Tampa in Florida.\n\nRepublicans booed and jeered Biden during the State of the Union when he accused them of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, pointing to a proposal by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to sunset all federal programs every five years. The White House believes the moment backed Republicans – who have pushed unspecified spending cuts during debt ceiling talks – into a corner.\n\n“I know that a lot of Republicans' dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare. Well, let me say this. If that's your dream, I'm your nightmare,” Biden said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMore:Hunter Biden, White House, House GOP clash over widening investigation of Joe Biden's son\n\n'It's time for him to go': Democrats introduce resolution to expel Santos\n\nRep.

Steven McCraw said.\n\nThe gunman was killed more than an hour after he started shooting inside Robb Elementary School. Members of a specialized Border Patrol unit had entered the classroom, with one holding a shield followed by at least two others who engaged the shooter, according to a US Customs and Border Protection official.\n\nThe gunman is believed to have waited for the agents to enter the room, then kicked open the closet door and began shooting, the source said.\n\nThe agents had used a key to get into the classroom, opening the door while standing off to the side since the gunman had been shooting through the door, the source said.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the detail on the gunman emerging from the classroom closet.\n\nThe timeline of events that were part of the law enforcement response became more clear and more disturbing to the victims’ families Friday as McCraw explained the school district police chief was the incident commander who made the decision not to breach the classroom door.\n\nYet as officers stood in the hallway, children inside Robb Elementary School classrooms 111 and 112 in Uvalde repeatedly called 911 and pleaded for help, he said. They were in the middle of the deadliest school shooting since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\n\n“From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course it was not the right decision,” McCraw said of the supervisor’s call not to confront the shooter. “It was the wrong decision. Period. There’s no excuse for that.”\n\nLATEST UPDATES ON THE UVALDE SCHOOL SHOOTING\n\nThe official who was the school district police chief, Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, officials said Friday.\n\nArredondo has nearly three decades of law enforcement experience, according to the school district, and was recently elected to a seat on Uvalde’s city council. He previously served as a captain at a school district police department in Laredo, Texas, and in multiple roles at the Uvalde Police Department.\n\nArredondo has not spoken about the shooting publicly since two very brief press statements on the day of the tragedy. CNN attempted to reach him at his home on Friday, but there was no response.\n\nIn all, 80 minutes passed between when officers were first called to the school at 11:30 a.m. to when a tactical team entered locked classrooms and killed the gunman at 12:50 p.m., McCraw said. The tactical team was able to enter using keys from a janitor, he added.\n\nWithin that period, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos killed 19 children and two teachers – marking at least the 30th shooting at a K-12 school in 2022. And while, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said, the massacre could have been worse, the law enforcement response suggests it could have been better.\n\nThe delayed response runs contrary to commonly taught active shooter protocol, established after the Columbine school shooting of 1999, to stop the shooter as quickly as possible and even bypass helping the injured. The revelations also help explain why officials have offered contradictory information over the past three days as to what law enforcement did in response.\n\n“The levels of failure are just incredible, beyond belief,” said Anthony Barksdale, the former acting Baltimore police commissioner.\n\nAlfred Garza, the father of 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza, who was killed in the attack, said he believes someone should be held accountable for the delayed response.\n\n“They should have reacted quicker, faster,” he said. “Had they done that? You know, maybe we would have a different result.”\n\nGovernor livid over misinformation\n\nGov. Abbott told reporters Friday he was misled by authorities the day after the shooting, and he is livid.\n\nAbbott said he took careful notes from his briefing on Wednesday, calling what he told the public “a recitation of what people in that room told me.” He added, “As everybody has learned, the information that I was given turned out, in part, to be inaccurate, and I’m absolutely livid about that.”\n\nThe governor was in Uvalde for a news conference about the state response for the families of those affected by the shooting, but reporters pressed Abbott on the law enforcement response and the information given to the public about the shooting.\n\n“My expectation is the law enforcement leaders that are leading the investigations … they get to the bottom of every fact with absolute certainty,” he said.\n\nAbbott said the people who deserve accurate answers the most are the families whose “lives have been destroyed.”\n\n“It is inexcusable that they may have suffered from any inaccurate information whatsoever,” he said.\n\nSchool back door had been propped open\n\nThe area around the Robb Elementary School signs has become a memorial dedicated to the victims of the May 24 mass shooting.

That 911 call came at 11:30 a.m.\n\nThe gunman then moved toward the school parking lot and began shooting into classroom windows, McCraw said. A school resource officer, who was not on campus at the time, heard the 911 call and rushed to the school but drove past the suspect, who was hunkered down behind a vehicle, McCraw said.\n\nThe suspect then entered the school via the propped door at 11:33 a.m. and went to the adjoining classrooms 111 and 112, where he continued shooting, McCraw said.\n\nTwo minutes later, seven officers arrived to the school and approached the locked classrooms where the gunman had barricaded himself. Two of the officers were shot by the suspect from behind the door and suffered graze wounds, McCraw said.\n\nThe gunman fired 16 more rounds inside the locked classrooms between 11:37 and 11:44 a.m., and more officers continued to arrive to the hallway, McCraw said.\n\nAt about the same time, the Robb Elementary School posted on its Facebook that the school was on lockdown due to gunshots in the area. Outside the school, distraught parents soon began to arrive, desperate to know whether their kids were still alive, leading to confrontations with police trying to set up a perimeter.\n\nInside the school, there were as many as 19 law enforcement officers in the hallway at 12:03 p.m., yet they remained outside and waited for further tactical team and equipment, McGraw said.\n\nThat very minute, at 12:03 p.m., police received a 911 call from a girl who identified herself and whispered she’s in Room 112, McCraw said. She stayed on the phone for 1 minute, 23 seconds. At 12:10 p.m. she called back and said there were multiple people dead. She called again three minutes later.\n\nMembers of the Border Patrol tactical team, known as BORTAC, arrived with shields at 12:15 p.m. There they waited.\n\nThe girl called again at 12:16 p.m. and said there were eight to nine students alive, McGraw said. Another student called 911 from Room 111 three minutes later but hung up at the urging of another student. On a 911 call at 12:21 p.m., three shots can be heard, he said.\n\nThe gunman had fired over 100 rounds in the first minutes of the shooting, but the gunfire after that was sporadic and aimed at the door, McCraw said.\n\n“The belief was that there may not be anybody living anymore and that the subject has now tried to keep law enforcement at bay or entice them to come in to (die by) suicide,” he said.\n\nA female student called 911 at 12:36 p.m. that lasted for 21 seconds, but then called back and was told to stay on the line and remain quiet. At 12:43 p.m. and 12:47 p.m. she asked 911 to please send police now.\n\nFinally, at 12:50 p.m., the tactical team entered the room and shot and killed the suspect.\n\nSurviving children describe what happened inside\n\n10-year-old survivor says 'almost all' of his friends died in the shooting 02:42 - Source: CNN\n\nChildren who survived the shooting described what happened inside the school during the mayhem.\n\nTo survive the nightmare, Miah Cerrillo, 11, smeared her friend’s blood all over herself and played dead, she told CNN.\n\nMiah and her classmates were watching the movie “Lilo and Stitch” when teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia got word of a shooter in the building. One teacher went to lock the door, but the shooter was right there – and shot out the door’s window, Miah said.\n\nAs her teacher backed into the classroom, the gunman followed. He then looked a teacher in the eye, said “Goodnight,” and shot her, the girl recalled.\n\nAnd then he opened fire, shooting the other teacher and many of Miah’s friends. Bullets flew by her, Miah said, and fragments hit her shoulders and head. The gunman next went through a door into an adjoining classroom. Miah heard screams and more gunshots. When the firing stopped, the shooter started playing music that was “sad, like you want people to die,” the girl said.\n\nScared he would come back to kill her and her few surviving friends, Miah put her hands into the blood of a slain friend lying next to her and smeared herself with it, she said. The girl and a friend managed to grab a dead teacher’s phone and call 911 for help, she said. She told a dispatcher, “Please send help because we’re in trouble.”\n\nThe pair then lay down and played dead.\n\nAnother student in a different classroom, 10-year-old Jayden Perez, said when he and his classmates heard gunfire, his teacher locked the door and told them to “hide and be quiet.”\n\nJayden said he was hiding near the storage area for backpacks during the shooting. Others in his class were under a table. The entire time, he wondered what was going to happen to them.\n\n“It was very terrifying because I never thought that was going to happen,” he told CNN. “(I’m) still sad about some of my friends that died.”\n\nHe does not want to go back to school again.\n\n“No, because after what happened. I don’t want to. I don’t want anything to do with another shooting or me in the school,” he said. “And I know it might happen again, probably.”\n\nParents outside school begged for action\n\nParents seen frustrated with police at shooting scene in new video 06:08 - Source: CNN\n\nOutside the school, chaos and confusion reigned as distraught parents showed up and implored law enforcement to force their way in and kill the gunman. One father even asked officers to give him their gear, he said.\n\n“I told one of the officers myself, if they didn’t want to go in there, let me borrow his gun and a vest, and I’ll go in there myself to handle it. And they told me no,” Victor Luna told CNN. His son survived.\n\nInstead, officers held parents behind yellow police tape, refusing to let them enter as crying and screaming echoed around them, several videos show.\n\nMembers of the US Marshals Service can be seen in one video holding back parents who pleaded to enter the school. US Marshals said in a statement they were called to the school at 11:30 a.m. and arrived about 40 minutes later from Del Rio, about 70 miles away.\n\nThe first deputy US Marshals to arrive entered the school to assist the Border Patrol tactical team already engaging with the shooter. The deputies also rendered aid to victims. Other deputies were asked to secure the perimeter around the school, but never arrested or placed anyone in handcuffs, the agency said.\n\n“Our deputy marshals maintained order and peace in the midst of the grief-stricken community that was gathering around the school,” the agency said.\n\nUvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez issued a statement Thursday defending his officers’ response to the shooting amid the growing criticism.\n\n“It is important for our community to know that our officers responded within minutes” alongside school resource officers, he said.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez Eric Levenson Virginia Langmaid Shimon Prokupecz Nora Neus", "Priscilla Alvarez", "Eric Levenson", "Virginia Langmaid", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Nora Neus"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/asia/imran-khan-pakistan-rally-intl/index.html", "title": "Imran Khan: Pakistani ex-Prime Minister shot in lower leg in ...", "text": "Islamabad, Pakistan CNN —\n\nPakistan’s ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan has survived a shooting at a political rally on Thursday that his party called an assassination attempt, which killed one person and injured several others and prompted protests among Khan’s supporters.\n\nVideo of the alleged attack shows Khan waving from an open-topped truck just outside the town of Gujranwala, Punjab province, when shots rang out, sending his party members ducking for cover.\n\nA bullet hit Khan in the leg, said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) senior leader Asad Umar, who later added: “Yes, he has been shot, there are pellets lodged in his leg, his bone has been chipped, he has also been shot in his thigh.”\n\nKhan was taken from the rally site to receive treatment in Lahore, around a two-and-a-half-hour drive away, and was in a stable condition, Umar added.\n\nA man suspected of firing shots at the rally was detained on Thursday, according to police. The suspect was arrested with a 9mm pistol and two empty magazines, police said.\n\nOn Thursday, Pakistan’s Ministry of Information released a video of a confession from an unnamed man who it claims carried out the attack.\n\nIn the video, the man says he “wanted to kill Imran Khan” because he “was misleading people,” adding he had no accomplices.\n\n“They (Khan’s rallies) were playing music and shouting from the loudspeakers as the call for prayer was happening. I didn’t like this happening on our soil,” the man says in the video, purportedly regarding his intentions.\n\nCNN cannot verify the circumstances under which the video was taken and is therefore not showing it.\n\nAt least one person was killed in the incident, according to Faisal Javed, a senior PTI politician and close Khan ally who received a wound to the head in the attack. The victim’s name has not been released.\n\nIn a video statement Javed, who can be seen sitting up while receiving treatment, said: “Please pray for us, for Imran Khan, pray for our fellow workers who are severely injured and pray for our party member who has died and is martyred.”\n\nEarlier Thursday, Sen. Fawad Chaudhry, a senior PTI politician and Khan’s former information minister, said Khan was undergoing surgery and six others were injured and still being treated.\n\n“We want to know who is behind the incident, which people trained the accused, what is the thinking under which this boy was prepared, how much money he got, where did he get it from,” the Chief Minister of Punjab province, Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, wrote on Twitter.\n\nKhan’s long march\n\nKhan was on the seventh day of a nationwide tour, during which he has held rallies calling for early elections to be held before next August. The so-called “long march” started in Lahore on October 28 and was due to finish in Islamabad after winding through several Pakistani cities.\n\nIt’s among a number of rallies the former Pakistani cricket caption has held since his dramatic ouster as Prime Minister in a no-confidence vote in April. During that time, he’s repeatedly claimed, without any evidence, that the United States was behind his loss of power.\n\nHis claims have struck a chord with a young population in a country where anti-American sentiment runs high, and where the rising cost of living has fueled anti-establishment feelings.\n\nAfter the shooting, protests broke out across Pakistan on Thursday in support of Khan, including in Islamabad and Peshawar, where approximately 800 protesters gathered. They blocked roads for about two hours while holding party flags and chanting slogans against the army and the federal government.\n\nVideo shows rally where Imran Khan was shot 02:07 - Source: CNN\n\nSeveral PTI politicians addressed the crowd, including provincial assembly member Fazal Elahi, who said the attack was part of a conspiracy against the PTI leadership.\n\n“Today we held a peaceful protest which would continue in the future as well,” Elahi said.\n\nPolitical tensions increase\n\nThursday’s shooting is likely to further inflame an already tense situation between Khan and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who led the campaign to remove him from office.\n\nKhan alleges that Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and a senior intelligence official, Maj. Gen. Faisal Naseer, were behind Thursday’s attack.\n\nKhan made the accusations in a statement shared by PTI senior leader Umar, who said he recently spoke to Khan.\n\n“I was getting information that this was going to happen from beforehand,” Khan said, according to Umar. “These men need to be removed from their posts, if they are not removed then there will be protests.”\n\nSanaullah called Khan’s allegations “grievous” during a televised address on Thursday.\n\n“Imran Khan has blamed me, the PM and a senior officer. This is such a grievous statement,” Sanaullah said. “It happened in the province where Imran Khan’s party is in government,” he said.\n\n“I commend the PTI worker who caught the man who tried to shoot Imran Khan. I commend the police and the man who stopped the attacker. There has been an atmosphere that all political etiquette has been ignored.”\n\nSharif, however, condemned Thursday’s attack on his political rival on Twitter.\n\n“I condemn the incident of firing on PTI Chairman Imran Khan in the strongest words,” Sharif wrote, adding that he has asked for an “immediate report on the incident” and will pray for the recovery of those injured.\n\n“Violence should have no place in our country’s politics,” Sharif wrote.\n\nOn October 21, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) recommended that Khan be disqualified from holding political office for five years, a move likely to exacerbate political tensions in the country.\n\nWhile reading out the recommendation, ECP chief Sikandar Sultan Raja stated that Khan was disqualified for being involved in “corrupt practices.”\n\nThe commission said its decision was based on the grounds that Khan had “made false statements” regarding the declaration of the sale of gifts sent to him by the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Dubai while in office – an offense that is illegal under the country’s constitution.\n\nThis is not the first time that Pakistani politicians have been attacked.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated on December 27, 2007, and then Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani survived an assassination attempt in 2008.\n\nOn Thursday, the US condemned the attack on the former prime minister. “The United States strongly condemns the attack on Imran Khan and his supporters and hopes for the swift recovery of all who were injured. Violence has no place in politics,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to New Mexico.\n\n“We call on all parties to remain peaceful and refrain from violence.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story contained an old photo of Imran Khan erroneously distributed by the Associated Press.

Then just shy of the US-Mexican border, it will turn westward – away from the coast – as it makes the closest pass to Southern California for a hurricane since 1997’s Hurricane Nora.\n\nA turn to the west is expected by Saturday night, the hurricane center said.\n\nWinds could gust to more than 60 mph as the system interacts with Southern California’s mountainous terrain. And those winds will be coming from the east, which means they will have a warming effect on coastal cities; as air travels down mountains, it is compressed and its temperature rises.\n\nIt will be similar to the Santa Ana wind phenomenon, which typically occurs in the fall and winter. “We are not calling it Santa Ana winds, but they will have characteristics of them as they pass through canyons and the sloped terrain,” Maxwell told CNN.\n\nThe warm, dry winds from the east will increase the region’s already considerable fire risk. Temperatures could reach 100 degrees Friday in coastal parts of San Diego and Orange counties.\n\n“This happened in 1984 as a Category 1 Hurricane Marie well southwest of San Diego County forced temperatures to reach 100 in San Diego,” Maxwell said.\n\nLows could remain in the 80s overnight Thursday and into Friday morning, making sleeping uncomfortable, especially for those without air conditioning.\n\nThen, the relentless heat will “end abruptly and unusually” late Friday, weather service in Los Angeles said, as the tropical system’s cloud cover and rainfall move in, drastically reducing temperatures but creating new hazards: heavy rainfall and a flash flood threat.\n\nA year’s worth of rain to parts of Southern California\n\nEven as the Southwest has been mired in a multi-year megadrought, Kay’s rainfall could pose a significant flood danger.\n\n“A Moderate risk for Excessive Rainfall is in effect for portions of Southern California this weekend,” the Weather Prediction Center said Thursday evening. “While Hurricane Kay is not forecast to make landfall in California, associated rainfall will likely still impact the region, with localized regions of heavy rainfall possible.”\n\nModels suggest moisture over this normally dry area will be well above the 99th percentile for this time of year going into the weekend.\n\nEven though rainfall is desperately needed across parched Southern California, this much rain over a short period can cause creeks and rivers to rise rapidly.\n\n“It’s never a good thing to get too much rain all at once, a trait all too common among slow-moving tropical storms,” the prediction center said earlier. “Thus, the flash flood potential is summarily also rapidly increasing.”\n\nRainfall of 2 to 4 inches, possibly up to around 8 inches, is expected throughout the mountainous terrain of Southern California, especially on the eastern slopes.\n\nA warning of moderate risk of excessive rainfall – Level 3 of 4 – is in effect for Friday over portions of Southern California and far southwest Arizona, with a slight risk – Level 2 of 4 – in effect by Saturday across more of Southern California, western Arizona and far southern Nevada.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecasts 2 to 4 inches of rain over 36 hours Friday and Saturday at Imperial County Airport in southeastern California; the spot gets 2.38 inches of rain on average each year. If Imperial receives more than 3 inches of rain, it would make this month its wettest September, breaking a record set in 1976.\n\nThe Imperial Valley region is home to one of the nation’s most productive farm belts, especially known for producing winter vegetables for US consumers due to its year-round growing season. The area and nearby regions including Yuma, Arizona, have been dealing with long-term drought and are in contentious negotiations about reducing their hefty water supply from the Colorado River.\n\nIn Palm Springs, California, 2 to 4 inches is forecast through the weekend, pushing toward the typical annual rainfall tally of 4.61 inches. Three inches in Palm Springs would put this month in the top three wettest Septembers for the city and make it the wettest since 1976, when it got 4.17 inches; its average September rainfall is 0.24 inches.\n\nYuma could see 1.5 inches of rain through the weekend, which would make this month the wettest September there since 2009. The city’s average September rainfall is 0.68 inches.", "authors": ["Derek Van Dam Judson Jones Allison Chinchar Monica Garrett", "Derek Van Dam", "Judson Jones", "Allison Chinchar", "Monica Garrett"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/politics/biden-taiwan-china-japan-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Biden says US would respond 'militarily' if China attacked Taiwan ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Monday that the United States would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force, a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by Washington.\n\nThe White House quickly downplayed the comments, saying they don’t reflect a change in US policy. It’s the third time in recent months – including during a CNN town hall in October – that Biden has said the US would protect Taiwan from a Chinese attack, only to have the White House walk back those remarks.\n\nDuring a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, Biden was asked if the US would be willing to go further to help Taiwan in the event of an invasion than it did with Ukraine.\n\n“You didn’t want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?” a reporter asked.\n\n“Yes,” Biden replied. “That’s the commitment we made.”\n\n“We agree with the One China policy. We signed on to it, and all the attendant agreements made from there, but the idea that it can be taken by force, just taken by force, is (just not) appropriate,” he said.\n\nUnder the “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. The US provides Taiwan defensive weapons, but has remained intentionally ambiguous on whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack.\n\nBiden's balancing act amid tensions between mainland China and Taiwan 02:41 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden’s strong warning was made right on China’s doorstep during his first trip to Asia as President. The visit is aimed at uniting allies and partners to counter China’s rising influence. It also came a day before Biden is scheduled to attend the second in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) – an informal grouping between the US, Japan, Australia and India that has alarmed Beijing.\n\nSeveral of Biden’s top administration officials were caught off-guard by the remarks, several aides told CNN, adding that they were not expecting Biden to be so unequivocal.\n\nIn a statement following Biden’s comments, a White House official said the US’ official position remained unchanged.\n\n“As the President said, our policy has not changed. He reiterated our One China policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself,” the official said.\n\nChina expresses ‘firm opposition’ to comments\n\nWithin hours, China had expressed its “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition” to Biden’s comments, saying it will not allow any external force to interfere in its “internal affairs.”\n\n“On issues concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and other core interests, there is no room for compromise,” said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\n“We urged the US side to earnestly follow the One China principle … be cautious in words and deeds on the Taiwan issue, and not send any wrong signal to pro-Taiwan independence and separatist forces — so it won’t cause serious damage to the situation across the Taiwan Strait and China-US relations.”\n\nChina’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian added, “We urge the US to stop saying or doing anything in violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués. … Those who play with fire will certainly burn themselves.”\n\nTaiwan lies fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) off the coast of China. For more than 70 years the two sides have been governed separately, but that hasn’t stopped China’s ruling Communist Party from claiming the island as its own — despite having never controlled it.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has said that “reunification” between China and Taiwan is inevitable and refused to rule out the use of force. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they’ve been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island.\n\nJoanne Ou, a spokesperson for Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN that it “expresses sincere welcome and gratitude to President Biden and the United States government for reiterating its rock solid commitment to Taiwan.”\n\nBiden compares potential invasion of Taiwan to Ukraine war\n\nBiden on Monday compared a potential invasion of Taiwan by China to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, warning, “It will dislocate the entire region,” and emphasizing “Russia has to pay a long-term price for its actions.”\n\n“And the reason I bother to say this, not just about Ukraine – if, in fact, after all (Russian President Vladimir Putin has) done, there’s a rapprochement … between the Ukrainians and Russia, and these sanctions are not continued to be sustained in many ways, then what signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting, attempting to take Taiwan by force?”\n\nBiden said that China is “already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the maneuvers they’re undertaking.”\n\n“But the United States is committed, we made a commitment, we support the One China policy, we support all we’ve done in the past, but that does not mean, it does not mean that China has the ability, has the, excuse me, jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan,” he added.\n\nAt the press conference, Kishida also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“Attempts to change the status quo by force, like Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, should never be tolerated in the Indo-Pacific, above all, in East Asia,” he said.\n\n“As the regional security environment becomes increasingly severe, I reaffirmed with President Biden that we need to speedily strengthen the deterrence and response of the Japan-US alliance,” he said, adding that he conveyed his determination to “fundamentally strengthen Japan’s defense capability.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Donald Judd Nectar Gan", "Kevin Liptak", "Donald Judd", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}]}

Ron DeSantis officially entered the 2024 presidential race Wednesday after months of anticipation, launching a campaign that will lean heavily on culture war battles and a contrarian COVID-19 record that brought him national attention and made Florida a leading laboratory for conservative governing.\n\nDeSantis emerged from the pandemic as one of the Republican Party's top figures and most promising presidential prospects, putting him on a collision course with former President Donald Trump, who began attacking him months ago.\n\nDeSantis enters the presidential race weakened by Trump’s constant attacks and polling well below his peak after a dominant re-election win last year, but still with considerable goodwill among Republicans, a huge amount of campaign cash and much less baggage than the twice-impeached Trump, who is facing 34 criminal charges.\n\nFrom USA TODAY:Ron DeSantis trails Donald Trump in the polls; 5 reasons he could still win in 2024\n\nDeSantis filed his paperwork with the Federal Election Commission Wednesday at 2:24 p.m., making his campaign official. He has a live, online event scheduled at 6 p.m. Wednesday with Twitter CEO Elon Musk to discuss the launch of his campaign.\n\nDeSantis has pushed Florida far to the right\n\nLong touted as the next big thing in Republican politics, DeSantis will test whether the GOP is ready to move on from Trump after a controversial presidency that was punctuated by efforts to overturn the 2020 election, culminating in a riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnalysis:DeSantis gets conservative wish list to campaign for president. Will it matter?\n\nShaking the money tree:DeSantis has ‘extraordinary’ billionaire support, with at least 42 backing him. Who are they?\n\nDeSantis is campaigning as someone with much less drama than Trump. Allies say he is more disciplined and adept at getting things done after dramatically reshaping Florida’s political landscape with a barrage of conservative laws and policies.\n\nYet in many ways the governor is hewing closely to Trump and fashioning himself as a similarly combative type of leader, a recognition of how Trump has changed the GOP.\n\nLike Trump, DeSantis touts himself as a fighter who will aggressively pursue his agenda and punch back against critics.\n\nInstead of trying to win over moderates, DeSantis has pursued a hard right agenda that is more conservative than anything ever witnessed in Florida as he tries to court Trump’s hardcore MAGA fan base.\n\nEven as he veers right, DeSantis is implying he is more electable and stands a better chance of unseating President Joe Biden than the embattled Trump, who faces a host of legal investigations. DeSantis won re-election last year by 19 percentage points, a huge margin in Florida that ended its swing state status in the minds of many political observers.\n\nHow Florida turned red:Changing population, weak opposition, aggressive Gov. Ron DeSantis\n\nWhat the polls say about Trump vs. DeSantis\n\nWhether DeSantis can peel away a good chunk of the MAGA faithful with his “Trump without the baggage” strategy remains to be seen, though. He has led a charmed political life so far, rising quickly from little known congressman to governor to national GOP superstar in the span of just 10 years.\n\nThat rapid ascent for the 44-year-old Navy veteran received a big boost from Trump, whose endorsement is widely credited with delivering DeSantis a victory in the 2018 GOP primary for governor.\n\nNow, Trump regularly attacks DeSantis for being disloyal, along with a host of other criticisms that likely have contributed to the governor's plummeting poll numbers.\n\nDeSantis topped Trump in some primary polls early this year after his dominating re-election victory, but the governor now trails by 36 percentage points in the average of national GOP presidential primary polls, according to Real Clear Politics.\n\nYet DeSantis has come from behind to win before, and has a resume that could appeal to many in the GOP.\n\nOrigin story: How DeSantis rose to power\n\nA Florida native who was born in Jacksonville and grew up in Dunedin in the Tampa Bay region, DeSantis played baseball at Yale and received his law degree from Harvard before serving as a JAG officer in the Navy.\n\nDeSantis left the military in 2010 and ran for Congress in 2012, winning a coastal seat in Northeast Florida that stretched from south of Jacksonville to the Daytona Beach area.\n\nIn Congress, DeSantis co-founded the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus. He later caught Trump’s eye by defending him on television during the early years of his presidency, and went on to secure an endorsement from Trump in the 2018 race for governor.\n\nBefore the endorsement, DeSantis was considered an underdog against Adam Putnam, who had spent years laying the groundwork to run for governor and had the support of many in the state’s business community and GOP establishment.\n\nTrump’s endorsement helped DeSantis top Putnam, and he went on to beat Democrat Andrew Gillum in the general election by just 32,463 votes out of 8.2 million, the closest margin of any governor’s race in Florida history.\n\nFrom COVID to culture wars\n\nAfter the election, DeSantis sought to temper his hard right image with more moderate policies that had bipartisan appeal, including allowing smokeable medical marijuana and cleaning up the environment. His approval rating soared.\n\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in early 2020 and DeSantis faced his greatest challenge as governor.\n\nAfter authorizing a brief lockdown that shuttered Florida restaurants, bars and other businesses for weeks, DeSantis pushed to quickly reopen and become an outspoken critic of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe pandemic rocketed DeSantis onto the national stage as he fought to keep schools and businesses open and outlaw mask mandates. It also brought out a more combative and aggressive side of his personality, with DeSantis regularly sparing with Democrats, the media and public health officials.\n\nAfter initially promoting COVID-19 vaccines, DeSantis has become more derisive of what he calls “the jab,” opposing vaccine mandates and raising questions about vaccine safety. He made Florida the first state to recommend against healthy children receiving the vaccine, and refuses to disclose if he received a booster shot.\n\nMoving seamlessly from COVID wars to culture wars, DeSantis also has attracted significant national attention for his policies touching on racial and LGBTQ issues, particularly in the realm of education.\n\nThe governor has become a leading figure in conservative efforts to eliminate diversity programs at schools, reframe how racial issues are discussed and pushback against the transgender rights movement.\n\nAfter being accused of using racially-charged language during his first campaign for governor when he said Florida shouldn't \"monkey this up\" by voting for his Black opponent, DeSantis has regularly delved into fraught racial issues, rejecting an Advance Placement course in African American studies, signing the Stop W.O.K.E Act to limit how schools and businesses discuss race and pushing a congressional redistricting map that reduced the number of Black districts.\n\nDeSantis has taken a similar approach to LGBTQ issues. A bill that outlaws teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity became one of the defining policies of DeSantis’ governorship, touching off his ongoing battle with Disney.\n\nDeSantis’s willingness to aggressively wield executive authority – exemplified by his efforts to punish Disney, his removal of a liberal prosecutor from office and an episode where he flew dozens of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard – also has been central to his political image, drawing praise from conservatives who view these moves as bold, and worries from critics who see them as authoritarian.\n\nBuilding a national profile\n\nThe result is that DeSantis popularity within the GOP soared, even as he became viewed as a much more partisan and polarizing figure overall.\n\nThroughout the last three years, DeSantis’ agenda has closely mirrored what’s trending in conservative media. He regularly latches onto issues that are capturing the imagination of the GOP base and make his mark on them in a way that generates national attention.\n\nThat constant national exposure has boosted his appeal within the GOP to the point that he is now widely viewed as Trump’s most formidable challenger. He polls above other Republicans who are running or considering bids, such as former Vice President Mike Pence, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott.\n\nDeSantis' declining poll numbers seem to have encouraged other leading Republicans to consider jumping in the race, though, and he could face a crowded field. He remains a distant second to Trump, who launched his campaign six months ago and has a head start on building it out.\n\nThe governor now must ramp up quickly. He has the resources to do it, with more than $80 million in a state political committee that is expected to be transferred into a federal committee.\n\nDeSantis allies have gotten a head start on building his campaign, creating the Never Back Down federal political action committee. That PAC reportedly has raised at least $40 million so far. It already has runs ads promoting DeSantis and bashing Trump, and is hiring staff in early primary and caucus states.\n\nStrong fundraising is one of DeSantis’ big advantages. He collected more than $200 million for his re-election bid, the most of any governor in U.S. history.\n\nDeSantis also has a record that could be appealing to many conservatives, having turned Florida into a national showcase for conservative policy.\n\nThe governor is hoping a “Make America Florida” campaign can peel enough GOP voters from Trump.\n\nu0022Make America Floridau0022:Ron DeSantis’ Florida power play fueling a presidential run: Who's benefited, who's targeted\n\nBig questions remain about how he will perform on the national stage, though, with reports suggesting he lacks personal charisma and is averse to the type of retail politics and glad-handing common in early voting states.\n\nDeSantis has stumbled in recent months and Trump has worked relentlessly to undercut him, branding him “DeSanctimonious” and questioning his governing record in Florida.\n\nNow the two Florida men will battle for the future of the GOP, and the nation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation. It has also been updated to correctly characterize former President Donald Trump’s position on paper ballots, fix the spelling of Justin Caporale and reflect additional developments.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes Veronica Stracqualursi", "Kristen Holmes", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/gallery/ron-desantis/index.html", "title": "Photos: Ron DeSantis, presidential candidate | CNN Politics", "text": "Florida Gov.

Several other GOP contenders are expected to join the race.\n\nHere are all the official 2024 presidential candidates so far.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nBiden officially launched his 2024 reelection bid in April, telling Americans \"let's finish this job.\"\n\n\"This is not a time to be complacent,\" Biden said in the three-minute video. \"That's why I'm running for reelection. Because I know America. I know we're good and decent people. I know we're still a country that believes in honesty and respect and treating each other with dignity.\"\n\nAlthough 78% of Democrats said they approve of the job Biden is doing, less than half (47%) think he should run again in 2024, according to The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. Overall, just 26% of Americans want him to run.\n\nHis background: Biden, 80, was elected president in 2020 and is already the oldest-serving president. He would be 86 when he finishes a second term if he wins reelection. He served as vice president under former President Barack Obama from 2008 to 2016 and has held public office for more than 50 years. He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nHis views: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump announced in November that he would seek the presidency again in 2024 amid a flurry of legal inquiries and skepticism from other Republicans over whether he’s the right candidate for the job.\n\n\"America's comeback starts right now,\" Trump said during his speech at his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nHis background: Trump, 76, was elected president in 2016, but lost his reelection bid in 2020. He falsely claimed – and still claims – he won the election. He is the only president to be impeached twice by Congress. Before entering politics, he ran his father’s real estate company, renaming it the Trump Organization. He was born in Queens, New York.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nFormer U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley was the second prominent Republican to enter the 2024 presidential race after Trump, calling for a “new generation” of leaders.\n\n“We need someone who can shake up Washington and the political class,” said Haley, who was also formerly South Carolina’s governor.\n\nThe 51-year-old candidate has touted her youth compared to other prominent figures in politics, making “mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old” a hallmark of her campaign.\n\nHer background: The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley hails from Bamberg, South Carolina. Before serving as U.N. ambassador, she served as a South Carolina's first female governor and a state legislator. Her first job at 13-years-old was keeping the books for her family’s clothing store, according to her Cabinet biography.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia. She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack.\n\nTim Scott\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott officially entered the presidential race Friday when he filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. He is expected to make his announcement speech Monday.\n\n\"American families are starving for hope,\" Scott tweeted Thursday. \"We need to have faith. Faith in God, faith in each other, and faith in America.\"\n\nThe lone Black Republican in the Senate, Scott is vying to be the first African-American to win the GOP nomination.\n\nHis background: Scott grew up in North Charleston, South Carolina in a “poor, single-parent household,” according to his website.\n\nHis views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, launched his presidential campaign in April, emphasizing his heartland upbringing in a hometown speech.\n\n\"This campaign is about courage. It is about making the tough decisions... and we've got our work cut out for us,\" he said.\n\nHutchinson has been one of Trump’s most outspoken critics in the GOP field since entering the race. A former federal prosecutor, the 72-year-old candidate urged Trump to exit the 2024 contest before he was formally charged in a New York hush-money case.\n\nHis background: Hutchinson was raised in the rural hills of Arkansas, which he said laid the groundwork for his early political awareness. Hauling hay, sacking groceries and being a janitor taught him the \"dignity of work,” he said.\n\nHis views: He supports lower taxes, a strong national defense and opposing abortion. He has said the Biden administration \"stood on the sidelines\" in the face of crime and “turned its back on the American worker.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy biotech entrepreneur and “anti-woke” activist, entered the 2024 presidential race in February.\n\nThe 37-year-old candidate launched his longshot bid by decrying what he called a “national identity crisis,” driven by a left-wing ideology that has replaced “faith, patriotism and hard work” with “new secular religions like COVID-ism, climate-ism and gender ideology.\"\n\nAuthor of the book “Woke, Inc.,” Ramaswamy centers much of his messaging around dismantling bureaucracies, whether in corporate America or Washington, D.C.\n\nHis background: The son of Indian immigrants, Ramaswamy grew up in the Cincinnati suburb of Evendale. He attended Harvard to study biology and graduated Yale Law School the same year as U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, another southwest Ohio native.\n\nHis views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education. His elevator pitch: He'll go farther than Trump ever did or could today.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nMarianne Williamson, a self-help author who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2020, launched another longshot campaign in March, becoming the first Democrat to formally challenge Biden’s reelection bid.\n\n“We are upset about this country, we’re worried about this country,” Williamson told a crowd of more than 600 at a kickoff in Washington, D.C. “It is our job to create a vision of justice and love that is so powerful that it will override the forces of hatred and injustice and fear.”\n\nThe Democratic Party is firmly aligned behind Biden; it does not plan to hold primary debates, even if other Democrats join Williamson in challenging the president.\n\nHer background: The 70-year-old candidate is a Texas native who now lives in Beverly Hills, California. A onetime spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey, Williamson has authored more than a dozen books and ran an unsuccessful independent congressional campaign in California in 2014.\n\nHer views: Williamson is in favor of abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for the descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace to systemize the suppression of violence.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist from a storied political family, became the second Democrat to challenge Biden for the White House in April with the launch of his 2024 presidential bid.\n\n\"My mission over the next 18 months of this campaign and throughout my presidency will be to end the corrupt merger of state and corporate power that is threatening... to impose a new kind of corporate feudalism in our country,” said Kennedy.\n\nThe son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, both assassinated in the 1960s, Kennedy has been the subject of recent controversies for criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, making anti-vaccine comments and spreading misinformation about the pandemic and vaccines.\n\nHis background: Kennedy, 69, served as an attorney for the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council for over three decades. He founded Waterkeeper Alliance, a network of environmental organizations advocating for clean water, and the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.His stance on vaccines resembles those of Trump, who is running for the Republican presidential ticket in 2024.\n\nThis story will be updated as additional candidates officially enter the race.\n\nContributing: Ken Tran, Haley BeMiller, Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/donald-trump-war-chest-presidential-campaign/index.html", "title": "Questions about Donald Trump's campaign money, answered | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith his formal announcement of a third presidential bid, Donald Trump now will face new limits on raising and spending money ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nBut election lawyers and campaign finance experts said loopholes in federal election rules – and lax enforcement by federal regulators of existing laws – still offer the former president several potential routes to capitalize on the massive fundraising operation he and his aides have built since his 2020 loss.\n\nHow much money does Trump have?\n\nA lot. Trump’s political operation, led by his leadership PAC Save America, is sitting on more than $100 million, according to the most recent filings with federal regulators.\n\nSave America has been at the heart of Trump’s post-presidential fundraising. Leadership PACs are generally established as a way to allow political figures to support other candidates. But they also serve as campaigns-in-waiting for presidential contenders – funding travel and polling and paying the staff members who ultimately join a White House campaign.\n\nLeadership PACs also can underwrite personal expenses.\n\nSave America, for instance, has spent more than $8.5 million on legal expenses since the start of 2021 – with some of it going to firms defending Trump in personal legal matters, such as the sweeping lawsuit that New York Attorney General Letitia James brought in September, alleging fraud in the Trump Organization’s business practices. Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe former president’s close allies also recently established a super PAC, which can raise and spend unlimited sums but is barred from coordinating its activities with the candidates it supports.\n\nLast month, Save America transferred $20 million to the new Trump-aligned super PAC, MAGA Inc., with the goal of aiding Trump’s favored candidates in the midterms.\n\nPolitical observers say that transfer might foreshadow one way Save America’s big war chest could benefit Trump’s candidacy in the months ahead.\n\nWhen does Trump become a candidate for fundraising purposes?\n\nShortly before announcing his bid at his waterfront Mar-a-Lago estate Tuesday, Trump filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission formally establishing his candidacy and the Donald J. Trump for President 2024 campaign committee.\n\nCampaign finance watchdogs argue that Trump has been skirting campaign finance laws for some time by talking and acting like a candidate without formally registering as one. (As far back as July 2021, for instance, Trump told Fox News that he had made up his mind about another presidential bid. And he repeatedly hinted at his intentions in public statements in the months after.)\n\nBut with Tuesday’s formal declaration, Trump must comply with limits on the size and sources of his contributions. A federal candidate cannot accept money directly from a corporation or a labor union, for instance.\n\nAnd, currently, an individual can only contribute $2,900 to a federal candidate for the primary or general election. (That contribution limit, indexed to inflation, will rise for the 2023-2024 election cycle. Federal regulators will announce the new contribution limits early next year.)\n\nAnd, as a candidate, any money Trump spends to advance his White House ambitions – whether it’s for travel to an early primary state or ads touting his achievements – becomes official campaign expenditures and needs to come out of his campaign account.\n\n“He can’t use any of his PACs to fly around the country and give speeches,” said Richard Briffault, an expert on campaign finance regulation and a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nAnd in stark contrast to leadership PACs, campaign committees cannot underwrite personal expenses.\n\nSo, is Trump cut off from using the funds he’s raised?\n\nYes and no, experts say.\n\nTrump can’t simply dump all the money raised by his leadership PAC or an affiliated super PAC into his campaign account. That’s because his campaign committee is subject to strict fundraising limits that don’t apply to those PACs.\n\nBut there are other ways the money Trump has amassed can still advance his candidacy.\n\nLarry Noble, a former top lawyer with the Federal Election Commission, thinks federal law is pretty clear: Candidates aren’t allowed to take a big pot of so-called soft money – funds that exceed the candidate contribution limits – and plow it into an entity that’s set up to help them get elected.\n\nBut he says the FEC – whose six members often deadlock along partisan lines – has set a high bar for even opening an investigation into potential violations.\n\nAs a result, Noble said, there’s probably little to stop a leadership PAC such as Save America from transferring money to a third party – such as a super PAC or a political “dark money” nonprofit group – to run what would look like an independent effort to help Trump, Noble said.\n\nUnder the standard set by some commissioners, “you’d have to show evidence that the money was transferred at the candidate’s direction with the idea that it would be spent to help his campaign and show his involvement in the ads and that type of thing,” he added.\n\nOn Monday, the nonpartisan watchdog Campaign Legal Center said it had filed a complaint with the FEC, alleging that Trump already has violated campaign finance law by transferring $20 million last month from Save America into the MAGA Inc. super PAC. The group argues the super PAC’s spending is likely to benefit Trump’s 2024 campaign.\n\nTrump’s aides did not respond to CNN’s inquiries about the complaint. And an FEC spokesman declined to comment, citing the agency’s standard policy of not discussing pending legal matters.\n\nIt’s far from clear whether the complaint will gain any traction within the FEC. In addition to frequent deadlocks, the agency moves at a slow pace, often ruling years after a complaint is first lodged.\n\nIn July, the Democratic group American Bridge sued the commission in an attempt to force the agency to take action on its complaint against Trump. The group had filed an FEC complaint four months earlier, alleging that Trump had broken federal law by raising and spending large sums to promote a likely presidential bid without formally declaring his candidacy.\n\nGiven the FEC inaction on many enforcement matters, some election lawyers said Trump would run little risk of trouble if Save America transferred another big sum into MAGA Inc. or into another super PAC actively supporting his candidacy.\n\n“If I were in his position, I’d give the money to a super PAC and have the super PAC spend it,” said one Republican election lawyer, who asked not to be identified because of his ongoing work with GOP political committees. Given that the leadership PAC already has transferred $20 million, “what difference would it make if you give $50 (million) more?”\n\n“Even if the FEC were to find that it’s not permissible – which I don’t believe they will, but even if they did – they aren’t going to fine him millions of dollars,” the lawyer added.\n\nHow else could Trump use his existing political operation?\n\nPolitical observers also said the operation Trump has built since leaving the White House can aid his 2024 candidacy in other ways.\n\nThe former president’s relentless fundraising over the last two years has established a small-dollar donor list that’s “constantly updated,” said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe new campaign has established a Save America joint fundraising committee, its filings show – giving it access to Trump’s established donor contact list.\n\n“It’s the largest political donor list in the world,” Heye said. “It gives him the ability to raise a lot of money very quickly.”\n\nAnd because Trump is launching a new campaign, it allows donors who already have contributed the maximum amount to his Save America leadership PAC to start fresh with donations to his 2024 bid.\n\nThe Trump campaign began to ask for those contributions before he had left the announcement stage Tuesday night, with a text message blasted out to supporters, urging them to “Become a 2024 Presidential Founder.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Fredreka Schouten"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/02/09/who-is-perry-johnson-iowans-to-see-super-bowl-ad-for-presidential-bid/69889577007/", "title": "Who is Perry Johnson?

Liz Cheney’s supporters say her reelection hopes were doomed on January 13, 2021, when a week after the insurrection at the Capitol, she and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach former President Donald Trump.\n\nEverything since that day – Cheney’s role on the House select committee investigating the insurrection; her ads featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, eviscerating Trump; her speeches attempting to steer the GOP away from Trump’s influence – only served Harriet Hageman’s victory in Wyoming’s primary for its lone House seat on Tuesday.\n\nCheney’s ouster caps a summer in which Trump has purged the GOP of many of his critics, while elevating candidates – including Hageman – who have parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Trump-aligned candidates have won primaries for governor in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Senate in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Candidates backed by the former President have positioned themselves to take over the election machinery in a series of key states if they win in November.\n\nPrimaries in recent months have also brought into focus the role a handful of prominent Republicans, including Cheney and former Vice President Mike Pence, are seeking to play in moving the GOP beyond Trump and his election denialism.\n\nBut Wyoming’s results on Tuesday demonstrated the long odds those Trump critics face in a party in which the former President remains the most dominant figure and is teasing a third run for the White House in 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Cheney following her primary loss, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to divulge the contents of the conversation. Bloomberg was first to report the call.\n\nCheney attempted to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate and anti-Trump Republicans – many of them ideological opponents of the neoconservative congresswoman before the last 19 months – to save her seat. Her campaign sent information to registered Democrats in Wyoming about how to change their party registration, and in interviews across the state in the lead-up to the election, a number of Democrats did say they were voting for Cheney.\n\nBut the Cowboy State’s electorate is almost entirely Republican. Wyoming has more than 215,000 registered Republicans compared to just 36,000 registered Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state’s office. That’s a drop of about 15,000 registered Democrats from early 2021, but the pool of party-switchers, along with a fall-off of more than 3,000 independent voters who likely became Republicans, was nowhere near large enough to save Cheney from defeat in a Republican Party that had turned against her.\n\n“I think she stood up for what she believes in,” said John Grant, a Republican who cast his ballot for Cheney, even though he suspected she would fall short. “It took a lot of courage to stand against the Republican Party and Donald Trump.”\n\n‘Uneasy from the beginning’\n\nThe roots of Cheney’s loss were planted long before Tuesday’s primary. And in some cases, the seeds were planted during the factional battles within the Wyoming GOP that date back to the tea party era, when Cheney was still a resident of Virginia.\n\nThe state’s GOP, with no real competition from Democrats, has divided into two factions, with a more moderate establishment wing butting heads with a more conservative faction that has increasingly wrested away control.\n\nThe establishment wing retains some power in Wyoming. Gov. Mark Gordon, a part of that wing, won Tuesday. But the conservative faction has seized control of the state Republican Party and many of its local organizations.\n\n“In Wyoming, we don’t necessarily embrace the idea of a big tent,” Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne said on Fox earlier this year.\n\nWyoming Republicans’ reservations about Cheney were first evident in 2016, when she won her House seat after winning just 39% of the vote in the GOP primary against a fractured field. She was cast as too close to the establishment by some rivals, and as a carpetbagger by others – including Tim Stubson, a former state lawmaker who now supports Cheney.\n\nBut, she was by far the best-known candidate in the race thanks to the decade her father spent representing Wyoming in Congress prior to becoming secretary of defense and later, vice president.\n\nCheney had coasted to reelection since then, largely because she had not broken with conservatives on major issues. Stubson said she was on course to do so again, until the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, when Cheney became a leading critic of Trump’s actions and defender of the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nThe makings for a divorce from Cheney were immediately evident. Though Wyoming’s GOP has been fractured by warring factions, one thing that has broadly united those factions is support for Trump. He won Wyoming in 2020 by 43.3 percentage points over Biden – Trump’s largest margin of victory anywhere in the nation.\n\n“Yes, there may have been an undercurrent there of anti-Liz sentiment, but there is no way she would have had any trouble getting elected,” Stubson said.\n\n“Her relationship with that portion of the party has been uneasy from the beginning, and they probably never totally embraced her because she has been the definition of an establishment Republican. But she was right on the policies,” he said. “In my mind, it’s a sort of binary issue: If she votes for impeachment, it doesn’t matter what she does afterward.”\n\nVoters say Cheney was too focused on Trump\n\nWhile Trump’s shadow loomed large over the race, conversations with voters across Wyoming over the last week often came across with a sense of disappointment in Cheney, more than a burning sentiment of anger. Several people said they felt Cheney devoted far more time on national issues – to the detriment of her focusing on energy and natural resource priorities of critical importance to the state.\n\n“I want Wyoming to be protected and I don’t feel Liz is doing that job,” said Jenille Thomas, who lives in the coal-mining town of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming.\n\nFor many Republican voters in Wyoming, though, it was Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump that spurred them to action.\n\nEsther Egan, a 68-year-old who cleans houses and lives in Jackson, said she voted for Hageman because Cheney “bailed on us when we need her the most.”\n\n“They can say whatever they want about Trump, but he did a damn good job. And then she turns tail,” Egan said. “She’s with Nancy Pelosi.”\n\nCatherine Norsworthy, a 68-year-old homemaker in Jackson, said she switched from being an unaffiliated voter to a Republican to vote for Hageman, citing Trump’s endorsement of her.\n\n“I’m not in favor of the January 6 hearings at all,” she said. “I didn’t like her voting against Trump. I’m very pro-Trump. I listen to him.”\n\nU.S. Representatives Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Elaine Luria (D-VA) listen during a public hearing of the U.S. House Select Committee to investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., July 21, 2022. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nGoing down swinging\n\nCheney was by far the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans to vote in January 2021 for Trump’s impeachment. She revealed her decision to do so the day before the House vote, saying in a statement that Trump “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”\n\nThe retribution she faced within the GOP built over the following months. In May 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly endorsed removing Cheney from her position as the No. 3 spot in the party’s leadership team.\n\nThat same month, the House GOP removed Cheney from her leadership post on a voice vote.\n\nShe followed the ouster by telling reporters, in a preview of how she would approach the following year and her reelection campaign: “I will do everything I can to ensure that the former President never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.”\n\nIn July 2021, Cheney accepted a position as one of two Republicans, along with retiring Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAs the committee conducted its probe, Trump set his sights on revenge, endorsing challengers to most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him.\n\nTrump’s biggest target was Cheney. He endorsed Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member and lawyer who had once been a Cheney ally, on the day she entered the race in September 2021.\n\nFor the most part, Trump’s efforts have succeeded. Four of the 10 have retired. Three more, in addition to Cheney, lost their primaries. Only two survived their primaries, and California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse did so in part because their states hold all-party open primaries.\n\nAs those retirements piled up and those primaries unfolded, Cheney was busy playing a leading role on that committee, in its interviews of former Trump administration officials and in its public hearings in which the panel has revealed some of its findings.\n\nShe has also sought out opportunities to confront the GOP’s direction. She delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and her party’s leadership in a late June speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\n“We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before – and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,” Cheney said then. “And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.”\n\nWeeks after that speech, Cheney was elusive when asked about the possibility of running for president in 2024. She told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that she will “make a decision on 2024 down the road.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt earlier this month, Cheney made clear she would not temper her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father once held and that she has held since 2017.\n\n“We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.”\n\nEven as polls showed Cheney was on her way to a resounding defeat, she stuck to a message focused squarely on Trump.\n\nHer campaign bought ad time on Fox for a spot featuring Dick Cheney, in which he called Trump a “coward” who lies to his supporters and “tried to steal the last election” using violence.\n\nRepublican candidate U.S. Representative Liz Cheney speaks during her primary election night party in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. August 16, 2022. David Stubbs/Reuters\n\nWhat’s next\n\nIt didn’t take long for the outcome of Tuesday’s primary to become clear. Cheney had been badly defeated, and conceded the race to Hageman quickly.\n\nShe told supporters that she’d won the primary with 73% support two years ago, and “could easily have done the same again.” But doing so, she said, would have required embracing Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\n“That was a path I could not and would not take,” Cheney said.\n\n“No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,” she said.\n\nAfter a primary that Cheney and her allies knew she was set to lose, the question is, what’s next for the Wyoming congresswoman who had in a short time rocketed up the House Republican ranks?\n\nShe did not answer that question Tuesday night, at her election night event on a ranch in Jackson Hole. But overnight, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called “The Great Task” – a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the “great task” facing the country. And on Wednesday morning, she told NBC’s “Today” show that she is “thinking about” running for president and will make a decision in “the coming months.”\n\nIn her election night speech, Cheney previewed a continued fight against Trump: “I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it. This is a fight for all of us, together.”\n\n“I ask you tonight to join me: As we leave here, let us resolve that we will stand together, Republicans, Democrats and independents, against those who would destroy our republic,” she added.\n\nAs she left the stage, Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” blared over the event’s speakers as the sun set over the Grand Teton mountain peak.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Jeff Zeleny", "Eric Bradner", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/13/milwaukee-rnc-could-include-as-many-as-4500-outside-police-officers/70081387007/", "title": "2024 Milwaukee RNC could include as many as 4500 outside police ...", "text": "As many as 4,500 police officers from agencies outside of Milwaukee could staff the Republican National Convention next year ― 1,500 more than had been originally expected for the 2020 Democratic National Convention that the city also hosted.\n\nUltimately, the DNC went largely virtual as the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe, taking with it Milwaukee's hopes of hosting a large-scale political convention and its 50,000 visitors.

Prosecutors also outlined a $30,000 payment to a former Trump Tower doorman “who claimed to have a story about a child Trump had out of wedlock.\"\n\nAnd they referenced a separate $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to silence her about an alleged affair prior to the 2016 election. Prosecutors said the latter two payments were facilitated by American Media Inc., which owns and operates the National Enquirer tabloid.\n\nThere's no state law that prohibits hush money payments. But Bragg said Trump falsified business records by concealing monthly reimbursement payments he made to Cohen as checks for legal services.\n\nBy itself, falsifying business records is a misdemeanor under New York law. Bragg charged Trump with more serious felony counts by arguing the records were falsified to cover up other crimes.\n\n\"Why did Donald Trump repeatedly make these false statements?\" Bragg said. \"The evidence will show that he did so to cover up crimes relating to the 2016 election.\"\n\nAlthough the indictment doesn't specify which additional crimes, Bragg said Trump violated New York election law and federal campaign finance law.\n\nTrump defiant in Mar-a-Lago speech\n\nHours after leaving the New York City court, Trump returned to his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, where he delivered a speech listing multiple grievances from Tuesday's arrest and last year's FBI search at Mar-a-Lago over classified records to President Joe Biden's son and losing the 2020 election.\n\n\"This fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election and it should be dropped immediately,\" he said.\n\nRomney, other Trump critics skeptical of Bragg's case\n\nEven some of Trump's biggest critics were quick to question whether Bragg presented enough new information to warrant the charges.\n\n“I believe President Trump’s character and conduct make him unfit for office,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who voted to remove Trump from office during the ex-president's second impeachment trial, said in a statement.\n\n\"Even so, I believe the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda.\"\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser-turned-critic, questioned whether Trump's hush payments represented a campaign contribution or expenditure under federal law.\n\n\"Speaking as someone who very strongly does not want Donald Trump to get the Republican presidential nomination, I'm extraordinarily distressed by this document,\" Bolton said in an interview on CNN. \"I think this is even weaker than I feared it would be. And I think it's easily subject to being quickly dismissed.\"\n\nAll eyes on Alvin Bragg\n\nBragg will arguably be as much the center of attention in this case as Trump.\n\n\"We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct,\" he said, defending bringing the case forward at a news conference after Trump appeared in court.\n\nThe district attorney said a \"trail of money and lies exposes a pattern\" that violates New York’s basic and fundamental business laws.\n\nFor Republicans, Bragg will be a lightning rod for their assertions that this case is at best a campaign promise and at worse political persecution.\n\nNation: Who is Alvin Bragg? Meet the attorney who will become the first prosecutor to charge a former president\n\nMore: Read the indictment. Donald Trump charged with crimes in New York.\n\nDuring the 2021 campaign for Manhattan district attorney, for instance, Bragg reportedly reminded voters that he sued the Trump administration “more than a hundred times” in his old job as assistant New York attorney general.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have largely emphasized how the justice system needs to play out without prejudice or favor.\n\nOthers have called attention to how Bragg, who is Black, has faced a barrage of death threats and racist email messages since the indictment was handed down by a grand jury.\n\nA courthouse circus amplified by members of Congress\n\nHours before Trump arrived to turn himself in, throngs of foes and fans had assembled at small a park near the courthouse.\n\nAmong them were two polarizing Republican lawmakers, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, and George Santos, of New York, who joined the pro-Trump side that was waving flags and blowing whistles.\n\n“The government has been weaponized against him,” Greene said. “I'm here to protest and use my voice to take a stand. Every American should take a stand.”\n\nPolitics: Marjorie Taylor Greene compares Trump to Jesus before his arrest and arraignment in New York\n\nMore: New York City Mayor Eric Adams warns Marjorie Taylor Greene, others ahead of Trump arraignment\n\nLater, Greene compared Trump to Jesus and Nelson Mandela in an interview with Right Side Broadcasting.\n\nAmong the anti-Trump demonstrators was Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, who shouted at Greene’s vehicle when it departed.\n\n“Get your hateful rhetoric out of New York City,” Bowman said via Twitter. “Democracy is all about love.”\n\nThe White House keeps quiet\n\nTuesday's circus-like atmosphere provided a striking split screen: a former president under arrest and President Joe Biden trying his best to act like he's not paying attention.\n\nAs Trump walked out of his vehicle to surrender at the Manhattan courthouse, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was in the middle of a press briefing, declining to comment to question after question about the Trump case.\n\n\"Obviously, he (Biden) will catch part of the news when he has a moment to catch up on the news of the day,” Jean-Pierre said at her daily briefing. “But this is not his focus for today.”\n\nMore:With 2024 looming, how long can President Biden stay silent on Trump's indictment?\n\nJean-Pierre cited the ongoing nature of the case in declining comment. Biden ignored questions shouted by reporters about Trump's case after declining comment last week.\n\nAnything Biden says could be used by Republicans to reinforce their case of a politically biased government and justice system.\n\nBut Biden's strategy of silence will be tested if Biden formally announces a 2024 reelection bid, which he's widely expected to do. If Biden remains silent, then Trump's claims of a rigged justice system – almost certain to ramp up heading into 2024 – would go unchallenged by the likely Democratic standard-bearer.\n\nHow long can Biden stay quiet on such a significant case – especially one with direct implications for his own political future?\n\nNo mugshot, but Trump fakes one to raise money\n\nHeading into the proceedings, it was unclear whether Trump would be held to the same standards as other defendants by getting fingerprinted and photographed for a mug shot.\n\nIn the end, Trump was required to provide fingerprints but was not subjected to a mug shot or handcuffs. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was ultimately made by Bragg's office.\n\nThat didn't stop the Trump campaign from creating its own Trump mug shot to raise money, however.\n\nWithin minutes of the former president being processed his 2024 campaign team put out its own \"mugshot\" with a picture of Trump over a “not guilty” banner in a fundraising email.\n\nPolitics: After arrest what's next legally and politically for the former president?\n\nTrump has used his indictment to rally Republicans, with even some of his potential Republican opponents accusing law enforcement of being weaponized against Trump.\n\nCampaign officials said Trump had $10 million in donations since the indictment last week.\n\nThe judge also did not order a gag order, meaning the former president can speak freely about the case without concern about repercussions in court.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison and Phillip M.

Todd Blanche, one of the lawyers, said the indictment doesn’t allege what statements were false.\n\n“It’s really disappointing. It’s sad,” Blanche said. “We’re going to fight it and we’re going to fight it hard.”\n\nBlanche described Trump as upset the district attorney brought a case that wasn’t justified.\n\nThe lawyers said Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan admonished everyone in the case, including witnesses, to consider their public comments.\n\n“He did not admonish the president,” lawyer Joe Tacopina said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump pleads not guilty in historic first case of criminal charges against a former president, reports say\n\nDonald Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday in New York to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the unprecedented case of the first criminal charges against a former U.S. president in history.\n\nHis plea came in response to a Manhattan grand jury’s indictment of Trump on Thursday.

Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, to make the payments to silence Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in the days before the 2016 election.\n\nWhile the payments were not necessarily illegal, the charges, soon to be unveiled Tuesday, are expected to allege that Trump falsified business records related to the hush-money payments.\n\nTrump and his legal team have denied wrongdoing and plan to fight the charges.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhite House: Biden not focusing on Trump’s arrest\n\nPresident Joe Biden, like the rest of the nation, may not be able to avoid seeing footage of his predecessor being arraigned in New York Tuesday.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he's paying attention, his spokeswoman said.\n\n“Of course, this is playing out on many of the networks here on a daily basis for hours and hours.

Bragg announced the indictment Thursday and is expected to unveil the detailed charges Tuesday.\n\nTrump is expected to have his mug shot and fingerprints taken, have the formal charges read and then plead not guilty “loudly and proudly,” his lawyer Joe Tacopina told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. But the details haven’t been nailed down because the Secret Service will accompany Trump, Tacopina said.\n\nTrump's New York arraignment comes as he's under investigation elsewhere\n\nHowever the New York case is resolved, Trump faces other investigations in Georgia over alleged election fraud and from the Justice Department over whether he incited the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack and the discovery of hundreds of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nTrump has boasted about overcoming previous investigations including special counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and two House impeachments that resulted in Senate acquittals over his dealings with Ukraine and his role in the Capitol attack.\n\nTrump to go on legal assault, experts say:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nTrump's arraignment spectacle:Donald Trump plans to turn his arraignment into a political spectacle.

If the charges are falsifying business records as expected, Sarah Krissoff, a former federal prosecutor, said Trump lawyers could claim the alleged violations are too old or exceed the statute of limitations of two to five years.\n\nTrump has said in a social media post Thursday that Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Mercan hates him, after presiding over a criminal case against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer.\n\n\"It is an understatement to say that he (Trump) has a litigious style,\" said Joshua Ritter, a former Los Angeles County prosecutor. \"You're going to see challenges to everything, every step of the way.\"\n\n– Kevin Johnson and David Jackson\n\nTrump expected to go on legal assault:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nDonald Trump blaming George Soros while fundraising off indictment\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to seek political donations after his indictment, using anti-Semitic tropes that blame Democratic philanthropist George Soros in addition to longstanding themes he’s used like attacking investigations of him as witch hunts.\n\nSoros is a frequent target of antisemitic attacks on the far-right even in his home country of Hungary. As recently as Sunday, according to an archive at politicalemails.org, a campaign email referred to Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor whose office brought the case to the New York grand jury, as “George Soros’ hand-picked and funded Manhattan DA.”\n\nMoney raised by these emails will be split between Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and a fund called Save America that has spent millions since the 2020 election paying lawyers who have worked for Trump, including on the case that prompted the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nHouse GOP chairmen oppose gag order on Trump as ‘unconstitutional’\n\nTwo House Republican chairmen opposed an anticipated gag order on Donald Trump pending his New York trial.\n\nReps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, head of the Judiciary Committee, and James Comer, head of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, called any potential order from Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan against Trump speaking about the charges unconstitutional.\n\n“We are deeply concerned by reports the New York District Attorney may seek an unconstitutional gag order,” the chairmen said in a joint statement. “To put any restrictions on the ability of President Trump to discuss his mistreatment at the hands of this politically motivated prosecutor would only further demonstrate the weaponization of the New York justice system.”\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump protests\n\nSteel barriers lined streets near the courthouse, roads were closed, and traffic was diverted across a swath of Manhattan on Tuesday in preparation for the arraignment of Trump.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday urged potential protesters to follow police instructions and threatened anyone who becomes violent with arrest.

Trump's plans from NY to Florida\n\nAs it stands now, Trump is scheduled to leave his self-named tower around 1 p.m. for the trip to the district attorney's office and courthouse that should take about a half-an-hour, according to his schedule.\n\nAfter a formal surrender and processing, Trump is scheduled for arraignment at 2:15 p.m.\n\nThe schedule anticipates a 3 p.m. departure from the courthouse to the airport for the trip to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump is scheduled to arrive back at his Palm Beach home in time for an 8:15 p.m. speech to supporters.\n\nAll of this is subject to change depending on events.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat are the charges facing Trump?\n\nWitnesses before the Manhattan grand jury have described hush-money payments Trump directed former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen to make to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\nLegal experts expect a combination of misdemeanor charges alleging falsification of business records about the payments, combined with a felony such as a campaign finance violation.\n\nBut Trump has denied wrongdoing and Tacopina said there is no documentation of false business records.\n\n“All of the Tuesday stuff is very much up in the air except that we will very loudly and proudly say not guilty,” Tacopina said. “We’re not doing anything at the arraignment because that would be showmanship and nothing more because we haven’t even seen the indictment.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Trump indicted: How did Michael Cohen arrange hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal?\n\nTrump judge expected to be same as for Trump Organization case\n\nThe New York judge tentatively assigned to preside at Donald Trump’s arraignment is familiar with players in the former president’s orbit.\n\nActing Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan oversaw the fraud trial of Trump's namesake real estate company and the related Trump Payroll Corporation, which ended in December with a conviction and $1.6 million in fines.\n\nMerchan also oversaw the sentencing of former Trump financial chief Allen Weisselberg, whose testimony in the fraud case helped secure the convictions.\n\nTrump has harshly criticized Merchan in posts on his social media company, Truth Social.\n\n\"The Judge 'assigned' to my Witch Hunt Case, a 'Case' that has NEVER BEEN CHARGED BEFORE, HATES ME,\" Trump wrote in one post.\n\n– Kevin Johnson, Josh Meyer, David Jackson\n\nWhat is an arraignment?:What the legal proceeding means ahead of Trump's appearance Tuesday.\n\nWho is judge in Trump arraignment?:Juan Merchan, judge in Trump Organization trial, expected to preside at Trump arraignment\n\nLawyers for Trump, Cohen argue against each other’s credibility\n\nTacopina and Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, foreshadowed the fight over credibility in any eventual trial.\n\nTacopina called Cohen a convicted liar who \"is constitutionally incapable of telling the same story the same way twice.\" Tacopina said there is no documentation of Trump falsifying business records.\n\n“I know there is no such evidence,” Tacopina said. “Michael Cohen is a pathological, convicted liar.”\n\nDavis said Cohen and other witnesses have provided testimony and documentation.

He's accused of falsifying business ...", "text": "Donald Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 34 counts of allegedly falsifying business records at his namesake company, where he is accused of hiding hush-money payments his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, arranged to silence two women before the 2016 election.\n\nThe 34 counts apply to payments the Trump Organization paid Cohen in the guise of a legal fees, according to the indictment and a statement of facts released by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nCohen has testified 11 reimbursements went to him – Trump signed nine of the checks – for arranging to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels for $130,000 and Playboy model Karen McDougal for $150,000 about their claims of having had sex with Trump.\n\nBragg's office said the Trump organization made a total of 34 false entries in business records from Feburary to December 2017 to conceal the covert $130,000 payment. The indictment describes Cohen submitting invoices for payments and making false entries with voucher numbers into a ledger for the Trump Organization through either the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust or Trump himself.\n\nUnder New York law, falsification of business records can be a misdemeanor. But the charges can be elevated to felonies by alleging they were committed with the intent to defraud such as by committing another crime or concealing another crime.\n\nBragg's office has filed 117 felony counts under the statute against 29 individuals and companies under the statute during his first 15 months in office. Bragg's predecessor filed 168 felony counts against 34 individuals and businesses from 2019 to 2021, according to the district attorney's office.\n\n\"We cannot allow New York businesses to manipulate their records to cover up criminal conduct,\" Bragg said in a statement.\n\nTrump's lawyers called the indictment \"disappointing\" for its lack of detail, particularly about what elevated the charges to felonies.\n\n“It’s really disappointing. It’s sad,” lawyer Todd Blanche told reporters after the hearing. “We’re going to fight it and we’re going to fight it hard.”\n\nIf convicted, the maximum sentence for the felony would be four years in prison, but first-time offenders typically get shorter sentences or probation.\n\nThe indictment doesn't explicitly specify what elevated the charges from misdemeanors to felonies. Bragg's statement of facts about the case said the scheme mischaracterized the payments for tax purposes, but one of Trump's lawyers has denied that.\n\n\"Further, participants in the scheme took steps that mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the reimbursements,\" the district attorney's office statement said.\n\nIn a news conference after Trump's arraignment, Bragg said the law doesn't require him to spell out the elevating charges. But he said the allegations were based on violations of state and federal election law.\n\nThe payments were recorded, but never filed with the Internal Revenue Service or the Federal Election Commission, Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday.\n\n“They were never filed anywhere,” Tacopina said.\n\nLegal experts expected Bragg to elevate the charges based on alleged violations of campaign finance law but said that was an unusual approach.\n\nFormer district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., said the office historically elevated cases of false documentation to felonies when federal statutes were involved. But linking the charges to a campaign finance violation would be unique, he said.\n\n“It’s never been done that I know of with regard to federal election law, which is quite a specific area of law,” Vance told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.\n\nMore:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nTrump and his allies have criticized Cohen as a disgruntled former employee who is a convicted liar. Cohen was imprisoned in part because of the hush payments.\n\nThe statute of limitations for false-documents misdemeanors is typically two to five years, depending on the circumstances. Trump might argue the charges were filed too late, according to legal experts.\n\n“They’re not false entries. They don’t exist,” Tacopina told CNN. “Assuming they were, they are misdemeanors way beyond the statute of limitations, so they had to cobble them together to try and get a felony.”\n\nDespite the seediness of the allegations, some legal experts argued it was an important case because the payments arguably could have changed the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\n\"This is about someone who was struggling in a campaign and took steps to try to make sure that his further struggles were minimized on the eve of an election,\" said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in Alabama. \"I think that that’s incredibly serious just standing on its own.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html", "title": "Trump Organization found guilty on all counts of criminal tax fraud ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Manhattan jury has found two Trump Organization companies guilty on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records connected to a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation for top executives.\n\nThe Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. were found guilty on all charges they faced.\n\nDonald Trump and his family were not charged in this case, but the former president was mentioned repeatedly during the trial by prosecutors about his connection to the benefits doled out to certain executives, including company-funded apartments, car leases and personal expenses.\n\nThe Trump Organization could face a maximum of $1.61 million in fines when sentenced in mid-January. The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nHear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/04/read-the-trump-indictment/11528624002/", "title": "Read the New York grand jury's indictment of Donald Trump", "text": "Read a copy of the New York grand jury's indictment of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe indictment, brought by the grand jury after the Manhattan District Attorney's office presented evidence, charges Trump with 34 felony counts of \"falsifying business records in the first degree.\"\n\nThe accompanying statement of facts, which lays out details of the case, says Trump \"repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe indictment\n\nDocument unsealed:Read the full indictment of Donald Trump\n\nTrump indictment live updates:Trump pleads not guilty to 34 felony counts in historic New York case\n\nThe statement of facts\n\nThe statement of facts:Read the document", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/20/donald-trump-new-york-charges-possible-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels/11508179002/", "title": "Is Donald Trump being arrested?

But the hush-money payment could potentially be used to build a case for falsifying business records and violating campaign finance law.\n\nHere is what we know about the investigation:\n\nHow does the Stormy Daniels payment figure in the investigation?\n\nThe heart of the New York investigation into Trump appears to focus on a hush-money payment Michael Cohen arranged from Trump to porn actress Stormy Daniels. The $130,000 payment aimed to prevent her from publicizing her claim of having had sex with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in August 2018 to concealing income from the Internal Revenue service, making false statements and “causing $280,000 in payments to be made to silence two women who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate,” according to the Justice Department.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison, although he was released early to home detention because of the threat of COVID-19 in prison.\n\nOpinion:Trump wants you to think he's constantly the victim. Maybe he's just a bad dude.\n\nOpinion:Between sketchy witnesses and the law, case comes up short\n\nCohen and Daniels have each testified before the grand jury. Evidence bolstering Cohen’s testimony includes emails, texts and other documents gathered during a search of Cohen’s electronic devices, a source familiar with the investigation told USA TODAY.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing but admitted to making the payment to Daniels.\n\n“I did absolutely nothing wrong, I never had an affair with Stormy Daniels, nor would I have wanted to have an affair with Stormy Daniels,” Trump said on his social media site Truth Social. “I relied on counsel in order to resolve this extortion of me.”\n\nCampaign-finance charges would typically come at the federal level. But the Justice Department declined to charge Trump and the Federal Election Commission deadlocked over potentially taking action in the case.\n\nHow was the Trump Organization involved?\n\nA New York grand jury in Manhattan has long been investigating Trump and his namesake company.\n\nTwo New York prosecutors who had been leading a criminal investigation of Trump quit Bragg’s office in February 2022. The resignations of Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz come just over a month into Bragg’s tenure and raised questions about whether he could pursue the investigation.\n\nBut the investigation into Trump's business operations eventually resulted in convictions of two parts of the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, over a tax evasion conspiracy. Trump wasn’t charged in that case.\n\nWhat is the Manhattan grand jury investigating now?\n\nBragg’s office hasn’t announced how it is investigating Trump. Based on the witnesses called, the inquiry seems to focus on the hush-money payment, which wasn’t necessarily illegal.\n\nOne potential legal strategy is that Trump could be charged with falsifying business records in combination with another criminal violation. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor, but it would become a felony if linked to a second crime.\n\nThe second charge could be an alleged campaign finance violation for failing to report the $130,000 payment to Daniels as a contribution to his presidential campaign.\n\nNorm Eisen, a lawyer and former counsel to the first House impeachment of Trump, said accounting for the hush money as legal fees appears to be a clear violation of law. But elevating that misdemeanor to a felony with a second charge is a \"steep\" challenge for Bragg, Eisen said.\n\nLinking a bookkeeping charge to a campaign finance violation or wire fraud is a challenge because it would be a state case referring to a federal crime, according to Eisen. But he said no courts have ruled out using a federal crime as the second violation – or prosecutors might find a second state charge.\n\n“We’ve never had a president who’s faced this kind of liability before,” Eisen said.\n\nThree House Republican chairmen criticized the legal strategy Monday in a letter to Bragg, based on Cohen's \"serious credibility problem\" and the potential charges involved.\n\n\"The legal theory underlying your reported prosecution appears to be tenuous and untested,\" Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio, Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky and Administration Chairman Bryan Steil of Wisconsin wrote to Bragg.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/04/04/trump-arraignment-indictment-new-york-case-analysis/11595708002/", "title": "Trump felony counts are more than any US president.

The charges are connected to hush money payments made to multiple people, including a former porn star and a Playboy Playmate. Trump surrendered at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office in New York Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIt will be a historic event that could impact the 2024 election and American politics for years to come. You can read coverage of today's news developments with USA TODAY's live blog.\n\nHere is where you can get running commentary and analysis of the arraignment and what comes next. We will be providing commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and in the comments here.\n\nTrump charged with 34 felonies\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has now been charged with 34 more felonies than any president in American history. The previous record was zero.\n\nAs if to celebrate this ignominious accomplishment, Trump’s presidential campaign immediately released a fake mug shot of the one-term, twice-impeached and now indicted president on a fundraising email because, apparently, being charged with felonies for falsifying business records is cool. I guess it bumps the street cred among what Trump has often called “the forgotten men and women of our country.”\n\nRead Trump's indictment:Former President Donald Trump charged with crimes in New York\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts which, given his proclivity for lying, is not the most reliable claim. Still, he’s innocent until proven guilty, so we’ll give him the same benefit of the doubt he has given Hillary Clinton, President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden and all the other never-even-remotely-indicted people he has said should be immediately imprisoned.\n\n– Rex Huppke, USA TODAY columnist\n\nTrump's legacy: He had less honor and was more crooked than Richard Nixon\n\n34 counts. All felonies. Donald Trump, only three years ago the most powerful person on the planet, is now arrested, charged and officially the most disgraced president in American history.\n\nHis presidential legacy is that he was more crooked and had less honor than Richard Nixon. As someone who grew up in the Watergate era, I didn’t think that was possible.\n\nBut Trump continues to lower the legal, ethical and moral standards for high office in this country.\n\nI wish I felt outrage that our nation elected this man and that tens of millions of Americans seemingly still support him. Instead, I feel deep sadness for what America has become.\n\n– Tim Swarens, USA TODAY Opinion deputy editor\n\nTrump will use arrest to dominate news cycle. Don't let him.\n\nLike many Americans and probably just people of the world, I'm watching the arraignment of Donald Trump play out.\n\nNetwork television is bursting with coverage. What are the charges? Will there be a mugshot?\n\nThese are all very important questions that are being asked and questions that news outlets will spend their day and week answering.\n\nI'll instead ask these questions:\n\nDid you know that thousands of kids in Tennessee marched on their state Capitol because they're tired of being afraid of dying at school?\n\nDid you know that gas prices are about to go back up because of OPEC oil cuts?\n\nDid you know that more than a dozen states will likely be at risk for severe weather and tornadoes?\n\nThose are trick questions by me, tbh. I know you know. Because those are the things Americans are dealing with. Those are the things Americans need help with.\n\nSo by all means, let Trump feel the full balance and force of the legal system. It's important. Just please remember that there is so much more happening that has a much bigger impact on our lives.\n\n– Louie Villalobos, USA TODAY Opinion deputy editor\n\nWhen can we finally be done with the angry old man of Mar-a-Lago?\n\nDonald Trump ought to be just an angry old man rattling and ranting around Mar-a-Lago while the rest of America and the world go about confronting the many serious problems we face.\n\nBut, of course, Trump has neither the decency nor the humility to simply fade away.\n\nSo, the sad and embarrassing spectacle of the arraignment of a former American president on criminal charges takes on more importance than it otherwise should because Trump, against all that is right and sane, may yet get the Republican presidential nomination next year.\n\nAnd given the deep chasm of political polarization that separates Americans, Trump, like virtually any GOP nominee, would be favored to win a minimum of 25 states. Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin might then be all that stands between us and what should be an unfathomable nightmare.\n\nWill the criminal charges brought against Trump by a grand jury and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg be enough to finally rid us of the Mar-a-Lago megalomaniac? I’m skeptical. The Trump dead-enders are beyond persuasion.\n\nI want to believe that Trump is unelectable – and the last three national elections are strong evidence in favor of that conclusion. But I also fear that we as Americans may be forced to put that hope to the test next year, no matter what happens in a New York courtroom in the months ahead.\n\n– Tim Swarens, USA TODAY Opinion deputy editor\n\nThe key word for everything surrounding this spectacle is “embarrassing.” Trump never came close to fulfilling his promise to make America great, but as the justice system finally catches up to him, he and those in his orbit have succeeded spectacularly at making America embarrassing.\n\nLike President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment by the House of Representatives.\n\nOr think former President Richard Nixon and Watergate. Nixon was never charged with anything, but we certainly don't take pride in his swath of presidential history. Trump’s situation is already far worse, and at least Nixon, unlike the Malcontent of Mar-a-Lago, was willing to do the right thing and go away.\n\n– Rex Huppke, USA TODAY columnist\n\nTrump indictment is embarrassing moment in US history:Trump's entire presidency was 'unprecedented.' His arraignment is just plain embarrassing.\n\nAlvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who now holds a bigger spotlight than any prosecutor since Donald Trump's old nemesis Robert Mueller, will likely show his hand publicly for the first time on Tuesday with the unsealing of an indictment handed down last week by a grand jury.\n\nA number of legal experts whom I've spoken with describe the case, based on what is now known publicly, as far from a slam dunk for prosecutors who are used to winning the vast majority of their cases.\n\nTrump, of course, is facing other criminal investigations beyond Bragg's office – an investigation by the district attorney in Atlanta over possible election interference in trying to overturn his election loss in the state in 2020; and a separate probe by Jack Smith, special counsel under the U.S. Justice Department, into Trump's retention of classified documents after he left the White House and possible election interference.\n\nThose investigations face their own legal hurdles if they are to be prosecuted. But Bragg, as the first one out the door, faces the most intense scrutiny, with Trump already attacking the prosecutor in ugly terms as an \"animal\" and raising the specter of violence from his prosecution.\n\nWith so much at stake, Bragg needs to get it right.\n\n– Eric Lichtblau, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter and author\n\nWhat is the evidence against Trump?:How strong is the case against Donald Trump? Why Alvin Bragg better get it right.\n\nIt’s possible to acknowledge that Democrats are overplaying their hand while also questioning why Trump keeps finding himself in these legal tangles. Don’t get me wrong. It seems pretty obvious that the Manhattan prosecutor is stretching the bounds of his office to make a name for himself, and many legal experts have questioned the soundness of the anticipated felony charges.\n\nSince before Trump became president, Democrats have overplayed their hand with investigations and claims that have proved untrue. And it’s possible that if Trump is indeed charged in the hush money case, it will actually help him politically.\n\nA recent poll showed the majority of Republicans and right-leaning independents think they would have a better shot at winning the White House with someone other than Trump.\n\nYet Trump’s hardcore base has remained fairly constant, and a Democratic “witch hunt” could be just the thing to win him even more support.\n\nTrump did some good things while president, including the appointment of three excellent Supreme Court justices. The reality at this point, however, is that he comes with too much baggage that he brought on himself, from the bizarre election denial in 2020 to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nDespite the real political motivation behind these criminal investigations into Trump, at some point Republicans need to ask themselves hard questions about why it is he keeps finding himself in these sticky situations.\n\nIsn’t it time to move on?\n\n– Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY columnist\n\nTrump has overplayed his hand:Donald Trump wants you to think he's constantly the victim. Maybe he's just a bad dude.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg will be prosecuting a case that has been widely criticized as long on politics and short on the law. And he will have an even more unpalatable prospect in putting two key witnesses on the stand embodying a case that borders on the legally indecent: a former porn star and a disbarred lawyer.\n\nThe star witness is one of the most repellent figures in New York. It is only the latest reinvention of Michael Cohen – this time from legal heavy to redemptive sinner. Cohen spent much of his time when he worked for Trump threatening critics, journalists and even students.\n\nCohen may be joined on the stand by Stormy Daniels, who agreed to a $130,000 payment to hush up an alleged affair with then-businessman Trump. Bragg would have to show that Trump made the payment only with the election in mind, which would have made the money an undeclared campaign donation to himself. But there are a host of other reasons why a married celebrity would want to hush up a one-night stand with a porn star.\n\nIn John Edwards' prosecution in 2012, the Justice Department used the same theory to charge the former Democratic presidential candidate after a disclosure that he not only had an affair with filmmaker Rielle Hunter but also sired a child with her. Edwards denied the affair, and it was later revealed that Fred Baron, Edwards' campaign finance chairman, gave money to Hunter.\n\nThe Justice Department spent a king's ransom on the case to show that the third-party payments were a circumvention of campaign finance laws, because the payments were designed to bury an election scandal. Edwards was ultimately found not guilty on one count while the jury deadlocked on the other five.\n\nThe jury clearly believed there were ample reasons to hush up the affair beyond the election itself.\n\nOne could say that Trump and Cohen deserve each other, but the legal system does not deserve what may soon unfold in a New York courtroom.\n\n– Jonathan Turley, Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University\n\nWill Trump be arrested?:Between sketchy witnesses and the law, case comes up short.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/03/trump-arraignment-speech-tuesday/11588062002/", "title": "Trump lands in NYC to face criminal charges; mayor warns ...", "text": "Trump travel Monday to New York, where he will stay in Trump Tower.\n\nTrump is set to be arraigned Tuesday on the first criminal charges against an ex-president.\n\nLegal experts warn against criticizing judge ahead of trial.\n\nDonald Trump arrived in New York Monday afternoon, in anticipation of his arraignment Tuesday as the first former president ever charged criminally.\n\nTuesday live blog:Trump set for historic arraignment as first former president facing criminal charges - live updates\n\nTrump announced he will speak at 8:15 p.m. Tuesday from Mar-a-Lago, a chance to make his case in the court of public opinion as well as in the 2024 presidential race.

But in her first interview since Trump’s indictment last Thursday, she said the as-yet-unspecific charges have put her in more personal danger than ever before.\n\n“The first time it was like gold digger, slut, whore.

Cohen has already been imprisoned in part because he arranged for $280,000 in hush payments to Stormy Daniels, a porn actress, and Karen McDougal, a Playboy model.\n\n“Michael Cohen submitted a lot of documentation,” Davis said. “There are other documents from other people and other testimony from other people.”\n\nTrump lawyer expects 'painless and classy' arraignment\n\nTacopina said he's participated in hundreds of arraignments but never had the Secret Service involved before. He doesn't expect to make detailed legal arguments because the charges will be freshly unveiled.\n\n“Hopefully this will be as painless and classy as possible,\" Tacopina said.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg will explain the charges in detail, but legal experts don't expect all the evidence behind the charges to be revealed.\n\nTrump has criticized the judge, Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, who oversaw the case against the Trump Organization.

As several prominent players announced their intentions to compete in the Saudi-backed circuit, the United States Golf Association remained silent.\n\nOn June 7, the USGA finally made its position public:\n\n“We pride ourselves in being the most open championship in the world and the players who have earned the right to compete in this year’s championship, both via exemption and qualifying, will have the opportunity to do so.\"\n\n“Our field criteria were set prior to entries opening earlier this year and it’s not appropriate, nor fair to competitors, to change criteria once established.”\n\nUSGA chief executive Mike Whan later hinted that the exemption process could change in future years.\n\nR&A (British Open)\n\nWith the U.S. Open in the books, the focus turns to the final major of the 2022 calendar year, the 150th British Open at St. Andrews, Scotland.\n\nMartin Slumbers, chief executive of the R&A, confirmed that defectors to LIV Golf will have their exemptions honored at the 150th Open Championship to be contested at The Old Course at St. Andrews from July 14-17.\n\n\"The Open is golf's original championship and since it was first played in 1860, openness has been fundamental to its ethos and unique appeal,\" Slumbers said in a media release.\n\nHowever, the R&A did decide in December not to grant a spot in the Open to the winner of the Asian Tour's Order of Merit. That move came just a few months after the LIV group announced a multimillion dollar investment in the Asian Tour.\n\nPGA of America (PGA Championship)\n\nTo compete in the PGA Championship, golfers must be part of a recognized tour.

Koepka managed one birdie and five pars during the miserable cold and rain over his first six holes of the third round to reach 13-under-par for the tournament, four better than Rahm, who had a birdie, two bogeys and three pars.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nRahm, 28, had the misfortunate of bearing the brunt of the bad weather both Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, while Koepka luckily finished his second round before the weather turned ugly Friday and didn’t have to return to the course until the third round began.\n\nNow they both face a very long, intense journey Sunday.\n\n“I'm not too concerned about playing 29 holes or however many holes we've got left,” said Koepka, who won four majors from 2017-19 but has dealt with a series of injuries to his right knee the past few years. “It’s part of the deal. I'm pretty sure I'll be up for it considering it is the Masters. So I don't think anybody should have a problem with that.”\n\nThen again, 29 or 30 holes of golf in one day is a lot for a man who now enjoys the no-cut, exhibition-style, 54-hole lifestyle of the Saudi-backed LIV circuit — albeit a man who is believed to not be the happiest golfer in the LIV stable.\n\nMASTERS ROUNDUP:Play suspended due to weather; Tiger Woods sits in last place\n\nIf he had been as healthy last year when he left for the far-less-competitive LIV life as he is right now, he was asked, would his decision to bolt from the PGA Tour been more challenging?\n\n“Honestly, yeah, probably, if I'm being completely honest,” Koepka said. “I think it would have been. But I'm happy with the decision I made.”\n\nKoepka and 17 other golfers who arrived at this week’s Masters left their regular tour jobs to go into the “sportswashing” business with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the mastermind of the killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, as well as his golf-bro buddies in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nation responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and abysmal human rights violations against women and the LGBTQ community.\n\nOne golfer who was adamant that he would never leave the PGA Tour for LIV’s ridiculously fat paychecks is Rahm.\n\n“Shotgun (start), three days to me is not a golf tournament. No cut. It's that simple,\" Rahm said. \"I want to play against the best in the world in a format that's been going on for hundreds of years.\n\n\"I've never really played the game of golf for monetary reasons. I play for the love of the game, and I want to play against the best in the world.

Koepka, ranked 118th in the world, has won two U.S. Opens and two PGA Championships.\n\nThere’s still a long way to go, but it’s likely one of those two will be donning a green jacket Sunday evening.

This time, it’s the iconic 13th. It’s a move that has been talked about since Augusta National Golf Club bought land from neighboring Augusta County Club in 2017. This year, it’s a reality.\n\nOn the course, it’s one of those years that the top players in the world are peaking at just the right time for the Masters. They are the new Big Three; Defending champion Scott Scheffler, Jon Rahm and Rory McIlroy. This is McIlroy’s ninth try to complete the career Grand Slam. He’s coming off his best finish here, a solo second last year thanks to a final-round 64.\n\nLIV's First Big Moment at Masters? The Champions Dinner\n\nSome former champions, such as Fred Couples, have expressed their displeasure with the breakaway LIV Golf tour. Since last year’s Champions Dinner, six former champions have joined the league and are expected to be in attendance Tuesday night.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nThat includes three-time champion Phil Mickelson, who skipped the dinner and the tournament last year in the wake of comments critical of the PGA Tour and his support of LIV. He joined LIV in June, and was followed by former Masters champions Bubba Watson, Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia, Patrick Reed and Charl Schwartzel.\n\nScheffler, who will host the dinner as the defending champ, joked with Watson that maybe there should be a separate table for the LIV golfers. Nick Faldo, a three-time champ, joked that perhaps it might be wise to use “plastic knives and forks.”\n\nIn all, there are 18 LIV golfers in the Masters field, including four-time major champion Brooks Koepka. All of them have been sensitive to criticism that, because they are banned by the PGA Tour and have only played three events this season (including one in Orlando that ended Sunday), they might have lost their edge. They also play 54 holes tournaments, not the normal 72.\n\nThe PGA Tour has banned LIV members from playing its events. But the four majors, including the Masters, are allowing those who qualified to play.\n\nLIV GOLF:What Cameron Smith, others have said about 2023 Masters\n\nGOLFWEEK: All the latest news from the Masters and around the links\n\n“Most of us will get four cracks at it this year (in the major championships), and hopefully we get maybe a win out of it,” said Cameron Smith, the current British Open champ and LIV’s highest player in the world rankings. “Maybe we just show a really hearty effort. I think for us, internally, there’s a lot of chatter going around about, 'These guys don’t play real golf anymore.' And I think it’s (crap) to be honest. And we just want to show people that.\"\n\n\"I think there is a big rivalry right now between the Tour and LIV,\" said Joaquin Niemann, another LIV member. \"I think there is a lot of players that – I don't know if they don't like us or they don't like the decisions that we take – but it's going to be fun.\"\n\n\"I think it's going to be more fun knowing that they hate us,\" Niemann said. \"Then go to the majors and beat them.\"\n\nWill Augusta National pair them all together? It’s doubtful. The former champions are normally paired with amateurs. Will the fan reaction be muted?\n\nAnd what if a LIV golfer wins? That could very well happen, especially since Smith is unquestionably one of the game’s top players. He’s shown he can win here, with top-10 finishes in each of the past three years. He tied for second in 2020, becoming the first golfer in tournament history to break 70 in all four rounds, tied for 10th in 2021 and tied for third last year.\n\nLucky, or Unlucky, New 13th Hole at Augusta National?\n\nBack to the lengthening of the 13th hole. The tee was moved straight back and up the hill 35yards, making it play at 545 yards. It will be more difficult for players to draw their ball around the dogleg right corner on the par-5. That means fewer player will go for the water-guarded green in two shots, and eagles will be rarer. But there were only three there last year.\n\nLast year, when the other second-nine par-5, the 15th, was lengthened by 20 yards to 550 yards, there was zero eagles recorded.\n\nThe change on No. 13 puzzles two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson.\n\n\"It will change the hole,” Watson said. “It's now driver (off the tee) and maybe a long iron into the green. Will they take out trees on the bend? That'll determine how much harder it is when it comes to going for it in two. There's probably going to be a lot more lay-ups. A few years ago, they wanted the roars back on Sunday. Now you're taking away the roars? That's kind of weird.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/masters/2023/04/05/masters-doesnt-invite-liv-greg-norman-fred-ridley-augusta-explains/11608852002/", "title": "Masters doesn't invite LIV's Greg Norman; Augusta chair explains why", "text": "Augusta National Golf Club chair Fred Ridley confirmed LIV Golf CEO and commissioner Greg Norman was not invited to attend the Masters in an attempt to limit distractions about the Saudi-funded league that has lured away dozens of PGA Tour members.\n\n\"We did not extend an invitation to Mr. Norman,\" Ridley said Wednesday during a news conference. \"The primary issue and the driver there is that I want the focus this week to be on the Masters competition, on the great players that are participating, the greatest players in the world, which, by our decision in December, we ensured that we were going to honor and be consistent with our invitation criteria.\"\n\nIn December 2022, Augusta National issued a statement in which it made clear that all players eligible to receive invitations under current criteria, including LIV Golf players, would be offered the chance to compete in the Masters.\n\nOPINION:By allowing LIV golfers, Masters officials are giving into Saudis' sportswashing scheme\n\nAs golf's prized major is set to begin, 18 LIV golfers have accepted invitations to the Masters, including six past winners who were present at Tuesday night's Champions Dinner.

Three of those golfers – Talor Gooch, Hudson Swafford and Matt Jones – were seeking a temporary restraining order so they could compete this week in the first playoff event, the FedEx St. Jude Championship, which starts Thursday in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today denied their emergency relief request, and those players remain ineligible for PGA TOUR tournament competition, including this week’s FedEx St. Jude Championship,” Monahan’s memo said.\n\n“With today’s news, our players, fans and partners can now focus on what really matters over the next three weeks: the best players in the world competing in the FedExCup Playoffs, capping off an incredibly compelling season with the crowning of the FedExCup champion at the TOUR Championship,” the memo said.\n\nThe players who are part of the lawsuit are Phil Mickelson, Gooch, Swafford, Jones, Bryson DeChambeau, Abraham Ancer, Carlos Ortiz, Ian Poulter, Pat Perez, Jason Kokrak and Peter Uihlein.\n\nLIV Golf released a short statement Tuesday, expressing disappointment. “No one gains by banning golfers from playing,” officials said. The controversial LIV tour has attracted some big names from the golfing world to leave the established PGA Tour and the DP World Tour to participate for vast sums of money.\n\nIn June, Monahan indicated the LIV Golf Invitational Series represents a serious threat to the success of the PGA Tour.\n\n“If this is an arms race and if the only weapons here are dollar bills, the PGA Tour can’t compete,” he said. “The PGA Tour, an American institution, can’t compete with a foreign monarchy that is spending billions of dollars in an attempt to buy the game of golf.\n\n“We welcome good, healthy competition. The LIV Saudi Golf League is not that. It’s an irrational threat; one not concerned with the return on investment or true growth of the game.”\n\nCEO Greg Norman told Fox News last week that LIV Golf officials had offered Tiger Woods about $700-800 million to join the series, which he turned down.\n\nThe series is backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) – a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia – and has pledged to award $250 million in total prize money.\n\nThat has led to criticism from many PGA Tour players, including Rory McIlroy and Woods, that players have abandoned golf’s traditional set up and accepted money from a country with a dismal human rights record.\n\nAccording to the PGA Tour, any golfer that joined LIV Golf was ruled ineligible to participate in tournament play since early June.\n\nLIV Golf’s next three-day event is scheduled to begin September 2 in Boston.", "authors": ["Steve Almasy Jill Martin", "Steve Almasy", "Jill Martin"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/04/06/liv-golfers-2023-masters-opening-round-augusta-national/11618482002/", "title": "How all 18 LIV golfers performed during the Masters opening round", "text": "Editor's note: Here are the latest live updates from Friday's Round 2, including Tiger Woods' tee time and more.\n\nAnticipation continued to build in February when Augusta National officials announced that LIV golfers who met Masters qualifications would be eligible to play in the 2023 Masters, the since the division of the tours started with the first LIV tournament in June 2022.\n\nMany PGA Tour players like Rory McIlroy who had previously criticized the Saudi-funded LIV series eased tension this week by turning the conversation to the history and tradition of the Masters.\n\n“Look, it’s a narrative and a storyline, but the Masters and the four major championships sit above all that noise, and that’s the way it should be this week,” McIlroy said.\n\nAugusta National chairman Fred Ridley further explained on Wednesday comments he made in December expressing disappointment in players opting for the LIV series instead of the PGA Tour.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\n\"What I was trying to point out, and I alluded to it in my comments, the platform that these players have built their careers on were based on the blood, sweat and tears of their predecessors, people like Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Tiger Woods,\" Ridley said.\n\n\"So my comment in December was really more that I was expressing some disappointment that these players were taking the platform that had been given to them — that they rightly had earned success on, by the way — and moving to another opportunity, perhaps not thinking about who might come behind them.\"\n\nThe Masters:The Masters: Tee times, TV, streaming info for Friday's second round at Augusta National\n\nHere's how each LIV golfer performed Thursday in the 2023 Masters opening round:\n\nBrooks Koepka | Tied for the lead, 7 under 65\n\nBrooks Koepka closed out strong to tie Jon Rahm and Viktor Hovland for the lead with a 7-under par 65.Koepka made the turn at 4-under par, and birdied three of the last four holes to finish.\n\nHe became the first LIV golfer invited to the interview room during the tournament.\n\n\"Love to finish with two birdies like that.

But then I hit a good shot on 14, good putt also. Then on 15, I thought I hit an unbelievable shot. I mean, it was a really good shot and I just probably needed two more yards and it was probably a tap-in eagle and ended up making bogey.\n\nSo I think that's the way this course works.

It marks Woods’ first double-bogey of the tournament. Through six holes in the third round, Woods has two bogeys and now a double bogey.\n\nHe grimaced and was visibly in pain as he labored to walk the course.\n\nWoods is 4-over in the round and seven-over in the tournament, good for 54th place after making the cut into he weekend.\n\nTiger Woods started the third round of the Masters on Saturday afternoon with the rain coming down around him.

After two rounds, the 23-year-old sat in third place at 8-under, only four strokes behind leader Brooks Koepka.\n\nBennett is within striking distance of becoming the first-ever amateur to win the Masters, but he got off to a rough start on the third round on Saturday. He hit a bogey on No. 1 and No. 2 to bring him to 6-under for the tournament. Maybe it’s the inclement weather? Maybe it’s nerves? But Bennett rebounded on No. 3 with a par.\n\nHe’s slipped to fourth place and is tied with American Phil Mickelson and Norwegian Viktor Hovland. Koepka sits atop the leaderboard at 13-under for the tournament.\n\nScottie Scheffler is seeking to defend his Masters title. On Saturday, the American star rebounded from a shaky Friday performance that left him with a score of +3. He started the third round Saturday at tee No. 10 and was able to bring his score to -1.\n\nThe 2023 Masters Tournament has been a mixed bag for members of LIV Golf competing against the PGA Tour stars they abandoned for the Saudi-backed league.\n\nFor Brooks Koepka, things couldn't be going better. The four-time major champion has his sights set on No. 5 after ending his second round atop the leaderboard.\n\nHere's the LIV golfers who made the cut at the Masters:\n\nBrooks Koepka: -12\n\nJoaquin Niemann: -4\n\nPhil Mickelson: -4\n\nPatrick Reed: -3\n\nDustin Johnson: -1\n\nHarold Varner III: -1\n\nAbraham Ancer: -1\n\nCameron Smith: Even\n\nMito Pereira: Even\n\nTalor Gooch: +2\n\nThomas Pieters: +3\n\n— Jace Evans\n\nTiger Woods made the cut by the skin of his teeth after a rain delay pushed the end of the second round to Saturday morning. This is his 23rd straight time making the cut at the Masters.\n\nThe five-time Masters champion will continue play Saturday afternoon in the third round at 1:06 p.m. ET from tee No. 10. He will play in the last wave of the day with Thomas Pieters and Sungjae Im.\n\nTiger Woods makes cut as second round wraps up\n\nTiger Woods' streak of 23 straight made cuts at the Masters came to fruition after the five-time champion finished the first 36 holes at 3-over-par. The consecutive cuts ties the record shared by Gary Player and Fred Couples.\n\nWoods began the day with a chance to play the weekend and was comfortably above the cut line when he made a birdie on the Par 5 No. 15. But he bogeyed the last two holes and had to wait for the cut line to move as Justin Thomas finished with two straight bogeys to secure Woods' spot.\n\nBrooks Koepka (12-under) goes into Saturday's action on top of the leaderboard after Friday's action was suspended due to inclement weather. He holds a two-shot lead over Jon Rahm. Amateur Sam Bennett is alone in third at 8-under, followed by Collin Morikawa and Viktor Hovland at 6-under.\n\nTiger Woods finishes second round at 3-over, outside projected cut line\n\nWoods' approach on No. 17 was an adventure as his tee shot went wide right on the par-4 440-yard hole, but battled back to get within six feet of a par, and he missed it, going back to 2-over.\n\nOn 18, another par-4, Woods hit the ball left of the fairway and was left with a 50 foot for par.\n\nWoods finishes his second round at 1-over with two birdies and three bogeys and will likely need players above him to falter to get a new projected cut line so he can play through the weekend.\n\nOn the updated leaderboard, Jon Rahm is still two shots from the lead after bogeying 16. Brooks Koepka remains the 36-hole leader at 12-under.\n\nTiger Woods makes second birdie of round, Jon Rahm inches closer to lead\n\nWoods had a chance to make up some ground on the 550-yard Par 5 15th hole, and hit the fairway on his first shot, leaving him 277 yards from the hole. He made a 27-foot put for birdie to give him some breathing room and gave the crowd a nice fist pump. On 16, one of the five holes that has played over par through two rounds, Tiger made a seven-foot putt for par and sits at +1.\n\nRahm, who finished Friday three shots off the lead, got off to a good start, making birdie on the Par 3 No. 12, and making pars on No. 13 and 14.\n\nTiger Woods resumes second round, pars first two holes to remain at 2-over\n\nWoods got through 12 holes during Friday's round and started early on Saturday trying to stay above the cut line. On the par-5 No. 13, Woods got in good position with a chance for a birdie from 15 yards out, but settled for par and remains at 2-over. On 14, he made a four-yard put to save for another par.\n\n63-year-old Fred Couples could make history\n\nIt appears that Fred Couples will be playing the rest of the weekend at the Masters.\n\nThe 1992 champion finished his second round with a bogey, leaving him at 1-over for the championship and inside the projected cut line. That would make the 63-year-old Couples the oldest player to make the cut at Augusta National, beating the mark that Bernhard Langer set during the 2020 tournament by about 3 ½ months.\n\nIt also would be the 31st career cut for Couples, trailing only Jack Nicklaus’ record of 37.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nPlay has resumed at Masters\n\nSome of the golfers who have yet to complete their second round have hit the course at the Masters on Saturday after play was suspended on Friday due to inclement weather. Tee times have not been posted for the third round.\n\nAnother LIV golfer withdraws\n\nA second golfer who plays on the LIV tour has withdrawn from the Masters. Louis Oosthuizen, who has one PGA Tour win, the 2010 British Open, won't finish the weekend due to injury.\n\nThe South African completed 17 holes of his second round and finished at 7-over, mostly likely missing the cut anyway. Kevin Na, a fellow LIV golfer, withdrew after nine holes on Thursday.\n\nSix other LIV golfers, including four who haven't completed their second round, are in danger of missing the cut, based on the projected cut line of 2-over.\n\nAugusta National takes big risk after trees crash down at Masters\n\nAugusta National Golf Club and the Masters got very lucky Friday afternoon when the three trees that crashed to the ground near the 17th hole missed dozens of fans gathered nearby.\n\nYet no more than 90 minutes after the incident, the Masters announced that ticket gates for spectators would open as scheduled Saturday morning at 7 a.m. In other words, fans will be back on the grounds in droves and it will be business as usual at the first men’s major golf tournament of the year.\n\nClearly, the leaders of Augusta National are gambling that in the midst of severe weather that is expected to continue throughout Friday evening, including heavy rain and high winds, all their other trees — thousands of them — are safe and stable and nothing like this will happen again.\n\n— Christine Brennan\n\nHow to watch the Masters on Saturday\n\nESPN is set to air the restarted second round action beginning at 8 a.m. ET. CBS will have live coverage of the Masters from 3 p.m.-7 p.m. ET.\n\nThe resumption of the second round and the third round can be live streamed at CBSSports.com, ESPN+, Paramount+, Masters Live and the CBS Sports app.\n\nWhat time does the Masters resume on Saturday?\n\nThe second round is scheduled to resume at 8 a.m. ET Saturday morning, with the third round to follow — though more rain and storms are in the forecast for the entirety of the day.\n\nKoepka is back in championship form at the Masters\n\nBrooks Koepka is back. But given which side of the professional golf schism he landed on, you better catch him while you can.\n\nEven if Koepka wins this Masters for his fifth major championship — and it’s looking pretty good with a three-shot lead in the clubhouse when officials suspended the round due to inclement weather — the next time you’ll see him (or won't see him, more likely) will be later this month in Adelaide, Australia, or the following week in Singapore. Back to the easy, breezy LIV Golf anti-grind that is so obviously beneath his talent and incapable of satisfying his hunger to be remembered as one of the greats of all time.\n\nIt would be a welcome development if golf has entered a second era where Koepka feels like a threat every time he tees it up at a big event. He’s that electric of a player and competitor. But in golf’s current fractured state, he only gets four chances a year to beat the players he most wants to beat.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nWhat other LIV Golf players are projected to make the cut?\n\nWith the cut line currently standing at 2-over par, 10 members of the LIV Golf Series would make the cut as things stand entering Saturday.\n\nKoepka, of course, is a shoo-in, and Phil Mickelson and Joaquin Niemann are in excellent shape after finishing their second rounds at 4-under. Patrick Reed also sat at 4-under with four holes remaining in his second round, while Cameron Smith was 2-under through eight holes.\n\nDustin Johnson and Harold Varner III both finished their second rounds at 1-under, Abraham Ancer is 1-under with six holes remaining, Mito Pereira was Even following the second round and Talor Gooch was 1-over with just the 18th hole to play.\n\nWhat is the Masters cut rule?\n\nThe Masters will pare down the field after the conclusion of the second round, with the low 50 players and ties qualifying for the final 36 holes.\n\nJack Nicklaus holds the record for most Masters cuts made with 37, followed by Fred Couples and Gary Player who each made the cut 30 times.\n\n— Fletcher Page, Augusta Chronicle\n\nMcIlroy crashes out at Masters, misses cut\n\nNo exit at the 2023 Masters is more surprising than that of Rory McIlroy.\n\nAs he heads home to Florida, McIlroy, who needs only a Masters win to complete the career grand slam, will be burning with fury — though not at others — after carding a 5-over through two rounds and missing the cut. He sets a high standard for himself and at Augusta National, he fell woefully short.\n\nThe world No. 2 has missed only two cuts since the 2022 Masters. One came at the FedEx St. Jude Championship in August, and he went on to win the PGA Tour’s $18 million playoff prize two weeks later. The other was last month at the Players Championship, which he followed with a strong third-place showing at the WGC-Match Play. He won’t yet care what will follow this Masters disappointment.\n\n— Eamon Lynch", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/golf/the-masters-liv-golf-2023-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "The Masters will allow LIV golfers to compete in 2023 tournament ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGolfers that have played in the LIV Golf series will be allowed to compete at the Masters next year, organizers of the prestigious major said on Tuesday.\n\nFred Ridley – the chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club, which stages the Masters – said In a statement that “those eligible under our current criteria” would this week receive invites to play the 87th edition of the major in April.\n\nA number of players to have competed on the controversial Saudi-backed LIV Golf series are listed for invite, including three-time Masters winner Phil Mickelson, world No. 3 and 2022 Open champion Cameron Smith, and four-time major champion Brooks Koepka.\n\nThe eligibility of LIV Golf players for majors has been one point of contention in an ongoing rift in the sport, with participating golfers banned from the PGA Tour and no world ranking points offered for LIV Golf events.\n\nEarlier this year, LIV Golf joined an antitrust lawsuit alongside some of its players to challenge their suspensions by the PGA Tour.

He beat the record of Bernard Langer, the 1985 and 1993 champion, who was 63 years, two months and 17 days old when he made it to the weekend in the Masters that was played in November of 2020.\n\n\"At whatever age I come here, next year I'll work hard to be — last year I wasn't fit at all, and the course was brutal,\" Couples said. \"I actually played a really good first round. This year I drove it really well most of the time. I hit a lot of fairways, and they were out there pretty good.\"\n\nCouples had made his drive at No. 18 on Friday and was on the right side of the fairway, 220 yards out, when the horn blew to stop play for inclement weather.\n\nHe marked his ball and came back out Saturday morning, knowing a bogey would put him at 1-over par for the tournament — inside the cut line.\n\nCouples hit an easy fairway wood that gave him a nice angle with 43 yards to the pin. He calmly hit a wedge to 15 feet, and made a nice first putt to set him up inches away from the cup to finish out.\n\nCouples doffed his cap as Masters patrons showed their appreciation as he left the green. He'll be playing two more days in his 38th Masters appearance.\n\n\"I am excited to make the cut,\" he said. \"That's why I come here. The last four years have been really mediocre golf. Maybe one year I was semi close to making the cut. But that's my objective, and I did it.\"\n\n8:00 a.m. | Masters champion Sandy Lyle finishes final round in style\n\nSandy Lyle, who had to wait overnight to finish his second round with his final two putts, kept a secret in his golf bag all week.\n\nThen, as a second weather delay hit Augusta National, Lyle’s wife, Jolande, shared the surprise.\n\nTo commemorate his final competitive Masters, PING designed a replica putter that Lyle used for his 1988 triumph. It has a golden head with the words C1988 inscribed on the shaft.\n\n“You see this?” Jolande asked a group of five reporters. “This is what Sandy is going to use to hit his last putt.”\n\nLyle, along with playing partners Taylor Gooch and Jason Kokrak, were on the 18th green Friday when the horn sounded. The trio elected to mark their balls and did not complete the hole.\n\nBecause the round was still in progress, Lyle — who was 19-over after 35 holes — was not permitted to speak with media. Jolande, however, said her husband carried two putters in his bag during Friday’s round.\n\n“He wanted his last shot to be memorable,” Jolande said.\n\nLyle was using an Evnroll putter before switching to the commemorative flat stick.\n\n— Doug Stutsman contributed to this report\n\n7:30 a.m. | Tiger Woods at the 2023 Masters projected cut line Saturday at Augusta National\n\nThe top 50 players, including ties, after the second round make the cut at the Masters.\n\nThe projected cut line for the top 50 players and ties at the 2023 Masters is 2-over par entering Saturday.

Movie': Chris Pratt plumbs Nintendo's greatest hits", "text": "We've spent countless hours with Mario over the last four decades, having him jump on turtle henchmen, go down teleportation tubes and save the day. After all this time, though, folks really don't know the video game plumber all that well.\n\nChris Pratt is here to fix that.\n\nVoicing him in the animated adventure “The Super Mario Bros.” (in theaters Wednesday), Pratt felt he could “breathe a little bit of my own spirit\" into the character, like “my brand of vulnerability and Mario's desire to never give up.\"\n\nPratt and his “Super Mario” co-stars break down how the film pulls from Mario’s history as an 8-bit icon while also mining fresh ground:\n\nChris Pratt weathered 'Super Mario Bros.' backlash about his voice\n\nMustached Brooklyn dude Mario runs a plumbing business with his bro Luigi (Charlie Day) – which isn’t going all that great – when they venture underground to look into a water main problem and end up transported to a fantasy world. Mario meets Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) of the Mushroom Kingdom, gets recruited to help fend off an attack from the mighty Bowser (Jack Black), and is indoctrinated into a world where eating fungi gives him superpowers.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, Pratt and Day pay passing homage to the high-pitched faux Italian tones of their classic Nintendo characters before settling into less over-the-top accents, which spawned criticism from fans from the first trailer. \"When I first heard people being passionate about our take on the voices, it never really bothered me,\" Pratt says, because there was that nod to the past. But Day argues, “I think 90 minutes of that over-the-top stereotypical accent would've been borderline unwatchable.”\n\nCharlie Day found an immediate connection with Luigi as ‘a nervous, put-upon guy’\n\nIn the early ’80s games “Mario Bros.” and “Super Mario Bros,” Luigi was essentially a color-swapped Mario but over the years gained his own personality and had solo adventures in the “Luigi’s Mansion” series. The new movie nods to his terrifying predicaments in those games by sticking him in the Dark Lands, where he runs afoul of Bowser and his skeleton Koopa Troopas.\n\nLuigi has “a personality type that I get cast in a lot, which is sort of a nervous, put-upon guy,” says Day, a star and writer on FX's “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” “It felt like a really nice fit (and) hopefully the audience is finding a new and more fleshed-out Luigi to fall in love with.”\n\nSeth Rogen’s Donkey Kong still harbors a Mario grudge\n\nHe’s still throwing barrels just like in his original game, but the Donkey Kong (voiced by Seth Rogen) in the “Super Mario” movie is a warrior from the Jungle Kingdom who’s roped into the battle against Bowser’s forces. Rogen appreciated how the film used the “Donkey Kong Country” video game “as inspiration and built out the family more and him wanting his father's attention.”\n\nBut the relationship between the big gorilla and Mario is as adversarial as ever. “Donkey Kong hates Mario and is not thrilled to be around him, inherently has a dislike for him and doesn't buy into the Mario fanfare,” Rogen adds. “And in movies, any scene where someone hates someone else is usually funny.”\n\nJack Black gives life to the antagonistic icon Bowser\n\nBowser, who debuted in the hugely popular 1985 video game “Super Mario Bros.,” has been Mario’s chief nemesis for 40 years, mainly grunting and snarling at his foes. Black says he adored giving a softer side to “arguably the most recognizable video game villain of all time.” (It might also involve a “fantastic song,” he teases.) “He’s evil but he's also sensitive. It's a smorgasbord for an actor.”\n\nWhereas Black uses his own voice as Po in the “Kung Fu Panda” movies, he utilized a “darker, lower register” and “a little more gravel” when recording Bowser's lines. “I had to drink a lot of hot tea and shut down some of the sessions,” he recalls. “Sometimes after a couple hours, I’d go, ‘Guys, I'm roasted, my pipes are raw. I've left esophageal meat on a microphone.’ ”\n\n‘Super Mario Bros.’ borrows from ‘Mario Kart’ and other favorite games\n\nThe movie contains Easter eggs referencing a number of beloved Nintendo games, from “Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!!” to “Duck Hunt.” Pratt loves a montage moment where fans will realize they’re watching a mix of levels from multiple “Super Mario” games, plus the way the film incorporates the well-known musical themes “that really are the soundtrack to so many people's lives, including my own.”\n\nAs a big “Mario Kart” fan, Rogen got a kick out of seeing Mario, Peach, Donkey Kong and crew drive their vehicles “Mad Max”-style down Rainbow Road, “which to me as a kid was always one of the coolest, most psychedelic levels in any of the games.”\n\nTwo plumbers, a princess and a great ape still rule the Nintendo landscape\n\nWhy do we care so much for Mario and Co. more than 40 years later? Black, who recalls playing the original arcade “Donkey Kong,” feels they’re “touchstones for our childhood” and “at some point, they create their own mythology when they're that ingrained in our culture. They become larger than just video game or cartoon characters.”\n\nFor Rogen, something objectively as good as the “Super Mario” galaxy is hard to define: “Why does the song ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ still hold up after all this time? I think some things just work.”\n\nGet your game on with these stories:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/entertainment/super-mario-bros-movie-teaser-trailer/index.html", "title": "'Super Mario Bros.

UConn was in the bonus after eight minutes and made 20 of 21 free throws in the second half to keep San Diego State at bay.\n\nThe stop-and-start flow and defensive focus in the second half sparked memories of the Huskies’ 2011 championship game win against Butler. The Bulldogs shot just 18.8% from the field in that loss. San Diego State did slightly better at 32.2%, including just 28.6% in the first half.\n\nBut the Aztecs began to climb back into the game with a 9-0 run to draw within 56-50 with 7:40 left, wobbling UConn for the first time in this tournament, and then trailed 60-55 with 5:19 remaining. SDSU had overcome halftime deficits of six points in the Elite Eight against No. 6 Creighton and seven points in the national semifinal against No. 9 Florida Atlantic, winning each game by a single point.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD:UConn, Duke lead next season's way-too-early Top 25\n\nRIGHT CALL:National title validates Connecticut's move to Big East\n\nSIGNING OFF:Watch 'One Shining Moment' cap off NCAA men's tournament\n\nIn the end, though, the Huskies’ combination of shooting and interior defense was too much for the Aztecs to overcome.\n\nWhile SDSU struggled to do anything in the paint and misfired from deep — the Aztecs hit 6 of 23 attempts from 3-point range — the Huskies’ offense was again anchored by the inside-out duo of Sanogo and guard Hawkins.\n\nA potential first-round pick in the upcoming NBA draft, Hawkins finished with 16 points on 5 of 9 shooting. His 3-pointer with 5:04 left gave the Huskies a 63-55 lead and provided the perfect response to the Aztecs' run.\n\n\"Coach drew something up for me,\" Hawkins said. \"I know he trusted me to make that shot. I had to make it. Easy part. All credit to my teammates for getting me open on those screens and Coach for trusting me.\"\n\nFellow guard Tristen Newton had a team-high 19 points along with 10 rebounds and 4 assists, offsetting a game-high five turnovers.\n\nBut the biggest key was a deep frontcourt anchored by Sanogo, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He posted a double-double in four tournament games, including the last three.\n\nThe Huskies' parade of big bodies crippled the Aztecs’ offensive game plan and made almost every possession an exercise in futility.\n\nPlaying in its first Final Four, San Diego State was led by forward Keshad Johnson's 14 points. Guards Lamont Butler and Darrion Trammell finished with 13 points.\n\n\"We feel good about the things we did,\" Aztecs coach Brian Dutcher said. \"Disappointed in the loss, but there was a brotherhood in that locker room that will never be divided by a margin of victory or not winning at all. That brotherhood will last a lifetime.\"\n\nFor UConn, this national championship joins titles in 1999, 2004, 2011 and 2014. The Huskies are 5-0 in championship games.\n\nThe win also moves UConn past Kansas and into a tie with Duke and Indiana for the fourth-most rings in Division I. UCLA leads with 11, followed by Kentucky with eight and North Carolina with six.\n\nNo other team has more than three titles since 1999. All five of the Huskies’ wins have come since the last national championship for Indiana (1987) and UCLA (1995).\n\nThree coaches are responsible for the program’s five titles: Jim Calhoun in 1999, 2004 and 2011, Kevin Ollie in 2014, and now Hurley.\n\nInheriting a program mired in negativity following Ollie’s controversial dismissal in 2018, Hurley posted a losing record in his first season and had his second year cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tournament bids in the past two seasons ended in the opening round.\n\nBut this year’s team rose as high as No. 2 in the USA TODAY Sports men’s college basketball poll and spent all but the first two polls of the season in the Top 25.\n\nAnd then the Huskies reached the postseason and put together one of the most dominant runs since the tournament expanded in 1985.\n\nThey beat No. 13 Iona 87-63 in the first round, outscoring the Gaels 50-24 in the second half. In the second round, they beat No. 5 Saint Mary’s 70-55.\n\nUConn rolled through the second weekend, beating No. 8 Arkansas 88-65 in the Sweet 16 and No. 3 Gonzaga 82-54 in the Elite Eight to reach the Final Four. After beating No. 5 Miami 72-59 in the national semifinal, UConn became the sixth team since 2000 to reach the championship game by defeating every opponent by a double-digit margin.\n\nPlaying in the West Regional, the Huskies were able to miss No. 1 Kansas, which lost in the second round, and No. 2 UCLA, which fell to Gonzaga in the Sweet 16.\n\nRegardless of the competition, however, this UConn run will go down in history. The Huskies are the first team since the tournament expanded to win the title by defeating every opponent by 13 or more points.\n\n\"I'm just mostly proud of the way we've done it and with the type of people that we've done it, the way we recruit young players, develop young players,\" Hurley said.\n\n\"It's truly been building a program and a culture.

College basketball. Men’s college basketball. Just to be as clear as possible: There were 352 Division I men’s teams during the 2022-23 season, and the No. 5 Aztecs and the No. 4 Huskies are the last two standing.\n\nIt can feel a little hard to believe.\n\nSan Diego State had never reached the Elite Eight before this season. Now, after a thrilling, buzzer-beating epic against No. 9 Florida Atlantic, the Aztecs will look to join UNLV in 1990 as the only current mid-major programs to win the national championship.\n\nConnecticut has won four since 1999, making a case along the way for being counted among the premier brands in the country. Yet the Huskies had made just three tournament appearances and never advanced past the opening weekend since winning the whole thing in 2014.\n\nThese are the factors that will determine Monday night’s championship game:\n\nSan Diego State’s physical (and mental) toughness\n\nFor about a decade, the Aztecs have earned a reputation for being one of college basketball’s toughest teams because of the play of a defense that annually ranks among the nation’s best.\n\nThat has held to form during tournament play. SDSU is giving up an even 60 points per game heading into Monday night while holding opponents to 35.9% shooting from the field and 21.6% from deep.\n\nIn a good analog for what sort of talent and depth they’ll see Monday night, the Aztecs beat overall No. 1 seed Alabama 71-64 in the Sweet 16 and did a number on freshman star and projected lottery pick Brandon Miller, who had just nine points on 3 of 19 shooting.\n\nFAU connected on 44.2% from the field and became the Aztecs’ first opponent since New Mexico on Feb. 25 and the 11th overall to crack the 70-point mark. But FAU was held in check in the second half, hitting on just 8 of 24 attempts as SDSU cut into and then erased the Owls’ lead.\n\nThere’s also something to be said for the Aztecs’ mental toughness. Down 56-42 with under 14 minutes left, SDSU went on a 23-9 run to even the score with 4:24 remaining.\n\nOf course, Lamont Butler’s game-winning jumper will go down as one of the clutch moments in tournament history.\n\nThere's one factor to keep in mind Monday night: SDSU has played a series of close games this tournament — the Aztecs are the first team in tournament history to win Elite Eight and national semifinal games by one point apiece — while UConn has blown out five opponents in a row.\n\nIn a close game, the confidence that comes with these narrow victories will give the Aztecs an edge over the Huskies.\n\nUConn is an unstoppable juggernaut. Right?\n\nWell, it does seem that way.\n\nThe Huskies beat No. 13 Iona by 24 points and No. 5 Saint Mary's by 15 points, both times pulling away after a sluggish first half. UConn dominated the second weekend, dispatching with No. 8 Arkansas by 23 points and No. 3 Gonzaga by 28 points.\n\nAgainst the Hurricanes, the Huskies went up 14-4 after seven minutes and led 37-24 at halftime. After Miami drew within eight points, 53-45, with 11:40 remaining, UConn went on a 7-0 run to push the lead to 60-45 with just over eight minutes left and won 72-59.\n\nIn doing so, the Huskies became the seventh team since 2000 to reach the championship game by defeating every opponent by a double-digit margin. Of the previous six, only 2016 North Carolina failed to win it all.\n\nOver and over again since the start of tournament play, UConn has had the answer. Driven by an electric offense built around the two-man game of forward Adama Sanogo and guard Jordan Hawkins, the Huskies might have the personnel and pace to crack the code of San Diego State's defense.\n\nBut don't sleep on the Huskies' defense, which hasn't allowed more than 70 points in a game since Feb. 25 and has been very impressive the past two games. After Gonzaga hit on just 33% of its attempts from the field, Miami made only 32.3%. The Hurricanes were to convert just 8 of 23 layup attempts against the Huskies’ frontcourt.\n\nThe potential X-factors\n\nSanogo and Hawkins will receive the Aztecs’ undivided attention, leaving the Huskies’ supporting cast in a position to play the deciding role in the championship game.\n\nSenior guard Tristen Newton had seven points, eight assists and five rebounds against the Hurricanes and is averaging 8.5 points, 6.8 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game since the tournament opener against Iona.\n\nFreshman forward Alex Karaban has 31 points and 20 rebounds in his past three games. Freshman center Donovan Clingan has provided a big spark in tournament play, including six rebounds and a block in the win against Miami.\n\nFor SDSU, leading scorer Matt Bradley made only 3 of 17 attempts in wins against Alabama and Creighton but came alive against FAU with a team-leading 21 points. This was Bradley’s first 20-point game since scoring 23 points against UNLV on New Year’s Eve.\n\nContaining Sanogo in the paint will take a team effort. Look for three frontcourt players to share the load in Nathan Mensah, Jaedon LeDee and Aguek Arop.\n\nWhy Connecticut will win\n\nBecause this is a team putting together one of the most dominant runs in NCAA men’s tournament history. The Huskies have beaten five teams by an average of 20.6 points.\n\nBecause Sanogo has been impossible to stop. The Aztecs are terrific defending the perimeter but weaker inside, giving Sanogo an opportunity to take control of the game in the paint.\n\nBecause UConn doesn’t lose on this stage. The program has played in four national championship games and won them all, beating Duke (1999), Georgia Tech (2004), Butler (2011) and Kentucky (2014).\n\nWhy San Diego State will win\n\nBecause this defense has what it takes. Forget that UConn is loaded. Forget that the Huskies are bulldozing everything in their path. The Aztecs have the defensive style and length to disrupt things and turn the tempo and pace of the game in their favor.\n\nBecause Bradley is heating up. His game against FAU could give him the jolt of confidence SDSU needs on the offensive end. More than anything, the Aztecs need a go-to scorer in key moments — Bradley can be that guy.\n\nBecause a wild-and-wacky tournament warrants a wild-and-wacky conclusion. UConn will almost undoubtedly be favored Monday night. But since when does this tournament care about favorites? Underdogs have ruled this tournament, so SDSU winning it all would be the perfect conclusion.\n\nFollow colleges reporter Paul Myerberg on Twitter @PaulMyerberg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2023/04/03/uconn-sdsu-march-madness-ncaa-tournament-championship-game/11588743002/", "title": "Connecticut vs. San Diego State men's national championship game ...", "text": "The No. 4 Connecticut Huskies won their fifth national title Monday, beating the No. 5 San Diego State Aztecs 76-59 in Houston.\n\nUConn has been dominant throughout the tournament, winning each of its games by double digits.\n\nMeanwhile, the Aztecs have lived on the edge.

Lamont Butler and Keshad Johnson chipped in with six points a piece.\n\nUConn surges to 10-point lead over SDSU\n\nThe Connecticut Huskies warmed up fast and lead the San Diego State Aztecs 22-12 with 8:53 on the clock. They went on a 16-2 run, including an 8-0 stretch that put them ahead for the first time in the game. UConn has outrebounded San Diego State 12-8 as the Aztecs have missed their last 12 shots from the field.\n\n“We have to finish at the rim,” head coach Brian Dutcher said on the ESPN broadcast during commercial break.\n\nWho sang national anthem?\n\nThe national anthem before the San Diego State and UConn national championship game was sung by astronaut Tracy Dyson.\n\nShe was selected for the Astronaut Candidate Training program in 1998 and has been on two space flights. She was also a track athlete at Cal State Fullerton before entering the space program.\n\nThe response to Dyson's rendition of the anthem? Well, you can watch it for yourself.\n\nAfter the Aztecs took an early 6-2 lead with back-to-back three-point shots, they led the Huskies for the first five minutes of the game. Connecticut finally caught up with back-to-back field goals — a jumpshot each from Tristen Newton and Adama Sanogo. The game is tied at 10 with 14:42 on the clock.\n\nThe Connecticut Huskies and San Diego State Aztecs tipped off in Houston as they battle for the 2022-23 national championship.\n\nUConn, seeking its fifth title, has won every game of the NCAA tournament by an average of 20.6 points. The Huskies are led by junior forward Adama Sanogo, who is averaging 17.2 points per game and 7.6 rebounds. He had a double-double with 21 points and 10 rebounds in the semifinal win over the Miami Hurricanes. He's followed closely behind by sophomore guard Jordan Hawkins, who averages 16.2 ppg and had 14 in the semifinals after recovering from a stomach bug.\n\nThe Aztecs are the underdogs in their first national championship appearance after losing in the first round the last two seasons. They've made the Sweet 16 twice before, including in 2011 when NBA champion Kawhi Leonard was on the team. Now, senior guard Matt Bradley is their leading scorer, averaging 12.7 points per game while tallying a team-high 21 in the semifinal against Florida Atlantic.\n\nWho will take home the title? We'll find out tonight.\n\nFrom 68 to two. That's what is left of the NCAA men's tournament field after five rounds of play. Neither Connecticut nor San Diego State were popular picks to win the championship. They were seeded fourth and fifth, respectively.\n\nConnecticut and San Diego State will meet Monday night for the national championship.\n\nIn basketball. College basketball. Men’s college basketball. Just to be as clear as possible: There were 352 Division I men’s teams during the 2022-23 season, and the No. 5 Aztecs and the No. 4 Huskies are the last two standing.\n\nIt can feel a little hard to believe.\n\nSan Diego State had never reached the Elite Eight before this season. Now, after a thrilling, buzzer-beating epic against No. 9 Florida Atlantic, the Aztecs will look to join UNLV in 1990 as the only current mid-major programs to win the national championship.\n\nConnecticut has won four since 1999, making a case along the way for being counted among the premier brands in the country. Yet the Huskies had made just three tournament appearances and never advanced past the opening weekend since winning the whole thing in 2014.\n\n— Paul Myerberg\n\nThe men's NCAA Tournament final is slated to begin at 9:20 p.m. ET on Monday and will be broadcast on CBS.\n\nFINAL FOUR RECAP:UConn continues March Madness domination, will play SDSU for title\n\nHOUSTON — If your rooting interest in Monday night’s men’s championship game is up for grabs, may I suggest thinking about the poor, downtrodden undergrad of little-known San Diego State who will wake up this week to weather in the mid-60s with an oh-so-frigid low of 54 degrees and clear sunny.\n\nKidding aside, all of San Diego State’s — let’s call them natural advantages — make what they’ve accomplished there one of the most impressive, organically built powers in college sports.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nJim Nantz reflects on his last men's basketball championship broadcast\n\nEven after calling so many of the biggest sporting events in recent memory — including Super Bowls, Masters tournaments and Final Four battles — Jim Nantz is still basking in the moment.\n\nThe iconic CBS play-by-play broadcaster will call his final NCAA basketball game Monday when No. 4 seed Connecticut and No. 5 seed San Diego State meet in the men's national championship game at NRG Stadium in Houston.\n\nDespite facing his last college basketball broadcast, Nantz told USA TODAY Sports that \"gratitude\" was his prevailing emotion ahead of Monday's title game.\n\nMEMORIES:Jim Nantz reflects on his last NCAA men's basketball championship broadcast: 'I'm nostalgic'\n\n\"This has been such a big part of my life,\" Nantz said. \"It's always tough when you know you're not going to get to go through this again. ... I'm nostalgic but it's not a melancholy feeling right now. It's appreciation ... gratitude.\n\n\"And that's how I'm getting through this weekend with a smile on my face and not weeping.\"\n\n— Richard Morin\n\nHOUSTON — The ball was on the baseline, in nearly an impossible spot, the pass needing to be sent through a thicket of bodies out to the perimeter where Alex Karaban had snuck away from everyone. Only UConn’s Tristen Newton knew where the 6-foot-8 sharpshooter was, and even with his lower body inches from going out of bounds, he fired the ball exactly where it had to go.\n\nSwish.\n\nThat was how the first half ended in UConn’s 72-59 deconstruction of Miami in Saturday’s second national men’s semifinal, and though the game was not technically over, it might as well have been.\n\nIf Miami didn’t know it before, they certainly had to at that moment. UConn just had too many options, too many answers. And with each game on the march to Monday night, the Huskies have proven they’re beyond good.\n\nThey’re inevitable. And San Diego State is going to be the next to find out.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nHOUSTON — San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher didn't bother calling a final timeout because he didn't have a play he wanted to call.\n\nHe didn't need one.\n\nLamont Butler had already won the Aztecs one game this season on a buzzer-beater, no reason to think he couldn't do it again. Even if the stakes were just a tad higher than clinching the Mountain West title.\n\nAfter trailing for the final 27-plus minutes, Butler gave San Diego State the only lead that mattered, draining a pull-up jumper as time expired to stun Florida Atlantic 72-71 in the Final Four on Saturday night.\n\n\"(Coach) told me to go downhill, get something at the rim,\" Butler said. \"They did a good job cutting me off. Once I looked up, it was two seconds left, I knew I had to make a shot.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nHOUSTON — It couldn’t have ended in more heartbreaking fashion, Florida Atlantic falling to San Diego State right at the buzzer Saturday night 72-71.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the team and fans will be left frustrated as the Owls held a 14-point lead with under 15 minutes left in the game, all to be shrunken as time went on.\n\nThe Aztecs completed the third-largest comeback in national semifinals history and fifth largest in a Final Four.\n\nAfter San Diego State’s Lamont Butler scored at the buzzer, Owls head coach Dusty May sat with his hands on his knees for an extended period of time.\n\nRedshirt freshman Nick Boyd said that it’ll serve as motivation to get back to work.\n\n“I'm not dwelling on it much,\" Boyd said. \"I'm happy for our team.

It's a battle-tested team. And obviously I was comfortable with the things we were calling, and the guys were able to manage the situation.\"\n\nAfter a quiet game against Gonzaga (10 points on 3 of 11 shooting), Sanogo scored 13 of his points in the first half when he hit to 3-pointers in the first minutes and made 9 of 11 attempts overall. The junior is averaging 20.2 points and 9.8 rebounds per game in tournament play.\n\nSophomore guard Jordan Hawkins went 3 of 7 from 3-point range and scored 13 points. UConn was also sparked by the play of freshman center Donovan Clingan, who had four points, six rebounds and a block in 13 minutes.\n\nThe Huskies shot 49.1% from the field and held Miami to 32.3% shooting. While Wong led Miami with 15 points, UConn was able to slow down fellow guards Nijel Pack and Brandon Miller, who combined for 19 points on 7 of 20 shooting. It was a disappointing end after the program reached its first Final Four af\n\n\"It's been special each year,\" Miller said.\n\nWe just tried to build what every Miami basketball team should try to reach each season.

Six minutes into the game, Tristen Newton made a 3-point shot to put the Huskies up 14-4. Adama Sanogo had two buckets from behind the arc to build UConn's lead.

So he drove two miles from campus and went to church.\n\nThe purpose of the trip wasn’t prayer, even though the program could have used some. Angelos, then FAU’s athletics director, had gone to meet with Mike Jarvis, the former George Washington and St. John’s coach who had moved to Boca Raton and become an influential member at Spanish River Church. They did the interview right there in the pastor's office.\n\n“He was a great coach, but I also thought, he’s part of this 6,000-member church right by FAU,” said Angelos, now a senior deputy athletics director at Long Island University. “So if we have any of his friends come to games, maybe 100 or 200 or even 1,000 because they want to support their fellow church member, that’s a huge plus. In Boca, you need a guy who can do more than just coach.”\n\n– Dan Wolken\n\nWill Miami's Norchard Omier play football?\n\nHOUSTON — The University of Miami birthed one of the great basketball-to-football conversions of all time when Jimmy Graham, a four-year basketball role player for the Hurricanes, picked up football as a graduate student in 2009.\n\nNFL scouts saw enough of Graham’s size, speed and athleticism in that one year of college football to make him a third-round draft pick.

Such a pity.\n\nAnd to cap off the litany of misery these fragile California souls have to deal with, San Diego State ranks just 20th these days on Newsweek’s list of party schools. What a terrible time that must be.\n\nThank goodness they have a decent basketball team to lift their spirits.\n\n“There’s nothing like San Diego,” said Lamont Butler, who finally provided some joy for these empty, boring lives when he hit a buzzer-beater Saturday night to send the Aztecs one win from an NCAA Tournament title. “You can always go to the beach. The weather is about 75, 80 throughout the year. San Diego is one of the best cities ever.”\n\nSo if that’s the case, what do they need to beat Connecticut for?\n\nKidding aside, all of San Diego State’s — let’s call them natural advantages — make what they’ve accomplished there one of the most impressive, organically built powers in college sports.\n\nNO PLAY, NO PROBLEM:Stunning shot sends San Diego State to title game\n\nBREAKDOWN:Wild tournament ends with San Diego State against Connecticut\n\n'BEAUTIFUL TO SEE': Assistant Mark Fisher, living with ALS, helps San Diego State at Final Four\n\nIf you study the history of how certain schools became great and created long-lasting tradition in a place where it seems unexpected, you’ll often find a sociological component born out of need.\n\nOklahoma football became Oklahoma football because, as Barry Switzer once said, “Oklahomans had a mass inferiority complex” coming out of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression and winning football games was the way out. Notre Dame was a vehicle for Catholic immigrants struggling against discrimination in American society to reach a level of cultural prominence. Without Bear Bryant’s decision to integrate Alabama football against the backdrop of George Wallace’s racism, there would probably be too many scars on the program to overcome even all these years later.\n\nSan Diego State’s two decades of basketball success is built on something different. When it hired Steve Fisher to coach basketball in 1999, the school wasn’t suffering from a bad reputation that only sports success could solve. San Diego, which at the time had the Padres and Chargers, was not lacking for sports viewership options. It wasn’t chasing a conference realignment ghost.\n\nThe Aztecs were simply bad at basketball and thought they should be better, so they constructed a new on-campus arena and set out to build a fan base to fill it by winning some games.\n\n“The challenge that (Fisher) faces is that there has been more interest in this job search than any game we’ve ever played,” then-athletics director Rick Bay told the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nWhile every mid-major who makes an NCAA tournament run dreams of being the next Gonzaga, the reality is that San Diego State is a much more attainable and aspirational model.\n\nFisher, who had won a national title at Michigan but was fired in 1997 due to the fallout from an NCAA investigation, knew how to build a good program. So did Brian Dutcher, who had been on the bench with Fisher since 1989 as a 30-year-old recruiting ace.\n\n“Once you have facilities to draw to, you have a chance,” Dutcher said Sunday.\n\nAnd incrementally, one year at a time, San Diego State cracked the door open to something other than what it had always been — even if it didn’t have a Final Four to show for it until this year.\n\nTake Butler as an example. When you trace the origins of his forever moment Saturday night, you have to start when he was in sixth grade and watching a player by the name of Jeremy Hemsley, who averaged about 10 points a game during his four years with the Aztecs.\n\nHemsley wasn't an All-American or anything, but he played on a couple NCAA Tournament teams and was from Rancho Cucamonga, just a few minutes down the freeway from Moreno Valley. Butler looked up to Hemsley and wanted to go see him play.\n\n“I loved the atmosphere,” Butler said.\n\nFor all the talk of name, image and likeness and transfer portal freedom, those are the moments that truly build programs: One little layer of credibility on top of another, strengthening the roots that were planted when Butler was born.\n\nA recruit of his caliber could have gone to any number of schools on the West Coast, even some in the Power Five. But there was equity in San Diego State that had been ingrained in him from the time he understood what college basketball was about.\n\n“I just think it speaks to how long we've been good,” Dutcher said. “He grew up knowing about San Diego State basketball. We didn’t just show up at the last minute. And it's long relationships that make kids comfortable and want to come to your school, that they feel they know you and have known you a long time.”\n\nMake no mistake: The Aztecs are up against it Monday. Connecticut is bigger, deeper and has more future NBA players. A San Diego State win would be somewhere on the list of biggest title game upsets we’ve seen.\n\nBut even in getting this far, San Diego State is showing that there’s still a reward in this sport for just being really solid and consistent for a really long time.\n\nAs Dutcher acknowledged Sunday, it’s possible the Aztecs have had better teams than this one. Who knows what might have happened in 2020 had COVID-19 not cancelled the NCAA Tournament for a team that was 30-2. Goodness, they had Kawhi Freaking Leonard in 2011 and were good enough to get a No. 2 seed, stopped only by Kemba Walker’s heroics in the Sweet 16.\n\nBut that’s part of the story too. Whether the outcome is good or bad, what the program stands for doesn’t change. Sure, you might have an image of this laidback school by the beach where students spend all day tanning on the main quad. That is not the ethos of what Fisher started and Dutcher continued.\n\nMatt Bradley found that out after transferring from California, where he played his first three seasons. His first summer in San Diego, he did not understand and didn't want to buy into the way the Aztecs played team defense.\n\n“Coming from the Pac-12, it was always ‘guard your yard,’ ” Bradley said. “It’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks. I’m thinking, ‘OK, I can do what I want’ but they’re like, ‘Matt, you'll sit on this bench if you don’t change.’ ”\n\nWin or lose Monday, that’s how it's going to be at San Diego State next year and the year after and the one after that. The program is the program. Making the championship game is simply one more step up the ladder of validation that started more than 20 years ago.\n\n“I don't think we’re a one-hit wonder,” Dutcher said. “We’re going to be good every year.”\n\nAnd even if they're not, it’s still going to be 75 and sunny.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2023/04/03/final-four-title-game-predictions-connecticut-san-diego-state/11588028002/", "title": "Connecticut or San Diego State? Our NCAA Tournament men's title ...", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nFrom 68 to two. That's what is left of the NCAA men's tournament field after five rounds of play. Neither Connecticut nor San Diego State were popular picks to win the championship. They were seeded fourth and fifth, respectively.\n\nBut the Huskies and Aztecs are the lone teams standing, albeit by different methods. Connecticut has steamrolled its opposition, winning all its games by at least 13 points. San Diego State has won its last two games by one point with scores in the final seconds.\n\nNone of that means anything when the teams take the court at NRG Stadium in Houston on Monday night. The one that plays the best will cut down the nets and take home the national title.\n\nBREAKDOWN:Wild tournament ends with San Diego State against Connecticut\n\nNO PLAY, NO PROBLEM:Stunning shot sends San Diego State to title game\n\nINEVITABLE? Connecticut looks overwhelming ahead of championship game\n\nOur staff makes their predictions for the game:\n\nPaul Myerberg\n\nSan Diego State will try to corral UConn on the perimeter and force the Huskies into a more mid-tempo pace. If not able to do so, the Aztecs will be the sixth and final tournament opponent to lose to UConn by double digits. But if it can make UConn more one-dimensional and minimize the impact of shooters such as Jordan Hawkins, SDSU has the chance to win another close one. Connecticut 73, San Diego State 61.\n\nErick Smith\n\nDefense travels. That's always the axiom for teams that excel in limiting opponents. The theory is that you're never out of a game if you're putting together stops. San Diego State has typified this approach in its success throughout the years and this season on its run to the national title game. So the Aztecs have the potential to keep things close and make this an unappetizing rock fight. But part of that winning formula is also being able to score enough points to win the game. Can San Diego State do that against the Huskies, who are averaging 80 points per game? Maybe for a bit. In the end, though, UConn is an irresistible force. Connecticut 70, San Diego State 58.\n\nEddie Timanus\n\nI want an exciting championship game that isn’t decided until the final horn. But I just don’t see it happening. This is not in any way a slight against San Diego State, a program that looks to be on the map to stay thanks to this run to the title game. But this Connecticut squad simply has too many weapons to stop, even for the Aztecs’ well-drilled defense. The Huskies will coast into Nome with the race well in hand. Connecticut 79, San Diego State 61.\n\nDan Wolken\n\nThis seems pretty simple. UConn has been the best team in the tournament. It has more talent, size and depth than San Diego State. The Huskies are extremely well-coached and hungry. If they lose, it's a massive upset. They won't.

The only higher total was 26 in 2011.\n\nThe semifinals matchups are Miami against Connecticut and the Aztecs against the Owls.\n\nThis unique group boasts a combined five previous Final Four bids since the tournament expanded in 1985, four coming from Connecticut.\n\nHIGHS AND LOWS:Winners and losers from Sunday's Elite Eight\n\nPOSTSEASON LINEUP:Complete NCAA men's tournament schedule, results\n\nHere's what you need to know as these teams get set to descend on Houston's NRG Stadium:\n\nNo. 4 Connecticut\n\nThe Huskies' road to the Final Four: No. 13 Iona (87-63), No. 5 Saint Mary's (70-55), No. 8 Arkansas (88-65), No. 3 Gonzaga (82-54).\n\nThis is a team that continues to heat up as they advance deeper into the tournament: Connecticut had spotty first halves in the wins against Iona and Saint Mary’s but put together complete, wire-to-wire games against Arkansas and Gonzaga to get back to the Final Four for the first time since 2014. In doing so, the Huskies became the seventh team to win all four games by 15 or more points in reaching the national semifinals.\n\nAt the heart of this surge has been the play of forward Adama Sanogo, who struggled shooting the ball against Gonzaga but chipped in a career-best six assists. Picking up the slack was sophomore guard Jordan Hawkins, a future first-round pick who has scored at least 20 points in these past two games. If this pair stays hot, the Huskies are going to be very tough to beat.\n\nPlayer to watch: Freshman center Donovan Clingan.\n\nAs shown in an imposing performance in the opener against Iona (12 points and 9 rebounds), Clingan is a critical player off the bench for the Huskies and a potential difference maker on both ends of the court. The 7-foot-2 freshman is averaging 7.1 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.8 per blocks per game in just 13.1 minutes of playing time, providing huge value as part of the Huskies’ supporting cast around Sanogo and Hawkins.\n\nNo. 5 Miami\n\nThe Hurricanes' road to the Final Four: No. 12 Drake (63-56), No. 4 Indiana (85-69), No. 1 Houston (89-75), No. 2 Texas (88-81).\n\nThere was nothing cheap about Miami’s first Final Four trip in program history. The four defeated opponents in the Midwest Regional had a combined seeding of 19, including three of the region’s top four seeds. In comparison, San Diego State’s opponents had a combined seeding of 32 and Connecticut and Florida Atlantic a combined seeding of 31. One year after losing in the Elite Eight, Miami clearly learned from that experience and remained poised and in command even as Texas pulled in front by 13 points with 13:30 left in the second half. Slowly and steadily, the Hurricanes erased the Longhorns' lead.\n\nPlayer to watch: Senior guard Isaiah Wong.\n\nHeld in check in the first half of Sunday’s win against Texas, Wong came alive in the second half and finished with 14 points. The senior All-America pick has alternated between hot and cold during a wobbly tournament but continues to deliver when it counts for the Hurricanes.\n\nNo. 5 San Diego State\n\nThe Aztecs’ road to the Final Four: No. 12 College of Charleston (63-57), No. 13 Furman (75-52), No. 1 Alabama (71-64), No. 6 Creighton (57-56).\n\nSan Diego State is a defensive juggernaut. Terrific throughout the regular season, the Aztecs have taken things to a new level during the tournament:\n\nCharleston shot 32.1% from the field and 20.8% (5 of 24) from 3-point range.\n\nFurman connected on 32% overall and 23.1% (6 of 26) from deep.\n\nAlabama hit on 32.4% and got nothing from star forward Brandon Miller, who was held to nine points on 3 of 19 shooting.\n\nAnd the Blue Jays hit on 40% from the field but only 2 of 17 from 3-point range, with guards Ryan Nembhard and Baylor Scheierman going a combined 6 of 18 for 19 points.\n\nIt’s obvious at this point that no opponent is going to solve what SDSU does defensively. In a tense, high-pressure environment, this consistency on the defensive end makes the Aztecs a very dangerous matchup in the semifinals.\n\nPlayer to watch: Senior guard Matt Bradley.\n\nThe Aztecs advanced past Creighton despite getting just two points from Bradley, the team’s leading scorer. That’s been a bit of trend of late: Bradley had six points while battling foul trouble against Alabama and has made just 6 of 27 shots in the past three games. While junior guard Lamont Butler stepped up with 18 points against the Blue Jays, San Diego State needs Bradley to step up in the semifinals against Florida Atlantic.\n\nNo. 9 Florida Atlantic\n\nThe Owls' road to the Final Four: No. 8 Memphis (66-65), No. 16 Fairleigh Dickinson (78-70), No. 4 Tennessee (62-55), No. 3 Kansas State (79-76).\n\nGoing by seed, Florida Atlantic ranks among the most unexpected Final Four teams in tournament history. As shown in two games at Madison Square Garden, however, the Owls are capable of playing with and beating some of the top teams in the country and a genuine threat to win the national championship. What FAU has is an extreme amount of reliable depth, especially in the backcourt. With the potential to go nine deep in his rotation, coach Dusty May can mix and match personnel, give opponents multiple different looks and keep his team's legs fresh deep into the second half.\n\nBIG SHOCKS:Florida Atlantic among most-surprising Final Four teams\n\nPlayer to watch: Senior guard Michael Forrest.\n\nThe only senior in the Owls' rotation, Forrest was a multiple-year starter before taking on a reserve role this season. After a quiet run of games beginning in the semifinals of the Conference USA tournament — he scored just eight points over a five-game span — Forrest stepped up to spark this Final Four appearance, scoring 11 points against Tennessee and making four clutch free throws in the final seconds to secure the win against Kansas State. He's also played 17 minutes in each of these past two games after logging a combined 19 minutes in the opening two rounds.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/27"}]}

Studies show that employee satisfaction is linked to performance, which permeates through every aspect of a business and can mean the difference between success and failure. While employee satisfaction should be the cornerstone of every serious company’s business model, only a handful of businesses excel at maintaining high employee morale.\n\nBased on employee reviews posted on Glassdoor, an online platform for former and current employees to review companies, 24/7 Wall Street identified the best American companies to work for. Out of a universe of hundreds, only 18 large companies received a score of more than 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nIn an interview with 24/7 Wall Street, Sarah Stoddard, community expert with Glassdoor, listed the factors that have the greatest impact on employee satisfaction. “Glassdoor research has found the top three indicators of employee satisfaction are career opportunities, trust in senior leadership, as well as culture and values,” Stoddard said.\n\nIn keeping with those findings, employee testimony suggests most companies on this list offer growth and development opportunities, have trusted and respected chief executives, and cultures described as fun, motivating, and supportive.\n\nMore:Ask HR: What can a potential employer ask a former employer? How about a health condition?\n\nMore:A majority of U.S. workers are actually satisfied with their jobs\n\nMore:Looking to find a job? These US cities are having an employment slump\n\nHalf of the companies on this list are technology and software firms based on the West Coast. The remaining companies include staffing agencies, management consulting firms, and grocery stores.\n\nThis is not a Glassdoor-commissioned report.\n\n18. Trader Joe's\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.1/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 84 percent\n\n• Employees: N/A\n\n• Industry: Grocery stores\n\n• Headquarters: Monrovia, California\n\nFounded in the 1950s as a convenience store chain known as Pronto Markets, Trader Joe's adopted the now familiar moniker in 1967 and became the grocery store chain we know today. With a current employee review score on Glassdoor of 4.1 out of 5, the company is one of just two grocery stores to rank among the best American companies to work for.\n\nA company's culture and values can have a major impact on employee satisfaction, and positive Trader Joe's employee reviews regularly tout a fun work environment and eclectic crew members. The degree to which the Hawaiian shirt employee uniforms boosts morale is uncertain.\n\n17. Keller Williams\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.1/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 80 percent\n\n• Employees: 186,000\n\n• Industry: Real estate\n\n• Headquarters: Austin, Texas\n\nKeller Williams, the largest real estate franchise in the world by agent count, is the only company in the real estate industry to rank among the best companies to work for. According to Glassdoor research, two of the most important factors in employee satisfaction is trust in senior leadership and career opportunities. At Keller Williams, a self-described culture of education and professional development and a CEO with a 90 percent approval rating may help explain why employee satisfaction is among the highest of any major American company. The company has a 4.1 out of 5 employee satisfaction score based on 2,300 reviews, and 80 percent of Keller Williams agents and staff would recommend a job at the company to a friend.\n\n16. H-E-B\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.1/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 86 percent\n\n• Employees: 110,000\n\n• Industry: Grocery stores\n\n• Headquarters: San Antonio, Texas\n\nFamily owned and operated since its founding in 1905, H-E-B is older than most companies on this list. The San Antonio-based grocer's more than 110,000 employees work across 400 stores in Texas and Mexico, and they appear to have a generally high opinion of the company. Based on nearly 3,000 reviews, H-E-B has a 4.1 out of 5 rating on Glassdoor. Additionally, 86 percent of H-E-B employees would recommend a job with the company to a friend, and CEO Charles Butt has a near-perfect 97 percent approval rating.\n\nHigh employee morale is likely due in part to programs like the company's Partner Stock Plan, which granted eligibility to some 55,000 employees to own company stock.\n\n15. Insight Global\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.1/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 79 percent\n\n• Employees: N/A\n\n• Industry:Staffing\n\n• Headquarters: Atlanta, Georgia\n\nBased on the feedback of over 6,000 current and former employees, Insight Global is one of the best companies to work for in the country. Through 48 offices in North America, Insight Global helps its clients -- many of which are large Fortune 1000 companies -- with staffing, filling about 33,000 positions a year. The company specializes in filling IT, accounting, and engineering positions.\n\nInsight Global CEO Bert Bean, who began working with the company as a recruiter in 2005, enjoys an 89 percent employee approval rating. Bean partially attributes the high morale among workers to the company's policy of promoting from within. Employee reviews on Glassdoor regularly praise the company's work hard, play hard culture.\n\n14. Microsoft\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.1/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 86 percent\n\n• Employees: 131,000\n\n• Industry: Software\n\n• Headquarters: Redmond, Washington\n\nHalf of the best companies to work for are West Coast tech or software companies. None of them are as massive or well-established as Microsoft. Founded by Bill Gates in 1975, the company racked up over $110 billion in sales in fiscal 2018, largely from licensing of its software, which includes the ubiquitous Windows operating system and Office suite.\n\nMicrosoft's 131,000 employees, the majority of whom are in the United States, give their employer high marks. The company has a score of 4.1 out of 5, based on 20,000 reviews on Glassdoor. Reviews regularly tout the company's benefits, work-life balance, and compensation. CEO Satya Nadella is among the most admired in business, with a 96 percent approval rating.\n\n13. Delta Air Lines\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.2/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 85 percent\n\n• Employees: 87,000\n\n• Industry: Airline\n\n• Headquarters: Atlanta, Georgia\n\nDelta is the only airline to rank among the best companies to work for. Positive employee reviews cite the company's benefits most frequently -- and with good reason. Employee family members are eligible for reduced fare, and if willing to wait in standby, travel anywhere in the world is free. Delta also offers a 401k match program and profit sharing program that has distributed over $1 billion to employees in each of the last four years.\n\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian, who took the helm in 2016, has said he intends to make employee satisfaction a top priority. Currently, Bastian enjoys an 88 percent employee approval rating on Glassdoor.\n\n12. Vector Marketing\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.2/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 86 percent\n\n• Employees: N/A\n\n• Industry: Sales\n\n• Headquarters: Olean, New York\n\nVector Marketing is the sales division of Cutco Cutlery, the largest manufacturer of kitchen knives in North America. While Vector Marketing, which hires college students to sell knives, has been sued for unpaid training sessions and exploiting a loophole by classifying managers as contractors rather than employees, people who have worked for the company submitting reviews on Glassdoor appear to have mostly positive things to say.\n\nThe company markets itself as a fun place to work, which likely appeals to college students, its target recruits. Positive reviews regularly cite how income from the job helps pay for tuition. There are many negative reviews, however, that call the company's business model a pyramid scheme, a criticism Vector Marketing rejects on its website.\n\n11. Adobe\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.2/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 85 percent\n\n• Employees: 17,973\n\n• Industry: Software\n\n• Headquarters: San Jose, California\n\nSilicon Valley tech company Adobe is the name behind some of the most popular professional software, including Photoshop, Acrobat, InDesign, and Flash. With an employee satisfaction score of 4.2 out of 5 based on 3,400 reviews, it is also one of the best companies to work for. Employee reviews regularly mention the company's work-life balance and generous benefits, which include 26 weeks paid maternity leave, 16 weeks paid paternity leave, and four weeks paid family leave. Employees of with five years tenure also eligible for a four-week sabbatical, and those who have stayed for 10 years get five weeks.\n\nAdobe CEO Shantanu Narayen also gets high marks from company employees, with a near-perfect 96 percent approval rating on Glassdoor.\n\n10. Intuit\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.2/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 85 percent\n\n• Employees: 8,900\n\n• Industry: Software\n\n• Headquarters: Mountain View, California\n\nIntuit is the California-based software company behind the popular finance management programs TurboTax, Mint, and QuickBooks. Intuit employees who review the company on Glassdoor not only applaud the company for its work-life balance and generous compensation and benefits, but also its culture. Intuit encourages its employees to spend 10 percent of their working day pursuing a passion of theirs for professional development.\n\nConfidence in the company's senior leadership is also strong. Intuit CEO Brad Smith has a near-perfect 97 percent employee approval rating. Older than most tech companies on this list, Intuit was founded in 1983 and went public in 1993.\n\n9. VMware\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.2/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 85 percent\n\n• Employees: 18,000\n\n• Industry: Software\n\n• Headquarters: Palo Alto, California\n\nVMware's business is developing technology that powers applications, services, and experiences worldwide. It is one of several Silicon Valley-based tech companies to rank among the best companies to work for. Based on 4,200 reviews, the company has a score of 4.2 out of 5 and 85 percent of employees would recommend a job at the company to a friend. Interesting work with cutting-edge technology is a common theme among positive reviews. With a 96 percent approval rating, CEO Pat Gelsinger has the confidence of his employees.\n\n8. Uber\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.2/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 83 percent\n\n• Employees: 16,000\n\n• Industry: Technology\n\n• Headquarters: San Francisco, California\n\nWhat started less than 10 years ago as an app that allows users to share a car ride with the push of a button is now one of the most valuable private companies in the world -- and one of the best companies to work for. Drivers who work for the company can make their own schedule, which allows for flexibility and better work-life balance and helped the company earn a score of 4.2 out of 5 on Glassdoor.\n\nAfter a series of scandals and bad press, which culminated in the resignation of co-founder Travis Kalanick from the top spot in June 2017, the new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, appears to be earning his keep. After a full year on the job, Khosrowshahi has a 94 percent approval rating and is focused on improving morale and Uber's public image.\n\n7. Manpower\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.3/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 90 percent\n\n• Employees: 29,000\n\n• Industry: Staffing services\n\n• Headquarters: Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nBased on nearly 3,000 reviews, staffing firm Manpower has a score of 4.3 out of 5 on Glassdoor, and nine out of 10 employees would recommend a job at the company to a friend. The staffing company works to match and place people in different jobs, an endeavour many Manpower employees report finding rewarding. Positive reviews also often cite work-life balance and an appreciation of coworkers.\n\nWhile many other reviews mention good pay, average salaries at Manpower are less than those at the vast majority of other companies on this list. The average salaries for staffing specialists and programmer analyst, the two most common jobs reported on Glassdoor, are $36,700 and $59,900, respectively -- a far cry from the six-figure salaries at many other companies on this list.\n\n6. McKinsey & Company\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.3/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 88 percent\n\n• Employees: 27,000\n\n• Industry: Consulting\n\n• Headquarters: New York, New York\n\nManhattan-based McKinsey & Company is one of two management consulting firms to rank among the best companies to work for. Positive reviews regularly cite the company's culture, growth opportunities, and smart and talented coworkers. Compensation also likely helps employee morale as the most common jobs at the company come with six-figure salaries on average, according to reviews on Glassdoor.\n\nLike many other companies on this list, McKinsey makes social consciousness a central part of its mission. Through service initiatives and pro bono consulting, the company has supported more than 1,000 nonprofit organizations, including local charities and academic organizations in the last two years.\n\n5. Salesforce\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.3/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 88 percent\n\n• Employees: 29,000\n\n• Industry: Software\n\n• Headquarters: San Francisco, California\n\nCalifornia-based technology companies like Salesforce are no strangers to this list. As with many other best companies to work for, Salesforce employees reviewing the company commonly report six-figure salaries and would likely recommend a job at the company to a friend. Salesforce is unique in at least one notable way -- its 1-1-1 philanthropy model, which dedicates 1 percent of the company's equity, 1 percent of its product, and 1 percent of its employees' time to give back to communities in need around the world. Hundreds of positive reviews mention the 1-1-1 model and the company culture.\n\nSalesforce was founded in 1999 by Marc Benioff, its current chief executive. Benioff has a near-perfect 97 percent employee approval rating on Glassdoor.\n\n4. LinkedIn\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.4/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 88 percent\n\n• Employees: 11,800\n\n• Industry: Social media\n\n• Headquarters: Sunnyvale, California\n\nLinkedIn is an online networking platform designed to connect professionals and job seekers. The company, founded in 2003 and acquired by Microsoft -- another company on this list -- in 2016, now boasts over 562 million users -- and some of the most satisfied employees in the country. Like other Silicon Valley-based tech companies, LinkedIn employees cite the company's culture and benefits in positive reviews. Benefits include free food, onsite fitness centers, dry cleaning, oil changes, a 401k match, and 17 paid holidays, including a full week off for July 4th.\n\nHigh salaries also are the norm at LinkedIn, with average compensation for many common positions topping six-figures.\n\n3. Google\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.4/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 89 percent\n\n• Employees: 80,110 (parent company)\n\n• Industry: Software\n\n• Headquarters: Mountain View, California\n\nOver the two decades since its founding, Google developed into the preeminent internet search engine, one of the most heavily trafficked websites in the world, and one of several Silicon Valley-based tech firms to rank among the best American companies to work for. Google employees reviewing the company appreciate the company's benefits and perks, which include free food and coffee made by baristas in every building. Other benefits include onsite gyms, free workout classes, and shuttles for free and easy commuting.\n\nEmployees also appear confident in the company's leadership. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has a near-perfect 95 percent approval rating on Glassdoor.\n\n2. Facebook\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.5/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 91 percent\n\n• Employees: 25,105\n\n• Industry: Social media\n\n• Headquarters: Menlo Park, California\n\nOne of the most recognizable brands in the world, Facebook is also one of the best places to work. With a Glassdoor score of 4.5 out of 5, the social media platform beats all other major tech companies in Silicon Valley in employee satisfaction. Facebook employees are in the unique position of touching many lives around the world as the social media site has over 2.1 billion monthly users -- equivalent to over a quarter of the global population. Like many other tech companies in Silicon Valley, Facebook employees have access to free meals at work, and employees applaud the corporate culture and appreciate their coworkers.\n\nThe company is headed by Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded the company in a Harvard dorm-room in 2004. A trusted leader, Zuckerberg has a near-perfect 96 percent employee approval rating.\n\n1. Bain & Company\n\n• Glassdoor rating: 4.7/5\n\n• Employees who would recommend working at company: 95 percent\n\n• Employees: 8,000\n\n• Industry: Consulting\n\n• Headquarters: Boston, Massachusetts\n\nWith a 4.7 out of 5 score on Glassdoor, Bain & Company, one of the world's preeminent consulting firms, is the best American company to work for. Positive reviews often mention the company's impact on global business, management's prioritization of work-life balance, and the ample opportunities for learning and professional development. High salaries also likely help morale, as Bain consultants typically report six-figure salaries.\n\nNearly every current or former Bain employee -- 95 percent -- who has reviewed the company on Glassdoor said they would recommend a job at the company to a friend, and though Bain CEO Manny Maceda has been at the helm for less than a year, he currently has a 99 percent approval rating.\n\nDetailed findings\n\nWhile Glassdoor identified career opportunities, trust in senior leadership, and company culture as the factors most closely tied to employee satisfaction, job seekers often put greater emphasis on other factors when looking for work.\n\n“When job seekers are looking for their next opportunity, salary is the number one factor they consider,” Stoddard said.\n\nIndeed, a paycheck is the reason most of us go to work in the first place -- and many companies on this list likely attract flocks of applicants by offering generous compensation packages. Average salaries for many common positions at Silicon Valley tech companies like Adobe, Facebook, and Google are in the six-figure range. The same can be said for management consulting firms like McKinsey and Bain.\n\nWhile Google, Facebook, and the other tech companies on this list offer well-paying jobs, salary alone does not explain high employee satisfaction. “Tech employees and tech employers are excited about the opportunity to work on products that have the potential to make an impact on thousands, if not millions, of people's lives,” Stoddard said.\n\nMeanwhile, the high employee satisfaction at staffing and consulting firms also often stems from the rewarding nature of the work, though in slightly different ways. “[Consultants] have the opportunity to work with other companies to solve really big complicated problems [...] and really help a company grow,” Stoddard explained.\n\nAt staffing agencies like Insight Global and Manpower, workers often derive satisfaction by helping others succeed. “Somebody working for a staffing company has the opportunity to help other people find jobs that they’re passionate about and so there's this inherent interest from employees to really help other people find opportunities that will fit their lives,” Stoddard said.\n\nTrust in senior leadership also appears to be a precondition for high employee satisfaction. In every company on this list, CEOs have approval ratings of at least 87 percent. For several companies on this list, CEOs have near perfect ratings of 95 percent or higher.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine America’s best companies to work for, 24/7 Wall St. independently reviewed employee ratings and testimonials on Glassdoor retrieved on Sept. 8, 2018 – this is not a Glassdoor.com commissioned report. Employee satisfaction is measured by Glassdoor on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is very dissatisfied and 5 is very satisfied. Only companies with scores of 4.1 or higher made our list. In cases where two companies had the same score, the one with more reviews ranked better on our list. Glassdoor ratings are based on current and former employee reviews and calculated using a proprietary algorithm that favors more recent reviews.\n\nTo be considered, a company had to have a minimum of 2,000 reviews on Glassdoor and be currently operating and headquartered in the United States. Government agencies, as well as nonprofit companies, were excluded from our analysis. Employee totals and revenue figures are for the most recent fiscal year available, and employee counts are sometimes listed as rounded figures when provided as such by companies or in official documents. Sources include company documents and Securities and Exchange Commission filings. In the case of subsidiaries for which profit or employment was not broken down, we used parent company figures and noted them as such. Employment information for private companies was often unavailable.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The Journal has denied the accusations and demanded the American journalist be released.\n\nEmma Tucker, editor-in-chief of the Journal, said Gershkovich’s family is “relieved to know we finally have contact with Evan” after the outlet previously reported a lawyer and representatives from the U.S. Embassy were denied access to him in jail. Gershkovich is being kept behind bars for two months pending an investigation and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\n“They said Evan’s health is good, and he is grateful for the outpouring of support from around the world,” Tucker said. “We continue to work with the White House, State Department and relevant U.S. government officials to secure Evan’s release.”\n\nThe Biden administration has said Gershkovich’s release is a top priority. He is the first U.S. correspondent since the Cold War to be detained on charges of espionage.\n\n“These charges are ridiculous. Evan is not a spy,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.\n\n– Jeanine Santucci and The Associated Press\n\nRussia warns of 'retaliatory measures'\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement warning Finland's membership in NATO would have a \"negative impact\" on relations between the two neighbors. Russia \"will be forced to take retaliatory measures of a military-technical and other nature\" to stop perceived threats, the statement said. Details on those steps will depend on the conditions for Finland's integration into NATO, according to the statement.\n\n\"We are convinced that history will judge this hasty step taken by the authorities of this country without due regard for public opinion by organizing a referendum and a thorough analysis of the consequences of NATO membership,\" the statement said.\n\nWHAT IS NATO? History, facts, members and why it was created\n\nRussian military, Wagner mercenaries remain at odds: US official\n\nLeaders of the Russian military and Wagner, its associated mercenary group, have been squabbling over the direction of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior Defense Department official. This comes after Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin recently complained that the military is providing his thousands of soldiers with insufficient ammunition.\n\nBattle lines in Ukraine have remained largely static, with heavy exchanges of artillery fire between Russia and Ukrainian forces backed by the U.S. and its Western allies. There has been not significant movement in recent weeks, said the official, who briefed reporters Tuesday on conditions set by the Pentagon.\n\nThe infighting among Russian commanders comes as Ukraine prepares an expected counteroffensive and the U.S. released another $2.5 billion in military aid. The official also said the Pentagon has trained about 4,000 Ukrainian troops split into brigades that will operate Stryker and Bradley armored personnel carriers. Training on U.S. Abrams tanks being sent to Ukraine has not yet occurred, the official said.\n\nThe Pentagon will also be buying trucks designed to carry 30mm guns that can shoot down Iranian drones that Russia has bought from Iran, the official said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUS to provide Ukraine with another $2.5 billion in military aid\n\nThe U.S. will send Ukraine about $500 million in ammunition and equipment and will spend more than $2 billion to buy an array of munitions, radar and other weapons in the future, Blinken said in a statement. The package includes more ammunition for U.S.-provided HIMARS – light, multiple-rocket launchers – air defense interceptors, artillery rounds, anti-armor systems, small arms, heavy equipment transport vehicles, and maintenance support \"essential to strengthening Ukraine’s defenders on the battlefield,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"This new security assistance will allow Ukraine to continue to bravely defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war,\" Blinken said.\n\nWHAT IS NATO? History, facts, members and why it was created\n\nFinland's entry into NATO doubles alliance's border with Russia\n\nFinland's move to join NATO was triggered by Russia's attack on Ukraine last year. Alarmed by the invasion, the long-neutral country applied to join in May, along with neighboring Sweden, seeking protection under the organization's security umbrella.\n\nFinland shares an 832-mile border with Russia, and the accession into NATO delivers a major blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long complained about the alliance's expansion toward his country.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized the strategic benefits of Finland's entry during remarks Monday, saying the country \"will bring to the alliance substantial military forces – well trained, well equipped with also a large reservist army.\" Finland's membership will also \"more than double the size of the alliance's border with Russia,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nTurkey last to ratify; Sweden still waiting\n\nTurkey, the last country to ratify Finland's NATO membership, sent official documents on Tuesday to Blinken, clearing the final hurdle for the country's entry.\n\nMeanwhile, Sweden, which applied for NATO membership along with Finland in May, is still waiting to win approval, something Stoltenberg expects in the coming weeks. Sweden has yet to fully implement new counter-terror legislation urged by Turkey that comes into effect June 1.\n\nTurkish President President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has accused Sweden of \"opening its arms” to the PKK and other groups classified as terrorist organizations by Turkey.\n\n\"I'm absolutely confident that Sweden will become a member,\" Stoltenberg said, adding that Finland's ratification was the fastest in NATO's modern history. \"It's a priority for NATO, for me to ensure that happens as soon as possible. \"\n\nWhat is NATO?\n\nNATO is an intergovernmental military alliance including two North American countries – the U.S. and Canada – and now 29 European countries. It was founded April 4, 1949 – exactly 74 years ago – after the end of World War II.\n\nWith the signing of the alliance, NATO countries agreed to collective defense, meaning an attack on one ally should be considered an attack on all.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/05/16/finland-soviet-war-1939-nato/9749755002/", "title": "As Finland joins NATO, look back at 1939 Soviet invasion", "text": "The complicated relationship between Russia and Finland is yet again in a state of decline.\n\nFinland formally joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the world's largest military alliance, on Tuesday as its 31st member.\n\nIn 2022, Finland officially applied to become a member of NATO during a news conference at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki.\n\n“This is a historic day. A new era begins,” Finish president Sauli Niinisto said at the time.\n\nSupport for joining NATO jumped by 25% last year in Finland since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in February, according to poll results reported by France24.\n\nThe historic move comes after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which stirred fears in countries that border Russia.\n\n“You (Russia) caused this. Look in the mirror,” Niinisto said.\n\nMoscow has warned Finland of “military-technical” retaliation if it is successful in joining.\n\nFinland remained neutral since a 1948 treaty with the Soviet Union and independent since 1917. The Nordic country shares an 830-mile border with Russia.\n\n“Finland’s accession to NATO will cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations,” the Russian foreign ministry wrote in a statement. “Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop the threats to its national security that arise in this regard.”\n\nSoviet Union invades Finland in 1939\n\nAs tensions continue to escalate among Russia, Finland and Sweden, there was a lesser-known attack that was pivotal in Finnish and Russian political relations: the ‘Winter War’ of 1939-1940, also known as the Russo-Finnish War.\n\nThe invasion began near the start of WWII after Poland was split up by Germany and the Soviets in 1939, according to Britannica.\n\nStunted from losses to Germany, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939 after it declined a 30-year lease for a naval base at Hanko in exchange for Soviet land.\n\nThe Soviets aimed to expand their border from Leningrad, strengthen the security of St. Petersburg, seize several islands in the Gulf of Finland and stop potential aid to Germany.\n\nOne million Soviet troops attacked the heavily outnumbered Finns on several fronts. After the Red Army breached Finland's southern barrier and captured the city of Viipuri, the two nations signed the Treaty of Moscow on March 12, 1940.\n\nSoviet victory came with a high price, with nearly 127,000 dead or missing soldiers. Finland lost about 25,000 in the war.\n\nA War of continuation\n\nDespite reaching an agreement, relations between Finland and the Soviet Union soured after Finland allowed German troops transit through the country and took arms against the Soviets.\n\nThe \"War of Continuation\" ended in 1944 when Finland signed an armistice, which recognized the 1940 Treaty of Moscow and declared the removal of German troops from the country.\n\nThe formal end of the Soviet-Finnish conflict came with the signing of a peace treaty in Paris in February 1947. Soviets gained western Karelia and began construction of a Soviet naval base on the Hanko Peninsula.\n\nDespite the existence of a Soviet military base in Porkkala until 1955, Finland expressed a desire to remain neutral and maintain peace in a treaty with the Soviet Union, the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual assistance of 1948, according to NATO.\n\nFinland was unable to join any organization considered hostile to the Soviet Union as a mutual defense provision in the 1948 treaty, which was later extended in 1955, 1970, and 1983, according to Britannica.\n\nFinland reached a new agreement with Russia in 1992, which pledged to settle disputes peacefully, after the Soviet Union fell in 1991.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/15/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/9782993002/", "title": "Ukraine: Finland to apply to NATO; Russian effort slows", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, May 15.

'Consequences you have never seen': How to read Putin's nuclear threats\n\nPUTIN'S RICHES:A port city, a steel cage, a palace: The steps that made Putin 'the richest man in the world'\n\nUkrainian official weighs in on Finland, Sweden in NATO\n\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna said on ABC News' \"This Week\" that the likely acceptance of Finland and Sweden into NATO would show the alliance has learned from how it handled Ukraine's 2008 membership application.\n\nOne of the mistakes to learn from, Stefanishyna said, was \"making promises without delivering on decisions in terms of membership, which has basically led to three wars, two of which are now happening on Ukrainian territory.\"\n\nFinland formally announced Sunday it would seek entry into NATO, citing the Russian invasion as a major factor, and Sweden’s governing party endorsed a bid for membership, which could lead to an application in days.\n\nBoth nations are hoping to avoid the brutal assault Ukraine is now trying to repel. Stefanishyna noted Russian troops are now pulling away from major areas in western Ukraine, but her country is not \"overly optimistic.\"\n\n\"We see that Putin has readjusted his strategy,\" she said, adding, \"the only possible winning scenario for him is the long-lasting war, which is not the case for us and for the democratic world.\"\n\nRepublicans visit Kyiv:Sen.

He noted Finland and Sweden, unlike some members of the Western alliance, would likely be in a position to pay their NATO obligations and would offer significant military capabilities.\n\nFinland makes it official, says it wants to join NATO\n\nFinnish leaders expressed their support for joining NATO last week, and on Sunday they formalized their intentions by announcing the Nordic nation will apply for membership.\n\nPresident Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin declared their intent at a news conference at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki. “This is a historic day.

Gretchen Whitmer and Finland's economic minister signed on March 4, 2020, shortly before COVID-19 short-circuited the world.\n\nWe have trees, water and factories, the theory went, while they have trees, water and raw materials for batteries, so everyone should get together to chat about things like mobility, smart shipping, forest bio-economy industries, and whether to snag a Slows brisket sandwich or perhaps go with a chicken-and-bacon Yardbird from the assortment set out for lunch.\n\nWhen I met him at the glass-walled headquarters of the Detroit/Wayne County Port Authority early Thursday, executive director Mark Schrupp said the travelers and hosts were at \"the relationship-building stage.\"\n\nSchrupp's background includes leaving a high-priced law firm to become a teacher in the Chicago Public Schools.\n\nMore:Examining the case for a ban on body armor after mass shooting in Buffalo\n\nMore:New RiverWalk park plants a question: How do you spend $1.2B on deadline?\n\nThese days, he said, he's interested in expanding marine transportation in Detroit, \"because we know that's the greenest way to move vehicles and goods.\"\n\nSpecifically, he envisions using the river as a highway, with a fleet of boats smaller than a typical freighter zipping parts and pickups to destinations reached now by trains and trucks.\n\nHe's on the prowl for $2.2 million to pave the Detroit docks to accommodate cars, and $200,000 for a feasibility study for an agricultural port.\n\n\"We could be an outlet for Michigan farmers to get their products to the world,\" he suggested.\n\nThen the second-floor elevator chimed. \"Our Finns are here,\" he said.\n\nGreen and happy\n\nThe Finns, it turned out, had spent Tuesday in the Upper Peninsula, feeling very much at home, and Wednesday at Michigan State University and the capital, feeling very much impressed.\n\nDelegation leader Ulla Lainio, the commercial counselor for Business Finland at the embassy in Washington, D.C., knew the U.P. had once been a destination for Finnish miners. But that was a long time ago.\n\n\"It was an exceptionally warm reception,\" she said, with Finnish flags and Finnish speakers and even Finlandia University in Hancock. \"I haven't seen anything like that.\"\n\nThe delegation flew to its first stop, then rolled across the U.P. and down to Lansing in a motorcoach. Through the window, trade and economic affairs counselor Heli Hyypia said, the greenery reminded her of home.\n\nThe United Nations-sponsored World Happiness Report, however, has never awarded us anything. Finland has been at the top of the list for five straight years.\n\n\"Finns tend to joke about that,\" said cultural counselor Suvi Jarvela-Hagstrom. But after half a decade, \"it makes you think there's something to it.\"\n\n\"It's trust,\" she said. \"We trust each other. We trust the authorities.\"\n\nAs for the most recent runner-up, Denmark, \"it's not a bad place either.\"\n\nApprehension and optimism\n\nNot surprisingly, the delegates were less kind to Russia. The Finnish parliament voted 188 to 8 last week to pursue membership in NATO, and polls say 75% of the populace likes the idea.\n\nIn terms of a possible invasion, Lainio said she has seen interviews with people living near the border, \"and they're so used to it, they're not really concerned.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" Hyypia said, \"we're more concerned about the unprovoked war with Ukraine.\"\n\nBack on the topics of the meeting, Vesa Koivumaa was talking about the decarbonization and digitalization of the shipping industry.\n\nAs the U.S. head of growth for Wartsila, a Finnish company that makes and services marine power sources, he has lived in Houston for 18 years. He's married to a Texan and speaks Finnish to their 11-year-old daughter, who attends a Mandarin language immersion school.\n\nHe can say decarbonization and digitalization in most of his multiple languages without so much as a stumble. The first refers to alternative fuels: Tests are underway on hydrogen, ammonia and methanol.

Ukrainian Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, who is still in the bunkers beneath the steel plant, told CNN on Wednesday that civilians \"that we knew about\" had evacuated, but it was unknown whether some may have been left behind.\n\n\"I cannot tell you for sure, maybe there’s someone else further down in the territory because no international organization at any point came or had access to come and assess the situation,\" he said.\n\nThe Azov Regiment said on social media that Russian forces carried out 38 airstrikes in the previous 24 hours at the steel plant.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine is attempting to strike a deal with Russia to allow injured fighters to evacuate from the plant, offering to release Russian prisoners of war in exchange.\n\nUS: Sanctions preventing Russia from making more weapons\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said a ban on sales of semiconductors and other technology to Russia by the U.S. and its allies is having a serious impact on Russia’s ability to manufacture military equipment.\n\n“We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian equipment, military equipment, on the ground, it’s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators,” Raimondo said Wednesday during a Senate hearing, adding that she met a few weeks ago with Ukraine’s prime minister.\n\nRaimondo said two of Russia’s tank manufacturing plants have shut and many of its auto makers have furloughed workers and closed down.\n\n“And so the point is, we are having a very serious effect,” she said. “What we need to do in order to continue this is enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.”\n\nRaimondo said U.S. exports of technology to Russia are down nearly 70% since late February when the Biden administration, in coordination with European and Asian allies, imposed sanctions and export controls on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCivilian killed by Ukrainian shelling, Russian official claims\n\nThe governor of a Russian region near the border of Ukraine said Wednesday that shelling from the Ukrainian side killed one civilian and injured six.\n\nBelgorod Gov.

That will be followed by a debate in Finland’s parliament early next week and a vote that is almost sure to be “strongly in favor of membership,” Tuppurainen told USA TODAY while she was in Washington attending a high-level security conference.\n\n“We want to defend our freedom and our equality,” she said. “This is not only about territories and borders. This war is also about values and ideology.”\n\nNoting that Finland shares an 830-mile border with Russia, Tuppurainen said she hopes her country’s application would be approved swiftly. NATO members adhere to a collective defense that views an attack on one as an attack on all. But that security guarantee would not apply while Finland’s bid is under consideration.\n\nTuppurainen said her country is acutely aware of the threats Russian officials have made against Finland if it goes ahead with the NATO bid.\n\n“We know our neighbor ...

Biden, in an opinion piece published by CNN, says you don't have to \"see the sorrow with your eyes because you can feel it with your heart.\"\n\nBiden also visited Ukrainian refugees in Romania and Slovakia. She said the mothers she spoke with told her about the horrors of bombs that fell night after night as they sought to find refuge during journeys out of their homeland. Many had to live days without food and sunlight, harbored in basements underground, Biden wrote. Border guards in Slovakia told stories of thousands of people with few belongings scrambling to escape the carnage.\n\n\"Kahlil Gibran once wrote, 'The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain,'\" Biden said. \"My hope is that this is true for the mothers I met.

If found guilty of premeditated murder, Shishimarin could face a sentence of up to life in prison. A trial date is expected to be announced this week, Venediktova's office told USA TODAY. Ukrainian authorities unveiled their first war crimes charges late last month connected to alleged incidents in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, in March.\n\nWives of trapped Ukraine soldiers plead with pope for help\n\nThe wives of two Ukrainian soldiers holed up in a Mariupol steel mill met with Pope Francis on Wednesday, asking him to help arrange evacuation of the troops before Russian soldiers overrun the sprawling plant.\n\nYuliia Fedusiuk, who met with the pope at the conclusion of his weekly general audience in the Vatican's St. Peter’s Square, said food and water were running out in the mill, that some soldiers were injured and dead and that the survivors were ready to lay down their arms. But they want to be evacuated to a third country, concerned that they would be tortured and killed if they surrendered to the Russians.\n\n“You are our last hope. We hope you can save their lives,\" said Kateryna Prokopenko, who wept as she greeted Francis. \"Please don’t let them die.\"\n\nSanctions slowing ability of Russia to replenish precision weaponry\n\nSanctions that prevent Russia from obtaining electronic parts have taken a “bite” out of its ability to replenish precision-guided weapons, a Pentagon official said. The official, who is not authorized to speak publicly about intelligence assessments, said there are signs that Russian supplies of precision weapons are dwindling, forcing the Russians to rely on older bombs that are not guided to their targets with satellites or lasers.\n\nSo-called “dumb bombs” are being dropped in Mariupol, causing hundreds of civilian deaths and devastation to homes and businesses.\n\nUS, Europe condemn Russian cyberattack prior to invasion\n\nThe United States, the European Union and Britain collectively blamed Russia for a cyberattack on Ukraine that happened only one hour before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion Feb. 24. The cyberattack disrupted satellite communications used by Ukraine’s military and also affected European countries, according to a statement from the EU released Tuesday.\n\n\"Cyberattacks targeting Ukraine, including against critical infrastructure, could spill over into other countries and cause systemic effects putting the security of Europe’s citizens at risk,\" the statement said.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Tuesday the cyberattack was only one in a series that began in mid-January. Russia's digital attacks on Ukraine included stolen and deleted data, disrupted telecommunications and attempts to knock out power.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/europe/russia-arctic-military-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia's militarization of the Arctic shows no sign of slowing down ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia has continued expanding its military bases in the Arctic region despite significant losses in its war on Ukraine, according to a new series of satellite images obtained by CNN.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also told CNN in an exclusive interview on Friday there is now “a significant Russian military build-up in the high north,” with recent tensions causing the alliance to “double its presence” in response.\n\nThe findings also come as a senior Western intelligence official told CNN Russia has withdrawn as much as three quarters of its land forces from the High North region near the Arctic, sending them to bolster its faltering invasion of its neighbor, Ukraine.\n\nThe satellite pictures, obtained by CNN from Maxar Technologies, show a series of Russian radar bases and runways undergoing improvements over the past year. The images do not show dramatic development, but rather the continued progress of fortifying and expanding an area analysts say is of vital importance to Russia’s defensive strategy, at a time of great strain on Moscow’s resources.\n\nAccording to Maxar, the images demonstrate continued work on the radar stations at the Olenegorsk site, on the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia, and at Vorkuta, just north of the Arctic circle. They also appear to show work moving ahead to complete one of five Rezonans-N radar systems at Ostrovnoy, a site located by the Barents Sea, near Norway and Finland in Russia’s west. The Rezonans-N are claimed by Russian officials to be able to detect stealth aircraft and objects.\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies At Tiksi air defense site, towards the East of Russia's arctic region, satellite imagery shows three radomes (which protect radar systems) have been built up between this October and last. The remote Russian military Arctic base is located on the coast of the Laptev Sea. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nThree new radomes, the weatherproof enclosures used to protect radar antennas, were completed this year at the Tiksi air defense site, in the far northeast, according to Maxar’s images and analysis. There are also improvements to a runway and parking apron at Nagurskoye air base – Russia’s northernmost military facility – and runway improvements at ‘Temp’ air base, on Kotelny Island, in the northeast of the country.\n\nRussia has been bolstering its defenses in the far north for years, refurbishing a series of old Soviet bases with modern designs and equipment.\n\nIts Arctic region has long been key to its oil and gas sector, but also to its nuclear defenses, with a significant proportion of its sophisticated nuclear weaponry and submarine facilities in that area.\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies On the arctic Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia, change is visible at the Olenegorsk Radar Station, including a new building compared to the imagery from June last year. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\n“That deterrence has always been ready,” said a senior Western intelligence official. “It’s never down to low readiness; it’s a high status all the time,” the official said.\n\nAt the start of the war with Ukraine in February some submarines were repositioned to signal “this is a real capability,” the official added, but they soon returned to standard high readiness.\n\nNATO chief Stoltenberg reasoned: “The shortest way from Russia to North America is over the Arctic North Pole. So the strategic importance of these areas has not changed because of the war in Ukraine.”\n\n“We see Russia reopening old Soviet bases, military sites,” he said, noting that it is also “testing novel weapons in the Arctic and the high north.”\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Build-up continued between August this year and last at the Ostrovnoy site located by the Barents Sea, near Norway and Finland in Russia's west. One of five new Rezonans-N radars, which Russia claim can find stealth jets, is located here. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\n“It is significant that they have managed to shelter this area from the impact of the Ukrainian war”, said Malte Humpert of the Arctic Institute, who has written extensively on the development of the Arctic.\n\n“They are prioritising energy resources in the Arctic, but another aspect is to project power. Yet this is also economic. About 20% of Russia’s GDP comes from the Arctic area, and that may be more in the future. There is a lot of money involved in the area for them.”\n\nThe war in Ukraine has led to a major adjustment in Russia’s troop strengths in the region, the senior Western intelligence official said. “They’re down to somewhere between 20 and 25% of their original land forces up there. But then the naval component is totally untouched by the war,” they noted.\n\nFollowing strikes earlier this month on two key airfields deep inside Russia in Ryazan and Saratov, Russian military jets and bombers have been dispersed across the country and the Arctic north, the official added. Moscow has blamed the strikes on Ukraine, while Kyiv has offered no comment on the explosions at the Russian bases.\n\nThe Arctic is also vital to Russia because its melting ice is rapidly opening up new shipping routes from Asia’s southeast to Europe, using a much shorter path along the Russian coast.\n\nAt Russia's northernmost military facility, the runway at Nagurskoye airfield has visibly progressed over the last year despite Russia's war on Ukraine. Nagurskoye is one of several \"trefoil\" bases featuring a three-pronged building in the colours of the Russian flag. The base, located in Alexandra Land far up in the Arctic Circle, was built by the Soviets in the 50s, and has been refitted since 2015. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nThe Northern Sea Route could cut around two weeks off the current journey time across the Suez Canal. Russian state TV has reveled in the launch of several atomic-powered icebreakers, designed to boost Russian influence and power in the region. Critics say Moscow is seeking to exert outsized control over a route that should be equally accessible to all nations.\n\nSpeaking via videolink at the launch of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker in St. Petersburg last month (November 22), Russian President Vladimir Putin said the development of the “most important” Northern Sea Route “will allow Russia to fully reveal its export potential and to establish effective logistics routes, including to southeast Asia.”\n\nAt the same time, the war in Ukraine has boosted NATO’s presence in the region. Once Finland and Sweden join the block, as is widely expected, seven out of eight Arctic states will be NATO members.\n\nThe alliance has also ramped up its military clout in the region. In August, Norway released the first images of US B52 bombers flying over its territory escorted by Norwegian F35 jets and 2 Swedish JAS Gripen.\n\nIncreased signaling by NATO included a recent test of the new weapons system, the Rapid Dragon Palletized Munition Deployment, involving a complex drop by US special forces of a normal supply pallet from the back of a C130 cargo craft.\n\nThe pallet contains a cruise missile, which launches as the pallet falls by parachute. The display was designed to show the United States can launch these powerful weapons systems from the back of an ordinary cargo plane. The test took place in Norway, not far from the Russian border.\n\nNATO has also become increasingly concerned about the potential sabotage of Norway’s oil and gas infrastructure. Now Russian energy is subject to sanctions, Norway’s natural gas makes up more than 20% of Europe’s supply, according to some analysis.\n\n“Since the sabotage in the Baltic Sea,” Stoltenberg said, “we have doubled our presence, with ships, with submarines, with maritime patrol aircrafts in the Baltic and North Seas, partly to monitor, to have better situational awareness, but also to send a message of deterrence and readiness to protect this critical infrastructure.” The NATO head was referring to the blasts at the Nord Stream pipeline in September, which were caused by an act of sabotage, according to Swedish prosecutors, after evidence of explosives was discovered at the sites.\n\nThe senior intelligence official said, however, that a recent Norwegian review of its infrastructure security concluded no major attempts to attack it had occurred and that “the oil infrastructure is well secured now.”", "authors": ["Nick Paton Walsh Sarah Dean", "Nick Paton Walsh", "Sarah Dean"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/16/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/9789860002/", "title": "Ukraine: Sweden wants in NATO; Azovstal wounded evacuated", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Monday, May 16.

An additional 211 fighters were evacuated to Olenivka through a humanitarian corridor. An exchange would be worked out for their return home, she said.\n\nMalyar said missions are underway to rescue the remaining fighters inside the plant, the last stronghold of resistance in the ruined southern port city of Mariupol.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced an agreement for the wounded to leave the steelworks for treatment in a town held by pro-Moscow separatists.\n\nThere was no immediate word on whether the wounded would be considered prisoners of war.\n\nAmerican support for US efforts in Ukraine remains strong: poll\n\nAmericans are holding steady in their support of U.S. efforts to back Ukraine in its war against Russia, a new Monmouth University poll out Monday finds.\n\nOver three-quarters of those polled back the economic sanctions imposed on Moscow, just a few ticks down from a poll in March, 77% now versus 81% then.

Of the 90 U.S. howitzer cannons sent to Ukraine, 74 are shelling Russian forces, the official said.\n\nBritish intelligence assessments released Sunday indicated Russia has lost one-third of the ground forces it assembled for the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and also said the Russian offensive in the east is significantly behind schedule. Russian losses of equipment such as temporary bridges and surveillance drones have further hindered their advance. Significant Russian advances are unlikely over the next month, the assessment concluded.\n\nThe U.S. Defense official declined to peg the percentage of Russian losses but noted that President Vladimir Putin had deployed 80% of Russia’s ground combat forces for the fight in Ukraine. That amounted to 150 Russian battalions. On Monday, Russia had 106 of the battalions inside Ukraine with very few on the border, the official said. Each Russian battalion tactical group has about 700 to 1,000 troops.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nMcDonald's says running a business in Russia 'is no longer tenable'\n\nIn announcing it would sell its businesses in Russia because of the country's invasion of Ukraine, American fast-food giant McDonald's said operating in Russia “is no longer tenable, nor is it consistent with McDonald’s values.”\n\nThe company temporarily closed its stores in early March but still paid employees. McDonald's now seeks to have a Russian buyer hire its workers and pay them until the sale closes. McDonald's opened its first restaurant in what was then the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nMcDonald's will become one of the first restaurant companies to remove its entire business from Russia.

He said the border regions of Ukraine saw Russian “sabotage activity.”\n\nU.S. pledges to help defend Finland, Sweden while NATO memberships are pending\n\nThe Biden administration not only supports the decision by Finland and Sweden to join NATO, it's also vowing to help protect them before the process is finished.\n\nThat protection may include the use of Navy warships and Air Force bombers, Army personnel training Swedish troops and information technology specialists helping repel cyberattacks, Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said Wednesday after a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe two defense leaders \"discussed what we can call security assurances,” Hultqvist said, according to the newspaper.\n\nEarlier in the day, President Joe Biden welcomed the Nordic nations' newly expressed desire to join NATO, saying in a statement: \"While their applications for NATO membership are being considered, the United States will work with Finland and Sweden to remain vigilant against any threats to our shared security, and to deter and confront aggression or the threat of aggression.''\n\nAfter Finland and Sweden formally applied for admission, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned of “retaliatory measures,” while adding they would depend on a number of factors.\n\nUS flag flying in embassy again as diplomats return to Kyiv\n\nU.S. diplomats are back in Kyiv.\n\nThree months after shutting down its embassy in the Ukrainian capital as the Russian invasion loomed, the U.S. has reopened the facility.\n\nThe State Department said U.S. embassy operations in Kyiv resumed Wednesday, with diplomats returning on a permanent basis to the city. They had previously been temporarily relocated to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and neighboring Poland.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said that “the Ukrainian people, with our security assistance, have defended their homeland in the face of Russia’s unconscionable invasion, and, as a result, the Stars and Stripes are flying over the Embassy once again.”\n\nOther Western countries have also been reopening their embassies.\n\nRussian military, unable to coordinate attack, settling for smaller goals\n\nThe Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine has been reduced to small units taking limited objectives such as towns, villages, even crossroads, a senior Defense Department official said Wednesday.\n\nThe shrunken aims of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion reflect the Russian army’s inability to coordinate its offensive, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe battlefield intelligence. Putin launched the invasion Feb. 24 with the goal of toppling the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe Russian war effort continues to suffer from poor communication between commanders, the official said. The smaller units involved in the fighting are not fully manned or equipped, limiting their ability to wage a wider war.\n\nRussian commanders continue to stick with a traditional doctrine that emphasizes artillery assaults followed by a frontal attack with ground forces, the official said. The Ukrainians continue to rebuff many of the Russian movements, which have made limited progress in the east.\n\nNear Kharkiv, the Ukrainian army continues to push back Russian forces farther from the city, Ukraine’s second largest, the official said. Russian forces have retreated to within two to six miles of their border. U.S.-supplied M777 howitzer cannons have been used in the fighting there, the official said.\n\nMilitary supplies continue to flow into Ukraine, the official said. More than 156,000 rounds of 155mm shells for the howitzers have arrived in the country. Of the 90 howitzers sent to Ukraine, 79 are being used in combat.\n\n— Tom Vanden Brook\n\nEU plan would create energy independence from Russia by 2030\n\nThe European Union on Wednesday unveiled a $316 billion plan to become independent of Russian energy by 2030. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the plan will also save energy and phase out fossil fuels. The plan calls for easing approval procedures for renewable energy projects and requiring solar panels on some roofs, among other things.\n\nIn the short term, conventional coal and nuclear power generation would be increased in the EU to ease the demand for Russian fuel. The EU government leaders agreed to set up a platform for the joint purchase of gas, liquified natural gas and hydrogen.\n\n\"We must now reduce as soon as possible our dependency on Russian fossil fuels,\" von der Leyen said.\n\nAmnesty international: Red Cross should get access to Ukraine fighters\n\nUkraine’s soldiers deployed in Mariupol have been \"dehumanized\" by Russian media and portrayed as \"neo-Nazis\" throughout the war, raising concerns over their fate as prisoners of war, Amnesty International said Wednesday. About 1,000 soldiers have surrendered since Monday, both sides say.\n\nThe advocacy group said it has documented summary killings of captives by Russia-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, as well as the extrajudicial executions of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces in recent weeks.\n\n\"The soldiers who surrendered today must not meet the same fate,\" Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement. \"Prisoners of war must not be subjected to any form of torture or ill-treatment, and should be given immediate access to the International Committee of the Red Cross.\"\n\nAfter holding out for weeks in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, the soldiers are regarded as heroes in Ukraine, which hopes to negotiate their return home in a prisoner swap. However, Russia has threatened to put some of them on trial for war crimes.\n\nBiden applauds NATO membership requests from Finland, Sweden\n\nPresident Joe Biden expressed strong support for the \"historic\" applications from Finland and Sweden for membership in NATO. Finnish President Sauli Niinistö and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson are both scheduled to visit Washington on Thursday, the White House said.\n\n\"NATO guarantees the security of 1 billion people in Europe and North America, united by our shared commitment to democratic principles and our vision of peace and prosperity in Europe and around the world,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nHe added that NATO's all-for-one-and-one-for-all security commitment was \"ironclad.\"\n\nWhile the applications are being considered, the U.S. will work with both countries \"to remain vigilant against any threats to our shared security, and to deter and confront aggression or the threat of aggression.\"\n\nTurkey reveals demands for accepting Sweden, Finland into NATO\n\nA pro-government Turkish newspaper listed 10 demands reportedly sought from Sweden and Finland before the Turkish government would approve their NATO membership. The list published by Sabah newspaper on Wednesday calls on the two countries to stop any financial support to groups linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and Syrian Kurdish fighters, and also to halt contact with members of the latter. Sabah said Turkey furthermore wants the two countries to “expedite” extradition proceedings for suspects wanted by Turkey on terrorism charges.\n\nAll 30 NATO countries have to approve the admission of new members, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to use that leverage to extract concessions and guarantees from the rest of the alliance.\n\nTalks aimed at expediting Finland and Sweden's entry into NATO will continue, and U.S. President Joe Biden sounded optimistic Wednesday, saying, \"I think we’re going to be OK.”\n\nRussia said its military and political reaction to the latest possible NATO expansion would be “determined by the specifics of Finland and Sweden membership in NATO, including the deployment of foreign military bases on their territory and striking weapons systems.”\n\nUS pushing for regular contact with Brittney Griner, detained WNBA star\n\nThe U.S. has yet to establish regular contact with Brittney Griner, the WNBA star who has been detained in Russia for almost three months.\n\nGriner, who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, has been detained – wrongfully, the Biden administration says – in Russia since February after marijuana was allegedly found in her luggage at a Moscow airport.\n\nThe 31-year-old faces drug smuggling charges that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Last week, her pre-trial detention in Russia was extended for a month. At that point, an American consular official was able to meet with Griner.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/europe/putin-time-running-out-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Putin has his back to the wall with the clock ticking ever louder | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nTime is running out for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he knows it.\n\nMeanwhile his bombast continues: announcing the annexation of Ukrainian territories on Friday, Putin declared Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson will become part of Russia “forever.” He is rushing to claim a victory and cement slender gains and sue for peace, running a dangerous political tab, regardless of the fanfare in Moscow.\n\nHe called on Ukraine to “cease fire” immediately and “sit down at the negotiating table,” but added: “We will not negotiate the choice of the people. It has been made. Russia will not betray it.”\n\nHe is doing his best to hide it, but he is losing his war in Ukraine. The writing is on the wall.\n\nAndrey Kortunov, who runs the Kremlin-backed Russian International Affairs Council in Moscow, sees it, too. “President Putin wants to end this whole thing as fast as possible,” he told CNN.\n\nPutin’s recent heavy-handed conscription drive for 300,000 troops won’t reverse his battlefield losses any time soon, and is backfiring at home, running him up a dangerous political tab.\n\nAccording to official data from the EU, Georgia and Kazakhstan, around 220,000 Russians have fled across their borders since the “partial mobilization” was announced. The EU said its numbers – nearly 66,000 – represented a more than 30% increase from the previous week.\n\nEx-oligarch says Putin made a dangerous move and is risking his life 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nIndependent Russian media quoting Russia’s revamped KGB, the FSB, put the total exodus even higher. They say more military age men have fled the country since conscription – 261,000 – than have so far fought in the war – an estimated 160,000 to 190,000.\n\nCNN is unable to verify the Russian figures, but the 40 kilometers (around 25 miles) traffic tailbacks at the border with Georgia, and the long lines at crossings into Kazakhstan and Finland, speak to the backlash and the strengthening perception that Putin is losing his fabled touch at reading Russia’s mood.\n\nThe clock ticks loudly for Putin because his back is against the wall.\n\nKortunov says he doesn’t know what goes on in the Kremlin but that he understands the public mood over the huge costs and loss of life in the war. “Many people would start asking questions, why did we get into this mess? Why, you know, we lost so many people.”\n\nPutin’s logical option, Kortunov says, is to declare victory and get out on his own terms. But for this he needs a significant achievement on the ground. “Russia cannot simply get to where it was, on the 24 February of this year, say, okay, you know, that’s fine. Our mission is accomplished. So we go home… …There should be something that can be presented to the public as a victory.”\n\nAnd this is the logic Putin appears to be following, rubber-stamping the sham referendums in Ukraine’s Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and declaring them part of Russia.\n\nHe used the same playbook annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and now, like then, threatens potential nuclear strikes should Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, try to take the annexed territories back.\n\nGearing up for peace?\n\nWestern leaders are in a battle of brinksmanship with Putin. Last Sunday US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC’s “Meet the Press” Washington would respond decisively if Russia deployed nuclear weapons against Ukraine and has made clear to Moscow the “catastrophic consequences” it would face.\n\nLeaders have also vowed not to recognize the regions as part of Russian territory.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said Moscow’s actions have “no legitimacy,” adding that Washington will continue to “always honor Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders.” The European Union said it “will never” recognize the Kremlin’s “illegal annexation,” and described the move as a “further violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\n\nHear what worries Sen. Rubio more than a Russian nuclear attack 03:24 - Source: CNN\n\nThere is little new in what Putin does, which, if nothing else, is making his moves more predictable, and therefore more readily analyzed.\n\nKurt Volker, who was US ambassador to NATO and US special representative to Ukraine under former President Donald Trump, believes Putin maybe gearing up for peace. “I think what he must be striving for, is to brandish the nuclear weapons, make all kinds of threats to Europe, and then say, okay, so let’s negotiate a settlement. And let me keep what I have already taken.”\n\nFiona Hill, who has advised three US Presidents on national security about Russia, also thinks Putin may be attempting an end game. “He feels a sense of acute urgency that he was losing momentum, and he’s now trying to exit the war in the same way that he entered it. With him being the person in charge and him framing the whole terms of any kind of negotiation. “\n\nIf these analyses are correct, they go a long way toward explaining the mystery of what happened under the Baltic Sea on Monday.\n\nBoth Danish and Swedish seismologists recorded explosive shockwaves from close to the seabed: the first, at around 2 a.m. local time, hitting 2.3 magnitude, then again, at around 7 p.m., registering 2.1.\n\nWithin hours, roiling patches of sea were discovered, the Danes and the Germans sent warships to secure the area, and Norway increased security around its oil and gas facilities.\n\nSo far, at least four leaks in Russia’s Nord Stream pipelines 1 and 2 have been discovered, each at the surface resembling a boiling cauldron, the largest one kilometer across, and together spewing industrial quantities of toxic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nSabotage suspected in Nord Stream pipeline leaks 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nRussian naval vessels were seen by European security officials in the area in the days prior, Western intelligence sources have said. NATO’s North Atlantic Council has described the damage as a “deliberate, reckless and irresponsible act of sabotage.”\n\nRussia denies responsibility and says it has launched its own investigation. But former CIA chief John Brennan said Russia has the expertise to inflict this type of damage “all the signs point to some type of sabotage that these pipelines are only in about 200 feet or so of water and Russia does have an undersea capability to that will easily lay explosive devices by those pipelines.”\n\nBrennan’s analysis is that Russia is the most likely culprit for the sabotage, and that Putin is likely trying to send a message: “It’s a signal to Europe that Russia can reach beyond Ukraine’s borders. So who knows what he might be planning next.”\n\nNord Stream 2 was never operational, and Nord Stream 1 had been throttled back by Putin as Europe raced to replenish gas reserves ahead of winter, while dialling back demands for Russian supplies and searching for replacement providers.\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline sabotage could, according to Hill, be a last roll of the dice by Putin, so that “there’s no kind of turning back on the gas issues. And it’s not going to be possible for Europe to continue to build up its gas reserves for the winter. So what Putin is doing is throwing absolutely everything at this right now.”\n\nStretched supply lines\n\nAnother factor accelerating Putin’s thinking may be the approach of winter. Napoleon and Hitler both failed to take Moscow as supply lines running through Ukraine were too long and arduous in winter. Volker says that what historically saved Russia is now pressing down on Putin: “This time, it’s Russia that has to supply lines, trying to sustain its forces in Ukraine. That’s going to be very hard this winter. So all of a sudden, for all these factors, Putin’s timeline has moved up.”\n\nThe bottom line, said Hill, is that “this is the result of Ukraine gaining momentum on the ground on the battlefield and of Putin himself losing it, so he’s trying to adapt to the circumstances and basically take charge and get every advantage.”\n\nNo one knows what’s really going on in Putin’s mind. Kortunov doubts Putin will be willing to compromise beyond his own terms for peace, “not on the terms that are offered by President Zelensky, not on the terms which are offered by the West… .[though] he should be ready to exercise a degree of flexibility. But we don’t know what these degrees [are] likely to be.”\n\nAccording to Hill, Putin wants his negotiations to be with Biden and allies, not Ukraine: “He’s basically saying now you will have to negotiate with me and sue for peace. And that means recognizing what we have done on the ground in Ukraine.”\n\nHaving failed in the face of Western military unity backing Ukraine, Putin appears set to test Western resolve diplomatically, by trying to divide Western allies over terms for peace.\n\nVolker expects Putin to pitch France and Germany first “to say, we need to end this war, we’re going to protect our territories at all costs, using any means necessary, and you need to put pressure on the Ukrainians to settle.”\n\nIf this is Putin’s plan, it could turn into his biggest strategic miscalculation yet. There is little Western appetite to see him stay in power – US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said as much in the summer – and even less to let down Ukraine after all its suffering.\n\nPutin knows he is in a corner, but doesn’t seem to realize how small a space he has, and that of course is what’s most worrying – would he really make good on his nuclear threats?\n\nThe war in Ukraine may have entered a new phase, and Putin may have his back against the wall, but an end to the conflict could still be a very long way off.", "authors": ["Nic Robertson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/europe/russia-officials-fined-for-putin-impeachment-call-intl/index.html", "title": "Russian officials who called for Putin's 'impeachment' face fines | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nSeveral elected officials in Russia have been summoned by police after they called for the impeachment of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn a rare display of dissent in the country, local deputies from the Smolninskoye municipality in the St. Petersburg area appealed to the Russian Duma to impeach the President, for what they called crimes of high treason.\n\nThe author of the appeal, Dmitry Palyuga, posted it on Twitter, alleging Putin was responsible for “(1) the decimation of young able-bodied Russian men who would serve the workforce better than the military; (2) Russia’s economic downturn and brain drain; (3) NATO’s expansion eastward, including adding Finland and Sweden to “double” its border with Russia; (4) the opposite effect of the “special military operation” in Ukraine.”\n\nPalyuga and fellow Deputy Nikita Yuferev later posted on Twitter a summons issued to them by the St. Petersburg police for their “discrediting of the ruling establishment”.\n\nPalyuga later reported that two of the four deputies summoned have been released by the police and all are expected to face fines.\n\nKremlin has tried very hard to stifle any criticism of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAfter launching a full scale invasion in late February, the Russian government moved swiftly to shut down the remnants of Russia’s free press and introduced a new law that imposed severe criminal penalties for spreading “fake” information.\n\nAccording to OVD-Info, an independent group that tracks detentions in Russia, 16,437 people have been arrested or detained for anti-war activism in Russia since the start of the invasion.", "authors": ["Josh Pennington Ivana Kottasová", "Josh Pennington", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}]}

Jacob said Pence took the call privately but returned looking “steely, determined, grim.”\n\nAfter evacuating the Senate chamber, Pence refused to get in a Secret Service car in an underground parking garage because he worried it would carry him away from the Capitol rather than finish the Electoral College vote count that night.\n\nPence didn’t wanted to take the chance “the world would see the vice president of the United States fleeing the Capitol,” Jacob said.\n\n'No precedent' for Pence to intervene\n\nMichael Luttig, a retired federal appellate judge who was influential in conservative circles, said he offered Pence advice that “there was no historical precedent” for the vice president to reject Electoral College votes.\n\nSarah Matthews, a former deputy press secretary in the White House, said Trump’s tweet at 2:24 p.m. – after he evacuated the Senate chamber – fueled the angry crowd. “I think that in that moment for him to tweet out that message about Mike Pence, it was him pouring gasoline on the fire and making it much worse,” Matthews said.\n\nA 2024 campaign looms\n\nThe prospect of grand jury testimony comes at an awkward time for Pence as he considers a run for the presidency in 2024.\n\nTrump and his allies still criticize Pence for refusing to follow the demand that he simply toss out electoral votes favorable to Biden and simply hand the election to the incumbent president.\n\nAt the same time, anti-Trump Republicans say Pence has exhibited too much fealty to the former president, including his attempts to avoid testify before the grand jury.\n\nPence has criticized Trump for ordering him to discount electoral votes, but stopped short of saying the former president acted illegally.\n\nPence calls subpoena 'unprecedented' and 'unconstitutional'\n\nPence opposed the subpoena but he told Newsmax he hasn't decided yet how to respond.\n\n“When I received a subpoena from the Justice Department, I said that I thought it was not only unprecedented to ask a vice president to come into court to testify about the president,\" Pence said. \"But I also thought it was unconstitutional, believing that the Constitution’s speech and debate protections applied to me when I was serving as president of the Senate on Jan. 6.\"\n\n“I’ll have more to say about that in the days ahead,\" Pence said.\n\nPence: 'President Trump was wrong'\n\nDuring a press dinner in March, Pence repeated his statement that \"President Trump was wrong\" and \"I had no right to overturn the election. And his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know history will hold Donald Trump accountable.\"\n\nThe former vice president's lawyers did not immediately respond to inquiries, including whether they will appeal the ruling.\n\nLast month, the former vice president said he would take his case “as far as it needs to go, if need be to the Supreme Court of the United States.”\n\nTrump slammed the Justice Department inquiry, claiming the special counsel was \"stepping far outside the standard norms\" in pursuing Pence's testimony.\n\n“There is no factual or legal basis or substance to any case against President Trump,\" a campaign spokesperson said, echoing the former president's repeated claim that justice system was being \"weaponized\" against him.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel-high-profile-moves-trump-criminal-investigations/index.html", "title": "Special Counsel Smith speeds ahead on criminal probes ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nNewly-appointed special counsel Jack Smith is moving fast on a pair of criminal probes around Donald Trump that in recent months have focused on the former president’s state of mind after the 2020 election, including what he knew about plans to impede the transfer of power, people familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nThough he remains in Europe recovering from a biking accident, Smith has made a series of high-profile moves since he was put in charge last month, including asking a federal judge to hold Trump in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena ordering him to turn over records marked classified.\n\nSince Thanksgiving, Smith has brought a number of close Trump associates before a grand jury in Washington, including two former White House lawyers, three of Trump’s closest aides, and his former speechwriter Stephen Miller. He has also issued a flurry of subpoenas, including to election officials in battleground states where Trump tried to overturn his loss in 2020.\n\nSmith takes over a staff that’s already nearly twice the size of Robert Mueller’s team of lawyers who worked on the Russia probe. A team of 20 prosecutors investigating January 6 and the effort to overturn the 2020 election are in the process of moving to work under Smith, according to multiple people familiar with the team.\n\nSmith will also take on national security investigators already working the probe into the potential mishandling of federal records taken to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left the White House.\n\nTogether, the twin investigations have already established more evidence than what Mueller started with, including from a year-long financial probe that’s largely flown under the radar.\n\n“Mueller was starting virtually from scratch, whereas Jack Smith is seemingly integrating on the fly into an active, fast-moving investigation,” said Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor and senior CNN legal analyst.\n\nSmith also won’t be constrained in the same way as Mueller, who deferred decisions on whether to charge Trump because he was a sitting president.\n\nView inside Trumpworld\n\nWhile Trump lambasted Smith’s appointment on social media, some of the former president’s attorneys think it could’ve been worse, according to people familiar with the matter. Those lawyers maintain the former president is unlikely to be indicted, according to two sources familiar. They also believe Smith’s appointment is a good thing because he is “not emotionally attached” to the original case and can look at it “dispassionately and factually,” one of the sources said.\n\n“The fact that they found a guy who has been Europe for the past several years, without his brain marinating in the soup of January 6th coverage, that’s a good thing,” the source said.\n\nBut others on Trump’s team are concerned that Smith’s appointment signals a more aggressive stance from Attorney General Merrick Garland, characterizing him as a “hit man” who is likely to bring a prosecution, people familiar with their thinking said.\n\nOn Friday, the Justice Department’s approach in the Mar-a-Lago case hit a small bump, with a federal judge declining to hold Trump in contempt of court and urging DOJ and Trump’s team to work out a resolution as investigators attempt to make sure all national security records are back in the possession of the federal government.\n\nBehind the scenes, in separate sealed proceedings related to January 6, Smith has already told the federal court he is in charge of the investigation, according to some of the sources. And while Trump lawyers on the January 6 probe have not been in touch directly with Smith at this point, according to some of the sources, they anticipate they will eventually speak with him once he returns to the US.\n\nIt’s unclear how long Smith may continue to work before deciding on any charges in either probe. While both investigations may result in charges within months, Smith could still spend time organizing and expanding his team, and continuing to pick through information that’s been collected, according to people familiar with parts of the probe.\n\n“It could well be that Jack Smith moves more quickly than Merrick Garland would and forces a decision to Merrick Garland’s desk more quickly than it might have otherwise,” said Honig.\n\nComparisons to Mueller\n\nAccording to a handful of people familiar with the probe, there is still work to be done to centralize all the moving parts of large prosecution teams under the new special counsel’s office.\n\nSmith is expected to set up a physical office for the two investigative teams away from the downtown Justice headquarters, as Mueller did for his probe and as did John Durham, who is nearing the end of his examination of 2016 Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nAccording to several people familiar with his appointment, Smith will operate more like a US Attorney – managing an existing team of career prosecutors already working on the cases, and signing off on evidence they bring him – rather than as a de facto-department head like Mueller, who tapped several lawyers from outside the Justice Department to pursue parts of the Russia investigation from scratch.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller makes a statement about the Russia investigation on May 29, 2019 at the Justice Department in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nMueller also had his own set of legal advisers akin to a shadow Justice Department appeals and policy team. Smith likely won’t have the same set-up – with lawyers from throughout the Department assisting as needed, according to multiple people familiar with the office’s development.\n\nGarland already turned to a long-time criminal appellate section leader, Patty Stemler, who retired earlier this year from DOJ, to advise as a consultant on the January 6 investigations throughout this year.\n\nOthers from Stemler’s former unit and other sections are likely to shepherd cases and policy issues as needed, in a departure from Mueller’s soup-to-nuts approach of preparing for thorny Constitutional issues and appeals in the Russia investigation, some of the sources said.\n\nA spokesman for the Justice Department didn’t provide any comment for this story.\n\nCircling Trump\n\nPublicly released court filings have already made clear Trump is under investigation for the mishandling of national security secrets after his presidency.\n\nBut the other investigative team, looking at efforts to block the transfer of power from Trump to President Joe Biden after the 2020 election, had even a year ago been given the greenlight by the Justice Department to take a case all the way up to Trump, if the evidence leads them there, according to the sources. Work that’s been led by the DC US Attorney’s Office into political circles around Trump related to January 6 now will move under the special counsel.\n\nPartly led by former Maryland-based federal prosecutor Thomas Windom, DOJ has added prosecutors to the January 6 team from all over the department in recent months. Windom and the rest are also expected to move over to the special counsel’s office. Some, like Mary Dohrmann, a prosecutor who’s worked on several other Capitol riot cases already, appear to be reorienting, according to court records of open Capitol riot cases.\n\nAnother top prosecutor, JP Cooney, the former head of public corruption in the DC US Attorney’s Office, is overseeing a significant financial probe that Smith will take on. The probe includes examining the possible misuse of political contributions, according to some of the sources. The DC US Attorney’s Office, before the special counsel’s arrival, had examined potential financial crimes related to the January 6 riot, including possible money laundering and the support of rioters’ hotel stays and bus trips to Washington ahead of January 6.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Nov. 15 launched his 2024 presidential campaign. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIn recent months, however, the financial investigation has sought information about Trump’s post-election Save America PAC and other funding of people who assisted Trump, according to subpoenas viewed by CNN. The financial investigation picked up steam as DOJ investigators enlisted cooperators months after the 2021 riot, one of the sources said.\n\nIn interviews with people in Trump’s orbit over the past several months, some of the DOJ focus has been on the timeline leading up to January 6 and Trump’s involvement and knowledge of potential events that day, according to a source familiar with the questioning.\n\nTrump allies have consistently maintained that nothing Trump did related to the election and January 6 itself amounts to a crime. They have also suggested that if Trump were to ultimately face an indictment, the bar to prove he committed a crime is extremely high, and that a jury would hear he was getting conflicting advice from different lawyers. For example, Trump allies point out, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told Trump that Vice President Mike Pence couldn’t block the election certification on January 6, while Rudy Giuliani and others believed he could.\n\nEven earlier this year, federal prosecutors were specifically asking witnesses whether there was a plan to steal the election and for Trump not to concede, according to a source with knowledge of the questions posed during this stage of the DOJ criminal probe.\n\nThe DOJ probe has evolved significantly since that time, but sources familiar with testimony before the grand jury in recent months have told CNN that prosecutors are still focused on the core question of whether there was a plan to steal the election and Trump’s understanding about the relevance of January 6.", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz Kristen Holmes Paula Reid Jeremy Herb", "Katelyn Polantz", "Kristen Holmes", "Paula Reid", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/17/trump-investigations-live-updates/10343126002/", "title": "Rudy Giuliani spent 6 hours with Georgia grand jury in election probe", "text": "Rudy Giuliani spent nearly six hours Wednesday in an Atlanta courthouse before a special grand jury investigating interference in the 2020 election.\n\nGiuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, declined to say whether former President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer invoked his right against self-incrimination after being designated by Fulton County prosecutors as a target of the inquiry.\n\n“It was cordial,” Costello said.\n\nAs Giuliani's session concluded, it became public knowledge that Republican Gov.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta postponed the trial to hear more arguments about the dispute.\n\nThe Justice Department argued Navarro never documented the claim of executive privilege before he was charged. But even if he had, the committee sought to ask him about protests and speeches on Nov. 14, 2020, and about purported election fraud in a report he released, which fell outside his official duties protected by executive privilege.\n\n“The Defendant argues that both executive privilege and testimonial immunity excuse his noncompliance with the Committee’s subpoena,” U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves said in the filing. “This is incorrect.”\n\nNavarro has until April 4 to reply.\n\nHere’s what we know about the case:\n\nWhy did House panel want to question Navarro?\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee sought to question Navarro because in his 2021 book \"In Trump Time,\" he described the scheme to delay certification of the 2020 election of President Joe Biden through a strategy called the \"Green Bay Sweep.\" Navarro said it was the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats’ jaws of deceit.\"\n\nNavarro said in a later interview that Trump was “on board with the strategy,” according to the committee. He also produced a three-volume document called The Navarro Report about claims of purported election fraud. The panel subpoenaed him for documents about the plan and testimony.\n\nBut Navarro replied to the committee by email that Trump invoked executive privilege to keep their communications confidential. “Accordingly, my hands are tied,” Navarro wrote.\n\nHow does executive privilege fit in the case?\n\nNavarro’s case could help define executive privilege and the ground rules for criminal prosecutions. The doctrine for keeping presidential communications confidential, to ensure candid advice, is being tested in other criminal investigations.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said he would fight a subpoena from special counsel Jack Smith, who is investigating Trump’s role in the Capitol attack.

Perry was a central figure in planning to overturn the 2020 election and introduced Trump to a candidate to install as acting attorney general, according to the House committee.\n\nPerry’s lawyer, John Rowley, argued that his communications should fall under the Constitution’s speech and debate clause, which aims to protect a lawmaker’s speech from prosecution. But judges questioned such an open-ended claim for any conversations.\n\nWhat is the Justice Department arguing?\n\nThe committee asked to subpoena Navarro by email Feb. 9, 2022. He replied three minutes later: “Yes. no counsel. Executive privilege.” On Aug. 17, 2022, Navarro sought to dismiss the indictment because federal criminal rules say “when a former president invokes Executive Privilege as to a senior presidential adviser, the adviser cannot thereafter be prosecuted.”\n\nBut federal courts upheld the House committee’s subpoena power in previous civil cases dealing with claims of executive privilege over documents. The D.C.

The text messages, which were obtained by CNN, reveal how top Republican Party officials, right-wing figures and even Trump’s family members discussed with Meadows what Trump should say and do after the election and in the middle of the insurrection.\n\nMeadows did not turn over other documents he had, and the House committee voted to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress for it and for his refusal to testify, referring the matter to the Justice Department. The Justice Department has declined to indict Meadows for evading his subpoena, given his high level position in the Trump West Wing and claims of executive privilege.\n\nRaskin also suggested Thursday that previous referrals to DOJ for contempt of Congress would not impact how the panel handles these criminal referrals.\n\n“We obviously did contempt of Congress referrals earlier and there’s a whole statutory process for making that happen,” he said. “But you know we will explain our decisions in detail – why we are making certain kinds of referrals for certain people and other kinds for others.”\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nEastman sat for an interview with the panel last year, but invoke his Fifth Amendment rights that protect against self-incrimination.\n\nIn the midst of a legal fight to obtain Eastman’s emails, a federal judge ruled in March that Eastman, along with Trump, may have been planning a crime as they sought to disrupt the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election. The FBI seized Eastman’s phone in June as part of its criminal investigation according to a court filing from Eastman.\n\nDavid O. Carter, a federal judge in California, ordered Eastman to turn over 101 emails from the period around January 6, 2021, that he has tried to keep secret from the House select committee, which after a lengthy court battle, the panel ultimately received.\n\nCarter’s reasoning was a crucial acknowledgment by a federal court that Trump’s interest in overturning the election could be considered criminal.\n\n“The illegality of the plan was obvious,” Carter wrote.\n\nIn a hearing over the summer, the panel presented revelations that provided new insight into Eastman’s role as a central figure in the effort led by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Eastman was integral to the intense pressure campaign that Trump directed at then-Vice President Mike Pence to compel Pence to help carry out a plan to overturn the election results.\n\nIn the hearing, the committee walked through how Eastman put forward a legal theory that Pence could unilaterally block certification of the election – a theory that was roundly rejected by Trump’s White House attorneys and Pence’s team, but was nevertheless embraced by the former President.\n\nJeffrey Clark\n\nClark invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 100 times during his deposition with the committee. Federal investigators have raided Clark’s home as part of their own criminal investigation.\n\nThe former DOJ official was facing a criminal contempt of Congress referral at the time after he refused to answer the committee’s questions at a prior deposition. The referral was never sent to DOJ because on the day the committee voted on the contempt referral, Clark’s lawyer informed the committee that he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to not answer questions on the grounds it may incriminate him.\n\nThe panel dedicated much of a June hearing to Clark’s role in Trump’s attempts to weaponize the Justice Department in the final months of his term as part of the plot to overturn the 2020 election and stay in power.\n\nThe committee in particular zeroed in on the efforts of Rep. Scott Perry, the Pennsylvania Republican, who connected Clark to the White House in December 2020.\n\nCNN has previously reported on the role that Perry played, and the committee in court filings released text messages Perry exchanged with Meadows about Clark.\n\n“He wanted Mr. Clark – Mr. Jeff Clark to take over the Department of Justice,” Cassidy Hutchinson, a former Meadows aide, said about Perry in a clip of her deposition that was played at that hearing.\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nGiuliani, Trump’s onetime personal attorney and a lead architect of his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, met with the panel in May for more than nine hours.\n\nIn its initial subpoena, the committee alleges that Giuliani “actively promoted claims of election fraud on behalf of the former President and sought to convince state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results.” The subpoena also stated that Giuliani was in contact with Trump and members of Congress “regarding strategies for delaying or overturning the results of the 2020 election.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Annie Grayer Zachary Cohen Pamela Brown", "Annie Grayer", "Zachary Cohen", "Pamela Brown"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/13/january-6-committee-hearing-live-updates/10441093002/", "title": "Jan 6 hearing recap: Panel subpoenas Trump, shows new video of ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump Thursday after a dramatic meeting where its members presented evidence that Trump incited the assault on the Capitol even though he knew he had lost the election.\n\nSome of the former president's followers were armed, the committee said, including that the Secret Service knew before the attack that some in the crowd at Trump's rally had guns and other weapons.\n\nSecret Service members exchanged texts on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021 warning each other of weapons spotted among supporters of Trump at a rally near the White House and the threat of violence at the Capitol, according to the committee, which held its ninth public hearing of the year.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\n“Calm before the storm,” one Secret Service agent texted another early that morning, according to evidence reviewed by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nAnother wrote in a Secret Service chat, “Pulling up live-streams and watching the crazies.”\n\nThe committee also focused on Roger Stone, a Trump confidant, and his efforts to keep Trump in power following the 2020 election. Stone was behind the “Stop the Steal” movement that falsely claimed Trump won the 2020 election and had close contact with two right-wing extremist groups involved in the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nWatch it:How to watch today's Jan. 6 committee hearing on the Capitol attack\n\nHearing day 8 recap: What we learned from the eighth Jan. 6 hearings\n\nOnPolitics:Get political news, fast and to the point, delivered to your inbox.\n\nSince the committee's last hearing in July, the legal landscape for one of the committee's key targets – Trump – has shifted significantly following the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate and a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Trump, his company and three of his adult children alleging fraud.\n\nWhat happened at Thursday's hearing:\n\nRep. Liz Cheney said 30 individuals asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in testimony before the Jan. 6 committee, and several did so related to questions about their “dealings with Donald Trump directly.”\n\nFormer White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he was “stunned by the violence” as well as Trump’s “indifference” to it. “I thought he failed at a critical time to be the sort of leader that the nation needed.”\n\nThe committee showed footage of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asking acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to get Trump to call off the rioters, as well as videos of Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence conferring on the state of the Capitol.\n\nWhite House security officials were “in a state of shock” about the idea of Trump walking from the rally to the Capitol, one official testified, because it meant the event was no longer a rally, but “this would move from a normal, democratic, public event into something else.”\n\nBy 9 a.m. Jan. 6, the Secret Service noted some of the crowd was gathered outside a security perimeter at the rally and speculated “they have stuff that can’t come through? Would prob be an issue with this crowd.”\n\nRepublican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said Trump called her, along with John Eastman, who explained to McDaniel the need for the RNC to help Trump’s campaign gather “contingent electors” in case the results of any elections changed. That was part of fake electors scheme, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., explained.\n\nTrump’s “false victory speech” was planned well in advance of Election Day, regardless of results, committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said.\n\nTrump confidant Roger Stone told Danish filmmakers on Nov. 1, 2020, that then-president needed to declare victory no matter the results. “Possession is nine-tenths of the law,” he said.\n\nJan. 6 committees votes to subpoena Donald Trump\n\nThe House Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol took the extraordinary step of subpoenaing Donald Trump, voting unanimously 9-0 to call the former president to appear before Congress to testify.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, vice chairwoman of the committee, said the committee has enough evidence to “make criminal referrals for multiple individuals” to the Justice Department and recommend policy changes to Congress but a “key task” remains.\n\n\"We must seek the testimony, under oath, of Jan. 6's central player,\" said Cheney, vice chair of the committee. “We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion.”\n\nIt’s very likely Trump will ignore the committee’s subpoena, similar to Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows and other Trump aides who have refused to testify.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nRaskin: Trump excused and glorified Jan. 6 attack\n\nCommittee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., blamed an unrepetant Trump for the attack on the Capitol building.\n\n“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously and viciously stripped away from great Patriots,” Raskin said, reading a tweet from Trump.\n\n“Trump was telling us that the Vice President, the Congress and all the injured and wounded cops, some of whom are with us today, got what was coming to us,” said Raskin. “According to Trump, January 6 should not be a day that lives in shame and infamy in our history, but rather in glory.”\n\n“Trump did nothing to stop the deadly violence for obvious reasons,” Raskin continued. “He thought it was all justified. He incited it and he supported it.”\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nChao: It was impossible for me to continue given my personal values\n\nThe Jan, 6 committee is playing up criticism of Trump from fellow Republicans, a presentation that included new testimony from Elaine Chao, who resigned from the Cabinet right after the insurrection.\n\n“I think the events at the Capitol were shocking and it was something that as I mentioned that I cannot put aside,\" Chao said on videotape.\n\nChao, who is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, told the committee \"it was impossible for me to continue given my personal values. I came as an immigrant. I believe in the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nTrump has often criticized Chao, and made a racist crack about her just this month.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump tweet about Pence ignited security concerns, calls for execution\n\nWithin a minute of former President Donald Trump sending out a tweet calling Vice President Mike Pence weak for not overturning the results of the electoral college, a Secret Service agent became concerned about the vice president’s safety.\n\n“POTUS just tweeted about Pence, probably not going to be good for Pence,” the agent wrote in a message shared by the Jan. 6 committee. Five hours later, another Secret Service message read, ““Potus said he he lacked courage. Over 24k likes in under 2mins.”\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said the tweet ignited “violent hashtags” such as “execute Mike Pence.” Anika Collier Navaroli, a Twitter employee who testified in front of the committee, said, Twitter users were “literally calling for his execution.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nNew video shows Pelosi on phone with Pence discussing resuming election certification\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee showed never before seen video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling Vice President Mike Pence during the attack on the Capitol to determine whether lawmakers would be able to return to the building to resume certification of the Electoral College votes.\n\n“We’re trying to figure out how we can get this job done today,” Pelosi said on a call to Pence.\n\nPence later told Pelosi that law enforcement officials believed the House and Senate would be able to reconvene that evening.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n‘They’re your people,’ McCarthy told Trump during attack\n\nRepublican House Leader Kevin McCarthy was among those urging former President Donald Trump to call back his supporters who were attacking the Capitol, according to testimony to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nIn a phone call as the attack was happening, according to a witness, Trump told McCarthy that the rioters were members of the group Antifa.\n\nMcCarthy responded: “No, they’re your people.”\n\nTrump fired back to McCarthy, “I guess they’re just more upset about the election than you are.”\n\nThe committee showed video of McCarthy’s congressional staff in hiding as the attack unfolded.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nPelosi: 'Clean up the poo poo'\n\nThe Jan. 6 hearing featured same-day video of congressional leaders reacting to the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lamenting the rioters' damage to the U.S. Capitol – including defecation.\n\nIt will take time to \"clean up the poo poo that they’re making ... literally and figuratively in the Capitol,\" Pelosi said at one point.\n\nPelosi is shown speaking on the phone with local leaders about the security situation, saying at one point: \"Do you believe this?\"\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, is seen at one point telling the acting attorney general Jeff Rosen to tell President Donald Trump to call off the protesters at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPelosi, Schumer plead for National Guard reinforcements\n\nThe committee played never-before-seen video of congressional leaders calling for military reinforcements to the Capitol Police and how to resume counting Electoral College votes after evacuating the House and Senate chambers under siege from the rampaging mob.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was walking in a hallway at 2:23 p.m. – soon after the mob breached the building – and talking on the phone. “We have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,” she said.\n\nShe and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are shown at 2:57 p.m. urging military leaders to send National Guard troops from Maryland and Virginia. Pelosi urged military officials to treat the situation as if the White House or Pentagon were under siege.\n\n“We need them there now,” Schumer said at 3:46 p.m.\n\nTroops didn’t arrive until after 5 p.m.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchumer and Pelosi called multiple officials to send help to Capitol\n\nIn new footage revealed by the Jan. 6 committee, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made calls to various officials to send help to the Capitol as rioters entered the building.\n\n“I’m gonna call up the effin Secretary of DOD,” said Schumer, before calling acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and tellnig him: “We have some senators who are still in their hideaways. We need massive personnel now, can you get the Maryland National Guard too?”\n\nPelosi contacted Mayor of Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan and Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam.\n\n“They’re breaking windows and going in, obviously ransacking our offices and all the rest of that,” said Pelosi in a call to Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. “That’s nothing. The concern we have about personal safety just transcends everything but the fact is that they’re breaking the law in many different ways.”\n\n“Quite frankly, much of it at the instigation of the President of the United States,” said Pelosi.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nTrump watched Fox News after learning about violence, Raskin says\n\nTrump watched Fox News in a dining room attached to the Oval Office for 2 hours and 40 minutes after he was told that there was violence ongoing at the U.C. Capitol, said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\n\nTrump returned to the White House at 1:20 p.m. that day, Raskin said, and “was told right then about the onset of violence at the Capitol.” He went to the dining room and stayed until about 4 p.m. as he watched the event unfold.\n\n“President Trump refused entreaties from his closest advisors and family members to tell his supporters to stand down and leave the Capitol,” Raskin said, referencing testimony from White House staff, including Pat Cippollone, Cassidy Hutchinson, and “an employee with national security employee duties,” among others.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nSecret Service was ‘concerned’ Trump would go to Capitol even after returning to White House\n\nEven after Trump returned to the White House after his speech on the morning of Jan. 6, the former president wanted to lead his supporters into the Capitol, according to Secret Service agents and White House officials.\n\n“Front office concerned about OTR to (the Capitol)” one Secret Service agent wrote in an email to Bobby Engel, the head of the president’s security detail. OTR is short for “off the record.”\n\nFormer Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany testified to the Jan. 6 committee that Trump wanted to physically walk to the Capitol or ride “the beast,” the nickname for presidential limousine, if he needed.\n\n“The people sworn to protect the safety of the president of the United States and who routinely put themselves in harm's way were compared this was a bad idea,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., one of the committee members.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nJan. 6 panel to recall witnesses, conduct further depositions based on Secret Service material\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee will be reviewing testimony regarding potential obstruction, including testimony about advice given not to tell the committee about the events surrounding Jan. 6, Rep. Pete Aguilar said during the hearing.\n\nThe committee plans to obtain further information from witnesses who provided testimony and conduct further investigative depositions after obtaining “voluminous” material from the Secret Service.\n\nAguilar said the committee will provide greater details in their final report.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTrump’s physical altercation with Secret Service was ‘water cooler talk’ in White House\n\nTrump’s physical altercation with the Secret Service on Jan. 6 later became “water cooler talk” among White House employees according to committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.\n\nAn anonymous former White House employee told the committee that “they remember hearing in the days after Jan. 6, how angry the President was when he was in a limo that afternoon.”\n\nSecret Service Agent Robert Engel and former White House aide Anthony Ornato “expressed to me that the President was irate, you know, on the drive up,” the employee told the committee.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nAgencies obtained tips of attack prior to Jan. 6\n\nIntelligence about the Jan. 6 attack was available to Secret Service and others in the White House more than 10 days before the march to the Capitol, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee found evidence that Trump was aware of the risk of violence along with the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Metropolitan police and other agencies through intelligence prior to the attack.\n\nTrump’s senior advisors at the Department of Justice and FBI received an intelligence summary days before Jan. 6 indicating certain people traveling to Washington were making plans to attack the Capitol.\n\nThe intelligence cited online calls to occupy federal buildings, rhetoric about invading the Capitol and plans to engage in political violence, Schiff said.\n\nOn a call with Trump’s White House national security staff in early January of 2021, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense David Norquist warned about an attack on the Capitol.\n\n“Norquist says during one of these calls the greatest threat is a direct assault on the Capitol, I’ll never forget it,” Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an audio recording played during the hearing.\n\nIn a report from the Secret Service field office, a tip that had been received by the FBI included information from a source that said the Proud Boys planned to march armed into Washington and outnumber police.\n\n“Their plan is to literally kill people. Please, please take this tip seriously and investigate further,” the source said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nSecret Service knew the crowd had weapons 'as early as the night before'\n\nThe Secret Service knew before the attack on the Capitol that the crowd forming for Trump’s rally had guns, as early as the night before the attack, according to evidence presented by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nA Secret Service briefing said that in demonstrations on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, there were “multiple weapon offenses to include Carrying a handgun w/out a license, possessing a high capacity feeding device, and unregistered ammunition.” The following day, the Secret Service and other federal agencies would find a similar situation.\n\nSchiff said the Federal Protective Service, a law enforcement agency that protects federal buildings, found a man with a handgun in his waistband. The U.S. Parks Police arrested a man with a rifle in front of the World War Two memorial that day, he said.\n\nSecret Service agents Jan. 6, 2021 texted with each other about all the weapons, with one saying, “With so many weapons found so far, you wonder how many are unknown. Could be sporty after dark.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\n‘Calm before the storm,’ Secret Service member texted Jan. 6 morning\n\nSecret Service members exchanged texts on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021 warning each other of weapons spotted among supporters of President Donald Trump and the threat of violence at the Capitol.\n\n“Calm before the storm,” one Secret Service agent texted another early that morning, according to evidence reviewed by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nAnother wrote in a Secret Service chat, “Pulling up live-streams and watching the crazies.”\n\nBy 9:30 a.m. on Jan. 6, Secret Service agents reported more than 25,000 people outside the Ellipse, where Trump later gave a speech that encouraged his loyalists to march to the Capitol.\n\nAgents observed some Trump supporters with guns and others wearing body army, ballistic helmets, pepper spray, and holding riot shields.\n\n“The documents we obtained from the Secret Service make clear that the crowd outside the magnetometers was armed and the agents knew it,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., one of the committee members.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nGOP chairwoman was pressured on fake electors\n\nOne of the blockbuster witnesses the committee presented on Thursday was Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who testified via videotape how Trump, along with his attorney John Eastman, tried to recruit her to join the plan to overturn the 2020 results.\n\nThe plan, based on a debunked legal theory, relied on key states finding Trump-supporting electors who would go to Washington to swing the Electoral College.\n\nMcDaniel told the committee how Trump called her and turned the phone over to Eastman, who explained it was important for the national GOP to get behind the plan and help “gather these contingent electors.”\n\nThe plan also required former Vice President Mike Pence to toss out the real electors, which he refused to do and later called the idea “un-American.”\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nAfter Georgia call, Meadows said Trump ‘knew’ he lost 2020 election\n\nAfter Trump’s phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger where Trump pressured him to just “find 11,780 votes,” former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Trump “knew” he already lost the 2020 election.\n\n“He can’t possibly think we’re gonna pull this off. That call was crazy,” former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson told Mark Meadows after the call ended.\n\n“He (Meadows) started shaking his head and he’s like ‘No Cass, he knows this is over,'” Hutchinson recounted. “He knows he lost.”\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nHutchinson video:Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson says Trump didn't want people to know he lost\n\nCommittee: Trump knew he lost, but still lied to overturn the election\n\nIf there's one point the committee wants to drive home, it is this: Trump knew he had lost the 2020 election, yet still made improper - and possibly illegal - efforts to overturn that loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nThe hearing has included videos from a variety of former aides, from Attorney General William Barr to lower-level lawyers, explaining why Trump's claims of voter fraud were mistakes or simply lies.\n\nWho's on :Meet the members of the January 6 House select committee ahead of first public hearing Thursday\n\n“Donald Trump maliciously repeated this nonsense to a wide audience over and over again,\" said Rep. Elaine Luria. D-Va. \"His intent was to deceive.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nScalia told Trump to concede to Biden\n\nEugene Scalia, the Trump administration’s Labor secretary, told the committee he spoke with Trump on Dec. 14, 2020 – the day Electoral College votes for president were certified, and told him the time had come to concede.\n\n“I conveyed to him that I thought it was time for him to acknowledge that President Biden had prevailed in the election,” said Scalia, the son of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nScalia said the campaign was over if legal challenges were exhausted and fraud not established.\n\n“Unfortunately I believed what had to be done was concede the outcome,” Scalia said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump rushes to complete unfinished business, signs memo for large-scale troop withdrawal\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger said once Trump knew he had lost the election, he rushed to complete unfinished business.\n\nHe cited how Trump acted immediately and signed an order on Nov. 11 requiring immediate withdrawal of troops from Somalia and Afghanistan to be completed before the Biden inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\n“I personally thought it was militarily not feasible, nor wise,” said Gen, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nGen. Keith Kellogg, the national security adviser for the president, said in video testimony he thought the memo “was a tremendous disservice to the nation.”\n\n“An immediate departure that that memo said would have been catastrophic,” Kellogg said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nAide: Angry Trump told Meadows 'I don’t want people to know that we lost.'\n\nAfter the Supreme Court stopped his lawsuit related to the 2020 election from going forward, Trump became angry and tried to stop people from finding out that they lost the election, according to evidence presented by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\n“Just FYI potus is pissed – breaking news – supreme court denied his law suit,” an email from a Secret Service agent on Dec. 11, 2020 said. “He is livid now”\n\nPOTUS is an acronym for President of the United States.\n\nFormer White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson said she and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows crossed paths with a “raging” and “fired up” Trump that day as he walked out of the oval office, who then told Meadows something to the effect of, “I don’t want people to know we lost, Mark. This is embarrassing. We need to figure it out. I don’t want people to know that we lost.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nTrump campaign aides repeatedly told him voter fraud claims were baseless\n\nTrump’s campaign aides exhaustively reviewed each of the former president’s baseless claims of voter fraud but found nothing to invalidate the results of the 2020 election results, according to witnesses who spoke with the committee.\n\n“There’s no ‘there’ there,” Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows told the former president, according to testimony.\n\nTrump campaign manager Bill Stepien also relayed the reality to the former president. The Trump campaign team lost 65 lawsuits between the November election and Jan. 20 that sought to overturn election results.\n\n“It's an easier job be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations. It’s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn't true,” Stepien said to the committee.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nAides said Trump admitted he lost 2020 election\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., one of two GOP members on the panel, outlined how after the election the former president’s campaign aides knew his chances of pulling out a victory were slim.\n\nThe committee showed a videotape testimony by former Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller, who said how they told Trump, “the odds of us prevailing… were very small.”\n\nKinzinger then played a clip of Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, saying how he lost and letting the “next guy” deal with foreign affairs.\n\nOther former White House aides also told the committee how Trump acknowledged losing but wanted to keep fighting.\n\nAlyssa Farah, a former White House communications director, said a week after the election was called, she “popped in the Oval (Office)” and that Trump said: “Can you believe I lost to this f-ing guy?”\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nThe committee showed clips of Roger Stone, a Republican political operative who is a confidant of Donald Trump, from a Danish documentary from director Christoffer Guldbrandsen\n\n“I really do suspect it’ll still be up in the air,” Stone said of his expectations for election night 2020. “When that happens, the key thing to do is to claim victory. Possession is nine-tenths of the law. No, we won. You’re wrong.”\n\nStone was previously convicted of lying to Congress and other crimes, and sentenced to three years in prison. Trump pardoned him Dec. 23, 2020. Stone refused to answer questions from the committee by invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nBut Stone met with Trump allies at the Willard Hotel near the White House on Jan. 5 and 6, according to Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. And he posted his advice to Trump on social media Dec. 27.\n\n“I also told the president exactly how he can appoint a special counsel with full subpoena power to ensure those who are attempting to steal the 2020 election through voter fraud are charged and convicted and ensure Donald Trump continues as our president,” Stone said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nStone had close associations with Oath Keepers and Proud Boys\n\nIn the days leading up to and the day of the Capitol attack, longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone maintained direct connections to the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, far-right extremist groups that were on the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to the panel.\n\nMembers of those groups have been charged with seditious conspiracy – conspiring against the U.S. government.\n\n“Multiple associates of Roger Stone from both the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with this crime,” said committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.\n\nLofgren pointed to Stone’s associates who are currently under trial or who have already plead guilty to charges of seditious conspiracy such as Joshua James, leader of the Alabama Oath Keepers who pled guilty earlier this year.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nPence staff did not want to declare victory prior to official results\n\nStaff members to Vice President Mike Pence were concerned with what Trump might do on election night regarding the results of the election, Rep. Zoe Lofgren said. She added that the vice president's staff took steps to ensure Pence would not echo a false victory announcement from Trump.\n\nThe vice president’s staff indicated there was a possibility that there would be a declaration of victory, prior to election results being known, within the White House, she said.\n\nVice President Pence’s counsel Greg Jacob worked with Chief of Staff Mark Short to avoid Vice President Pence from being thrust into a position of having to comment on the election results without efficient information.\n\n“It is essential that the vice president not be perceived by public as having decided questions concerning disputed electoral votes prior to the full development of all relevant facts,” according to a memo sent on election day that the Jan. 6 committee obtained from the National Archives.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDraft statement ahead of election urged Trump to declare victory\n\nAn outside advisor to former President Donald Trump sent a draft statement to aides Molly Michael and Dan Scavino days before the 2020 election with language Trump could use to declare victory.\n\n“We had an election today – and I won,” the draft statement from Tom Fitton sent Oct. 31 said. “The ballots counted by the Election Day deadline show the American people have bestowed up on me the great honor of reelection to President of the United States.”\n\nThere is no deadline to count ballots only on Election Day, and “everyone knew that ballot counting would lawfully continue past Election Day, said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. “Claiming that the counting on election night must stop was, as we now know, a key part of President Trump’s premeditated plan.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nLofgren: Trump's declaration of victory was part of plan to steal the election\n\nThe committee is revisiting one of the famous events of Election Night 2020 – Trump's false declaration of victory.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., noted that Trump and aides planned their \"victory speech\" well in advance, trying to convince Americans that the election was over and further counting of mail-in ballots was an effort to rig the result.\n\nCalling the false declaration part of an effort to steal the election, Lofgren noted that allies like Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, and Brad Parscale helped prepare Trump's premature declaration of victory.\n\n“It was a premeditated plan by the president to declare victory no matter what the actual result was,\" she said. \"He made a plan to stay in office before Election Day.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump had ‘pre-meditated plan’ to reject election results, committee says\n\nTrump campaign advisors told the former president on election night that it was premature to declare victory but he did anyway as part of a “pre-meditated plan,” according to the committee.\n\n“It was far too early to many any calls like that,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told the committee in videotaped testimony.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a committee member, said Trump planned to exploit a “red mirage” that would show him ahead of Joe Biden before mail-ballots were counted. Trump attacked mail-ballots throughout the campaign, giving Biden a massive advantage among voters who voted absentee.\n\nAnd yet Trump advisors advised the former president in the months before the election that mail-ballots could actually help him win.\n\n“Mail-in ballots can be a good thing,” Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner told the committee, describing what was told to Trump\n\nStepien gave a similar account to the committee but said “the president’s mind was made up.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCheney: Trump wasn’t ‘dupe’\n\nIn a blistering opening statement, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who serves as the panel's vice chair, warned that if some sort of action isn’t taken against the former president “another Jan. 6 could happen again.”\n\n\"President Trump knew from unassailable sources that his election fraud claims were false. He admitted he had lost the election,\" she said.\n\nCheney, who lost her reelection bid in a GOP primary to a Trump-backed contender in August, has been a chief target of the former president’s ire. She reiterated during Thursday’s hearing how the former president was solely responsible for the attack.\n\n\"There is no defense that Donald Trump was duped or irrational,” she said. “No president can defy the rule of law and act this way in a constitutional republic—period.\"\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nCheney says “no guarantee” institutions will hold next time\n\nVice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., warned of future presidencies that could emulate Trump’s efforts to overturn the election.\n\n“A key lesson of this investigation is this: our institutions only hold when men and women of good faith make them hold, regardless of the political cost,” said Cheney.\n\n“Any future president inclined to attempt what Donald Trump did in 2020 has now learned not to install people who could stand in the way,” Cheney warned.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nCommittee to present evidence from Secret Service\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee will present “new materials produced to the committee by the Secret Service,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Thursday.\n\nThe committee found out after subpoenaing Secret Service records earlier this year that the agency had deleted text messages that staff made on Jan. 5 and 6, leading the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general to launch a criminal investigation.\n\nMore:Criminal probe of Secret Service texts a 'big deal' as agency draws Jan. 6 committee scrutiny\n\nHowever, since the last hearing, the committee received about 800,000 pages of documents from the Secret Service, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in September.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nCheney: Trump ‘central cause’ of Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nThe committee will explore during the hearing former President Donald Trump’s state of mind, intent and motivations in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to the vice chairwoman, Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\nShe said Trump made his claims of a stolen election without evidence in hand and then spurred aides to spread lies about fraud.\n\n“The vast weight of the evidence so far has shown us that the central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, Donald Trump, who many others followed,” said Cheney, R-Wyo. “None of this would have happened without him. He was personally and substantially involved in all of it.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nThompson hints at 'further investigative action' by the committee\n\nCommittee chairman Bennie Thompson previewed coming attractions by noting that this hearing is a also a \"business meeting\" – meaning the committee could take votes today on future investigative steps.\n\n\"In addition to presenting evidence, we can potentially hold a committee vote on further investigative action based upon that evidence,\" Thompson said.\n\nPossible actions range from new subpoenas to criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTestimony came mostly from Republicans, chairman says\n\nThe evidence obtained by the Jan. 6 committee is not partisan and testimony came almost entirely from Republicans, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in his opening statement.\n\nThompson said testimony came from former President Donald Trump’s closest aides and advisors, the highest officials in the Department of Justice, Republican state officials, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and members of Trump’s own family, among others.\n\n“It’s tough for any congressional investigation to obtain evidence of what we’ve seen, least of all such a detailed view into a president’s inner circle,” Thompson said.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nJan. 6 panel promises ‘never-before-seen footage’ before hearing begins\n\nThe House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol says it will show “never-before-seen footage” during Thursday’s public hearing and “more details about the ongoing threat to American democracy.”\n\nThat’s according to a tweet from the Jan. 6 committee posted shortly before the hearing is set to begin at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\nThursday will mark the 9th hearing of the committee, which has worked to highlight the central role former President Donald Trump played ahead of and during the attack.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is the future for Jan. 6 committee members?\n\nWeeks away from the midterms, seven Jan. 6 committee members are gearing up for key races in their home districts while three others will not be returning to Congress next term.\n\nCommittee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., was defeated in Wyoming’s GOP primary race this August against Trump-backed candidate Harriet Hageman.\n\nBoth Republican Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and Democrat Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida announced did not seek reelection.\n\nThe remaining committee members face bids to keep their seats on Nov. 8.\n\nCommittee chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., faces GOP military veteran Brian Flowers, who won the Republican primary earlier this summer.\n\nIn Virginia, Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria is running against Navy veteran and Virginia state Sen. Jen Kiggans in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin is running against republican Gregory Coll, a rocket scientist, to keep his seat in Maryland’s 8th Congressional District.\n\nIn California, Democrats Adam Schiff, Pete Aguilar and Zoe Lofgren are facing off against Republican primary winners to remain in office.\n\nRoger Stone's role:What exactly was Roger Stone's role in Capitol riot? The next Jan. 6 hearing could tell us\n\nWho are the members of the January 6 committee?\n\nThe committee is composed of nine members of the House — seven Democrats and two Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., appointed each member.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi serves as the committee chair. He previously worked on legislation to create a bipartisan commission to investigate Jan. 6, but it died in the Senate. Thompson, who also serves as chair of the Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump after Jan. 6 and accused the president of inciting the attack and conspiring with extremist groups.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., serves as the vice chair and is one of two Republicans on the committee. Cheney condemned Trump for his role in the attack and voted to impeach him, resulting in her being ousted from GOP leadership for criticizing the former president and those who remain loyal to him.\n\nIllinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger serves as the other Republican on the committee. Kinzinger was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. He has condemned members of his own party and has been an outspoken member of the GOP.\n\nAlso on the committee are Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Adam Schiff of California, who both served as lead impeachment managers for Trump’s first and second impeachments.\n\nOther Democrat House members include Stephanie Murphy of Florida who co-chairs the Blue Dog Coalition; Pete Aguilar of California, the only Latino representative on the committee; Zoe Lofgren of California, who was involved in prosecuting one of Trump’s impeachment trials and retired Navy commander Elaine Luria of Virginia.\n\nWho else is the committee seeking to testify?\n\nThe committee sought testimony from Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, specifically over a phone call Trump made to Vos asking to overturn the results of the election.\n\nThe committee expressed interest in speaking again with two Secret Service officials who protected Trump – Anthony Ornato and Robert Engel – after former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony.\n\nNeither have testified under oath. Cheney said the committee received 800,000 pages of communication from the Secret Service after committee members filed a subpoena in July for text messages reportedly deleted.\n\nThe committee also requested former House Speaker Newt Gingrich provide information related to Jan. 6.\n\nMore:Former Proud Boys leader pleads guilty to seditious conspiracy in Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nWho has testified since the last hearing?\n\nMembers of the committee interviewed additional witnesses since the last public hearing in July.\n\nThe committee heard from Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, on Sept. 29. She voluntarily agreed to appear before the committee and repeated claims the 2020 election was stolen during her testimony.\n\nThomas's lawyer said she voiced concerns over election fraud, condemned the violence on Jan. 6 and answered the committee's questions.\n\nThe committee also heard from Kelli Ward, the head of Arizona’s Republican Party, who declined to answer questions during her subpoenaed testimony, according to a government attorney. Ward was part of a group that cast fake electoral votes for Trump after he lost the state.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee sought a log of her phone calls and text messages. A federal judge decided the committee was within its rights to subpoena Ward for the cell phone records.\n\nWhat time is Thursday's Jan. 6 hearing?\n\nThe hearing will be at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere to watch the Jan. 6 hearing\n\nUSA TODAY will air it on its YouTube channel. C-SPAN will also air it, as well as TV networks such as CNN, CBS and MSNBC.\n\nHearing witness:Stephen Ayres, Capitol rioter who testified at Jan. 6 hearing, gets 2 years probation\n\nWill this be the last hearing?\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said maybe so when interviewed on \"Meet the Press\" on Sept. 25.\n\n\"It, it may be the last investigative public hearing where we're going to try to round out the factual narrative,\" he said, but held out hope there would be an additional hearing \"that lays out all of our legislative recommendations about how to prevent coups, insurrections, political violence and electoral sabotage in the future because this is a clear and present danger that's continuing up right to this day.\"\n\nCheney suggested at the Texas Tribune Festival Sept. 24 that it is unlikely the upcoming hearing will be the last.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}]}

While he didn’t close the door on Black Adam returning in some form, Johnson said the character was not in DC’s plans for the immediate future. (DC Studios and CNN are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of several decisions by DC’s management team that have angered some fans, particularly those involving the flagship characters Superman and Wonder Woman.\n\n“My passionate friends, I wanted to give you a long-awaited Black Adam update regarding the character’s future in the new DC Universe. James Gunn and I connected, and Black Adam will not be in their first chapter of storytelling. However, DC and Seven Bucks have agreed to continue exploring the most valuable ways Black Adam can be utilized in future DC multiverse chapters,” Johnson wrote. “James and I have known each other for years and have always rooted for each other to succeed.”\n\nHe went on to write, “It’s no different now, and I will always root for DC (and Marvel) to win and WIN BIG. You guys know me, and I have very thick skin – and you can always count on me to be direct with my words. These decisions made by James and DC leadership represent their vision of DCU through their creative lens.”\n\nJohnson added that he was “very proud” to make the film, which made its debut in October.\n\nFrank Masi/Warner Bros.

In the movie, the antihero is awakened in the present day after being dormant for years, and proceeds to fight the Justice Society of America, including such heroes as Hawkman and Doctor Fate.\n\nAlthough the movie has grossed nearly $400 million worldwide, there has been some debate about whether that will be enough to make the film profitable, given its high budget and marketing costs. Johnson has stated via Twitter that it ultimately will be.\n\nThe film was coolly received by critics, averaging just a 41 (out of 100) on the aggregation site Metacritic.\n\n“Black Adam” ended with a closing-credit sequence that hinted at further adventures to come, including a cameo by Henry Cavill in the role of Superman.

Here's what's in store:\n\nThe force will be strong at Disney parks:Star Wars-themed lands are in development at Orlando's Disney World and Anaheim's Disneyland, and are expected to be 14 acres each. Guests will be able to ride the Millennium Falcon, sample blue milk and hang out at the cantina. Disney didn't give a timeline for the additions, but park attendees will experience more Star Wars even before the themed lands are ready: Popular indoor roller coaster Space Mountain will transform into Hyperspace Mountain; 3D simulator Star Tours will include new characters from The Force Awakens; and there will be a new Star Wars Launch Bay for guests to play games and peek behind the scenes of movies.\n\nDisney also announced plans for a new Toy Story Land, complete with a Slinky Dog roller coaster.\n\n'Civil War' breaks out: Both Captain America (Chris Evans) and The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) flew in overnight from the German set of Captain America: Civil War to show off footage from the Marvel movie (in theaters May 6, 2016), which pits superheroes against each other.

DeGeneres, who voices the forgetful blue tang and has been campaigning for the Dory film for years, helped introduce the new movie's cast. The actors then joined her and the animators onstage: Ed O'Neill (Modern Family) voices a curmudgeonly octopus, Ty Burrell (also Modern Family) is a confused beluga whale and Kaitlin Olson (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) is an innocent whale shark.

The cheeky tagline: \"Saving the world takes a little Hart and a big Johnson.\"\n\n\"There's just something about seeing the visual of us together,\" says Johnson, 44, who at a brawny 6-foot-5 dwarfs his 5-foot-4 co-star.\n\nAdds Hart, 36: \"We talked about the poster way before we even got into the film. We knew the visual of Dwayne and myself was going to be amazing, so we're already going to have people's attention. Let's just make sure that once we get their attention, we keep it.\"\n\nIn Central Intelligence (in theaters Friday), the actors play former high-school classmates who meet again two decades later under potentially lethal circumstances. Calvin Joyner (Hart), voted \"most likely to succeed\" his senior year, is now listlessly trapped behind a desk as an accountant. He's passed over for yet another promotion, and his stress is compounded by marital strife with his high school sweetheart (Danielle Nicolet) and their upcoming 20-year class reunion.\n\nBut his life is sent into a tailspin by a visit from Bob Stone (Johnson), a once-bullied nerd turned rogue CIA operative who still idolizes Calvin and haphazardly wrangles him into a dangerous mission. High-speed chases, office shootouts and a slew of surprise celebrity cameos ensue.\n\nThe Rock launched a motivational alarm clock because he wants better for you\n\nJohnson was the first one attached to Central, directed by We're the Millers' Rawson Marshall Thurber and co-written by The Mindy Project's Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen. Together with New Line Cinema executives, they ran through a list of roughly 10 actors, singers and stand-up comedians whom Johnson could be paired with. Johnson had never met Hart, but he was a fan of his comedy and suggested him on a whim.\n\n\"I downloaded literally every (stand-up) album he put out,\" says Johnson, who has since co-hosted the MTV Movie Awards with Hart. \"I remember starting to hear about his tours and how successful they were, and I was like, 'Man, he's really doing things.' \"\n\nFor both actors, part of Central's appeal was that it flips the roles they might typically play in movies: Hart as the uptight straight man to Johnson's goofy, unpredictable Bob, who first appears wearing a unicorn T-shirt and fanny pack before beating up a rowdy group of trash-talkers in a bar. As parents, they also were drawn to the movie's pronounced anti-bullying theme as Calvin and Bob move past their teenage glories and scars to more fully embrace their grown-up selves.\n\n\"There's the message of being comfortable with who you are and where you are in your life,\" Hart says. \"The standards that we create and pressure we put on ourselves is sometimes overwhelming, and both characters have done that in some way, shape or form.\" With that through line, \"there's a real partnership that's formed; it's a unique ride. We tried to make it as fresh as possible in a day and age where every realm of buddy film has been done.\"\n\nCinemaCon: Raunchy 'Baywatch' movie earns its R rating\n\nJohnson and Hart, now sitting in a disheveled hotel room off Central Park, are jocular and chatty, though visibly worn down by a grueling day of back-to-back interviews. It's a best-foot-forward attitude that Thurber recalls on the movie's Boston set last summer. Filming one particular scene, the actors were asked to pretend they were jumping from an office building. That meant being hoisted up in wire rigs for nearly six hours, which caused them excruciating groin pain.\n\n\"I've worked with a lot actors who would make it worse by (complaining) and moaning, or giving you a lot of side-eye when you ask them to go for another take,\" Thurber says. \"Kevin and Dwayne took the opportunity to do a dueling Instagram post, where they each recorded a video to their fans while the other was recording another one in the background. They were always using those opportunities to have fun and make fun of each other.\"\n\nTogether, those two videos earned 1.3 million \"likes\" on Instagram. It's just one example of Johnson and Hart using social media to help promote Central, as they continue to share behind-the-scenes photos and videos of the making of the film and its media tour. Considering they have nearly 210 million combined followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, their influence is far-reaching.\n\n\"There's been a question of 'Do stars really open movies the way they used to?' For a movie like this, it's going to be central,\" says Daniel Loria, editorial director at BoxOffice Media. \"These are two guys who take their star personas very seriously and work very hard in grassroots marketing of their films — getting out there in front of fans and being very active on their social media accounts to really help a film out.\"\n\nLiam Hemsworth and Jeff Goldblum reenacted The Rock's turtleneck pic\n\nLoria predicts Central will open with $52 million against Disney/Pixar's Finding Dory, on its way to $155 million domestically. That would put the actors' first joint venture just above many of their recent, separate hits. Since his breakout turn in 2012's Think Like a Man, movies starring Hart have earned nearly $675 million, bolstered by the successes of Ride Along ($134.9 million) with Ice Cube and its sequel ($90.9 million) and last year's Get Hard with Will Ferrell ($90.4 million).\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has had some box-office misses in Hercules ($72.7 million) and Pain and Gain ($49.9 million). But his prominent role in the billion-dollar Fast & Furious franchise, combined with last year's top-billed surprise smash San Andreas ($474 million worldwide), have proven he is a viable commodity.\n\nWith Johnson, \"we're talking about a global superstar where his movies do well pretty much anywhere in the world, and that's really hard to get these days,\" Loria says. \"We see movies being built for a global audience, but we don't see many stars. Sure, we can say that Pirates of the Caribbean 5 is a movie being built for a global audience, but can we really say that about Johnny Depp these days?\"\n\nAlthough they come from different professional backgrounds — Hart, in stand-up comedy; Johnson, in college football and wrestling before transitioning to acting — the two have a shared desire to cultivate their personal brands, and in turn, help motivate each other.\n\n\"We look at Oprah (Winfrey), and she's a billionaire, and a lot of people would be like: 'What are you doing? Go relax.' But it's something in her that just wants to keep conquering,\" Hart says. \"It's the same thing you're looking at here. We have so much more to do.\" Hart's ultimate goal, he says, is \"to become a mogul. I look at the word and I understand the definition of it. I'm 36 years old, so I have nothing but time to achieve that.\"\n\nAdds Johnson: \"We've got a very similar mind-set of building, building, building. We can get projects green-lit, we don’t have to read them — it’s a really good position, especially today. It’s a very hard business these days to get movies made and (figure out) what people have the appetite to see.\"\n\nComing up, Hart has lined up more family-friendly fare: Disney's The Secret Life of Pets (out July 8) and an animated adaptation of the kids' book series Captain Underpants, expected next year. Johnson, who returns to HBO on the NFL comedy Ballers this summer, has a crowded slate of movies announced or in production, including sequels San Andreas 2 and Fast 8, superhero movie Doc Savage, and remakes of Baywatch and Jumanji.\n\nThe latter will reunite Johnson and Hart and is a reboot of the 1995 family adventure starring Robin Williams, about a magical board game. The new film will co-star Jack Black and Tom Holland, and \"reimagine the story,\" Johnson says. \"We want to honor Robin Williams' character, who will be forever immortalized in our story. We've got a really cool way to honor his legacy that should be very entertaining, and I think his family's going to be proud. We're excited about it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/04/01/coronavirus-cancellations-postponements-entertainment-music-movies-tv/5102829002/", "title": "Coronavirus cancellations: 'Black Widow,' 'Mulan,' Journey tour", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic shows no signs of slowing down any time soon, cancellations and postponements in the entertainment industry continue — from tours to awards shows and film productions, the virus is putting a halt to most, if not all, events.\n\nBookExpo, which already had been postponed from May to July, has been called off for this year, ReedPOP announced March 14.\n\nThe publishing industry's annual national convention was to have been held at New York's Jacob Javits Convention Center, which has been converted to a hospital to help with the city's caseload of coronavirus patients.\n\nDisney made some major moves regarding its movie slate on April 3, parking the solo Marvel film \"Black Widow\" in the fall and slating a \"Captain Marvel\" sequel in 2022.

Today, another Tennessee lawmaker has been reappointed. Plus, an e-cigarette maker will pay millions after a series of lawsuits, and NPR quits Twitter.\n\n♦\n\nThe second of two Tennessee lawmakers expelled by Republicans was reappointed yesterday.\n\nJustin Pearson:\n\nThey ended up putting themselves on trial and the people's verdict is back.\n\nCrowd:\n\nGuilty.\n\nJustin Pearson:\n\nGuilty, guilty, guilty.\n\nCrowd:\n\nGuilty, guilty, guilty.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThat's Justin Pearson, one of two Black Democratic state legislators whose expulsion from the state house last week sparked a national backlash. For more, I spoke with Commercial Appeal government reporter Katherine Burgess. Katherine, thanks for hopping on the podcast.\n\nKatherine Burgess:\n\nHi. Thanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Katherine, let's just set the stage, to start. Why was Justin Pearson expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives in the first place?\n\nKatherine Burgess:\n\nJustin Pearson and Justin Jones, who represents Davidson County, were expelled from the Tennessee State House after they engaged in protests related to the Covenant School shooting. They were advocating for tighter gun restrictions, along with representative Gloria Johnson, who represents Knoxville. So the three of them went forward, led chants, engaged with many young people who were in the Capitol and broke House rules of decorum.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd days later, Pearson has now been reappointed. Was this expected after Rep. Jones was also reinstated?\n\nKatherine Burgess:\n\nYes. I think this was expected even before Rep. Jones was reinstated. Shelby County Commission, which is the body that decides whether or not to reappoint an interim, has a nine-member Democratic super majority. Not all of them were able to be present today. There were seven Democrats present, but Pearson was still able to easily get the seven votes he needed to be reappointed.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what was the scene like as his supporters gathered after the vote?\n\nKatherine Burgess:\n\nThere was so much applause, so much cheering, chants of, \"Justin, Justin.\" The chambers were absolutely packed. The audience was really excited. After the vote, members of the crowd, Justin Pearson's supporters and Pearson himself spilled out into the plaza outside the Shelby County government building where there was very much a party-like atmosphere. Music was playing. It was a very joyous moment for the people gathered, but also slightly tempered by Justin Pearson reminding people that there is a weight on his shoulders to keep seeking gun reform. So very joyful, but also an awareness that this was something prompted by a very serious moment.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what are lawmakers saying about a possible investigation into these expulsions?\n\nKatherine Burgess:\n\nTop leadership in the country have called on the Department of Justice to investigate.\n\nThere's specifically three things they are asking to be investigated. The first is whether the rights of the people who are represented by Jones and Pearson have been violated in them losing representation for a week. The second is whether the rights of Reps Jones and Pearson were violated for losing their free speech and freedom of assembly, and the third is whether the rights of Jones and Pearson were violated based on race. Because notably, they were expelled and they are both young Black men, while Gloria Johnson, the representative from Knoxville, a white woman, was not expelled.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCommercial Appeal Government Reporter Katherine Burgess, thanks so much.\n\nKatherine Burgess:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA video circulating on social media that appears to show a Ukrainian soldier being decapitated fueled outrage yesterday and prompted a war crimes investigation. The Chief of Ukraine Security Service, Vasyl Maliuk, said, \"We will find these monsters.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged to neither forgive the killers, nor forget the crimes. He also referred to Bucha, the city where hundreds of bodies were found in mass graves after Russian occupiers fled.\n\nMeanwhile, a Kremlin spokesman questioned the authenticity of this week's video.\n\n♦\n\nInflation slowed for a ninth straight month in March, amid drops in both gasoline and grocery prices. According to the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, consumer prices overall increased 5% from a year earlier, down from 6% in February and a 40-year high of 9.1% last June.\n\nMeanwhile, rent continues to be the biggest driver of inflation, but the increase notably slowed. Rent increased 0.5%, down from 0.8% in February, but it's still up 8.8% the past year. Economists do expect rents to fall later this year.\n\n♦\n\nEmbattled e-cigarette maker Juul will pay nearly half a billion dollars to settle a series of lawsuits. USA TODAY Health Reporter Ken Alltucker explains.\n\nKen, welcome to 5 Things.\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Ken, what exactly did these lawsuits focus on?\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nWell, we had a half dozen states, California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Mexico and New York, as well as the District of Columbia, who largely alleged that Juul targeted marketing efforts towards underaged vapers. This was a collective settlement for those six states and DC, and as part of it, Juul agreed to pay $462 million. Juul denied any wrongdoing, but they've been settling a bunch of cases. Now they say they're up to 47 states and territories and they've paid out over $1 billion. The way the company describes it is these largely deal with past business practices.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Ken, how big of a deal is the teen vaping crisis in America?\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nWell, in 2019 it kind of snuck up in many ways where there's a national survey the federal government does, and it found more than one quarter of high school students were using vaping devices.\n\nThere was a more recent survey last year and it found that those numbers had dropped. Researchers cautioned the two studies weren't directly comparable because of different methodologies, as well as the pandemic that sort of hampered collection efforts.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKen, can you just explain to us a little about the risks to vaping?\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nSure. Now, as with everything, with vaping, there are different views on this. Federally-funded research shows that there might be some cardiovascular risk. This is from the National Institutes of Health. The CDC says nicotine is, of course, addictive and that's what these devices deliver and can harm adolescent brain development. However, long-term risks are still being studied.\n\nNow, vaping industry supporters and advocates will say it's less harmful than cigarette smoking and they sort of portray it as a harm reduction effort because you're not inhaling the harmful chemicals that are in tobacco. However, health folks, groups like the American Lung Association, warn that we really don't know what the long-term effects of these chemicals are and it's a risk.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKen Alltucker, thanks so much.\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nOkay. Thanks for your time.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nNPR is leaving Twitter. The move comes about a week after the social media platform designated the outlet as state-affiliated media. That's the same designation often used to identify propaganda and media outlets controlled by authoritarian governments.\n\nTwitter later changed the label to government-funded media, but NPR maintains that both labels are inaccurate, noting that the nonprofit news company operates independently from the US government. The company said that federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting accounts for less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget.\n\nIn addition to NPR, Twitter has given the government-funded media label to several other outlets as of yesterday, including PBS and the BBC. PBS said yesterday that it has also stopped tweeting from its main account.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Twitter for a statement yesterday. The press account replied with a poop emoji.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things. You could find us every day wherever you get your audio. I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/13"}]}

Pearson ...", "text": "Melissa Brown\n\nNashville Tennessean\n\nTen days after a shooter unloaded 152 rounds at a Nashville school and killed six people, Tennessee House Republicans on Thursday expelled from the General Assembly two Democratic lawmakers for breaking House rules and mounting a gun-reform protest on the chamber's floor.\n\nAfter hours of fiery debate, the House expelled Reps. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, on a 72-25 vote, and Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, 69-26, in a move that put the nation's eyes on Tennessee and its politics.\n\nBut the House failed to achieve the two-thirds majority needed to kick Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, out of the chamber. The effort to expel Johnson failed on a 65-30 vote, as chants \"Gloria! Gloria!\" rang out in the House chamber.\n\nThe historic, party-line expulsion process has roiled political tensions as the state continues to grapple with the deadliest school shooting in its history. The debate drew widespread attention beyond Tennessee, with the nation's eyes on the Volunteer State and thousands of protesters objecting to the expulsion.\n\nTennessee three:What to know about the House Democrats targeted for expulsion by Republicans\n\nWith the expulsions, Republicans removed two of the youngest Black lawmakers in the General Assembly, further reducing an already small minority caucus.\n\nStill, with the expulsions, Republican leadership have elevated the two lawmakers’ political profiles, possibly with little long-term gains for the chamber as Pearson and Jones could be reappointed to their seats within days or weeks.\n\n\"What is happening here today is a farce of democracy,\" Jones said at the beginning of his 20-minute defense, after gazing up at a packed gallery holding signs in his defense. \"What is happening here today is a situation in which the jury has already publicly announced the verdict. What we see today is just a spectacle. What we see today is a lynch mob assembled to not lynch me, but our democratic process.\"\n\nJones at one point took a long pause, taking a few sips of water, allowing the chants of \"whose house, our house,\" to flow into the chamber from the crowd gathered outside.\n\n\"Your extreme measure is an attempt to subvert the will of voters who democratically elected us as representatives to speak and to passionately fight for them,\" Jones said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement on Thursday night: \"Today’s expulsion of lawmakers who engaged in peaceful protest is shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent. Rather than debating the merits of the issue, these Republican lawmakers have chosen to punish, silence, and expel duly-elected representatives of the people of Tennessee.\"\n\nStay in the conversation on politics:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nThe expulsions for the two were effective immediately, leading Jones to gather his personal items from his desk. He later took a seat in the House gallery, now as a member of the public watching the legislative hearing below him.Lawmakers considered the fate of the three Democrats steps away from hundreds of protesters whose chants permeated the House doors, while more than 200 people stood in silence in the House galleries, many holding signs decrying the proceedings. Protesters continued to call on Republican lawmakers to pass gun reform and slammed the efforts to expel the lawmakers, who have been dubbed the \"Tennessee three.\"\n\nThe trio was accused of breaching decorum and floor rules for speaking at the House podium on March 30 without recognition.\n\nPearson and Jones, both freshman lawmakers who had previously clashed with leadership on other issues this session, walked up to the House podium during a floor session and using a bullhorn began leading gun reform chants, echoing the shouts of protesters packed into the Capitol rotunda. The pair, later flanked by Johnson, grew frustrated as House leadership moved on to regular business just days after the mass shooting.\n\nHouse Republicans showed a video montage of the events during the expulsion debate, over the objections of Democrats. The video included footage taken from the House floor by a lawmaker, and Democrats accused Republicans of breaking House rules forbidding members from recording floor sessions. The debate then centered on whether the House was formally in session at the time the lawmaker took the video.\n\n“This is just not about one specific instance or one specific rule that may have been broken. The rules here are for order,” said Rep. Johnny Garrett, R-Goodlettsville, who led the GOP arguments against Jones. “We owe that to the constituents that we represent across this state.”\n\nThe expulsions will strip more than 200,000 Tennesseans of their elected representation and marks just the fourth time since the end of the Civil War in which the House ousted sitting lawmakers. No House member has ever been removed from elected office for simply violating decorum rules.\n\nAfter relieving the lawmakers of committee assignments and shutting off their building access over the weekend, the Republican supermajority moved swiftly Monday to start the expulsion process, among the first legislative actions taken by the General Assembly related to the March 27 mass shooting that killed six, including three 9-year-olds.\n\nSarah Neumann, the mom to a 5-year-old who attends The Covenant School, watched the expulsion hearings from the House gallery. Pearson at one point went upstairs to give her a hug.\n\n\"I just want Noah to know I did something for him,\" she said, noting she wanted to come to the Capitol to honor the Covenant victims Katherine Koonce, Mike Hill, Cynthia Peak, Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, and she thinks of the shooter's family as well.\n\nThousands of Tennesseans have marched en masse on the state Capitol three times in the 10 days since the tragedy, demanding gun reform measures the ruling party is hesitant, if not outright opposed, to publicly support.\n\nCovenant School shooting in Nashville:3 children, 3 adults dead; victims' names released\n\nPearson later said he could not \"sit idly by\" after lawmakers that day walked through a gauntlet of protesters, many of whom were teenagers, screaming for gun reform.\n\n\"If this House decides to expel me for exercising our sacred First Amendment right to help elevate the voices in our community who want to see us act to prevent gun violence, then do as you feel you must,\" Pearson told his colleagues in a Monday letter. \"We must always stand up for what we believe to be right and just, we must say no to more gun violence. We must prioritize the voices of thousands of families that are hurting due to this country's gun violence epidemic, especially in communities like District 86.\"\n\nThe trio were not recognized to speak, an official breach of floor rules, which led House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, to recess the House and huddle with leadership for nearly an hour. Democratic leadership led the three off the floor, and they later continued on with House business. But within days the lawmakers were stripped of their committee assignments and lost badge access to the legislative office building.\n\nSexton later likened the events to an \"insurrection,\" even comparing the peaceful protest that resulted in zero arrests to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol. Though he later walked back the comments, saying his remarks were directed at the three lawmakers and not protesters. Sexton this week said he considered the unprecedented floor protest an act \"against civil authority.\"\n\n\"What they did was try to hold up the people's business on the House floor instead of doing it the way that they should have done it, which they have the means to do,\" Sexton said. \"They actually thought that they would be arrested, and so they decided that them being a victim was more important than focusing on the six victims from Monday. And that's appalling.\"\n\nGOP wields supermajority power\n\nThe Thursday vote was widely viewed as a certainty as soon as the Republican caucus voted to file expulsion resolutions. For some, the partisan expulsions are a stark reminder of the supermajority power Republicans have amassed over the state's Democratic, urban areas.\n\n“I'm devastated. I am,” said protester Ashley Anderson, rain dripping off her hood as she stood in line to enter the Capitol. “There's so many emotions that go into how I feel about it. It's really hard to put words to it that this. It's fascist. It is undemocratic. You're leaving 200,000 constituents of the state without any representation. What is this? This is our freedom at stake.“\n\nJones' removal would mark the third major circumvention of Nashville voters in the last year, after an aggressive congressional redistricting effort in 2022 split Davidson County and parceled its majority-Democratic voter base into Republican-held districts. More recently, infuriated after the Nashville council blocked a bid to host the Republican Nashville Convention, lawmakers drew up multiple bills to shrink the Metro Council and snatch back control of governing boards such as the local airport and sports authorities.\n\nIn General Assembly history, a partisan expulsion vote like Thursday's is unusual, and an expulsion push over a decorum breach is unprecedented.\n\nEmotions ran high on Thursday morning after Jones opposed a school safety bill presented by Republicans, arguing it would further militarize schools while not addressing gun reform issues. Other Democrats said they were concerned the bill treats the \"symptoms\" of school shootings, not the problem.\n\n“That’s what is supposed to happen on this House floor when we debate legislation. We hear each other, we don’t hear the hate, we don’t hear the vitriol. It worked today, it can work for the future,” Garrett said. “One week ago, it didn’t work. One week ago we had members take it upon themselves to rush the well and stop the people’s business.\n\nGarrett said the protest, by shutting down the work of the House, “silenced 7 million” Tennesseans. Protesters in the gallery shook their heads as he spoke.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Karen Camper, D-Memphis, defended her colleagues.\n\n\"Rep. Jones represents thousands of people in this state whose voices have been silenced time and time and time again,\" she said. \"We had just had this mass shooting, and he only wanted to elevate the voices of those people. For a simple rule violation, we have elevated this to the highest level of admonishment. That’s not democracy.\"\n\nPast expulsions bipartisan votes\n\nThe House last expelled a sitting lawmaker in 2016, when the chamber voted 70-2 to remove then-Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, over allegations he had harassed nearly two dozen women while in office. In 1980, then-Rep. Robert Fisher was expelled on a 92-1 vote after a bribery conviction.\n\nSix lawmakers were ousted during an 1866 special session after they tried to prevent Tennessee from ratifying an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to provide citizenship to former slaves.\n\nThe Senate expelled a member for the first time last year following the conviction of Sen. Katrina Robinson, D-Memphis, on federal wire fraud charges.\n\nAn ethics committee was convened to investigate Robinson's case before it was brought to a vote, which Bruce Oppenheimer, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, said is typical procedure. Special committees took up the Durham and Fisher cases.\n\nJohnson this week decried the expulsion as a double-standard and politically motivated. Last year, former House Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, faced federal charges related to alleged crimes committed while in office was allowed to finish out his term, while current leadership in 2019 declined to support expulsion charges against former Rep. David Byrd, who was accused of sexually assaulting teenagers when he was a basketball coach decades earlier.\n\nLawmakers have contentious history with the three\n\nAll three lawmakers have at times publicly clashed with Republican leadership prior to The Covenant School shooting.\n\nWhile Jones is a freshman lawmaker, he is no stranger to the Capitol and led public protests against the lawmakers who later became his colleagues. In 2019, he led sit-ins to call for the removal of the bust of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from the Capitol, and was once arrested for tossing liquid at the former House speaker.\n\nRep. Gloria Johnson:'I wouldn't be here today' under current abortion ban\n\nJohnson was first elected to her Knoxville district in 2012 after retiring from teaching. After losing a reelection campaign twice to a Republican opponent, she won the seat back in 2018 and last year won election in a new district after redistricting.\n\nShe's long been an outspoken Democrat, particularly decrying Tennessee's no-exceptions abortion ban in recent months.\n\nPearson joined the legislature via appointment, following the death of Rep. Barbara Cooper, D-Memphis, last fall. Like Jones, the 28-year-old rose through local advocacy circles, co-founding a grassroots organization now credited with stopping a proposed crude oil pipeline from cutting through South Memphis backyards.\n\nHouse Republicans publicly scolded Pearson after he wore a traditional West African dashiki on the House floor on his first day in office.\n\nThe path forward\n\nDespite the high-profile expulsions, the three could technically return to the House within days.\n\nThe Tennessee Constitution allows a county governing body to appoint an interim representative in the case of a vacancy, an authority General Assembly Republicans could not easily revoke.\n\nAn expulsion does not disqualify a former representative from running for office, which could mean one of the expelled lawmakers could be appointed interim, run for reelection and be reseated in the General Assembly within months.\n\nRep. Gino Bulso, R-Brentwood, repeatedly stated Jones wanted to be expelled, but noted the Constitution would allow him to elected again after expulsion. “If after looking at his conduct, they vote he come back, we will recognize him as a representative,” Bulso said, referring to the floor protest as a \"mutiny.\"\n\nMore:What happens when Tennessee House members get expelled? Here are some answers\n\nThe trio has demurred this week on future plans, instead choosing to focus on the upcoming expulsion vote. Johnson on Monday indicated she was consulting with lawyers, though one attorney said pursuing a lawsuit could be an uphill battle given as the state Constitution gives the legislature express authority to discipline and expel its own members.\n\n\"Ultimately, it falls under the separation of powers,\" attorney David Raybin said. \"The constitution prevents the legislature from interfering too much with the courts. Similarly, the constitution prevents the courts from interfering with the inner-workings of the legislature. A court would decline to review that.”\n\nVivian Jones, Nicole Hester, Angele Latham, Katherine Burgess and Tyler Whetstone contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/03/tennessee-republicans-expel-democrats-gun-reform-chants/11596894002/", "title": "Tennessee GOP begins expulsion process for 3 Democrats, House ...", "text": "Tennessee House Republicans on Monday filed resolutions to expel three Democrats for \"disorderly behavior\" after the trio led protest chants for gun reform on the floor of the chamber last week in the wake of the deadly Covenant School shooting.\n\nThe official expulsion resolutions state the trio \"did knowingly and intentionally bring disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives through their individual and collective actions.\"\n\nLawmakers have not yet voted for expulsion. Once the House votes on the resolution, it is expected to trigger an expulsion process that would give the trio a chance to defend themselves at another floor session before a final expulsion vote.\n\nStill, the resolutions were approved by a majority of the Republican caucus, which holds a supermajority in the General Assembly. Democrats will have little power to block expulsions if House Republicans move forward with a vote.\n\nHouse Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison, R-Cosby, referred to Rep. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, as the \"former representative\" from Davidson County on Monday night.\n\nThe trio were present and voted on bills Monday night. Together, they represent more than 210,000 constituents.\n\nOn Thursday, the three House Democrats approached the podium between bills without being recognized to speak — breaching the chamber’s rules of procedure.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nSexton immediately recessed the chamber, halting legislative business for nearly an hour before it resumed, and ordered security to clear the House galleries.\n\nWith a bullhorn, Reps. Gloria Johnson of Knoxville, Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis led protestors in the galleries in several chants calling for gun reform. At no point did any demonstrators make their way onto the House floor.\n\nFollowing the demonstration, Johnson, Pearson, and Jones' access to the Cordell Hull Legislative Office Building and member's parking garage was restricted. Johnson told reporters Monday that her building access badge had been deactivated, and she was unable to access the building to retrieve her mobility scooter over the weekend.\n\n\"No one told me that my garage pass was cut off. No one told me that my badge to the building was cut off,\" Johnson said. \"My scooter was inside the building. I needed it at home. I don't always need it at home on the weekend, but I needed it this past weekend because there was a big downtown event.\"\n\nDoug Kufner, a spokesperson for Sexton, confirmed access was restricted for the three members on Monday.\n\n\"Rep. Johnson was on limited access after her antics on Thursday,\" Kufner told The Tennessean. \"A trooper is always on-site, and the number is posted on the door outside the garage. They could have helped her. Rep. Johnson could have also called her leadership team for her caucus, the clerk, the speaker's office, or HR if she has trouble accessing the building.\"\n\nAll three continue to have access to their offices and legislative staff. Both Pearson and Jones spoke on the floor Monday night.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, stripped Johnson and Jones of their committee assignments. Pearson does not serve on any committees.\n\n\"What they did was try to hold up the people's business on the House floor instead of doing it the way that they should have done it, which they have the means to do,\" Sexton said. \"They actually thought that they would be arrested. And so they decided that them being a victim was more important than focusing on the six victims from Monday. And that's appalling.\"\n\nWaiting outside the chamber on Monday night, Jones said a non-bipartisan expulsion vote would be \"unprecedented.\"\n\nThe last time the House expelled a sitting lawmaker was in 2016 when the chamber voted 70-2 to remove then-Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, from the House for alleged sexual misconduct.

Justin Jones of Nashville, Justin Pearson of Memphis and Gloria Johnson of Knoxville – showed courage in pushing for gun reform following a mass shooting at a Nashville private Christian school that killed six people.\n\n“It wasn’t about these three leaders – it was about what they were representing,” she said during an event at Fisk University. “It’s about whose voices they were channeling. Is that not what a democracy allows?”\n\nHouse Republicans voted Thursday to expel Jones and Pearson, both of whom are Black, for their role in the protest. Johnson, who is white, dodged an expulsion by one vote.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\n“That is not a democracy,” Harris said of the expulsions. In a democracy, she said, \"you don’t silence the people, you do not stifle the people, you do not turn off their microphones when they are speaking about the importance of life and liberty.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden also spoke to the three Democrats, who have become known as the \"Tennessee Three,\" during a conference call Friday ahead of Harris' visit. He thanked them for their leadership in seeking to ban assault weapons and standing up for democratic values, the White House said. He also invited them to the White House in the near future.\n\nHarris' hastily arranged trip to Nashville came after Tennessee House Republicans voted overwhelmingly Thursday to expel Jones and Pearson. Jones was expelled on 72-25 vote. The vote to remove Pearce was 69-26. The expulsions have become a national flashpoint on the issues of gun control and race.\n\nUpon arriving in Nashville, Harris met privately with the three Democrats at Fisk, which hosted a gathering of community leaders to support the expelled lawmakers. Afterward, she met with other Tennessee Democratic lawmakers and Nashville Mayor John Cooper.\n\nPearson was met with raucous applause and cheers as he arrived for the event. “They thought they could expel democracy,” he said, addressing the crowd from a stone platform. “But we’re still here!”\n\nIn her remarks, Harris also praised students and other young leaders who converged upon the state Capitol en masse to push for gun control after the school shooting but haven't swayed the state's Republican majority. She encouraged them to continue the fight.\n\n\"I do believe that every generation has its calling, that there are moments in time that find you and require and depend on your leadership,\" she said. \"And so, in particular to all the young people, this issue is going to require your leadership.\"\n\nHarris renewed Biden's call for Congress to pass a nationwide ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Assault weapons \"were designed to kill a lot of people quickly\" and have \"no place on the streets of the civil society,\" she said.\n\nMore:Tennessee Republicans expel two of 'Tennessee Three' House Democrats for leading pro-gun reform protest\n\nAmong those waiting outside Fisk ahead of the event was Nicholas Umontuen, who teaches business administration at the university. Umontuen said he was \"shocked\" and \"demoralized\" by the decision to expel the lawmakers. But he said the national attention gives him hope to elevate the voices of young people fighting for change.\n\nThe trio of lawmakers were accused by Republican leadership of breaching decorum and floor rules for speaking at the House podium on March 30 without recognition.\n\nMore:'Congress has to act': Biden says there's nothing more he can do on his own to address guns\n\nBut by moving ahead with the expulsions, the state's Republican House speaker, Cameron Sexton, turned two Democrats who held no legislative power in a Republican supermajority into national heroes on the political left.\n\nBiden, in a statement, called the expulsions \"shocking, undemocratic and unprecedented.\" He said that \"rather than debating the merits\" of gun control, \"these Republican lawmakers have chosen to punish, silence, and expel duly-elected representatives of the people of Tennessee.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison and Michael Collins @mcollinsNEWS.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/05/tennessee-house-lawmaker-expulsion-vote-future-of-gop/70081721007/", "title": "Tennessee Republicans push to expel lawmakers may set future ...", "text": "Republicans are expected to vote on Thursday to remove three Democrats from the House.\n\nThe expulsion vote comes after the three lawmakers broke House rules and led chants for gun control from the House floor.\n\nTennessee’s Republican supermajority is poised to take the unprecedented move of expelling three Democrats as punishment for violating House decorum rules by using a bullhorn on the House floor to lead a protest calling for gun reform.\n\nHouse members are expected to vote Thursday to remove Reps. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, Justin Jones, D-Nashville, and Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, from elected office after the trio brought the chamber to a halt for nearly an hour last week by speaking out of order following the deadly shooting at The Covenant School – a move House Speaker Cameron Sexton later likened to “an insurrection.”\n\n“What they did was try to hold up the people's business on the House floor instead of doing it the way that they should have done it, which they have the means to do,” Sexton said. “They actually thought that they would be arrested. And so they decided that them being a victim was more important than focusing on the six victims from Monday. And that's appalling.”\n\nFollow along:Live updates as Republicans seek ouster of three Democrats who led gun reform chants\n\nHouse leadership has never overridden a member’s election for simply violating House rules. Only two House members have been expelled from the chamber since the 1800s, both after either criminal charges or sexual misconduct allegations. Both of those times, in 1980 and 2016, followed special committee inquiries and were bipartisan votes.\n\nExpulsion:Tennessee GOP begins expulsion process for 3 Democrats, House session devolves into chaos\n\nThe expulsion vote — along with the deadly Covenant shooting and subsequent demonstrations — has thrust Tennessee and its politics onto the national stage, drawing attention from Republicans and some of the highest-ranking Democrats in the country.\n\nIt has also given Tennessee Democrats a fundraising opportunity while illustrating the power the Republican supermajority has over legislative business and even representation in Democratic districts. Experts say the expulsion vote will set a precedent for the Tennessee General Assembly going forward.\n\n“They're trying to make us an example. This is a political lynching. But we will not back down,” Jones told reporters Monday, echoing words of expelled former Sen. Katrina Robinson, who at the time of her 2022 ouster called the GOP majority’s move “procedural lynching.”\n\nIf Republicans vote to remove the three members on Thursday, they might not be gone for long. The Tennessee Democratic Party is already fundraising to back the three in special elections. If constituents send them back, Tennessee’s Constitution does not allow members to be expelled twice for the same offense.\n\nPolitical martyrdom rockets ‘Tennessee Three’ to the national stage\n\nJones, Johnson and Pearson — dubbed “The Tennessee Three” — have garnered international media attention since the protest and looming expulsion vote, sparking a trending hashtag on social media this week and drawing messages of support from some of the highest-ranking Democrats in the country.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre characterized the expulsion proposal as “shrugging in the face of yet another tragic school shooting” during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nTennessee Capitol protest explainer:Here's what did and did not happen\n\nThousands of students marched on the Capitol to \"confront their lawmakers for their failure to keep them safe at school, and what did these Republican legislators do?\" Jean-Pierre said. \"They're trying to expel these three Democratic legislators who joined in the protests.”\n\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts joined numerous lawmakers across the country in sharing her support for the three, calling expulsion “infuriating and anti-democratic.”\n\nJones rhetorically claimed political martyrdom on Monday as he paralleled the trio’s indecorous behavior to that of “a revolutionary brown-skinned Palestinian named Jesus who engaged in good trouble” when he cleansed the temple before his crucifixion.\n\n“Jesus engaged in an act out of decorum because he knew that the dignity of the people who were being dishonored was more important than decorum,” Jones said on the House floor Monday. “God is not pleased with injustice and that light will shine, and no matter what you do to us, we will not bow down.”\n\nOn the flip side, the three have drawn ire from conservative media as Sexton has appeared multiple times on Fox News to criticize the interruption.\n\n\"[Jones] is trying to make this about the protestors. He's trying to make this about what people were protesting about. Their voices were not silenced. This has nothing to do with anything outside the House chamber,\" Sexton said Wednesday. \"The three individuals stormed up to the well where you speak from without being recognized. Did not display decorum. They disrupted the proceedings, and we had to shut down. They pulled out a megaphone and started to lead the balcony in protests for the next 30 to 45 minutes. Their actions on the House floor rises to the level of expulsion. We cannot allow for these types of things to take place in the people's house.\"\n\nRep. Gino Bulso, R-Brentwood, sponsor of the resolution to expel Johnson, roundly criticized the three during a podcast appearance on the conservative Daily Wire on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"They voluntarily disqualified themselves from further service,\" Bulso said. \"Rather than comply with their oath to the Constitution and comply with the rules, they decided to go outside of the House and effectively shut it down. And so what we're simply doing is recognizing that they've voluntarily chosen to put themselves outside the House and formally expel them.\"\n\nPast expulsions:Tennessee legislative expulsions: From sexual misconduct to opposing rights of former slaves\n\nMeanwhile, both sides seem to be capitalizing off the controversy, either with political capital or campaign cash. Within hours of the House vote Monday, Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Hendrell Remus sent out a fundraising appeal to send the trio back.\n\n“This behavior is dangerous — they’re operating like a fascist regime,” Remus wrote in a fundraising email sent Tuesday. “This is a radical abuse of power for clear political reasons. We need to be prepared to re-elect the Tennessee Three if they are removed.”\n\nA separate GoFundMe set up to raise money for the group’s legal expenses had raised more than $20,000 as of Wednesday.\n\nPrecedent set for decorum-based removals\n\nExpulsion of a member for a rules violation is unprecedented in the chamber’s 227-year history, but could lay groundwork for future removals.\n\nBruce Oppenheimer, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, told The Tennessean that typically an ethics committee investigation occurs before an expulsion vote.\n\n“Normally, expulsion from a legislature is an extreme sanction that involves indictment and conviction of a crime or a severe ethical violation,” Oppenheimer said. “Even when an ethical violation is incurred, lesser penalties of a reprimand or censure would be assessed in most cases.”\n\nCompared with others who have been ousted from the legislature, Oppenheimer said the decorum violation “seems modest, almost to the point of being trivial.”\n\nFor example, in 2016, then-Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, faced sexual misconduct allegations and an attorney general's investigation. And in the Senate last year, Robinson was federally indicted in July 2020 and retained her seat and voting power for more than a year as her legal case played out before the Senate voted to remove her in February 2022 after her conviction.\n\n“It would be incumbent on the Speaker to cite precedent for this type of action,” Oppenheimer said.\n\nThe three fight back\n\nJohnson suggested on Monday she would consider a lawsuit if ultimately expelled, though she declined to comment further on what legal remedy she thinks she could pursue. House Democratic Caucus spokesperson Ken Jobe said Monday the three were exploring several options to respond.\n\nDavid Raybin, a Nashville attorney, said legal precedent suggests the courts would not intervene in a legislative expulsion process. The issue has been “pretty well settled” in multiple cases in other states and federally, though not in Tennessee, when courts decline to weigh in on a “political question.”\n\nTennessee three: Tennessee three: What to know about the House Democrats targeted for expulsion by Republicans\n\n“The Constitution gives the House and the Senate the exclusive authority to discipline its own members. That's what's known as a political question under the Constitution,” Raybin said. “Ultimately, it falls under the separation of powers. The constitution prevents the legislature from interfering too much with the courts. Similarly, the Constitution prevents the courts from interfering with the inner-workings of the Legislature. A court would decline to review that.”\n\nStill, if expelled, the three members could theoretically regain their lost seats without seeking a legal remedy: There's nothing in the Tennessee Constitution preventing a person from seeking reelection for a lost seat or even being appointed as interim while the district awaits a special election. They also could not be punished a second time for the March 30 floor protest, if they're expelled for that incident on Thursday.\n\n“The only reason they wouldn't be able to run again or be reelected again is if they were disqualified, such as, theoretically, being convicted of a felony,” Raybin said.\n\nMeanwhile, after a tussle on the House floor Monday evening, Jones has filed a police report accusing Rep. Justin Lafferty, R-Knoxville, of assault.\n\nJones said Lafferty shoved him and snatched his phone away during a physical confrontation as the gallery was being cleared. He has shared video depicting some sort of confrontation between the two. In the immediate aftermath, other lawmakers formed a heated scrum around the two before the situation was defused.\n\nIn a statement, Lafferty did not deny pushing Jones but said the Democrat \"shoved his phone in my face in a threatening manner.\"\n\n\"I reacted as anyone would,\" Lafferty said. \"Attempts to characterize this as anything else are misleading and false. The three members who are in danger of losing their jobs are desperate to deflect attention away from their actions.”\n\nMetro Nashville Police Department spokesperson Kris Mumford confirmed Jones filed the report Monday night, but the department declined to release the report due to the ongoing investigation. A detective has yet to be assigned but will be, Mumford said.\n\nVote illustrates GOP control over both lawmaking and representation\n\nExpelling three elected members from the legislature illustrates the iron grip of the Republican supermajority has on both legislative business and representation — even in Democratic districts.\n\nThe General Assembly is already prepping for the expulsions: Johnson on Thursday confirmed legislative staff informed her she would lose health insurance if expelled, though she was advised of a previous situation where a lawmaker retained his state insurance by resigning before he could be expelled.\n\nThe vote comes one year after the GOP-controlled body redrew Congressional districts to divide Davidson County into three, paving the way for three Republicans to represent the Democratic stronghold in Congress.\n\nIt also follows Republican efforts this year to reduce the size of Nashville’s Metro Council by half, overhaul membership of Nashville’s Airport Authority and Sports Authority boards and end special tax authority around Nashville’s convention center.\n\nNow, House leadership could override the votes of 210,000 constituents for violating House rules on speaking – despite already holding the ability to pass bills regardless of any Democratic opposition.\n\n“Expulsion will be seen by some as punishing dissent,” said Ken Paulson, director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University. “The legislature has some options when it comes to boisterous behavior in its chambers. It can view the chanting and shouts as an emotional reaction to a community tragedy and recognize the important role the right of petition plays in American society, while reprimanding errant lawmakers without eliminating their voices and viewpoints.”\n\nSexton initially stripped Johnson and Jones of their committee assignments as a sanction. But presiding over the vote also demonstrates Sexton’s power over both House procedure and membership, and energizes his conservative base.\n\nIt’s still possible that expulsion will not happen on Thursday — Rep. Antonio Parkinson, D-Memphis, asked colleagues to back down and pray about the vote before session on Thursday\n\n“Every one of us, whether you were in the scuffle or whether you were part of creating martyrs out of other members — this is not us,” Parkinson said. “We didn't look like leaders a few minutes ago. We're bigger than that. We're better than that.”\n\nMelissa Brown contributed to this report.\n\nReach Vivian Jones at vjones@tennessean.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/13/house-prepares-jeremy-durham-expulsion-vote/90127546/", "title": "Jeremy Durham expelled from Tennessee House in 70-2 vote", "text": "Joel Ebert and Dave Boucher\n\nThe Tennessean\n\nFor the first time in Tennessee history, a state representative has been expelled from the legislature for alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nIn an historic move by state lawmakers, Jeremy Durham was ousted Tuesday as a member the Tennessee House of Representatives during a special legislative session.\n\nThe vote to oust Durham came months after The Tennessean launched an investigation into Durham's behavior, including inappropriate late-night text messages to three women from the lawmaker.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats joined together to remove the 32-year-old Franklin Republican, voting 70-2 to cast Durham out after more than an hour of discussion to approve the first legislative expulsion since 1980, and only the second since the Civil War. The House needed 66 votes to remove him. Durham is accused of inappropriate conduct with at least 22 women and remains under investigation by state and federal officials.\n\nThe proceeding and Durham's attendance caught some off guard, as GOP leaders had to call a quick break for an emotional plea from House Speaker Beth Harwell for support to prevent anyone from publicly identifying the women accusing Durham of sexual misconduct.\n\nAfter lawmakers yelled at Durham and questioned him about issues ranging from sexual harassment to an FBI inquiry, the embattled lawmaker brandished a folder, threatening to reveal some information. He blasted the allegations and suggested he could reveal details about the 22 women and others in the Attorney General's investigation, but then abruptly left the chamber before his colleagues voted to oust him. The women were referred to only as Jane Does in the report because they had requested anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\n\"It's amazing what people say, as long as it's not happening to them. I can't vote for their bills anymore,\" Durham told a crowd of reporters as he left the capitol, after initially refusing to answer questions.\n\nThe Tennessean's ongoing scrutiny of Durham prompted a Tennessee attorney general investigation into his behavior and calls for his resignation.\n\nDrew Rawlins, executive director of the state Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance, said the state's investigation into Durham's finances will continue. The status of the federal investigation is unclear.\n\nThe attorney general found 22 women who said Durham had acted sexually inappropriate with them. The report includes an array of allegations, from lewd comments and inappropriate hugs to giving beer to and having sex with a 20-year-old \"college student/political worker\" in his legislative office and home.\n\nGOP, Democrats react to expelling Jeremy Durham\n\nHarwell, R-Nashville, said after the vote: \"I'm very pleased that the House made the decision it did today. This was good for the taxpayers of the state. It was good for the victims of the state.\"\n\nAfter a speech that lasted nearly 13 minutes, Durham said the attorney general report was \"anonymous hearsay\" and that it was an unethical investigation. Much of Durham's speech focused on the mechanism of the investigation, not the substance of the allegations.\n\n\"I ask that you vote for due process,\" Durham said.\n\nDurham previously has denied sexually harassing anyone, calling the investigation unconstitutional and an attempt to remove a conservative stalwart. He sent a letter to colleagues Monday outlining his critiques of the investigation and other allegations, and threatened to release a document naming the women who accused him of inappropriate conduct.\n\n\"No matter how guilty you think I am, there are aspects of this situation that should bother you,\" Durham said.\n\nDurham appeared ready to leave after his speech when Rep. William Lamberth, R-Cottontown — a former prosecutor — asked him to return to the podium to answer questions.\n\nLamberth, who was clearly bothered, had already made a motion that no one speaking about the report could identify anyone by name. He thundered away at Durham, asking him to respond to numerous allegations outlined in the report, including whether Durham had sex in his office with a 20-year-old woman.\n\n“I mean, I’m a father, I’m a husband, I’m a son. I feel violated that any one of our members would treat anyone in the fashion that the allegations in the report lay out,\" Lamberth said after the expulsion vote.\n\n\"I will also tell you that having personally known Rep. Durham for four years, I felt betrayed. If any one of those allegations is true, it is completely unacceptable behavior by an elected representative of this state.”\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Leader Mike Stewart, D-Nashville, also walked Durham through a series of questions about the attorney general's report and investigation. When Stewart asked him to point out in the report which allegations were true, Durham refused.\n\n\"I'm not going to go one by one. I really don't think these witnesses would want me to,\" Durham said. \"It would be much more fun to talk about the ones that are false. Some of the text messages that they've sent me and some of the things that I know. But I'm not going to go down that road.\"\n\nDurham later pointed to a black binder he'd brought with him that contained a letter previously written by his attorney Bill Harbison, along with other undisclosed information which he suggested could be damaging to others in the House.\n\n\"I assure you, you don't want me releasing some of the things that are in this binder,\" Durham said. That remark came less than an hour after he'd criticized the media for reporting that Durham had threatened to name accusers.\n\nDuring his questioning by Stewart, Durham did admit some wrongdoing. \"There were some things I did wrong, there’s no question about it. There’s things I should not have said.\"\n\nStewart, reflecting on his questioning of Durham, later said, \"I wanted to cross-examine him to make it clear, although he talks about fairness, he's not willing to do his part.\"\n\nDurham repeatedly argued that an ouster procedure should be treated like a criminal hearing or trial. But Rep. Jon Lundberg, R-Bristol, noted earlier in the day that court procedure has nothing to do with the House expelling a member. No complaint or formal charge is required to remove a member from the House, according to House rules and the state Constitution.\n\nRep. Rick Womick, R-Rockvale, and a handful of other lawmakers disagreed. Womick argued, as he's done repeatedly, that the investigation didn't afford Durham the necessary due process and violated constitutional principles, setting up the legislature for a lawsuit from Durham.\n\n\"Anyone can file a lawsuit anytime. I don’t think he has any standing,\" Harwell said after the vote.\n\nAt one point during the House discussion — and amid questions from his colleagues — Durham abruptly left the chamber, with reporters in pursuit as he briskly left the building ahead of the chamber's vote.\n\nHouse leadership once thought they would get as many as 80 votes to expel Durham. Fourteen Republicans and two Democrats voted present or did not vote. Reps. Courtney Rogers, R-Goodlettsville, and Terri Lynn Weaver, R-Lancaster, were the sole members to vote no on expelling Durham.\n\nHouse Republican Caucus Chairman Glen Casada, R-Franklin, said the narrow vote was because \"members thought we were a court and they viewed it in that process.\"\n\nRep. Charles Sargent, R-Franklin, said Durham's expulsion allows the voters of Williamson County to have closure.\n\nThe move to expel Durham comes nearly eight months after leading Republicans, including Gov. Bill Haslam, and Democrats called for Durham to resign in the wake of an ongoing Tennessean investigation which started in January. The Tennessean's coverage set off a firestorm of scrutiny for the once-rising star.\n\nIn the aftermath of The Tennessean investigation, Durham resigned from his House Whip leadership post, left the House Republican caucus and took a two-week hiatus from the legislature. At the time, Harwell also began exploring the process for expelling Durham while calling for Attorney General Herbert Slatery to open an independent investigation. At one point during the probe, Durham's legislative office was relocated because Slatery found the lawmaker posed a \"continuing risk to unsuspecting women.\"\n\nSlatery's six-month investigation culminated in a scathing report issued in July, which was released only after a Davidson County judge nixed an effort by Durham and his attorney Bill Harbison to stop its release. The day after the report was released, Durham denied most of the accusations but announced he would suspend his re-election campaign.\n\nThe attorney general also sent information from a former Durham employee to state election officials. The former employee said Durham told him to put money from his campaign finances into his personal business. Durham has denied the allegation, arguing the state has also cleared him on this particular issue.\n\nThe state registry of election finance did say that a payment from Durham's campaign to the former employee \"appears to have not been paid directly from Rep. Durham's campaign account,\" although a payment was listed to the employee in Durham's election finance report. The registry is still investigating a $191,000 discrepancy between Durham's campaign report and his bank account. In his letter to colleagues, Durham said the discrepancy is due to investments but didn't elaborate.\n\nA federal investigation also still appears to be underway. Peter Strianse, a Nashville criminal defense attorney recently hired by Durham, recently told The Tennessean that the U.S. attorney issued two subpoenas for records related to campaign finances and a possible tax violation. Durham also closed his title company recently.\n\nBefore Tuesday's expulsion vote, the session was halted after Casada called for a recess that lasted almost 45 minutes.\n\n\"I'm asking the speaker if I can go into recess to remind the caucus that it is paramount to protect the Jane Does — the innocent women who are brave enough to come forward,\" Casada said moments before the start of session.\n\nHer voice breaking, Harwell asked the GOP caucus to support the motion from Lamberth to protect the identities of the women in the attorney general's report who were afraid of retribution.\n\n\"Don't do this to these women. Don't you dare,\" Harwell said.\n\nLamberth also called on the press not to print the names of any victims if Durham does mention them or try to release them.\n\n\"Please, for God's sake, do not print anybody's name. It is not right,\" Lamberth said.\n\nThe Tennessean has not published the names of any women who have accused Durham of inappropriate conduct. Durham nor anyone else named the victims during the proceedings.\n\nThe caucus also debated the constitutionality of the session in general, with Rep. Andy Holt, R-Dresden, vowing not to vote on any measure to oust Durham.\n\nOthers disagreed.\n\n\"Let's go up there and flush this commode,\" said Rep. David Alexander, R-Winchester, during the caucus meeting.\n\nImmediately after the vote, Durham's name was removed from his desk on the House floor and his name was removed from the legislative website. He is no longer eligible to receive a state pension, having not served enough time in the House.\n\nThe last Tennessee lawmaker to be expelled was Robert Fisher, who was kicked out in 1980 after being convicted of soliciting a $1,000 bribe in exchange to kill a bill. Prior to that, six lawmakers were ousted during an 1866 special session after they tried to prevent Tennessee from ratifying an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to provide citizenship to slaves.\n\nReach Dave Boucher at 615-259-8892 and on Twitter @Dave_Boucher1.

Justin Jones, D-Nashville and Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, were expelled from their elected seats in partisan votes during a six-hour expulsion hearing on Thursday. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, survived expulsion by a single vote, as seven Republicans broke with their party and voted to keep her in office.\n\nThey leveraged the national spotlight, accusing the Republican supermajority of shutting their voices out of the legislative process, and highlighting misdeeds of former Republican House members who did not face censure.\n\nWhile Johnson successfully defended her actions by focusing her defense on specific accusations, Jones and Pearson claimed Republicans’ move to oust them was fueled by racial prejudice and would bring an “end to democracy.”\n\nFor hours, the two held court from the House chamber, giving rousing speeches in their defense and continuing their calls for gun control.

Several GOP members argued that representing constituents with activism is not a valid basis for violating chamber rules to which every representative is bound. They also argued that if Jones and Pearson genuinely wanted to bring the change they’re calling for, they should “file a bill.”\n\nWere two young Black men forced out of elected office and 140,000 Tennesseans disenfranchised by a racist totalitarian Republican supermajority that rules the legislature with an iron grip? Or did Republicans take justified action within House rules to deal consequences on two members who held the chamber hostage by leading a protest instead of sponsoring legislation to bring the change they called for?\n\nHere are key takeaways from the historic day at the state Capitol.\n\nDemocrats took advantage of national platform\n\nDemocrats have little legislative power in the Tennessee General Assembly. So when the spotlight turned on them, they took full advantage of the opportunity.\n\nJones and Pearson, two millennial lawmakers, knew how to work the cameras from the moment they arrived at the Capitol. Through the throng to the chamber, they walked slowly — as if to a funeral dirge. Pearson and Johnson raised their clasped hands, and Johnson held Jones’ arm. Jones wore a white suit and white shoes, the color of innocence — a nod to his earlier claim of political martyrdom.\n\n“Today is Maundy Thursday, the day of betrayal,” Johnson’s attorney, former Rep. John Mark Windle said in her defense. “Isn’t it fitting these allegations are made during Holy Week?”\n\nThe trio have characterized the expulsion proceedings as a “political lynching,” and highlighted racial dynamics they said were at play.\n\nThe vote:How Tennessee lawmakers voted in Thursday's House expulsion debate\n\nTennessee three:What you need to know about the expulsion of Democratic TN lawmakers\n\n“What we see today is just a spectacle,” Jones said during his defense. “What we see today is a lynch mob assembled to not lynch me, but our democratic process.”\n\nIn an effort to draw attention back to calls for gun reform, all three Democrats repeated the names of the six victims who were killed at The Covenant School on March 30. But repeatedly during his defense, Pearson mispronounced the name of 9-year-old Hallie Scruggs, daughter of a pastor at Covenant Presbyterian Church and one of the victims in the shooting.\n\nSeveral times during his speech, Jones dramatically paused to drink water as protestors outside the House chamber cheered in response, the sounds carrying inside.\n\nAt one point, Jones reprised the call he made one week before from the same podium: “no action, no peace.”\n\nCrowds watching on screens outside echoed back, as Jones took a dramatic pause.\n\nRepresentation or activism?\n\nCalling out Republicans for not recognizing thousands of protestors outside, the trio said Thursday they were compelled to protest with bullhorn, breaching House protocol, because they needed to represent their constituents, but Republicans refused to call on them.\n\n“I am able to speak because the people of my district sent me here,” Jones said. “Speaker Sexton is not my constituent. Speaker Sexton is not a king. Speaker Sexton is not God, though he may want to be. I don’t know how many times the speaker has gaveled me out of order for simply doing my job as a representative.”\n\nRepublicans criticized them, arguing that as elected representatives, they already had the power to propose the policy changes they were calling for during the protest. And, as elected representatives, they are obliged to follow the rules of the chamber.\n\n“You know what you could do? You could maybe compile a piece of legislation that could do that, instead of sitting back and criticizing folks who have worked really hard for the past two decades to do so,” said Rep. Andrew Farmer, R-Sevierville, who sponsored the resolution to expel Pearson. “If you want to conduct business in this house, file a bill. Be recognized, stand there and present it, and pass it.”\n\nHouse Majority Leader William Lamberth, R-Portland, argued that in interrupting and holding the House hostage during their protest, the three stifled the voices of the millions of constituents represented by other members.\n\n“You came to the well of this chamber and silenced 96 other voices,” Lamberth said. “You don’t seem like you believe that any of us care about our constituents as much as you care about yours.”\n\nGOP supermajority accused of shutting Democrats out\n\nAll three Democrats accused Republicans of shutting the Democratic minority out of the legislative process by cutting off microphones during debate, refusing to call on Democrats, and “calling the question” (a legislative action that ends debate on a bill) before Democrats have had time to weigh in.\n\n“Each of you have an obligation to stop turning the people's house into your own club,” Pearson said. “The folks that sit in committees with you, who got elected just like you, who swore the same oath that you swore – they deserve a voice in these committee rooms. And we deserve a break on this House floor.”\n\nDuring debate, other Democrats chimed in, accusing Republican leadership of killing their bills, only allowing certain members to have their bills passed, requiring Democrats to submit questions in advance for certain committee proceedings, and not calling on Democrats during committee meetings and at times on the House floor.\n\n“The erosion of democracy in the state legislature is what got us here,” Pearson said. “It wasn’t walking up to the well: it was being disruptive to a status quo that silences the minority.”\n\nHouse Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Sexton, disputed the claims during a news conference after the expulsion votes, saying that since he took up the speaker’s gavel “more voices have been heard.” He said more Democratic bills have been passed, noting that six bills sponsored by Democrats passed Thursday on the House floor.\n\n“You were here. You saw it. Those were good bills that made it through committee and made it to the floor,” Sexton said. “We’re not upholding their bills. We’re not pushing back their bills. We’re not purposely killing their bills.”\n\nAired GOP’s dirty laundry from years past, hurled personal accusations\n\nSeveral Democrats argued that expulsion – a nuclear option – was far to heavy a penalty for a minor rule infraction, especially when compared to those of some Republican colleagues who faced federal investigations and indictment, criminal charges, or committed other undignified actions, but never faced expulsion.\n\n“For years, one of your colleagues who was an admitted child molester sat in this chamber: no expulsion,” Jones said during his speech. “One member sits in this chamber who was found guilty of domestic violence: no expulsion. We had a former Speaker sit in this chamber who is now under federal investigation: no expulsion. We have a member still under federal investigation: no expulsion. We had a member pee in another member’s chair in this chamber: no expulsion.”\n\nFor instance, former House Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, is currently under federal indictment on corruption-related charges. He did not run for reelection amid the federal charges, but no action was taken to remove him from his seat. No action was taken against former Rep. David Byrd, R-Waynesboro, who faced child sexual abuse allegations from decades earlier.\n\nIn response, Rep. Sabi “Doc” Kumar, R-Springfield, accused Jones of having called him “brown face” after a recent committee hearing.\n\n“In all those 53 years in America, I have never encountered a racial slur. I’m really not sure any of that applies to me. I live a good life,” Kumar said. “Yet, you on tape called me a ‘brown face.’ Yes, sir. It’s on tape. It’s on tape. You called me that after a committee meeting on that same day. … You shoved your finger in my face and said, ‘Kumar, they will never accept you.’ You said it twice, and you were so intimidating that the sergeant at arms without my invitation came in to intervene between us.”\n\nJones later explained from the podium that he had said Kumar “put a brown face on white supremacy.” Kumar is the only non-white member of the Republican caucus.\n\nThe end of democracy?\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the three Democrats declared that their expulsion would signal the “end of democracy” in Tennessee. Spectators outside seemed to agree.\n\n“Fascists! Fascists!” some chanted.\n\n“Shame! Shame!” others said.\n\nTo both the media and those in the House chamber, Pearson and Jones characterized their expulsions as “a sad day for democracy,” an “attack on democracy,” “persecution,” and an attempt to “disenfranchise our constituents.”\n\nBut expulsion proceedings did not breach the chamber’s rules and protocol, or the state Constitution. The legislature has wide latitude to conduct its own business.\n\nAppointing authority for an interim member now goes to county legislative bodies, where Nashville’s Metro Council has already set a special meeting during which Jones will likely be reappointed. Special elections to formally re-fill Jones and Pearson’s seats would likely come this summer and fall.\n\nThursday afternoon, Jones reactivated his campaign fundraising website. By Friday morning, a “Tennessee Three” political action committee was formed to fundraise for their reelection.\n\nBoth the Tennessee Republican Party and Tennessee Democratic Party are also fundraising.\n\nGOP sought contrition\n\nThroughout their cross examinations of the three, Republicans sought their remorse and contrition for interrupting the House.\n\nRep. Gino Bulso, R-Brentwood, repeatedly tried to get Johnson to apologize, saying he didn’t “see any remorse”\n\n“What you've heard here this afternoon from the representative from Knox County is not contrition,” Bulso told colleagues. “She's not even willing to agree with me on anything that her conduct was disorderly or that she disrupted the proceedings.”\n\nAfter the vote, Sexton said that he was told that the three planned to apologize on Monday evening – as is a usual practice on the House floor when personal disputes arise.\n\n“The Democratic caucus told me that Monday night they were going to stand up individually and apologize. They never did. I do not know why,” Sexton said. “It's hard to go back and say if it would have made a difference because it never happened.”\n\nOn Thursday, none of the three were contrite.\n\n“I will apologize when the speaker and you all apologize to the families of Covenant,” Jones said. “When you apologize to the families from the Waffle House. When you apologize to the many countless victims of gun violence because of your reckless laws that proliferate weapons of war in our communities.”\n\nStill, Republicans said that if the two come return as interim appointments or get reelected, they would welcome them back, provided they follow House rules.\n\nBulso said so during the debate. So did Sexton.\n\n\"If the people of their district wish to reelect them, they can do so,\" the speaker said after the vote. \"That's the process.\"\n\nAnd on Thursday night, the House GOP caucus, while accusing the Democrats of violating state law, said much the same.\n\n\"If elected to come back and serve their constituents in the Tennessee House of Representatives, we hope they will act as the thousands who have come before them - with respect for our institution, their fellow colleagues, and the seat that they hold. We look forward to continuing to defend the voices of ALL Tennesseans,\" the Republicans said in a statement.\n\nTo what extent did race come into play?\n\nRepublicans expelled two young Black lawmakers, but fell one vote short of expelling a white woman. Since the vote, Jones, Pearson and others have framed their expulsions as an act of racism by the overwhelmingly white Republican supermajority.\n\n“The state in which the Ku Klux Klan was founded is now attempting another power grab by silencing the two youngest Black representatives and one of the only Democratic women in this body,” Jones said. “That is what this is about.”\n\nRepublican leaders dispute that race had anything to do with how members voted. Lamberth told reporters Thursday that representatives who voted not to expel Johnson did so based on evidence presented during the hearing.\n\nRelated:Republicans' expulsion of 2 Black members draws comparisons to Tennessee's 'dark history'\n\n“Our members literally didn't look at the ethnicity of the members that were up for expulsion,” Lamberth said. “The strength of the evidence against two of the representatives was stronger than the other. Representative Johnson said very clearly from the well, that she didn't chant, that she didn't have a sign, and that she didn't have a bullhorn. Our members took into account the evidence that was presented and that's what they made the decision on.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Karen Camper, D-Memphis, told reporters Thursday that the members likely felt “some racial undertones” to the vote “because of their experience in the halls of this General Assembly.”\n\nSen. Charlane Oliver, D-Nashville, came in with Jones in the 2023 freshman class and said she's watched “a lot of political bullying going on behind the scenes” directed at Jones.\n\n“This idea that he and Rep. Justin Pearson must apologize is a mindset set in white supremacy. A mindset that we, as Black folks are not on par or peers to them, and we must be inferior and subservient to their demands,” Oliver said. “I can't tell you how many times Rep. Jones has come into my office after something has happened on the elevator, or a conversation with leadership where they called him a worthless human being. That's not leadership.”\n\nRep. Jesse Chism, D-Memphis, said Thursday's expulsion hearings looked like a “Jim Crow-era trial.”\n\n“We saw two Black men fighting for their careers, fighting for their reputations, fighting for their political lives,” Chism said.\n\nMembers of the Black Caucus, who flanked Jones as he defended himself on Thursday night, followed the former representative out of the House chamber after the vote. Many were fighting back tears, Chism said, which finally spilled when they returned to their desks without Jones.\n\n“It was a shame to see some of the smirks, some of the smiles, that some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle had when they saw our tears,” Chism said. “Yesterday was a shame. The world saw it. Anybody on that side of the aisle that voted to remove our members should be ashamed of themselves.”\n\nMelissa Brown contributed to this report.\n\nReach Vivian Jones at vjones@tennessean.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2023/04/07/tennessee-republicans-finally-address-guns-by-expelling-black-democrats/11618540002/", "title": "Tennessee Republicans expel two Black Democratic lawmakers ...", "text": "The Republican-led Tennessee legislature responded to a recent Nashville school shooting by spending all day Thursday kicking two Black Democratic lawmakers out of office, a decision that thrilled guns in the state and across the country.\n\nSpeaking from an unlocked closet outside a child’s room in a suburban Nashville home, the spokesgun for the Tennessee chapter of Guns United Against Gun Control applauded the GOP-controlled House of Representatives for its decisive action to draw attention away from gun violence.\n\n“This is a great day for us,” the Daniel Defense DDM4V7 AR-15-style firearm said. “We had hoped our Republican friends in the legislature would do the bare minimum in response to the Covenant School shooting. But never in our wildest dreams did we think they’d find a way to do less than nothing. Heck, they shifted the whole conversation from guns to racism!”\n\nTennessee continues doing nothing about gun violence – expels Justin Jones, Justin Pearson instead\n\nLess than two weeks after a shooter fired 152 rounds and killed three children and three adults at a Nashville elementary school, the GOP lawmakers aimed their ire on three Democrats who last week held a brief gun-control protest on the chamber floor, violating House rules.\n\nReps. Justin Jones, of Black and Filipino descent, and Justin Pearson, who's Black, were expelled from the General Assembly by the Republican majority. Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is white, survived the vote and when asked why said: “It might have to do with the color of our skin.”\n\nMoments after she said that, thousands of people watching the proceedings in Tennessee and around the world said, in unison: “Yep.”\n\nRepublicans basically booted two of the 'Tennessee Three' because they talked too loud\n\nA Ruger LCP MAX pistol on the hip of a vocal National Rifle Association member standing outside the Tennessee statehouse Thursday said it felt relief and optimism in the wake of the expulsions: “Seeing a large group of fragile white lawmakers whose lives are defined almost entirely by fear that the days of white, male dominance in American society are nearing an end vote to expel two Black lawmakers because they talked too loud? Wow. I mean, there’s just no doubt this helps us.”\n\nRather than work toward solutions to the epidemic of gun violence that recently destroyed lives and forever traumatized children at a Christian elementary school in Nashville, the conservative lawmakers focused on the more important crime committed by the three Democrats: Not following the rules of decorum.\n\nOn March 30, hundreds of predominately young protesters were in the Capitol to press lawmakers to pass gun-control legislation in the hope they might be able to keep living. Three House Democrats joined in the protest from the front of the chamber, with Jones using a small bullhorn to chant: “No action, no peace!”\n\nNo children or adults were killed during the lawmakers’ brief protest.\n\n'They tried to shred our constitution with a bullhorn' – LOL!\n\n“Well, you know, something really bad could’ve happened,” said a loaded GLOCK 19 that listened to the day’s proceedings from under the driver’s seat of a Chevy Tahoe in neighboring Kentucky. “What if Jones turned quickly and a non-Democrat was hit in the head with the bullhorn? That could cause a pretty serious bruise.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Gino Bulso said during the governing body’s successful daylong attempt to do literally anything except control guns: “They tried to shred our Constitution with a bullhorn.”\n\nTo which the Guns United Against Gun Control spokesgun said: “Lulz!”\n\nThe Ruger responded: “See, these men are very, very fragile. They need to be treated with great care. That small bullhorn frightened them, so rather than worrying about who can and can’t buy firearms like me, we should be worrying about the fact that it’s very upsetting for these white people to see Black people in positions of power, particularly if the Black people are saying things the broader public agrees with.”\n\nA bad day for democracy in Tennessee was a great day for guns\n\nDuring Thursday's session, which again accomplished nothing that could stop the next horrific act of gun violence, Jones defended himself, telling fellow lawmakers: “Your extreme measure is an attempt to subvert the will of voters who democratically elected us as representatives to speak and to passionately fight for them.”\n\nA Remington shotgun from the nearby city of Gallatin chuckled.\n\n“Damn right!” it said. “The Republicans sent a clear message today. You talk about doing anything whatsoever to limit free and easy access to me or any of my fellow guns and rifles, you get the boot. Heh-heh. I love it.”\n\nPrior to the first expulsion vote, Democratic Rep. Antonio Parkinson said: “We’re creating a circus. This is embarrassing. The world is watching us.”\n\nThe Ruger disagreed.\n\n“I admire these Republicans’ resolve,” it said. “They’re focused on the matters that mean most to guns like me: Not regulating guns like me.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Twitter @RexHuppke and Facebook facebook.com/RexIsAJerk\n\nMore from Rex Huppke:\n\nElon Musk is taking away my blue check mark on Twitter.

Justin Jones, D-Nashville, who returned to the House Monday backed by Nashville’s Metro Council. Both had been removed for leading gun-reform protests on the chamber floor following last month’s mass shooting at a Nashville elementary school.\n\nCommissioner Erika Sugarmon praised Pearson after the vote.\n\n\"My heart is singing,\" the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported Sugarmon as saying. \"You belong on the national level. … We need you here right now in this moment to continue the fight in Nashville. It’s not going to end today or tomorrow. It’s a journey.”\n\nPearson told those assembled after the vote that \"we do not speak alone.\"\n\n\"We speak together,\" he said. \"We fight together. So, a message for all the people in Nashville who decided to expel us: You can’t expel hope. You cant expel our voice. You sure can’t expel our fight.\"\n\nPosts on social media showed hundreds of marchers accompanying Pearson, his fist pumping in the air, as he headed from Memphis' National Civil Rights Museum through downtown toward Wednesday's special session at the county administration building.\n\nWhy were the lawmakers expelled?\n\nHundreds had assembled in the House galleries on March 30 to demand gun reform after six people, including three students, were fatally shot at The Covenant School in Nashville, the Volunteer State’s deadliest school shooting.\n\nBoth Pearson and Jones, who are Black, had employed bullhorns during the protest and were expelled for violating House decorum. Along with Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, the so-called “Tennessee Three” had come under fire for approaching the podium in session without being recognized.\n\nOn April 6, the House Republican supermajority removed Jones by a 72-25 vote and Pearson by a 69-26 vote after hours of rancorous debate. Johnson, who is white, avoided expulsion by one vote.\n\nMonday, Nashville’s progressive-leaning council, responsible for filling Jones’ vacancy, voted to reappoint him to his seat on an interim basis pending a special election. Hundreds of cheering supporters likewise flanked Jones as he returned to the Capitol shortly afterward to be sworn in.\n\nSenators call for DOJ investigation\n\nThe expulsions had sparked broad national fallout, prompting a reaction from President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the NAACP, which framed the incident as “horrific (but) not surprising…. Especially, in the South.”\n\nIn his defense prior to his expulsion, Jones called the process “a farce of democracy.”\n\nWednesday, Sen. Raphael Warnock and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter Wednesday to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging the Department of Justice to investigate the expulsion of two Black lawmakers from the Tennessee General Assembly.\n\nThe letter, also signed by Sens. Chris Murphy, Alex Padilla, and Brian Schatz, asked Garland “to use all available legal authorities” to determine whether the expulsion of state Reps. Justin Pearson and Justin Jones violated federal civil rights law or the Constitutional rights of the lawmakers or their constituents.\n\nThe letter notes that the state legislature has reportedly never expelled a member for procedural violation before and that Pearson and Jones, who are Black, were expelled while Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is white and also part of the protest, was not.\n\n“We cannot allow states to cite minor procedural violations as pretextual excuses to remove democratically-elected representatives, especially when these expulsions may have been at least partially on the basis of race,” the letter said. “Allowing such behavior sets a dangerous – and undemocratic – precedent.”\n\nRepublican House Speaker Cameron Sexton on social media had called the legislators’ part in the protests “unacceptable” and described it as “an effort, unfortunately, to make themselves the victims.”\n\nAccording to the Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, Sexton called on Jones to speak within minutes of his reclaiming his seat and was ultimately pushed to gavel supporters into order twice during Jones’ remarks.\n\n“Today, 78,000 people have a voice in this chamber once again,” Jones said. \"No expulsion, no attempt to silence us, will stop us.”\n\nContributing: N'dea Yancey-Bragg, USA TODAY; Katherine Burgess, Memphis Commercial Appeal\n\nDig deeper:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/07/tennessee-house-expulsion-gloria-johnson-justin-jones-justin-pearson/70080338007/", "title": "Tennessee expulsion: Meet Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones, Justin ...", "text": "In the wake of protests calling for gun reform at the state Capitol, Tennessee Republicans are seeking to expel three Democratic members of the House for \"disorderly behavior\" after they led protest chants from the floor of the chamber.\n\nThe protests came in the wake of the deadly Covenant School shooting that killed six people, including three children.\n\nOn Thursday, the three House Democrats approached the podium between bills without being recognized to speak, a breach of chamber rules.

Justin Jones, D-Nashville, on a 72-25 vote and Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, on a 69-26 vote.\n\nA third lawmaker, Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, survived after the House failed by one vote to achieve the 66 votes needed to oust her from office. The vote was 65-30.\n\nSo who are the three Democrats? Here's what to know about them.\n\nGloria Johnson, D-Knoxville\n\nJohnson, currently represents District 90 in Knoxville. She was first elected to the legislature in 2012 for District 13.\n\nAfter losing her reelection bid in 2014 and again in 2016 by fewer than 200 votes each time to Republican Eddie Smith, she won the seat back in the 2018 election by more than 2,400 votes.\n\nAmid the latest redistricting, Republican lawmakers redrew District 13 to shift Johnson's address into District 15, represented by fellow Knoxville Democrat Sam McKenzie. Johnson moved, and won reelection in the newly created District 90 in 2022.\n\nJohnson has long been one of the most outspoken House Democrats, both during legislative debates and on social media. She has regularly drawn the ire of Republicans.\n\nTennessee Rep. Gloria Johnson:'We are on the right side of history'\n\nDuring the 2021 session, Johnson moved her desk into a hallway in the Cordell Hull legislative office building after she was assigned a small, windowless conference room as her office, while her assistant was assigned to a closet down the hall.\n\nJohnson told Knox News she believed the office assignment was a \"petty\" move by House Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, to punish her for being the only member not to vote to reelect him as speaker.\n\nSexton replied that members often were displeased with new office assignments, and noted that Johnson's newly assigned office was twice the size of her first one in 2012.\n\nJohnson, 60, is a retired teacher. She was born in Colorado, moved to Knoxville as a child, graduated from Farragut High School and earned a bachelor of arts degree in education from the University of Tennessee Knoxville.\n\nShe has been named to the National Foundation of Women Legislators Women of Excellence. Before being elected to the Tennessee House, Johnson served as Knox County Democratic Party chairwoman. In 2012, she told Knox News she hadn't been involved in politics before being inspired by President Barack Obama to become politically active.\n\nJustin Jones, D-Nashville\n\nJones, 27, is one of the youngest members of the Tennessee House of Representatives, elected to represent House District 52 in November 2022.\n\nWhile a new member, Jones is no stranger to Capitol Hill. Jones has been a vocal advocate for free speech, voting access, Medicaid expansion and representation of working class and minority residents, and a critic of the Republican supermajority.\n\nIn 2019, Jones led sit-ins and protests calling for the removal of a bust of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from the second floor of the Capitol.\n\nDuring one protest, Jones was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and simple assault after throwing a cup of coffee at then-Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, and continued to advocate for the bust’s removal. Gov. Bill Lee later announced support for the busts’ removal and after a lengthy approval process by multiple state commissions, the Forrest bust was removed in 2021.\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd in 2020, Jones help lead the People’s Plaza protests during which demonstrators camped on War Memorial Plaza for 62 nights calling to defund the police and seeking an audience with the governor to discuss racial injustice.\n\nJones repeatedly led protestors in acts of civil disobedience, defying police security boundaries outside the Capitol (which was closed due to COVID-19 at the time), and at one point blocking the entrance to the Capitol parking garage to prevent lawmakers from leaving the building. He was arrested multiple times.\n\nTennessee legislative expulsions:From sexual misconduct to opposing rights of former slaves\n\nIn response to the People’s Plaza demonstration, state lawmakers enhanced penalties for violating state law that prohibits overnight camping on state property, making it a felony punishable by up to six years in prison.\n\nJones sponsored bills this year to allow student IDs for voter identification, to impose a 4% tax on Tennesseans’ non-retirement financial securities purchases, revoke the state’s ability to contract with private prisons, require police to only use marked vehicles for non-emergency traffic stops, and to eliminate qualified immunity protections for law enforcement.\n\nHe is a policy and activism fellow at the John Lewis Center for Social Justice at Fisk University, and is completing a master’s degree in theological studies at Vanderbilt.\n\nJustin Pearson, D-Memphis\n\nPearson, 28, first became widely known in Memphis when he co-founded the grassroots organization Memphis Community Against the Pipeline in response to a planned crude oil pipeline that would cut through backyards in South Memphis, particularly in the Boxtown neighborhood.\n\nThe work of MCAP, now called Memphis Community Against Pollution, has been credited with stopping the pipeline plans from Plains All American.\n\nIn January, he was elected by a significant margin to take the House District 86 seat in an election triggered by the death of educator and state Rep. Barbara Cooper, who died in October.\n\nUpon his election, Pearson became one of the youngest lawmakers in Tennessee.\n\nRelated:Tennessee House speaker strips Democrats of committee roles after Capitol protest\n\nA native Memphian, Pearson is the fourth son of five boys. Their father is a preacher and mother a teacher. In Memphis, Pearson attended Mitchell High School, where he advocated for textbook access for students. He is also a graduate of Bowdoin College in Maine, where he majored in government and legal and education studies.\n\nKnown since college for almost always wearing a suit, Pearson wore a traditional West African dashiki on the House floor on his first day in office.

Alan Winters, co-director of the Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy at the University of Sussex.\n\nThe sense of gloom hanging over the UK economy is captured by striking workers, who are walking out in ever larger numbers over pay and conditions as the worst inflation in decades eats into their wages. At the same time, the government is cutting spending and hiking taxes to fill the hole in its budget.\n\nWhile Brexit isn’t the cause of Britain’s cost-of-living crisis, it has made the problem more difficult to solve.\n\n“The UK chose Brexit in a referendum, but the government then chose a particularly hard form of Brexit, which maximized the economic cost,” said Michael Saunders, a senior adviser at Oxford Economics and former Bank of England official. “Any hope for economic upside from Brexit is pretty much gone.”\n\nNHS nurses strike over pay outside St Thomas' Hospital in London on December 20, 2022. Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters\n\nBusinesses count the cost\n\nAlthough Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, its exit from the single market and customs union was finalized only on December 24, 2020, when the two sides finally agreed a free trade deal.\n\nThe Brexit deal, known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, came into effect on January 1, 2021.\n\nIt eliminated tariffs on most goods but introduced a raft of non-tariff barriers, such as border controls, customs checks, import duties and health inspections on plant and animal products.\n\nBefore Brexit, a farmer in Kent could ship a truckload of potatoes to Paris just as easily as they might send it to London. Those days are no more.\n\n“We hear stories every single day from small businesses about the nightmare of forms, transportation, couriers, things getting stuck for weeks at a time… the epic length of the problems is just gobsmacking,” said Michelle Ovens, the founder of Small Business Britain, a campaign group.\n\n“The way things have panned out in the last two years has been really bad for small businesses,” Ovens told CNN.\n\nResearchers at the London School of Economics estimate that the variety of UK products exported to the European Union declined by 30% during the first year of Brexit. They said that this was likely because small exporters had exited small EU markets.\n\nTake the example of Little Star, a UK company that makes jewelry for children. Its business took off in the Netherlands and it had plans to expand to France and Germany next. But since Brexit, only two of more than 30 of its Dutch customers are prepared to handle the costs and paperwork to obtain stock from the company.\n\nProducts that took two days to ship are now taking three weeks, while import duties and sales taxes have made it much harder to compete with European jewelers, according to Rob Walker, who co-founded the business with his wife, Vicky, in 2017. The company is now looking to the United States for growth opportunities.\n\n“Isn’t it mad that we have to look to the other side of the Atlantic to do business, because it’s so difficult to do business with people 30 miles away?” Walker said.\n\nA truck passes a Union Jack, at the Port of Dover on April 1, 2021. The UK government has delayed post-Brexit checks on EU food imports until the end of 2023. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA British Chambers of Commerce survey of more than 1,168 businesses published this month reported that 77% said Brexit has not helped them increase sales or grow their businesses. More than half said they were finding it difficult to adapt to the new rules for trading goods.\n\nSiteright Construction Supplies, a manufacturer in Dorset, told the Chamber that importing parts from the European Union to fix broken machines has become a costly and “time-consuming nightmare.”\n\n“Brexit has been the biggest-ever imposition of bureaucracy on business,” according to Siteright.\n\nNova Dog Chews, a producer of snacks for canines, said it would have lost all its EU trade had it not set up a base in the bloc. “This has cost our business a huge amount of money, which could have been invested in the UK had it not been for Brexit,” it added.\n\nA UK government spokesperson told CNN that the government’s export support service has provided exporters with “practical support” on the implementation of the Brexit deal. The deal is “the world’s largest zero tariff, zero quota free trade deal,” the spokesperson added. “It secures the UK market access across key service sectors and opens new opportunities for UK businesses across the globe.”\n\nPermanent damage to trade\n\nBritain won’t easily replace what it has lost by forfeiting unfettered access to the world’s largest trading bloc.\n\nThe only substantive new trade deals it has struck since exiting the European Union, which did not simply roll over the deals it had as an EU member, have been with Australia and New Zealand. By the government’s own estimate, these will have a negligible impact on the UK economy, increasing GDP in the long run by just 0.1% and 0.03% respectively.\n\nBy contrast, the UK Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces economic forecasts for the government, expects Brexit to reduce Britain’s output by 4% over 15 years compared to remaining in the bloc. Exports and imports are projected to be around 15% lower in the long run.\n\nInitial data has borne this out. According to the OBR, in the fourth quarter of 2021, UK goods export volumes to the European Union were 9% below 2019 levels, with imports from the European Union 18% lower. Goods exports to non-EU countries were 18% weaker than in 2019.\n\nThe United Kingdom “appears to have become a less trade-intensive economy, with trade as a share of GDP falling 12% since 2019, two and a half times more than in any other G7 country,” the OBR said in the March report.\n\nThe decline in exports to non-EU countries could be a sign that UK businesses have become less competitive as they battle higher supply chain costs following Brexit, according to Jun Du, an economics professor at Aston University in Birmingham.\n\n“The UK’s trading ability has been damaged permanently [by Brexit],” Du told CNN. “It doesn’t mean it can’t recover, but it’s been set back for a number of years.”\n\nResearch by the Centre for European Reform, a think tank, estimates that over the 18 months to June 2022, UK goods trade is 7% lower than it would have been had Britain remained in the European Union.\n\nInvestment is 11% weaker and GDP is 5.5% smaller than it would have been, costing the economy £40 billion ($48.4 billion) in tax revenues annually. That’s enough to pay for three quarters of the spending cuts and tax rises that UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced in November.\n\nA heavy economic toll\n\nThe United Kingdom is projected to have one of the worst performing economies next year among developed nations.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4%, ahead only of sanctioned Russia. GDP in Germany is forecast to be 0.3% smaller.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of just 0.3% for UK GDP next year, ahead of only Germany, Italy and Russia, which are expected to contract.\n\nBoth institutions say high inflation and rising interest rates will weigh on spending by consumers and businesses in Britain.\n\nAccording to the Confederation of British Industry, a leading business group, the fall in private sector activity picked up pace in December and has now declined for five consecutive quarters.\n\nThe downward trend “looks set to deepen” in 2023, principal economist at the CBI Martin Sartorius said in a statement.\n\n“Businesses continue to face a number of headwinds, with rising costs, labor shortages, and weakening demand contributing to a gloomy outlook for next year. ”\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/960281/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-3-april-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 3 April 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Dover ports controversy\n\nOpposition MPs have accused Suella Braverman of being in “denial” and “on another planet” after she insisted Brexit was not to blame for the chaos at Dover.

Progressive human rights ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, blacks, and the LGBT community demanded, and often won, equal rights. Technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of.\n\nThe world certainly has progressed, but wars have raged on, and climate change has picked up speed, endangering the ecosystems of our planet.\n\nTo put this in perspective, 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the most important event in each of the past 100 years. We drew on research material and news reports to determine what event had the biggest impact in a particular year.\n\n1919: National booze ban\n\n• Date: Oct. 28\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nCongress passes the 18th Amendment that bans the production, transport or sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The legislation opens the way for Prohibition, which lasts from 1920 to 1933. The public flouts the law, which succeeds in enriching gangsters and contributing to the rise of organized crime.\n\n1920: Women's suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population (starting with white landowning males over the age of 21) could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution is passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots.\n\nSports gambling:Why sports betting hasn't gone nationwide yet after Supreme Court ruling\n\n1921: Chinese Communists rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded, and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo that would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes monkey trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to Biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,460 in 2017 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court rules that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. starts numbered highway system\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Lindbergh would become one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany's aircraft industry. Also, his son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler consolidates power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 100-meter relay.\n\nFrom Alaska to Florida:States with the biggest and smallest governments\n\n1937: UAW changes car industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald's Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald's into what it is today – the world's largest restaurant chain.\n\n1941: Attack on Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed. The United States declares war on Japan the next day and three days later against Germany and Italy.\n\n1942: GIs arrive in Europe\n\n• Date: Jan. 26\n\n• Location: Northern Ireland\n\nThe first U.S. troops destined to fight in Europe in the world's greatest war arrive in Northern Ireland. It is the beginning of a military buildup that would culminate in the invasion of France more than two years later. Before then, the United States was providing only material support to its ally across the Atlantic, while building up what President Roosevelt called the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" in anticipation for the inevitable entry of the United States into the war in Europe.\n\n1943: Invention of LSD\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Basel, Switzerland\n\nSwiss chemist Albert Hoffman had been studying the potential medicinal value of lysergic compounds when he accidentally exposed himself to LSD-25, which he had created years earlier in his lab. This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier. The plan is conceived during the Quebec Conference by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. The invasion starts at 6:30 a.m. on five beaches, and over the next 24 hours about 4,900 Allied soldiers are killed, many of them the instant the doors of their Higgins transport boats opened directly into German machine gun fire.\n\n1945: World War II ends\n\n• Date: Sept. 2\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe surrender of Japan marks the end of World War II amid one of the most tumultuous years of the 20th century. Earlier in the year, leaders of three nations – Benito Mussolini, Franklin Roosevelt and Adolf Hitler – die and Nazi Germany surrenders. Though the surrender of Japan was inevitable, the prospect of a horrific Allied assault on the Japanese mainland convinces the United States to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic bomb attacks, along with the entry of the Soviet Union in the war against Japan, compel the Japanese to surrender.\n\n1946: Baby boom starts\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nMore American babies are born – 3.4 million – in 1946 than in any year in U.S. history up to then. The number of births grows to 4 million per year from 1954 to 1964, the last year of the baby boomer generation, the biggest generation at that point in history.\n\nIt's raining rats:Live rat falls from Buffalo Wild Wings ceiling as customer watches\n\n1947: India gains independence\n\n• Date: Aug. 15\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C\n\nThe sun sets on the British Empire in India in 1947, as the Asian nation becomes the world's largest democracy. Independence is the culmination of decades of work by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indian nationalists committed to throwing off the yoke of British colonialism. The transition to independence comes at a price. The subcontinent is partitioned into two nations, Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Violence erupts between Hindus and Muslims as Hindus migrate to India and Muslims shift to Pakistan. It is estimated that 1 million people die during the migration.\n\n1948: Birth of Israel\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: Middle East\n\nAfter Israel declares its independence following a UN resolution, neighboring Arab states with troops from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), Lebanon and Saudi Arabia attack the former British-controlled Palestinian mandate. The Arab-Israeli War ended with an armistice that leaves Israel with some territories as Egypt and Jordan retains control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, respectively.\n\n1949: NATO founded\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nTwo years into the Cold War, the Soviet Union detonates its first nuclear bomb and quickly exerts its influence over Eastern Europe. It attempts to do the same in Western Europe, which is still recovering from the massive destruction of World War II. To respond to the Soviet threat, U.S. and Western European allies form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Fundamentally, NATO simply states that an attack on any NATO member would be considered an attack on all NATO members. Cold War tensions ratchet up later that year when the communists take over China, the world's most populous nation.\n\n1950: Korean War starts\n\n• Date: June 25\n\n• Location: Korea\n\nThe North Korean People's Army crosses the 38th parallel into South Korea, eliciting almost an immediate response from President Harry Truman, and starting the Korean War – a proxy battle between the United States and the People's Republic of China. Three years later, a ceasefire would halt the war. The uneasy relations between North Korea and South Korea last to this day.\n\n1951: Rosenbergs sentenced\n\n• Date: March 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nHusband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are convicted of espionage for their part in passing along atomic secrets to the Soviet Union during and after World War II. They are executed two years later. Not everyone is convinced of their involvement in the scheme. Supporters claim they are scapegoats swept up in the Cold War hysteria of the time. Documents revealed decades later would show the detailed extent of Julius Rosenberg's involvement in the spy ring, though Ethel's participation in the scheme remains inconclusive.\n\n1952: First hydrogen bomb test\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Marshall Islands\n\nThe United States successfully detonates its first hydrogen bomb, a second generation thermonuclear device, in the Marshall Islands as part of Operation Ivy, one of a series of nuclear bomb tests. From 1946 to 1958, the United States used the remote Pacific Marshall Islands as its nuclear weapons testing site, detonating a total of 67 nuclear tests.\n\n1953: The dawn of DNA\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: Cambridge, England, U.K.\n\nCambridge University scientists James Watson and Francis Crick announce they have discovered the fundamental behavior and double-helix structure of DNA. Though scientists had been aware of DNA since the 1860s and its role in genetic inheritance since 1943, Watson and Crick were the first to explain how DNA works to replicate itself and pass on genes from one generation to the next.\n\n1954: Brown vs. Board of Education\n\n• Date: May 17\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nIn a landmark case involving Linda Brown of Topeka, Kansas, who had to cross a railroad track to reach an all-black elementary school even though an all-white school was closer, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the segregated school system was unconstitutional on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. The clause would be used again by the courts to reverse state-level racial segregation practices and ordinances.\n\n1955: Parks starts a movement\n\n• Date: Dec. 1\n\n• Location: Montgomery, Alabama\n\nRosa Parks makes history by refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus. The arrest of Parks for insisting to remain seated leads to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascent of a young pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., as a local activist leader to advance the civil rights cause. A successful federal lawsuit by the NAACP against the city leads to the desegregation of the Montgomery bus system on Dec. 21 of the following year.\n\n1956: Hungary suppressed\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Budapest\n\nNine years after the start of the Cold War, Hungarians took to the streets, demanding democratic reforms. Three days later, Soviet Red Army troops invade Hungary, killing thousands. Nine days after the incursion, Budapest is occupied by the Soviet troops in one of the largest and most aggressive actions taken by the Soviet Union since the end of World War II.\n\n1957: The Little Rock Nine\n\n• Date: Sept 24\n\n• Location: Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower orders federal troops to protect nine African American high school students as they start classes at the all-white Little Rock Central High School. This would become one of the first high-profile actions by the federal government against state-level racial segregation.\n\n1958: U.S. launches first satellite\n\n• Date: Jan. 31\n\n• Location: Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\nThe United States successfully launches Explorer 1, three months after the Soviet Union sent its first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit. The two superpowers would go on to send more satellites into space, creating a Cold War space race to build ever more sophisticated orbital communications devices.\n\n1959: Castro takes over Cuba\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Havana\n\nU.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista flees Havana as Fidel Castro's forces advance on the Cuban capital.

Hurricane Maria inflicts immense damage to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was already struggling from economic insolvency.\n\nDetailed findings & methodology\n\nThere is little doubt that in the last 100 years, mankind has progressed dramatically. People live longer, eat better, have greater access to improved medical care and are freer to express their opinions and associate with whomever they want.\n\nThat optimism can be seen in population growth. Despite the two most devastating wars in human history, the world population has nearly tripled, from 1.9 billion to 7.5 billion, since 1917.\n\nOne hundred years is an eye blink in history, yet 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote in the United States. African-Americans were prevented from voting in the American South. Labor unions were in their infancy and were weak, and laws reforming child labor had yet to be passed by Congress. All that changed because of women’s suffrage, the inexorable march of civil rights and the strengthening labor unions.\n\nOne hundred years ago, a person anywhere in the world was more likely than not to be illiterate. And there was a good chance he or she was the subject of colonial rulers in South America, Africa and Asia. Two world wars would spell the end of imperial houses in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia, and weaken the grip of another, Great Britain. Independence movements sprouted in Europe, Africa and Asia, yearning for freedom and expressing national pride.\n\nNationalism had its dark side, though, with fascist governments ruling Italy and Germany. It would take a world war to remove their scourge. Another form of totalitarianism, communism, would dominate the USSR and Eastern Europe for several generations, as well as China and other countries in Asia, before the West would triumph over the Soviet Union and its allies in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of the Cold War, that conflict launched the space race and accelerated technological progress, hastening the use of personal computers and cell phones. These inventions have fundamentally changed our lives – from the way we communicate to the way we shop and socialize – and made billions of dollars for the companies that make them and their founders. These products and innovations are a major part of the culture today.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list.

Follow here for the latest updates on the attack in Kyiv on Saturday, Feb. 26.\n\n***\n\nRussian forces closed in on Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, but dawn brought limited clarity about how far the invading troops had penetrated into the Ukrainian capital, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had vowed defiance through the night.\n\n\"We must survive this night,” Zelenskyy – who told Ukrainians earlier that Russia has marked him as “target No. 1” – said in a video message before morning arrived in Kyiv.\n\nAs Saturday began, Zelenskyy tweeted that he had started “a new day on the diplomatic frontline” with a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, with “weapons and equipment from our partners” on the way.\n\nBut the danger remained far from over to the former Soviet republic. Photos from Ukraine detailed destruction by Russian troops and bombs, with Ukrainian citizens huddled in underground bomb shelters or trying to flee their country to safety, carrying family members and what possessions they could. Authorities in Kyiv described fighting in the streets and urged residents to seek shelter.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden was slated to meet with his national security team on Saturday morning; the U.S. and other nations have imposed sanctions on Russia and on its president, Vladimir Putin, in the hopes that the economic price will force Russia from its current path.\n\nZelenskyy government:What happens if Kyiv falls? What would a government in exile look like?\n\nDawn breaks in Kyiv\n\nAs dawn broke in Kyiv, it was not immediately clear how far the soldiers had advanced. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were probing Ukrainian defenses to clear a path for the main forces.\n\nBut the swift movement of the troops after less than three days of fighting further imperiled a country clinging to independence in the face of a broad Russian assault, which threatened to topple the democratic government and scramble the post-Cold War world order.\n\nThe street clashes followed fighting that pummeled bridges, schools and apartment buildings, and resulted in hundreds of casualties.\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nDelta ends Russian partnership\n\nDelta has withdrawn its codeshare services operated in conjunction with Russian national airline, Aeroflot, effective immediately. Codeshare allows one airline to sell seats on flights operated by other airlines\n\n\"We have removed our code from Aeroflot-operated services beyond Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport and removed Aeroflot’s code from Delta-operated services from Los Angeles and New York-JFK,\" Delta said in a statement.\n\nDelta does not operate services to Ukraine or Russia.\n\n-- Craig Harris\n\nUS Dept of State warns Americans in Russia to stay away from protests\n\nThe U.S. Department of State early on Saturday warned Americans in Russia to “avoid demonstrations and any demonstration-related activities” because of the possibility of widespread arrests.\n\n“According to social media sources, there have been calls for demonstrations throughout Russia, including in major cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, in opposition to the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces against Ukraine,” the State Department noted in an online alert.\n\n“The U.S. Embassy reminds U.S. citizens that the Department of State’s Travel Advisory level for Russia is at “Level 4: Do Not Travel” for reasons including harassment against U.S. citizens, harassment by Russian government security officials, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law,” the statement added.\n\n-- Luciana Lopez\n\nZelenskyy and Macron speak\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted early Saturday morning that he and French President Emmanuel Macron had spoken by phone.\n\n\"A new day on the diplomatic frontline began with a conversation with @EmmanuelMacron. Weapons and equipment from our partners are on the way to Ukraine. The anti-war coalition is working!\" Zelenskyy tweeted.\n\n-- Luciana Lopez\n\nBlinken, South Korea foreign minister speak\n\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday to discuss the two allies’ cooperation over the Russia-Ukraine crisis, including Seoul’s participation in a U.S.-led economic pressure campaign against Moscow.\n\nSeoul’s Foreign Ministry said Chung and Blinken reaffirmed the allies’ “strong condemnation” of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and they urged Russia to immediately cease its takeover attempt.\n\nBlinken thanked South Korea for its support of Ukraine and its willingness to participate in international sanctions against Russia, the ministry said.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nBetter trained, better equipped:What you should know about Russia and Ukraine's militaries\n\n'I need ammunition, not a ride'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was asked to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer.\n\nZelenskyy said in response: “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, who described Zelenskyy as upbeat.\n\nInvading Russian forces closed in on Ukraine’s capital on Saturday, in an apparent encircling movement after a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's actor president, prepares for his greatest role yet\n\nSecond Russian transport plane shot down\n\nA second Russian Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles (85 kilometers) south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine’s military said it had shot down a Russian military transport plane with paratroopers on board.\n\nAccording to a statement from the military’s General Staff, the first Il-76 heavy transport plane was shot down near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles south of Kyiv. The Russian military has not commented on either incident so far, and the reports could not be immediately verified.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nFighting in the streets of Kyiv\n\nKyiv officials are warning residents that street fighting is underway against Russian forces, and they are urging people to seek shelter.\n\nThe warning issued Saturday advised residents to remain in shelters, to avoid going near windows or on balconies, and to take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nPresident refuses to flee, urges Ukraine to 'stand firm'\n\nRussian troops stormed toward Ukraine’s capital early Saturday as explosions reverberated through the city and the president urged the country to “stand firm” against the siege that could determine its future. He refused American help to evacuate, saying: “The fight is here.”\n\nHundreds of casualties were reported in the fighting, which included shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools. There also were growing signs that Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government, which U.S. officials have described as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ultimate objective.\n\nThe assault represented Putin's boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence. It triggered new international efforts to end the invasion, including direct sanctions on Putin.\n\nAs his country confronted explosions and gunfire, and as the fate of Kyiv hung in the balance, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a bleak statement that multiple cities were under attack.\n\n“This night we have to stand firm,” he said. \"The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”\n\n'Hands off Ukraine!' Russian protesters, celebrities risk arrest to denounce Putin's war\n\nZelenskyy was urged to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. The official quoted the president as saying that “the fight is here\" and that he needed anti-tank ammunition but “not a ride.”\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nBattle for Ukrainian capital reportedly intensifying, with explosions seen and heard in Kyiv\n\nRussian forces have reportedly moved in closer to Kyiv early Saturday morning, and explosions were seen and heard in parts of the capital suggesting an escalation of fighting with Ukrainian defenders, according to CNN.\n\nThe cable network reported that operations by Ukrainian forces to repel the Russian advance were intensifying in the early morning hours of Saturday, Kyiv time, not long after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy warned that the battle could be over by morning.\n\n\"This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,\" Zelenskyy said in a late-night video message Friday that was widely circulated on Twitter.\n\n\"This night we have to stand ground,” Zelenskyy said, surrounded by members of his national security team. “The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.\"\n\nCNN teams in the capital reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city. And Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes were underway in an eastern suburb as Russian forces appeared to be closing in on Kyiv from at least three sides.\n\nEarlier Saturday morning, the State Service of Special Communications reported: “Explosions in Kyiv. What is known? The enemy is trying to attack CHP-6 near Troieschyna. The Armed Forces give battle. Resistance continues in Vasylkiv, where enemy troops are trying to land.”\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\n'It is at its worst tonight'\n\nKonstantin Novikov is a yoga teacher living outside of Kyiv who is one of several residents who shared what life has been like the past few days. shared his Friday.\n\n\"They just started shooting. It's scary, you don't know where it's going to go.\n\n10 min ago there was a lot (of shooting); many rockets . It's silent now, and we are waiting. We will go down with a neighbor to the entrance to the first floor and we will sit there. It seems safer.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I have my car downstairs full of gas. I put my documents, money and some stuff in a little bag. In any moment i can take my bags, my cats, and run away if it is too scary to stay. ... Maybe I will go to the center of Ukraine. Somewhere where it is more safe. Mostly people are going to western Ukraine like Lviv. But right now I can only go through Kyiv because it is blocked any other way. Either by Russian troops on one side, or (on another road) the bridge was blown up to keep Russian troops from going over the road to Kyiv. So, I have only one way out from my city.\"\n\nUnclear if Japan to join in Russia sanctions\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi says he spoke with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the phone Saturday and agreed they must respond to Russian invasion of Ukraine properly to prevent it from becoming “a wrong lesson” because of its potential influence in Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nHayashi declined to comment if Japan plans to join the United States, Britain and the European Union in imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He said Japan will closely stay in touch with other Group of Seven members and the international society while watching the development.\n\nUkrainian soldier on Snake Island tells Russian officer 'go (expletive) yourself' before being killed\n\nHayashi told reporters that he and Blinken reassured their commitment to work closely with the rest of the international society. They agreed that it is necessary to respond to Russia properly and to absolutely reject the unilateral act to change the status quo and not leave “a wrong lesson.”\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRussian troops march on\n\nThe Russian military said Friday it had encircled the cities of Sumy and Konotop in northeastern Ukraine, but was “taking steps to ensure civilians’ safety.”\n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces have so far knocked out 211 Ukrainian military installations, including 17 command centers, 19 air defense missile systems, 39 radar units, 67 tanks and six warplanes. The Russian military also said it seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv, allowing it to quickly build up forces to take the capital.\n\nLate Friday, the Russian military said it has taken over Melitopol, a city near the Azov Sea. The claim could not immediately be independently verified.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official said it’s estimated that Russia has now launched more than 200 missiles into Ukraine and some have hit residential areas, although it was unclear if they were deliberately targeted.\n\nBut U.S. defense officials believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding slower than Moscow had envisioned.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nUkraine’s military reported shooting down an II-76 Russian transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers.\n\n\"We must survive this night”\n\nThe U.S. and its European allies moved to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday as Russia's military pushed further into Ukraine in an invasion that threatened to topple its democratic government.\n\nThe White House announced the new sanctions after President Joe Biden met with fellow NATO heads of state to discuss the mounting crisis.\n\nUkrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures. Bridges and schools have been damaged in the shelling, which also sliced through a Kyiv apartment building.\n\nAs Russian troops neared the capital, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to stay and fight - and beckoned his fellow countrymen to do the same.\n\n“You can not give up the capital,\" he said in a video message. \"We must survive this night.”\n\nThe crisis has roiled the globe since Putin, in the pre-dawn hours of Moscow on Thursday, announced in a televised address that he was launching a military operation against Ukraine.\n\nInternational backlash followed swiftly, with sanctions by the United States and a host of other countries. Biden said the new economic measures would \"limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy.\"\n\nBut, so far, those sanctions appear to have had little effect on Russia's attempt to take over the one-time Soviet Republic that has expressed a desire to someday join NATO.\n\n• MOUNTING DEATH TOLL: Zelenskyy announced that 137 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been killed with hundreds more wounded.\n\n• WHERE IS THE FIGHTING?

Here's what we know\n\nA NEW COLD WAR?: How historians view Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia vetoes UN Security Council resolution that it stop attacking Ukraine; China abstains\n\nAs expected, Russia vetoed a UN resolution on Friday evening demanding that Moscow stop its attack on Ukraine immediately and withdraw all troops. U.S. officials said they knew Moscow would oppose the measure but that they wanted to highlight Russia’s isolation within the international community.\n\nThe vote was 11 in favor, with Russia voting no. China, along with India and the United Arab Emirates, abstained.\n\nThe vote was delayed for two hours as the United States and Albania, co-sponsor of the resolution, worked behind the scenes to shore up support for the resolution among wavering nations, including Brazil.\n\n“A line has been crossed, and this council cannot remain silent,” said Brazil’s Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho. He said his government was “gravely concerned” about Russia’s military action.\n\nChina’s decision to abstain was seen as a diplomatic victory for pro-Ukrainian forces, given its history of using its veto power alongside ally Russia.\n\n-- Josh Meyer and Associated Press\n\nRussia-Ukraine explained:Inside the crisis as US calls Russian movements an invasion\n\nUkrainian President vows to stay and fight advancing Russian troops in Kyiv\n\nAs Russian troops advanced on Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv Friday evening, President Volodomyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a video statement that multiple cities were under attack and intent on seizing the capitol.\n\n”The night will be harder than the day,” Zelenskyy said on the video, which was widely circulated on Twitter.\n\n“At night they will storm,” he said in the message to Ukrainians. “You can not give up the capital. We must survive this night.”\n\nBiden administration spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed Friday afternoon that U.S. officials believe Putin intends to try to take the capital and oust the government.\n\nThe explosions and gunfire in Kyiv fueled further fears of wider war in Europe and triggered new international efforts — including direct sanctions on President Vladimir Putin by the U.S., UK, European Union and Canada — to make Moscow stop.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nU.S. to sanction Putin, other Russian officials\n\nThe United States is slapping sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and some of his deputies in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday the new sanctions will target Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and members of Russia’s national security team.\n\nThe announcement follows a decision by the European Union earlier Friday to freeze the assets of Putin and Lavrov, along with other sanctions.\n\nThe United States already has hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. But Ukraine has argued that a tougher economic response is needed and has asked for additional defense assistance.\n\n--Michael Collins and Joey Garrison\n\nThe enigma of Vladimir Putin:What do we really know about Russia's leader?\n\nUkraine's ambassador to US: Very concerned about Chernobyl\n\nOksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., voiced concern Friday that Russia took control of the Chernobyl power plant – site of the worst nuclear disaster in history – and took 92 staff members as hostages.\n\n“We are very concerned that the Chernobyl shelter is under threat of any type of random attack by the Russian federation,” Markarova told reporters in Washington.\n\nMore broadly, she said Ukraine armed forces destroyed 80 Russian tanks, 10 planes, seven helicopters and 516 armored vehicles. She blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for casualties.\n\n“As a result of Mr. Putin’s decision to send Russians to kill Ukrainians, 2,800 of Russian soldiers will not be going back to Russia,” she said.\n\nMarkarova said she wasn’t able to say what it would take for Putin to abandon the attack, but that Ukraine sought territorial integrity not just of its eastern provinces, but also Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\n“We are ready for peace talks, but we are not ready for capitulation or surrender,” Markarova said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWarner warns tech companies about Russian disinformation efforts\n\nSen. Mark Warner is urging U.S. tech companies on Friday not to let their platforms be misused by Russian influence operations in the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.\n\nThe Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, sent letters Friday to Alphabet, Meta – formerly known as Google and Facebook – as well as Reddit, Telegram, TikTok, and Twitter alerting them to malicious “information warfare” activities by Russia and Russia-linked entities.\n\n“As this conflict continues, we can expect to see an escalation in Russia’s use of both overt and covert means to sow confusion about the conflict and promote disinformation narratives that weaken the global response to these illegal acts,” Warner wrote.\n\nIn his letter to YouTube parent company Alphabet, Warner said his staff observed YouTube ads on Thursday monetizing content regarding the conflict in Ukraine from RT, Sputnik and TASS, which he described as malign actors affiliated with the Russian government.\n\n“Unfortunately, your platforms continue to be key vectors for malign actors – including, notably, those affiliated with the Russian government – to not only spread disinformation, but to profit from it,” Warner said.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nHundreds of casualties reported amid bombing damage, destruction\n\nAs the fighting intensified in Ukraine Friday, government officials offered competing assessments of the death toll.\n\nUkrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures.\n\nU.N. officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes, estimating up to 4 million could flee if the fighting escalates.\n\nBridges and schools have been damaged in the shelling, which also sliced through a Kyiv apartment building. After 8 p.m. in Ukraine, a large boom was heard near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square in central Kyiv that was the heart of the protests which led to the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president.

He had prolonged exposure in December to another prisoner with tuberculosis and was coughing up blood, according to U.S. embassy spokesman Jason Rebholz. Trevor Reed had been diagnosed with COVID-19 last May.\n\nAs a Marine, Reed served as a presidential guard and provided security at Camp David during the Obama administration.\n\nBut Reed was arrested in Moscow in August 2019 after allegedly being involved in a drunken fight at a party. He’s serving a nine-year sentence on charges the U.S. ambassador called “absurd.” U.S. officials have said Reed and another former Marine, Paul Whelan, were imprisoned potentially to be used as bargaining chips for the release of Russian spies.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday diplomatic talks with Russia have been ruptured by Moscow's massive military attack on Ukraine.\n\nPaula Reed told the Dallas Morning News the remarks were “like the exclamation point” to know “it’s going to be that much more difficult to get Trevor home.”\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nUkrainian minister offers pay hike for soldiers\n\nUkraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced Friday that the country’s armed forces would receive a 30% salary increase, along with monthly bonuses, while Ukraine is battling a Russian invasion that threatens its survival as a free democracy.\n\n“Together with the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Finance and the relevant parliamentary committee, we managed to find the expected financial resources and raise the salaries of Ukrainian defenders to the national average,” Reznikov said in a statement. “This is only the first step.

Ukraine has argued that a tougher economic response is needed and has asked for additional defense assistance.\n\nIn response, the European Union agreed Friday to freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov along with other sanctions.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nZelenskyy posts video pledging continued defense\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a short video just after midnight local time with other leaders of his country proclaiming their continued defense against the Russian invasion.\n\nHis defiance came as Russian troops pushed toward the capital Kyiv, and as questions swirled on social media about whether leaders had begun fleeing.\n\n“We are all here,” said Zelenskyy, who was surrounded by a handful of leaders. “Our military is here, citizens are here. We are all here defending our independence, our state and it will be so further. Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine!\"\n\nHe was joined by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and adviser Mykhailo Podoliak among other officials.\n\n\"Glory to heroes!\" the men said as the video ended.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Karina Zaiets\n\n'We are all here' Ukrainian President Zelenskyy shares message from Kyiv\n\nEU to freeze assets on Vladimir Putin, Sergey Lavrov - Latvian official\n\nThe European Union agreed to freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov along with other sanctions, according to Latvia's foreign minister.\n\nThe move is intended to ratchet up financial pressure on Putin to back off Ukraine and would add to other sanctions levied against Moscow from governments including the United States.\n\nLatvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said in a tweet on Friday that the EU's foreign ministers “adopted the 2nd sanctions package” and added that “the asset freeze includes President of Russia and its Foreign Minister.”\n\nHe said the EU plans to prepare another package of sanctions.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nUS official: Russian forces advance but not as quickly as anticipated\n\nRussian forces continue to invade Ukraine along three routes, including from the north toward Kyiv, although a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Russian momentum toward Kyiv has slowed in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe U.S. official declined to say how many Russian troops were on the ground in Ukraine now, but estimated it was about one third of the combat force that Russia had massed before the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin had deployed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s border prior to the invasion.\n\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings, told reporters Friday the U.S. had information suggesting that Moscow had expected a faster advance on Ukraine's capital. The official declined to say how the Pentagon had made that assessment, but Russia has not yet captured any major population centers.\n\nRussia has failed to dominate Ukrainian air space, the official said. Ukraine continues to fly warplanes that are attacking Russian forces. Ukraine also retains missiles for air defense.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, the Russians have made an amphibious attack, landing thousands of troops, the official said.\n\nElsewhere in the south, a battle is being fought for the Kakhovka hyrdo-electric plant that provides energy to Crimea and southern Ukraine. Russia has launched cyberattacks there, the official said.\n\n-Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUkraine pressures Europe to ban Russia from SWIFT\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister ramped up the pressure on European leaders on Friday to kick Russia out of the SWIFT financial system in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe United States and Europe already have hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. But some European leaders have been reluctant to boot Russia from SWIFT, a global messaging system connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nUkraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took to Twitter to urge those holdouts to reconsider, citing their past statements that a conflict like World War II should never be allowed to happen again.\n\n“To some European leaders who are still hesitant: each year at commemorative events you say ‘Never again,’” he wrote. “The time to prove it is now. Russia is waging a horrific war of aggression in Europe. Here is your ‘never again’ test: BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT and kick it out of everywhere.”\n\nKuleba said he spoke Friday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken about the need for the U.S. to use its influence to persuade hesitant European leaders to ban Russia from SWIFT.\n\n-Michael Collins\n\nZelenskyy says Ukraine is fighting Russia ‘alone’\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday Ukraine is fighting Russia “alone,” in an apparent criticism of the U.S. and other western allies, as he pushes for a stronger international response to Russia's invasion of his country.\n\n“This morning, we are defending our state alone, as we did yesterday,” he said in an address to Ukrainians. “The world’s most powerful forces are watching from afar. Did yesterday’s sanctions convince Russia?”\n\nBiden has vowed that he won’t send U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight Russia, though he has sent American forces to shore up NATO's eastern flank.\n\nBiden announced a second round of U.S. sanctions announced Thursday, but it did not include the harsh step of cutting Russia from the SWIFT financial system, which connects banks worldwide.\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nKremlin open to talks if Ukraine stops fighting\n\nThe Kremlin said Friday it is ready to hold talks with Ukrainian officials, but only after Ukrainian forces stand down. The conditional offer came as Russian forces bore down on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send a delegation to Belarus to meet with Ukrainian officials. This came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is willing to discuss a non-aligned status for the country, which would essentially mean dropping the country's bid to join NATO.\n\nHowever, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine must put down its arms before any talks happen, according to Russia's state controlled TASS News Agency.\n\nCharting Russia's invasion in maps\n\nRussian military forces invaded Ukraine at roughly 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday (4:30 a.m. on Thursday in Ukraine), using missiles, troops, tanks and aircraft.\n\nThe invasion has targeted major cities and military sites, with the attacks coming from all different directions, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Russia has fired more than 100 missiles.\n\nSee where Russia's forces are moving\n\nEmergency spending for Ukraine likely to reach billions, US senator says\n\nCongress may need to approve at least $10 billion in emergency spending to support Ukraine and for other needs, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Friday.\n\nCoons, a close ally of President Joe Biden who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters his estimate may be on the low side because it doesn’t include what may be a “robust” request from the Pentagon.\n\n“There is strong enthusiasm to provide ongoing resupply and training and whatever other covert and overt support is necessary and appropriate for the Ukrainian resistance,” he said.\n\nCoons, who also heads a subcommittee in charge of humanitarian aid, said he’s confident billions of dollars will be needed to support the likely millions of refugees expected to flee Ukraine for nearby countries.\n\n“It would be a wild guess on my part,” he said, “but I would be supportive of an emergency supplemental of at least $10 billion, perhaps more, to meet these vital national security and humanitarian needs.”\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nUkrainian official: Kyiv residents should make Molotov cocktails\n\nUkraine's Defense Ministry urged Kyiv's residents Friday to stay inside and prepare Molotov cocktails to defend their capital as Russian troops and tanks were on the verge of entering the central part of the city for the first since President Vladimir Putin launched his assault on Ukraine.\n\n\"Neutralize the enemy,\" Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted as Kyiv continued to be hit by apparent Russian airstrikes that have damaged apartment buildings and forced thousands into bomb shelters. Air raid sirens rang out through the night and into the early morning.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is continuing to plead with western leaders to unveil harsher sanctions on the Kremlin, saying “If you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”\n\nUkraine claims that more than 1,000 Russian troops have already been killed, though British officials have put the Russian death toll at half that.\n\n-Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhat is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from it impact the country?\n\nPresident Biden on Thursday announced a raft of new sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut one move the president didn’t announce: kicking Russia out of the SWIFT financial system.\n\nBiden said removing Russia from the international SWIFT financial system is still on the table but that European allies had resisted that step. The SWIFT system shifts money between banks around the world. Removing Russia would block Moscow from most international financial transactions, including profits from oil and gas production that are the lifeblood of Russia’s economy.\n\nMore:What is SWIFT?

For Francis to travel a short distance to the Russian embassy outside the Vatican walls was a sign of his strength of concern about Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nVatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the pontiff wanted “clearly to express his concern about the war.” Pope Francis was there for just over a half-hour, Bruni said.\n\nFrancis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next Wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine.\n\nBut he has refrained from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church, with which he is trying to build stronger ties.\n\nRockets strike Kyiv in `horrific’ attack\n\nRussia has launched a “horrific” rocket strike on Kyiv, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, tweeted Friday.\n\nThe capital hasn’t experienced an attack like that since 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded, he said.\n\n“Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one,” Kuleba tweeted. “Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe all ties. Kick Russia out\" of everywhere.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nRussian invasion advances on Kyiv; civilians spent night in bomb shelters\n\nRussian troops appeared to be advancing on Kyiv at the start of the second day of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAmid a fast-moving and difficult-to-verify situation, Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted early Friday that some Russian troops had broken through to several northern districts on the outskirts of the capital. However, Ukraine's military also said it was resisting the advance on multiple fronts.\n\nThe apparent development comes as thousands of civilians spent the night in bomb shelters, typically underground subway stations, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged his citizens to do all they can to resist Russia's assault. Zelenskyy has vowed to remain in Kyiv with his family and he appealed to Russia for a ceasefire.\n\nSome 137 Ukrainians, a mixture of soldiers and civilians, died in the fighting on Thursday, Zelenskyy said. Britain's Defense Secretary told his country's media Friday that Russia has lost about 450 military personnel.\n\nThe U.S., Europe and Japan have all unveiled sanctions on key Russian banks, airlines and associates of President Vladimir Putin.

Further package under urgent preparation.”\n\nMichel announced the move after a call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nMichel said Kyiv “is under continued attack by Russian forces” and called on Russia to immediately stop the violence.\n\nRussia stripped of Champions League final as UEFA shifts match to Paris\n\nLONDON - Russia was stripped of hosting the Champions League final by UEFA on Friday with St. Petersburg replaced by Paris after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe men's final will still be held on May 28 but now at the 80,000-seat Stade de France after the decision by UEFA's executive committee.\n\n\"UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis,” European football's governing body said in a statement. \"Together with the French government, UEFA will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.\"\n\nUkraine president: Russia has marked him ‘target No. 1’\n\nZelenskyy said Thursday he remains in the Ukraine capital of Kyiv, and intends to stay there, even as Russia has made him its top quarry.\n\n“The enemy has marked me as target No. 1, my family as target No. 2,” Zelenskyy said in an address to Ukrainians. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.”\n\nAsked about Zelenskyy’s safety, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. is in touch with him and are working to provide him support.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/02/25/coronavirus-outbreak-spreads-risks-us-economy-grow/4863214002/", "title": "Coronavirus: As outbreak spreads, risks to US economy grow", "text": "As the coronavirus spreads and raises the risk of recession, some analysts are further downgrading their forecasts for the U.S. economy.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, estimates the outbreak will reduce growth during the first three months of 2020 by six-tenths of a percentage point to 1.3%, more than his previous forecast of a four- to five-tenths of a point. The halt to Boeing’s production of its 737 Max airliner also is set to significantly hurt the economy this quarter.\n\nThe epidemic’s spread in recent days has sharply increased the number of cases in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. The number of infections worldwide is approaching 80,000, most of them in China, and the death toll now tops 2,600. There have been 35 cases in the U.S.\n\nLiving rooms on wheels:Tables, footrests, smart speakers: Here's what self-driving cars could include\n\nStock markets:World shares mostly lower after Dow drops more than 1,000\n\nThe outbreak is taking a growing toll on the U.S. economy, chiefly through reduced travel and tourism, Zandi says. Also, manufacturers will likely export less to Asia and Europe as demand there slackens. And lower imports from those regions are expected to lead to shortages of intermediate parts and retail products in the U.S., along with higher prices that curb consumer spending.\n\nChina outbreak hits U.S. construction\n\nThe construction industry is also likely to be affected, because it imports 30% of its products from China, more than from any other country, says Richard Branch, chief economist of Dodge Data and Analytics. Unless the virus is quickly contained, he says, \"supplies will continue to tighten – causing building costs to escalate and potential delays or cancellations of projects.\"\n\nAnd the 1,032-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday over reports of the virus's spread reflects market volatility that’s likely to curtail consumer and business spending, Zandi says.\n\nFor all of 2020, Zandi predicts the virus will trim growth by two-tenths of a percentage point to 1.7%. But if the outbreak becomes a global pandemic – a risk Zandi now puts at 40%, up from 20% – that almost certainly would result in a U.S. and global recession, he says.\n\nThreat to U.S. economic expansion\n\n“It’s becoming a threat to the economic expansion that is rising,” he says. The U.S. economy has grown for a record 10½ years.\n\nDiane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, also is increasing her estimate of the outbreak’s economic impact, possibly by about two-tenths of a point.\n\n“It’s causing an economic pandemic,” she says. “We have a global reaction that’s literally shutting down businesses.”\n\nSwonk is concerned that some American manufacturers won't receive parts from countries overseas, prompting them to lay off workers, who, in turn, will cut back on spending.\n\n“The longer it goes on, the more the risk of a vicious cycle,” says Swonk, who also worries about a “fear factor” that triggers a pullback in business investment beyond actual supply chain disruptions.\n\nWill the virus affect interest rates?\n\nOther economists have a more measured view. RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas and Nationwide chief economist David Berson say the virus’s advance has not yet led them to further lower their forecasts. Both estimate the outbreak will trim first-quarter growth by a relatively modest two-tenths of a percentage point.\n\nSwonk believes the intensified outbreak will lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again at its mid-March meeting. The Fed has been taking a wait-and-see approach since lowering rates three times last year but said that could change if there was a “material” change in its outlook. Another Fed rate cut likely would provide a boost to stocks.\n\nZandi, however, doesn’t believe the Fed will reduce rates again unless the epidemic worsens significantly.\n\nThe central bank also could act if Monday's market turmoil continues, says Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics,\n\nThe recent sharp drop in long-term Treasury rates – which reflects a dimmer global outlook because of the coronavirus – is likely aiding consumers more than any Fed cut to short-term rates, says Tom Porcelli, chief US economist of RBC Capital Markets. Ten-year Treasury rates directly affect mortgage rates, for example.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Monday that the virus poses a \"downside risk\" to her outlook. But at the National Association of Business Economics policy conference in Washington, she added that \"at this point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects.\"\n\nThe election and tuition:Election 2020: How the Democratic candidates could shape college costs, family finances", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/us/amtrak-train-crash-california/index.html", "title": "Amtrak train collides with vehicle at California intersection without ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn Amtrak train passing through an intersection without crossing gates in rural Brentwood, California, collided with a passenger vehicle, killing three people and causing major injuries to two others on Sunday, according to officials.\n\nAll five victims were in the vehicle and were attending an event near the train route, said East Contra Costa County Fire Protection District Marshal Steve Aubert.

But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/09/cast-blues-wedding-dress-scare-rhino-escape-news-around-states/118789038/", "title": "Cast of Blues, wedding dress scare: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The state attorney general’s office is trying to revive its lawsuit over the removal of a Confederate monument from outside a courthouse in the city. The state claimed in court documents that a judge shouldn’t have dismissed the suit just because someone anonymously paid a $25,000 fine that was owed by Madison County for removing the statue nearly a year ago, WHNT-TV reports. Attorney General Steve Marshall’s office contends the county should be required to pay the penalty itself. A judge scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon on the state’s bid to reinstate the lawsuit. The state sued the county last year seeking a $25,000 penalty that’s mandated under a state law that makes it illegal to remove or alter monuments. Madison County asked a judge to end the state’s suit after someone deposited $25,000 into a court account to pay the fine Aug. 27. The county says the money isn’t from taxpayers or Madison County but hasn’t said where it came from. Circuit Judge Claude Hundley dismissed the suit, but the state argues it needs to know who paid the fine to end the case. It also says the judge still needs to rule on its claim that Madison County broke the law by moving the monument, erected in 1905 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, to a city-owned cemetery.\n\nAlaska\n\nNewtok: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the pace of moving residents from a community threatened by erosion to another village, officials said. Money also has been an issue. Nine homes in the new village of Mertarvik that were started last year remain unfinished, and no one has moved from Newtok to Mertarvik since 2019, KYUK Public Media reports. Newtok had an estimated 220 residents last year. “We couldn’t get any cabinets because of this COVID thing,” said Phillip Carl, Newtok acting tribal administrator. Patrick LeMay, who is leading the building effort in Mertarvik, said shortages for materials have persisted. “We got 48 lights that are trapped somewhere in Tennessee floods, to finish the lighting. There’s a shortage of fire extinguishers in the nation,” LeMay said. “The supply chain has been a disaster.” Many of the workers building homes in Mertarvik are Newtok residents. LeMay said three workers from Newtok contracted COVID-19 in August. Many remaining laborers chose to stop working due to concerns about an outbreak, KYUK reports. Newtok recently experienced its biggest outbreak since the pandemic began, with 32 residents testing positive for the coronavirus last month. About 42% of its population is vaccinated. Meanwhile, Carl said Newtok has lost over 100 feet of its coast since April.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State Attorney General Mark Brnovich said Tuesday that Tucson’s vaccine mandate for its employees is illegal, giving the city 30 days to repeal it or risk losing millions of dollars in state funding. Democratic-led Tucson has repeatedly clashed with the state’s Republican leadership over the city’s aggressive efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. City Manager Michael Ortega said he put the mandate on hold while Tucson develops its legal position in response to the attorney general’s decision. Brnovich, who is running for U.S. Senate in a crowded Republican primary, cited a state law approved this summer that bans local governments from mandating vaccines for employees, though it doesn’t take effect until later this month. He also cited an August executive order signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. “Adhering to the rule of law in Arizona is not optional,” Katie Conner, a spokeswoman for Brnovich, told reporters. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero suggested Brnovich’s decision was motivated by his Senate campaign. “This report reads more as a campaign speech filled with political commentary rather than a fact-based legal opinion,” the Democratic mayor said in a statement. City officials are reviewing their options, Romero said, and the next step will have to be decided by her and City Council.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 38 new deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday as the capital city launched a new incentive program to boost vaccinations. The Department of Health said the state’s death toll from the pandemic now totals 7,108. The state reported 583 new coronavirus cases, and COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by eight to 1,228. Arkansas ranks 10th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The state’s top health official has warned he expects to see a surge in cases following the Labor Day weekend, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday said he expected an increase as well. “We have fewer cases from the Labor Day weekend, but we’ll see the effects of the holiday weekend later this week and into the next,” Hutchinson tweeted. Little Rock launched its incentive program tied to vaccination clinics it is holding, starting Saturday at the Southwest Community Center. Those who get shots at these clinics will receive a $50 VISA Rewards Card from U.S. Bank for both their first and second doses of vaccine received at a participating clinic. Those who provide proof of having gotten a first vaccine dose elsewhere and choose to get their second dose at a participating clinic, or those who receive a single-dose vaccine at a participating clinic, can receive a $100 Rewards Card.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers have moved to make the state the first to outlaw “stealthing,” which is removing a condom without permission during intercourse. Legislators sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a bill Tuesday adding the act to the state’s civil definition of sexual battery. It makes it illegal to remove the condom without obtaining verbal consent. But it doesn’t change the criminal code. Instead, it would amend the civil code so that a victim could sue the perpetrator for damages, including punitive damages. Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia has been pushing for the legislation since 2017, when a Yale University study said acts of stealthing were increasing against women and gay men alike. Her original bill attempted to make it a crime. But legislative analysts said at the time that the act could already be considered misdemeanor sexual battery, even if it isn’t specifically referenced in the criminal code. Even so, the analysts said it is rarely prosecuted, if only because of the difficulty in proving that a perpetrator acted intentionally instead of accidentally. Analysts this year said Garcia’s bill would remove any ambiguity in civil law. Garcia said the act can cause long-term physical and emotional harm to its victims.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city has closed Civic Center Park, one of its historic landmarks that has become a hot spot for homeless people to camp, because of safety and public health concerns, city officials said in a statement Tuesday. City officials said the park and surrounding areas have become a “hotspot for violence, crime, drug sales and substance misuse, jeopardizing the public’s ability to safely enjoy one of Denver’s treasured outdoor spaces.” Officials cited concerns about rodents, disease spread, impacts on water quality, discarded needles and other drug paraphernalia in a statement in which Mayor Michael B. Hancock said conditions had reached a “tipping point.” “This cannot and will not be allowed to continue,” Hancock said. The park was closed to the public starting Wednesday. Officials called it temporary but did not provide an exact date for its reopening. The city said it plans to restore the park’s greenery and historical stone structures that have been damaged by graffiti and fires and will require professional restoration. The park faces the state’s Capitol building and Lincoln Park, which was fenced off last summer after the city cleared a large camp of homeless people who were living there. Officials had cited health and safety concerns for issuing Lincoln Park’s cleanup, also referred to as “homeless sweeps” by local housing advocates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: An independent investigator will look into allegations of racial discrimination within the police department including unfair discipline of Black officers and a hostile work environment, city officials said. The probe is in response to claims against acting Police Chief Rebeca Garcia made by the Bridgeport Guardians, a group that represents minority officers on the force, Hearst Connecticut Media reports. City Council President Aidee Nieves said Bridgeport will be hiring an outside attorney to review the allegations. The Guardians, however, are continuing to insist that federal government officials investigate the department. Davon Polite, president of the Guardians, said there are concerns that city officials will hire a lawyer who will produce the results they want. “A federal investigation is the only way to get an impartial, fair investigation,” Polite said. The Guardians and the local NAACP branch recently requested federal oversight of the department and an investigation, alleging a widespread pattern of racial discrimination within the agency. The Guardians accuse Garcia of subjecting minority officers to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment. The group has called for her removal. The city police union voted no confidence in Garcia in March.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Chancery Court judge ruled protests may continue outside the house of Delaware Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney, denying the state’s request for a temporary restraining order. The proposed restrictions, made by the state Department of Justice after it perceived threats against the agency’s Division of Civil Rights and Public Trust head, sought to keep protesters 300 feet from Denney’s home. Demonstrators would also have to notify New Castle County Police at least 24 hours before they protested. In making her ruling Tuesday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick said there was not enough for her to go on to issue a temporary restraining order. She attributed that to the speed at which the proceedings were brought to her on Sunday of Labor Day Weekend. But she said the motion to expedite the proceeding could move forward. A date for the next hearing was not provided. Keandra McDole Ray, one of the people targeted by the motion, viewed the ruling as a positive outcome for demonstrators, who have been protesting that Denney “do his job” in the matter of Lymond Moses – a 30-year-old man killed during a Jan. 13 interaction with New Castle County Police in Wilmington.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: One of the biggest rock bands in the world will take the stage at D.C.’s 9:30 Club on Thursday night as the final part of the venue’s reopening week celebration, WUSA-TV reports. The club, which had been teasing a surprise musical guest for a few weeks, posted on social media Wednesday that the Foo Fighters had been tapped to help welcome fans back. This won’t be the first venue Dave Grohl and company have helped to reopen from long pandemic-induced closures. Back in June, the band reopened New York’s Madison Square Garden with a little help from D.C. native Dave Chappelle. But the 9:30 Club has a special connection to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band’s leader. As a teenager, Grohl played drums in a band called Dane Bramage at the 9:30 Club. “As a kid growing up in the D.C. punk rock scene, your first show at the 9:30 Club might as well have been Royal Albert Hall or Madison Square Garden,” Grohl told the Washington Post in a 2010 article celebrating the venue’s 30th anniversary. The 9:30 Club is one of several D.C. venues requiring proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of an event.\n\nFlorida\n\nIslamorada: A 148-year-old Florida Keys lighthouse could get a new life now that a community organization is poised to take ownership and begin a massive preservation project. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has approved a recommendation from the National Park Service that Islamorada-based Friends of the Pool Inc. be granted ownership of Alligator Reef Lighthouse under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act. The nonprofit announced the approval Tuesday. “Alligator Reef Lighthouse has stood since 1873,” project organizer Rob Dixon said. “It’s an important part of Islamorada’s local history. It’s our Statue of Liberty and needs to be saved.” Dixon said the restoration project is likely to take five to seven years and cost up to $9 million. “We’re going to need a lot of fundraising help and a lot of technical help,” he said. Friends of the Pool hosts an annual 8-mile swimming race to the offshore lighthouse and back to fund collegiate scholarships. The effort to save the lighthouse and start the “Swim for Alligator Lighthouse” event was conceived by Larry Herlth, a local metal artisan who created detailed replicas of Alligator Reef Lighthouse and other Keys lighthouses. “The six lighthouses off the Florida Keys are the biggest collection of iron piling lighthouses anywhere in the world,” Herlth said. “The history is just phenomenal.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A metro-area school district is switching to virtual learning, after two school bus drivers and a bus monitor died from COVID-19 in recent weeks. The 9,700-student Griffin-Spalding County school system, on the southern fringe of suburban Atlanta, made the announcement late Monday, citing a disruption in student transportation. Districts across Georgia are struggling to line up enough drivers and monitors to keep buses running. In Savannah, some bus drivers staged a sickout for the second day Tuesday after a similar protest Friday. At least 210,000 Georgia students in 54 districts and charter networks have had their school schedules disrupted because of COVID-19. Some districts have taken days off, some shifted to every-other-day schedules, and some sent home individual schools or grades. That’s over 12% of Georgia’s 1.7 million public school students. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals remains above 6,000, the highest level since the start of the pandemic. The number of newly reported deaths continues to rise sharply, with Georgia currently averaging more than 80 deaths a day, totaling more than 23,000 since the pandemic began. More than 34,000 coronavirus cases have been reported among children ages 5-17 in the two weeks ended Sept. 2, state Department of Public Health data shows.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A resort in the famed tourist mecca of Waikiki will be the first in the state to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all employees and guests. Starting Oct. 15, ’Alohilani Resort will require its employees, patrons and guests to show proof they’re fully inoculated. The requirement will also apply to the six other Waikiki properties owned or operated by Highgate, a real estate investment and hospitality management company. It’s the right thing to do as Hawaii grapples with a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations because of the highly contagious delta variant, said Kelly Sanders, senior vice president of operations at Highgate Hawaii. There were an average of 706 newly confirmed infection cases per day across Hawaii between Aug. 30 and Sept. 5 across Hawaii, according to the state Department of Health. Hawaii’s vaccination rate was 64%. “So I think we will be the safest hotel in Hawaii, at least for now,” Sanders said Wednesday. “And hopefully that helps our business and doesn’t hurt our business.” John De Fries, president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, called the move a step in a the right direction and said he hopes other hotels follow suit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s move to “crisis standards of care” is allowing some hospitals to ration health care as they struggle with an onslaught of coronavirus patients, and officials are warning the procedures could spread statewide. But the main hospital affected by the designation was already operating under extreme conditions, officials said. “Unfortunately we haven’t been really at our normal standards for some time,” said Dr. Robert Scoggins, the chief of staff for Kootenai Health, the largest hospital system in the northern half of the state. The Coeur d’Alene facility has had to move patients into a conference center, “doing things that were not normal – way outside of normal – at times,” Scoggins said. Newly confimed coronavirus infection cases are surging, and Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. At Kootenai Health, some patients are treated in converted lobbies and hallways. Urgent surgeries are on hold, and critical patients must often wait long periods of time for intensive care beds, Scoggins said. “Almost every day at this point we are having cardiac arrest from patients when their oxygen levels dip too low, and we can’t supply them with enough oxygen,” he said. An entire floor of the hospital has been turned into a COVID-19 ward, meaning medical staffers must put on full protective gear before they enter the floor.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Former U.S. Sen. Adlai Stevenson III has died at his home on Chicago’s North Side. He was 90. His son Adlai Stevenson IV, who confirmed the Illinois Democrat died Monday, said his father had dementia. Before his health declined, Stevenson kept active organizing presentations and speakers for the Adlai Stevenson Center on Democracy in Libertyville, Illinois. He also worked on the family farm in Hanover, Illinois, raising cattle, growing corn and hay for their feed, and chopping wood. “He just faded away,” his son said. Stevenson ran for governor of Illinois twice, losing his 1982 run by just 5,074 votes to Republican Gov. Jim Thompson – the closest election for governor in modern Illinois history. Stevenson was the great-grandson of former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, who served in the role for the second of President Grover Cleveland’s nonconsecutive terms. His father, Adlai Stevenson II, was a former Illinois governor and two-time presidential candidate. When running for the Senate, where he was first elected in 1970 to serve out the remainder of the late Sen. Everett Dirksen’s term, the third Stevenson asked then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley for advice. “My advice to you is don’t change your name,” Daley told him, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Stevenson was reelected in 1974 but decided not to run again in 1980.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Secured School Safety Board has approved more than $19 million in state grants, marking a third consecutive year the General Assembly has allocated funds for school safety investments. The awards will allow the board to fund projects proposed by 392 schools in their applications to the Secured School Safety Grant program. The program issues matching grants for school resource officers and law enforcement officers in schools, active event warning systems, firearms training for teachers and staff, threat assessments, and other safety technology and support services. Schools then match those funds at a certain level, based on average daily membership of the school district, the total amount of the project or what the request covers. “Hoosier students and staff should be able to go to school with the confidence and comfort of knowing they are safe and protected from harm. This program represents the state’s commitment to that mission,” Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a statement. The allocation of funds for the fiscal year includes roughly $13.4 million for school resource officers, $4.9 million for safety equipment, $642,000 for student and parent support services programs, $43,000 for active event warning services, and $6,200 for training.\n\nIowa\n\nMarshalltown: The city’s public schools will become the new owners of the historic Orpheum Theater for the basement-bargain price of $1. Marshalltown Community School District Board of Education on Tuesday unanimously approved a letter of intent to buy the theater on Main Street, the Times-Republican reports. The school district will pay the current owners, Iowa Valley Community College District, $1 for the building at closing. The closing date has been set for June 16 or sooner. The school board also approved a $20,000 purchase of a parking lot immediately east of the theater. The Orpheum closed last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Iowa Valley Community College District Chancellor Kristie Fisher said her school views the sale as more of a transfer of property from one school to another, and she’s proud the theater will remain an educational facility. “We knew it was a great community asset and so important to the greater Marshall County community that we wanted to make sure we were maximizing it,” Fisher said. She said that while the $1 sale doesn’t appear to be a money-maker for the community college district, it will save the institution the costs of operating the theater, freeing up funds for other priorities. The downtown Orpheum Theater was built in 1948.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: After months of advocacy by activists, the City Council has voted to establish a board to advise the council and city staff on environmental concerns, climate change and economic vitality. The council voted unanimously Tuesday to support Wichita’s Sustainability Integration Board, which will advise in such areas as reducing emissions and finding economic growth that is environmentally friendly. The council had listened to 27 Wichita citizens during the past six months who spoke about climate change concerns, The Wichita Eagle reports. As currently planned, the board will have 14 members and meet quarterly. Some of the advocates and some council members said the board was too big and should meet more often. The board will be able to create its own bylaws and procedures, including determining how often members meet. “I think this is a great first step forward, and I don’t think we should let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Mayor Brandon Whipple said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Republican lawmakers took initial steps Tuesday to block statewide mask mandates, showing their preference for local decision-making on the issue as they reconvened for a special session to assert their dominance in shaping Kentucky’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a daylong burst of action, a Senate committee advanced a measure to nullify the state school board’s requirement that anyone in a public K-12 school wear a mask. The bill would leave it up to local school boards to decide face-covering policies for their districts. A House panel advanced another bill to prevent the governor from issuing any new statewide orders requiring mask-wearing. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear previously used a mask mandate to combat the coronavirus’ spread. He lifted it but has said he would have reinstituted a requirement to counter a recent COVID-19 surge if he still had the authority. The session marks a dramatic power shift in coronavirus-related policymaking in the Bluegrass State. Since the pandemic hit Kentucky, Beshear mostly acted unilaterally in setting statewide virus policies, but the state Supreme Court shifted those decisions to the Legislature in a landmark ruling. Dozens of school districts have paused in-person learning because of virus outbreaks as the state sets records for new cases and hospitalizations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State health officials said Tuesday that they are revoking the licenses of nursing homes that evacuated residents to a warehouse where seven died amid deteriorating conditions deemed too squalid to be safe after Hurricane Ida. The seven homes – all owned by one person – “clearly failed to execute their emergency preparedness plans to provide essential care and services to their residents,” Department of Health Secretary Courtney Phillips said in a statement. Authorities found some nursing home residents lying on mattresses on the floor, without food or clean clothes, and detected strong odors of urine and feces throughout the warehouse, located in the town of Independence. Piles of trash were on the floor. Water entered the building, and generators at least temporarily failed, according to officials. Health department lawyer Stephen Russo called the conditions “inhumane.” State health officials and Attorney General Jeff Landry have launched investigations into the deaths. A police official said the Tangipahoa Parish warehouse was equipped to handle 300 to 500 people but ultimately took in more than 800. Officials said the owner, Bob Dean, failed to contact them for help and threw inspectors from the agency off the property when they arrived to review the conditions onsite after receiving reports of problems.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The late founder of the Greater Portland Immigrant Welcome Center has become the first Black Mainer to be inducted in the state’s Franco-American Hall of Fame. Alain Jean Claude Nahimana, who died at age 49 last year, was one of three people inducted posthumously during the ceremony Tuesday at the Maine State House. The son of a Burundi ambassador who fled political turmoil, Nahimana was educated in Burundi and Switzerland before moving to Maine in 2010. He served as the president of the Burundi Community Association and as coordinator of the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition before launching the immigrant welcome center. There were a dozen inductees, including former House Speaker John Martin, of Eagle Lake, and state Sen. Susan Deschambault, of Biddeford. Dignitaries who attended the event included the French ambassador to the United States, Phillippe Etienne, along with Senate President Troy Jackson and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau. Gov. Janet Mills, who studied abroad for a year in Paris as a college student, delivered remarks in both French and English. She noted that more than a third of Maine residents have a Franco heritage.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A commission on congressional and state legislative redistricting has announced 12 public hearings. Ten of the hearings will be held in different parts of the state. The first will be Sept. 20, and the last is scheduled for Nov. 18. There also will be two statewide virtual hearings. The panel, which includes leading Democrats who control the General Assembly as well as two Republican legislative leaders, will draw maps for the state’s eight congressional districts as well as the 188 seats in the Legislature, based on new census data. Maryland’s current congressional map has been criticized as having some of the most gerrymandered and oddly-shaped districts in the nation. In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1, Democrats hold a 7-1 advantage in its U.S. House delegation. Karl Aro, the former executive director of the Maryland Department of Legislative Services who is chairing the commission, said the geography should look “prettier” this time in how the maps are drawn. He noted that in the past “things have gotten pretty free-hand-drawing like.” Aro said he’s hopeful people will not feel like their communities have been “carved 16 different ways.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shortage of bus drivers in the city’s public schools has been raising concern among parents who fear some students could be left behind when the district starts a new year Thursday. Acting Mayor Kim Janey and Superintendent Brenda Cassellius have told families to expect significant delays or bus cancellations, but details were not being provided to families until Thursday morning, The Boston Globe reports. The shortage is so severe that a union for bus drivers last week urged the district to postpone the start of classes. The district’s bus fleet was short more than 60 drivers at the time, and few had been added by this week. Families and advocates worry some students could end up stranded at home or at bus stops Thursday. The Boston Special Education Parent Advisory Council has raised concerns about students who need special education services including door-to-door transportation or individual bus monitors. “I honestly don’t know what to expect now and am concerned for families that don’t have the work flexibility, income, or resources to secure alternative transportation,” said Roxi Harvey, who chairs the council.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday proposed spending $200 million in federal pandemic relief funding to replace lead water pipes across the state, where aging underground infrastructure was exposed by Flint’s disaster. The plan, if approved by the Legislature, would set aside $20 million to replace all the lines in Benton Harbor in five years. The majority-Black city in the state’s southwestern corner has been exceeding the federal lead limit since 2018. That year, Michigan began enforcing the nation’s strictest rules for lead in drinking water in the wake of the crisis in Flint, another impoverished city with a majority-Black population. The regulations will result in replacing every lead service pipe statewide by 2041 unless a utility can show regulators it will take longer. The proposal would expand upon a water plan Whitmer announced nearly a year ago, including $102 million to replace lead service lines in disadvantaged communities. In June, Republicans who control the Senate unveiled a $2.5 billion water infrastructure proposal that would be funded primarily with federal COVID-19 aid. Their plan includes $600 million for pipe replacements, triple what the governor is seeking. Whitmer said more money is needed to replace all pipes but noted an infrastructure agenda pending in Congress.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A prominent GOP donor who is charged with multiple counts of sex trafficking is now being sued by an underage girl who says he used her for sex acts, then offered her money to keep her from talking about it. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court alleges that Anton Lazzaro’s attorneys offered $1,000 in hush money to the girl and her parents to keep them quiet and asked them to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The girl’s father refused and instead went to law enforcement, said their attorney, Jeff Anderson. The lawsuit, which also lists the girl’s parents as plaintiffs, alleges Lazzaro used his “power, wealth, influence, connections, and resources to recruit children … so that he could prey on them. When it became clear that Lazzaro had committed serious crimes, he attempted to coerce his victims and their families into keeping silent.” Lazzaro, 30, was charged in August with five counts of sex trafficking of minors, one count of attempted sex trafficking of a minor, one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors and three counts of obstruction. His attorney has said he is being falsely accused. St. Thomas University student Gisela Castro Medina, 19, the former chairwoman of the school’s Republican Party chapter, also faces criminal charges for allegedly recruiting girls for Lazzaro.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: An exhibit about blues legends and juke joints is opening soon, designed to appeal to the eyes, hands and ears. A Cast of Blues will be on display starting Saturday and running through Oct. 9 at the Historic Eureka School in Hattiesburg. It features 15 resin-cast masks of blues legends and photographs of blues performers and juke joints made by Mississippi artists. Sharon McConnell-Dickerson created the resin-cast masks, and the photographs were taken by Ken Murphy. McConnell-Dickerson, who is visually impaired, said the casts are like 3-D photographs for people who are blind. “It captures the flesh, muscle, bone, hair and subtle expressions of emotion,” she said. “I wanted to discover the faces behind the music I love, so I went to Mississippi to map out the visages of the real Delta blues men and women.” The exhibit features Braille labels, a music playlist and a closed-captioned film about the Cast of Blues project. Visitors are encouraged to touch the masks, McConnell-Dickerson said. Among the artists spotlighted are Bo Diddley and Bobby Rush. The exhibit is also accompanied by the 2008 documentary film “M for Mississippi: A Road Trip through the Birthplace of the Blues.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Several people have been treated in emergency rooms after taking the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, even as experts warn of dangerous side effects and a lack of proof that it helps treat COVID-19. Dr. Steven Brown told KMOV-TV that cases of ivermectin toxicity have occurred at Mercy hospitals across the state. “People who are relying upon ivermectin and remaining unvaccinated are under a tremendous false sense of security,” Brown said. “I have seen people with ivermectin toxicity in the emergency room from taking the animal formulation. I’ve seen people who relied on ivermectin to prevent themselves from getting COVID who are on ventilators and who have died.” This week, the American Medical Association and two pharmacist groups urged physicians, pharmacists and other prescribers to warn patients against using ivermectin, a decades-old drug used to killed worms and other parasites in humans and animals. Large studies are underway in the U.S. and overseas to determine if the drug has any effect on preventing or reducing the effects of COVID-19. Ivermectin has been promoted by GOP lawmakers, conservative talk show hosts and some doctors, amplified via social media to millions still resistant to vacines. It has also been widely used in some other countries such as India and Brazil.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s Republican attorney general is asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood last month seeking to block four new laws that would restrict access to abortion in the state. The laws, set to take effect Oct. 1, would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation; restrict access to abortion pills; require abortion providers to ask patients if they would like to view an ultrasound; and prohibit insurance plans that cover abortion procedures from being offered on the federal exchange. The lawsuit filed in Yellowstone District Court names Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen as a defendant. The state is represented in the case by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. The state asked Tuesday for the court to reject Planned Parenthood’s request to block the laws before they take effect, saying the laws will “help minimize the medical risks” during pregnancy. But medical experts and abortion advocates broadly dispute that the new laws would make the procedure safer. The suit claims the laws violate the Montana Constitution, which protects access to abortion before the fetus is viable, generally at 24 weeks gestation. It says the laws will reduce the number of locations where abortion services are offered and threaten providers with civil and criminal penalties.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A segment of the Henry Doorly Zoo was cleared out and visitors were warned to remain inside buildings after a 5,000-pound rhinoceros briefly escaped its enclosure, officials there confirmed. The incident happened Tuesday afternoon, when zookeepers spotted an Indian rhino named Jontu outside his enclosure grazing on grass in an area adjacent to the rhino barn that’s not open to the public, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Visitors were asked to leave the area or shelter in buildings, and the zoo’s carousel and aviary were cleared of guests as a precaution. Dan Cassidy, the zoo’s vice president of animal management, said staff quickly pulled in trucks to serve as a barricade around the area to keep the rhino from wandering and used apples and leafy greens to lure him back in the barn. In all, the rhino was outside the enclosure for about 40 minutes, Cassidy said. The animal never showed any signs of aggression while outside the barn, and the public was not in danger, Cassidy said. Vets were on hand with tranquilizer guns to be used as a last resort if needed. Zoo officials believe Jontu used his nose to push open a latch on a door that wasn’t locked properly. Cassidy said staff will critique the process of corralling the rhino and are considering changing the lock on the door from which he escaped.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The president of the school board for metro Las Vegas says she’s received death threats since the district approved a requirement for employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations. Clark County School District Board of Trustees President Linda Cavazos said on Twitter that the threats had “very disturbing images” but that she and her colleagues were continuing to do their jobs, KVVU-TV reports. “We have no time for hate,” she said. The district board voted Sept. 1 for a vaccination requirement that the district superintendent will draft and implement. The district hasn’t yet released details of the mandate. As approved by the board, the plan will include a process for requesting accommodations for medical conditions or for sincerely held religious beliefs. Amid talk of a protest against the mandate, the district said Tuesday that staff member absences were about double from the day after Labor Day in 2019. The district said the callouts accounted for less than 5% of the CCSD workforce and noted that staff could have called out for a variety of reasons.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nStratham: A family that lost a nearly 185-year-old barn on their farm that’s been the backdrop for political events for Republican politicians has sunflowers in the spot for now and recently celebrated a grand reopening. The fire burned down a four-story, 80-foot-long barn at the Scamman Farm in Stratham in May. “It’s just so beautiful, and we’ve been getting a lot of phone calls through the summer asking if they can come take photos in the sunflower patch,” farm manager Sue Fernholz said. “It shows that there’s beauty in life after tragedy.” Fernholz said the sunflowers were planted to pay tribute to the sister of a family friend who died last year. The farm, which reopened last week, also features corn mazes, hayrides, pumpkin patch and other attractions. The family still plans to rebuild the barn once two other buildings are repaired. “We’re going to take the winter to figure out what our needs are (for the new barn),” Kirk Scamman said. Former Presidents George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush, had visited the farm. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, launched his campaign there, and Republican Scott Brown announced his U.S. Senate run there in 2014.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFair Lawn: One school district is getting creative with ways to allow students to get mask-free fresh air during the day. The Fair Lawn district has set up 32 tents at its 10 schools for outdoor lunch, and at Fair Lawn High School, two additional tents are available for outdoor classes, said Superintendent Nicholas Norcia. The first day of school last Friday had a delayed start because of flooding, and the schools have been closed this week until Thursday for the Rosh Hashana holiday. The principals will be working with teachers to determine a schedule for outdoor classrooms so that everyone can get a chance to use them, Norcia said. On Friday, Norcia visited a few schools. “The students were excited to be outside in beautiful weather, eating lunch,” he said. “They were having the best time ever, and it was so great to see.” As of now, the schedule will allow for half the students to eat lunch outside while the other half are inside, and they will rotate. While in the tents, students don’t need to wear masks, Norcia said. Meanwhile, some school districts along the Jersey shore have been lifting mask mandates, citing excessive heat and insufficient air conditioning in classrooms.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expansion of nonmerit scholarships to college and greater spending to safeguard abandoned oil wells in the state are among the governor’s new spending priorities, amid a windfall in income linked to federal pandemic relief and petroleum production. September marks the outset of the Legislature’s grueling budget-writing process for the year beginning July 1, 2022. Several executive agencies overseen by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham are making the case for expanded services. Lujan Grisham spokesman Tripp Stelnicki said Tuesday that the inclination is to “aim high” and “make the most of the opportunity we have to finish the work of rebuilding state government services after so many years of forced austerity.” The Human Services Department is suggesting a $100 million spending increase on Medicaid and related mental health services alone, for total annual general fund spending of $1.26 billion on the program. State income for the coming fiscal year is expected to outpace routine annual spending obligations by $1.4 billion, or 19% of annual general fund spending obligations. That leaves lawmakers more money than ever before to spend on education, roads, public safety and other government programs.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The remains of two people who died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack at the World Trade Center were positively identified this week, as officials continued the difficult and heart-wrenching task of returning victims to their families. The announcement came days before the 20th anniversary of an attack that killed nearly 3,000 people when hijacked commercial jets flew into the twin towers, struck the Pentagon and crashed into a Pennsylvania meadow. “No matter how much time passes since Sept. 11, 2001, we will never forget, and we pledge to use all the tools at our disposal to make sure all those who were lost can be reunited with their families,” said Dr. Barbara A. Sampson, the chief medical examiner of the city of New York. Technicians in the medical examiner’s office have been working for years to match thousands of body fragments recovered from the World Trade Center rubble with known victims but haven’t been able to extract useable DNA in many cases. The identifications announced Tuesday were the first since October 2019. One set of remains was linked to Dorothy Morgan, of Hempstead, New York, who was a broker for Marsh & McLennan. Officials also matched remains recovered in 2001, 2002 and 2006 to a single victim, whose family asked that his name be withheld.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: President Joe Biden approved a request Wednesday for federal funds to be made available to residents of western North Carolina who saw major flooding last month due to Tropical Storm Fred. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper sought the emergency declaration for federal assistance to seven counties nearly two weeks ago. “This federal disaster declaration will help provide assistance for Western North Carolina communities to rebuild stronger and smarter, and I appreciate the president’s approval of our request,” Cooper said in a statement. The storm claimed the lives of six people in Haywood County, caused major damage to more than 200 homes and led to nearly $19 million in estimated damages to public infrastructure. The Cruso community was among those hardest-hit by the flooding. Wednesday’s approval from Biden and the Federal Emergency Management Agency frees up money to residents of Buncombe, Haywood and Transylvania counties. State, tribal and eligible local governments and certain nonprofit organizations also qualify for federal funds on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work performed in the three areas, as well as Avery, Madison, Watauga and Yancey counties.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State health officials took to an internet town hall Tuesday to promote certain treatments for COVID-19 and discourage use of an anti-parasitic medicine. Ivermectin has a limited scope for human treatment, sometimes prescribed for worms, scabies and head lice. It is more popular in veterinary form as a treatment for parasitic infections and infestations in cows and horses. North Dakota health officials say data on ivermectin sickness is limited, and poison control has only documented a couple of such cases. But Dr. Joshua Ranum of West River Regional Medical Center said the stories are out there. “The ivermectin issue is interesting,” Ranum said. “We of course live out in farm and ranch country. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that the cows didn’t get their full dose of ivermectin because some of it accidentally went down the hatch.” The veterinary form of ivermectin has high concentrations of the drug because of the high body mass of horses and cows. Adverse effects in humans include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, coma and death. There are better and safer options, according to Ranum and state Health Department spokesman Kirby Kruger. They pointed to monoclonal antibody drugs, steroids and antivirals like remdesivir.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican lawmakers plan to unveil their version of a newly drawn map of legislative districts Thursday morning, with a vote planned later in the day on a final version, the state Senate president said. The Ohio Redistricting Commission, charged with drawing a map good for as long as 10 years, missed its Sept. 1 deadline, triggering an extension until the middle of the month. Senate Democrats submitted their proposed map last week. The map to be presented Thursday morning was created by House and Senate Republicans, said Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. Some of the GOP map is almost identical to the Senate Democrats’ version, he said. The commission will vote on a final version of its proposed map Thursday afternoon, Huffman said. The commission held nine public hearings around the state earlier this month looking for input on a new map, which is meant to end the current gerrymandered maps. Voters approved constitutional amendments in 2015 and 2018 that created a new process for drawing both state legislative and congressional district maps this year and set up the independent commission. Creating a 10-year map requires a majority vote of the commission, including both Democrats. Creating a four-year map requires a simple majority without both Democrats.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has removed the only two physicians from the board that oversees the state’s Medicaid agency, just a week after the board voted 7-1 to delay implementing rules on Stitt’s plan to privatize some Medicaid services. Dr. Jean Hausheer said Tuesday that both she and Dr. Laura Shamblin, an Oklahoma City pediatrician, were informed Saturday by a staffer in the governor’s office that they were being removed from the governing board of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority. Hausheer, an ophthalmologist from Lawton, said neither she nor Shamblin was told why they were being removed, and Stitt spokeswoman Carly Atchison didn’t immediately respond to questions about his decision. “The governor has my cellphone number … it is kind of odd that he didn’t contact me himself,” Hausheer said. “I’m going to presume it was because of our last board meeting.” Hausheer and Shamblin were among seven members of the board who voted last week to delay implementing rules on Stitt’s plan to outsource case management for some Medicaid recipients to private insurance companies. Stitt’s managed care proposal has faced bipartisan opposition in the Legislature and was ruled unconstitutional in June by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Because of new guidance, city officials may need to exempt the police bureau from an order that all employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or risk losing their jobs. The city attorney’s office said Tuesday that the order requiring police to be inoculated is now legally dubious because of new guidance from the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Under state law, local municipalities can only issue vaccine mandates for police officers if a federal or state rule requires it. The city believed Gov. Kate Brown’s vaccination mandate issued last month for state health care workers covered officers because they receive some medical training. But the new guidance related to Brown’s vaccine mandate said law enforcement was “probably not” subject to the governor’s orders, as providing medical care was “likely not a fundamental part of their job.” The city’s police union previously said a vaccine requirement would lead to mass resignations. The Portland Police Bureau has said it does not track vaccination rates for its officers. The city as of Tuesday had not publicly announced any change in policy regarding the vaccination mandate. Multnomah County, like Portland, has ordered all employees to be vaccinated by Oct. 18, including the sheriff’s office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A statewide mask mandate for schools went into effect Tuesday, with some districts in open defiance of the Wolf administration, while GOP leaders in the state House planned to come back to Harrisburg early to mount a legislative response. The state health secretary’s order that students, staff and visitors at K-12 schools and child care facilities are required to wear masks while indoors, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, has provoked outrage from some parents, students and school board members who say the decision should remain local. Some districts faced anti-mask protests as students returned to class after the long Labor Day weekend. Meanwhile, the Tamaqua Area School Board in Schuylkill County flouted the mask mandate by voting to keep face coverings optional. The superintendent of Hamburg Area School District in Berks County said masks would remain optional pending the outcome of a special school board meeting to discuss the statewide mandate. Late Tuesday, the board voted 5-3 to adhere to the Department of Health order and require masks, WFMZ reports. In central Pennsylvania, the Central York School Board expressed disdain for the mask mandate and said it would give a “grace period” for students to come into compliance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Local police organizations are questioning Mayor Jorge O. Elorza’s judgment after he hired a civilian with no experience in law enforcement to be the city’s first-ever police major instead of considering the Black officers who applied for the position. Elorza chose Michael Stephens, who has no experience in law enforcement, aside from graduating from the citizens academy in 2016. Stephens was a recreation director and NCAA referee before his appointment as police major, The Boston Globe reports. The National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers Chairman Charles Wilson said the mayor’s decision in appointing a civilian without experience over qualified Black law enforcement officers was demeaning. Stephens is also Black. Stephens will manage oversight on police training and be responsible for the recruitment and training of police recruits. According to Wilson, three Black officers applied for the major’s position. The mayor chose Elorza instead. Providence City Council President John Igliozzi proposed that the mayor change the job title from police major to public safety community-police liaison because of the backlash from the police organizations.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Authorities shut down a road for more than an hour Tuesday to investigate a bomb threat that turned out to be a wedding dress, Charleston Police said. Someone who saw a woman cram an oversized package into a mailbox called 911, Charleston Police spokesman Charles Francis said in a statement. Officers responded and determined the package contained a wedding dress that a woman was trying to return by mail, Francis said. The road was reopened after more than an hour. The statement did not say if the wedding dress was damaged.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has capped the number of retail stores that can sell medical marijuana at five. The council signed off Tuesday night on a proposal coming from Mayor Paul TenHaken’s office. But council members halved the $100,000 license fee that City Hall wanted and will allow the licenses to be sold on the secondary market. “The Sioux Falls City Council, by making a license worth $50,000 and transferrable, has just made dispensary licenses into liquor licenses,” Drew Duncan, a Sioux Falls attorney and lobbyist for clients in South Dakota’s gambling and alcohol industry, said via social media following the 7-1 vote. A new liquor license in Sioux Falls costs about $200,000, but a state-set cap on the number of them has driven up the price on the secondary market to $300,000 or higher. TenHaken and supporters of barring the transfer of dispensary licenses worry that allowing them to be sold on the secondary market will give them an artificial value, just as has happened with liquor licenses. But the majority of the council decided without allowing a license to be owned outright, the city’s medical marijuana rules would unduly restrict a retailer’s ability to grow their business.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A panel has approved $65 million in state incentives for Oracle Corp. as the company plans to bring 8,500 jobs and an investment topping $1 billion to the fast-growing capital city over the coming decade. The State Funding Board’s approval of the FastTrack grant came during a meeting Tuesday. In April, Nashville Mayor John Cooper’s office announced that the Austin, Texas-based computer technology company plans to build the new campus with 1.2 million square feet of office space. Documents show the jobs will have an average salary of $110,000. Oracle paid $254 million for 60 acres and is offering $175 million upfront for public infrastructure, including a pedestrian bridge over the Cumberland River, environmental cleanup, a sewer pump station and a riverfront park, the mayor’s office has said. Half of Oracle’s future property taxes – which the company estimates will be roughly $18 million annually when the project is fully built – would reimburse the company for the upfront investment, without interest payments, with the other half going into the city’s general operating fund, Cooper’s office has said. The move would surpass the expansion of Amazon, which in 2018 announced it would bring 5,000 jobs through a $230 million investment.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday defended a new state law banning most abortions that also does not provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest, saying it does not force victims to give birth – even though it prohibits abortions before many women know they’re pregnant. Abbott, a Republican, said Texas would strive to “eliminate all rapists from the streets” while taking questions during his first press conference since the law took effect last week. The comments drew new criticism from opponents of the biggest curb on abortion in the U.S. since the medical procedure was legalized a half-century ago. The Texas law prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, which is usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Though abortion providers in Texas say the law is unconstitutional, they say they are abiding by it. “His comments are confusing to me because they certainly do not seem to reflect the realities of this law,” said Amy Jones, the chief executive officer of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center. Recent surveys by the U.S. Department of Justice found that most rapes go unreported to police. “Certainly it is in our mission statement to work to end sexual violence – that is why we exist – but we are also very aware that that is an aspirational goal that yes, we do believe that this is a preventable crime, but it if it were that easy, rape would no longer exist,” Jones said.\n\nUtah\n\nBrian Head: In the midst of record tourism statewide, Gov. Spencer Cox helped park staff and charity partners break ground Tuesday on a new visitor center at Cedar Breaks National Monument. The center has been a decade in the making, built with a combined $6 million in funds from fees, donations, and funding from Iron County, the National Park Service, the Zion Forever Project charity and organizations. Superintendent Kathleen Gondor did a “happy dance” as she opened the groundbreaking ceremony near the popular Point Supreme overlook, which is currently closed to the public because of the construction. “It’s just going to give us that sense of place instead of a bunch of pullouts along the road,” she said, echoing a sentiment that Cedar Breaks is a “drive-thru” park. Cox said there was “every right to be excited,” and he was glad to see partnerships work as visitation soars in the lesser-known park. “So many people even in Utah don’t know about it, still,” he said. “Americans are rediscovering America, and Utahns are rediscovering Utah.” But with increased visitors comes an increased responsibility to make sure those visitors have a good experience and recreate responsibly, something Cox said he hopes the visitor center will help people to do.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: Three state troopers who are accused of being involved in a scheme to create fraudulent COVID-19 vaccination cards have resigned, state police said Tuesday. Troopers Shawn Sommers and Raymond Witkowski resigned Aug. 10, a day after a fellow trooper told supervisors about the alleged scheme. Trooper David Pfindel resigned Sept. 3 following further investigation, according to a state police news release. The three ex-troopers are suspected of having varying roles in the making of fraudulent vaccination cards, according to the release. “The accusations in this case involve an extraordinary level of misconduct – a criminal violation of the law – and I could not be more upset and disappointed,” Col. Matthew T. Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said in the release. “If these allegations are proved to be true, it is reprehensible that state troopers would manipulate vaccination cards in the midst of a pandemic, when being vaccinated is one of the most important steps anyone can take to keep their community safe from COVID-19.” Sommers and Witkowski both joined the Vermont State Police in July 2016. Pfindel was hired in January 2014, police said. Federal authorities are investigating the allegations.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A part of southside Virginia that has relatively lower rates of vaccination against COVID-19 is seeing increasing interest in the shots. The Danville Register & Bee reports that it appears the most recent surge in infections has spurred more residents to roll up their sleeves in the Pittsylvania-Danville Health District. Data from the Virginia Department of Health shows that inoculations jumped about 50% in August compared to July. Nearly two-thirds of the almost 5,700 shots were first doses. “Numbers of vaccinations are increasing as of late, which we welcome and consider a positive step by the community,” Dr. Scott Spillmann, director of the local health district, told the newspaper. “We ask everyone who is not yet fully vaccinated to do so as soon as possible.” Southside Virginia trails the rest of the state when it comes to vaccination rates. As of Friday, 51% of adults in Danville were fully inoculated. In Pittsylvania County, 47% of adults were fully vaccinated. Statewide, more than two-thirds of adults have received a full COVID-19 vaccine series. Meanwhile, Danville and Pittsylvania County combined are seeing about 52 new coronavirus infections a day because of the delta variant.\n\nWashington\n\nLongview: A recent increase in COVID-19 deaths has overwhelmed a southwest Washington county’s storage capacity, prompting the coroner to ask the commissioners to declare an emergency to allow the county to bring in a refrigeration trailer. Cowlitz County commissioners agreed Tuesday to the request to help expand capacity until the new morgue is ready for staff to move into in about a month. The Daily News reports Cowlitz County Health and Human Services data for the past week is incomplete, but at least eight county residents died due to COVID-19 between Aug. 31 and Sept. 6. The residents ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and seven of the residents had been hospitalized. Coroner Tim Davidson said the morgue and the county’s funeral homes are maxed out on capacity, and they are “being creative” to maintain cold storage. All together, the facilities can typically hold 45 bodies and right now have about 65, he said. “We’re just doing our best that we can to preserve the dignity of the deceased from this point forward until they can be processed for their families,” Davidson said. The morgue can hold 10 bodies but is currently “way above that,” using gurney tables in the cooling rooms to handle the increase, he said. The new morgue under construction will be able to hold 50 in cold storage.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: The state’s largest annual festival will require most people in attendance to wear masks when Bridge Day is held this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic in America’s newest national park. Tens of thousands of people typically show up on the third Saturday of October to watch parachutists, zip liners and rappellers on the 876-foot-high New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville. Masks will be required at the festival regardless of vaccination status, and social distancing must be observed whenever possible, the Bridge Day Commission said in a statement. People come from across the world to attend the event. Festivalgoers typically line the center of the 3,000-foot-long bridge shoulder-to-shoulder trying to get a good look at parachutists catapulting themselves off the nation’s third-highest bridge. Exceptions to the mask mandate include those at the time of their participation – be it in the air, during a 5-kilometer run, while rafting in the New River or on a zip line. But they’ll have to mask up before and after, the statement said. Social distancing will be next to impossible on the crowded bridge itself, but organizers said it will be required on the festival’s perimeters. Bridge Day is the only day of the year the bridge is open to pedestrian traffic. The pandemic forced last year’s event to be canceled.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A new report suggests people are buying dramatically more alcohol as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. Revenue from state excise taxes on alcohol during the fiscal year that ended June 30 totaled $73.8 million, up almost 17% from $63.3 million the previous year, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Revenue cited in the report from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. If the preliminary data holds, the increase would be the biggest proportional increase the state has seen since 1972, the report said. The rise in alcohol tax collection exceeded 2.4% in only one year between 2009 and 2020, the report said. Alcohol excise taxes in Wisconsin are based on the volume sold, not price. Beer is taxed at about 6.5 cents per gallon. Wine is taxed at 25 cents per gallon if it has an alcohol content of 14% or less. The report did not examine sales tax revenue on alcohol. Most states have seen a bump in alcohol tax revenues during fiscal year 2021. The report said increased alcohol consumption is “perhaps unsurprising” given rising stress related to personal health, job losses, school challenges and a lack of leisure activities during the pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming Supreme Court Justice Michael K. Davis plans to retire in January, opening the way for Gov. Mark Gordon to make his first appointment to the high court. Davis plans to retire Jan. 16 after a decade on the state’s highest court, Chief Justice Kate M. Fox said in a statement Tuesday. Davis served as chief justice for three years, stepping down from that role July 1. He was a state district judge for four years before being named to the Supreme Court. He previously was an attorney in private practice. He graduated with honors from the University of Wyoming law school in 1980. Former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, named all five current justices over his two terms in office. Gordon, also a Republican, will choose the next justice from a list of three names submitted to him by the state Judicial Nominating Commission. The commission plans to accept expressions of interest from qualified people through Oct. 1. Wyoming requires Supreme Court justices to be at least 30, “learned in the law,” a judge or attorney for at least nine years, a U.S. citizen and a Wyoming resident for at least three years.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/09/06/the-worlds-most-important-event-every-year-since-1920/113604790/", "title": "History: The world's most important event every year since 1920", "text": "Angelo Young and John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nOver the past 100 years, we’ve witnessed some of the most profound changes in human history.\n\nBetween a pandemic, wars, technological developments, progress in civil rights, and breakthroughs in science and medicine, the old order has been swept away, sometimes giving way to freer forms of governing and sometimes not.\n\nCenturies-old empires crumbled as new ideologies – from communism to fascism – took root in many parts of the world. Wars in the early part of the 20th century led to the end of the colonial world and gave birth to new nations. These wars also cost millions of lives and trillions of dollars. These are the most expensive wars in U.S. history.\n\nThroughout the past century, technological innovations transformed our lives in ways we never dreamed. Progressive ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, African Americans, and the LGBTQ community demanded, and often won, equal rights – from the ratification of the 19th Amendment in the United States to the legalization of same-sex marriage in many countries around the world. Even so, recent civil rights protests tell us the fight for equality is not over.\n\nDunkin' or Starbucks:Among America's favorite brew-at-home coffee brands, which comes out ahead?\n\nPlanes, phones and automobiles:These are the top-selling products from each state in the US\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that is ravaging the world in 2020 reminds us that for all of our scientific breakthroughs, we’re still vulnerable to deadly viruses that can shut down economies and disrupt society. People are hoping science can save Earth from the devastating changes to the climate that continue to imperil the ecosystems of our planet. In the coming years, natural disasters may have an increasingly impactful role on the course of history. Here are 26 disaster scenarios caused by climate change.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Tempo drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list. Deciding the most important event in a given year is by its nature a subjective exercise. In reaching our decisions, we chose the event that had the most far-reaching impact, even if it was not necessarily the most famous event in a given year.\n\nThe world's most important event every year since 1920\n\n1920: Women's Suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population – in the beginning only white landowning males over the age of 21 – could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution was passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots, though the voting rights fight was far from over for many African American women, especially in the South.\n\n1921: Chinese Communists Rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire Shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto Earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes Monkey Trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist and former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,498 in 2020 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would rule that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. Starts Numbered Highway System\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh Nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the first person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop, making him one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany’s aircraft industry. Also, his infant son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart Crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street Crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve, and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh Rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building Completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nU.S. President Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler Becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR Elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler Consolidates Power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR Launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens Flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 400-meter relay.\n\n1937: UAW Changes Car Industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism Surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes, and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II Starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's Founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald’s Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches, and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes, and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu, and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald’s into one of the world’s largest restaurant chains.\n\n1941: Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed. The United States declares war on Japan the next day and three days later against Germany and Italy.\n\n1942: GIs Arrive in Europe\n\n• Date: Jan. 26\n\n• Location: Northern Ireland\n\nThe first U.S. troops destined to fight in Europe in the world's greatest war arrive in Northern Ireland. It is the beginning of a military buildup that would culminate in the invasion of France more than two years later. Before then, the United States was providing only material support to its ally across the Atlantic, while building up what President Roosevelt called the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" in anticipation for the inevitable entry of the United States into the war in Europe.\n\n1943: Invention of LSD\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Basel, Switzerland\n\nSwiss chemist Albert Hoffman had been studying the potential medicinal value of lysergic compounds when he accidentally exposed himself to LSD-25, which he had created years earlier in his lab. This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier. The plan is conceived during the Quebec Conference by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. The invasion starts at 6:30 a.m. on five beaches, and over the next 24 hours about 4,900 Allied soldiers are killed, many of them the instant the doors of their Higgins transport boats opened directly into German machine gun fire.\n\n1945: World War II Ends\n\n• Date: Sept. 2\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe surrender of Japan marks the end of World War II amid one of the most tumultuous years of the 20th century. Earlier in the year, leaders of three nations – Benito Mussolini, Franklin Roosevelt, and Adolf Hitler – die and Nazi Germany surrenders. Though the surrender of Japan was inevitable, the prospect of a horrific Allied assault on the Japanese mainland convinces the United States to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic bomb attacks, along with the entry of the Soviet Union in the war against Japan, compel the Japanese to surrender.\n\n1946: Baby Boom Starts\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nMore American babies are born – 3.4 million – in 1946 than in any year in U.S. history up to then. The number of births grows to 4 million per year from 1954 to 1964, the last year of the baby boomer generation, the biggest generation at that point in history.\n\n1947: India Gains Independence\n\n• Date: Aug. 15\n\n• Location: Washington D.C\n\nThe sun sets on the British Empire in India in 1947, as the Asian nation becomes the world's largest democracy. Independence is the culmination of decades of work by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indian nationalists committed to throwing off the yoke of British colonialism. The transition to independence comes at a price. The subcontinent is partitioned into two nations, Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Violence erupts between Hindus and Muslims as Hindus migrate to India and Muslims shift to Pakistan. It is estimated that 1 million people die during the migration.\n\n1948: Birth of Israel\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: Middle East\n\nAfter Israel declares its independence following a UN resolution, neighboring Arab states with troops from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia attack the former British-controlled Palestinian mandate. The Arab-Israeli War ended with an armistice that leaves Israel with some territories as Egypt and Jordan retains control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, respectively.\n\n1949: NATO Founded\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nWith the Cold War worsening, the Soviet Union detonates its first nuclear bomb and quickly exerts its influence over Eastern Europe. It attempts to do the same in Western Europe, which is still recovering from the massive destruction of World War II. To respond to the Soviet threat, U.S. and Western European allies form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Fundamentally, NATO simply states that an attack on any NATO member would be considered an attack on all NATO members.

Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast.

And in “typical Musk fashion”, the billionaire – who bought the online social media platform for $43bn last year – tweeted a meme noting the change.\n\nThat was soon followed by another tweet, which revealed the logo change as an apparent call-back to when a Twitter user suggested Musk buy the company and change the logo. “As promised”, tweeted Musk, who also included a screenshot of the original interaction in March 2022.\n\n\n\nWhile most Twitter users appear to agree that the change is “a strange, weird, unfunny thing to do”, said Mashable, it could now be “par for the course with Musk’s version of Twitter”.\n\nFar from a joke, however, is the lawsuit recently filed against Musk in New York, “accusing him of engaging in racketeering by promoting Dogecoin”, reported Variety.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Musk’s legal team filed a motion on 31 March to have the lawsuit dismissed. The plaintiffs in the case, dogecoin investors, are suing Musk for $258bn in damages after they accused him of “deliberately driving up Dogecoin’s price more than 36,000% over two years and then letting it crash”, said the news site.\n\nThey said this generated “billions of dollars of profit at other Dogecoin investors’ expense, even as Musk knew the currency lacked intrinsic value”.\n\nAmong other complaints, investors pointed to his hosting stint on US comedy show Saturday Night Live, where he portrayed a fake financial expert who called dogecoin a “hustle”.\n\nBut according to the filing by Musk’s lawyers, the plaintiffs in the case have not shown how Musk’s frequent references to dogecoin – which saw him nicknamed “The Dogefather” by some netizens, according to NPR – defrauded anyone nor have they explained what risks Musk is alleged to have hidden from investors.\n\nThe price of dogecoin “spiked by about 30%” on Monday after the logo change was made, said NPR.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/960370/quiz-of-the-week-1-6-april", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 1 - 6 April | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

So far, they have kept reaching for their wallets. But what happens when they reach their breaking point?\n\nThe pandemic and the supply chain crisis have pushed the cost of virtually everything higher. Food and cars are more expensive, as are transport and labor costs, making inflation the buzzword of the moment.\n\nIn February, consumer prices increased at a level not seen since the start of 1982. And odds are it won’t stop there.\n\n“A month ago, we were generally looking at inflation that was primarily in areas that you were spending more on because of the pandemic,” such as cars, housing and home renovations, said Frances Donald, global chief economist and strategist at Manulife Investment Management. “These were more optional types of inflation.”\n\nAfter a year of soaring costs, the Ukraine-Russia conflict is pushing prices for more essential categories, like food and energy, up even more.\n\nThe price hikes Americans are likely to experience in the coming months will be much harder to get around, Donald said.\n\n“We don’t see a lot of what economists call elasticity when it comes to demand for fuel and food. We don’t have a choice. You can’t not eat. You can’t not drive to work,” she said.\n\nGas and food prices on the rise\n\nThe cost of cooking dinner and fueling the car have already shot up over the past year. Gasoline prices rose 38% in the 12 months ended February, while prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs jumped 13% over the same period, according to Labor Department data.\n\nNow gas prices are rising even further and people are struggling to keep up.\n\n“I try to catch the weekend sales and freeze meat,” Kathy LeGoux, who lives in Palm Coast, Florida, with her husband, told CNN Business. “[I] can’t buy a lot of fish because it’s too expensive now.”\n\nLeGoux, who is in her 60s, is retired, as is her husband. A high cost of living made them move from Nevada to Florida before the pandemic. But the high prices have followed them, she said.\n\nRetirees and others who live on fixed incomes get hit especially hard when prices go up like they have recently.\n\nLeGoux and her husband have postponed home improvement projects and no longer go on road trips, due to the cost of fuel.\n\n“And the gas price rolls into food prices,” she said. “We’re not even talking about inflation any more here. It’s more.”\n\nSoaring food prices are a difficult problem to solve, according to Donald, especially when it’s really a problem of global supply. Russia and Ukraine are huge exporters of grain and fertilizer. With trade hamstrung by the conflict, the global food supply chain has already started to feel the pain.\n\n“The greatest risk facing global supply chains has shifted from the pandemic to the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the geopolitical and economic uncertainties it has created,” Moody’s Analytics economist Tim Uy wrote in a report Thursday.\n\nFor governments and central banks around the world, this is a new challenge for which typical policy changes that were used to fight inflation in the past might not prove as useful. The Federal Reserve’s plan to raise interest rates and combat pandemic inflation, for example, will do little to change the dynamics of the global food supply. That also means it won’t help the financial pain many Americans will feel as prices keep going up.\n\nConsumers’ breaking point\n\nThere is some good news: American households are better funded than in previous crises, which should help them absorb some of the price increases. During the pandemic, stimulus checks and altered spending patterns helped many households shore up their savings.\n\nBut the more price spikes affect necessary products and services, people will need to reach deeper into their wallets, putting a strain on household finances. This will be particularly hard for lower-income Americans, who don’t have excess savings as a result of the pandemic and for whom gas and energy costs generally make up a larger portion of their spending.\n\n“A 10% increase in oil prices would shave 0.2% from discretionary spending,” assuming a one-for-one response from consumers, said Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska.\n\nSince the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, US oil prices have risen more than 11%.\n\nThat matters because consumer spending is the single most important driver of US economic growth. If people have less money to spend outside of necessities, that could weigh on economic growth this year.\n\nEven though the pandemic recession is firmly in the rearview mirror by now, economists are growing concerned the US could be heading toward a period of stagflation, during which low economic growth and high prices limit consumer spending.\n\nIn short, the inflation situation is a headache for lawmakers and the American people alike.\n\nMeanwhile, questions are arising about the record profits companies have been reeling in during this time of high prices. Last week, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the matter, showing some lawmakers are clearly concerned about corporate profiteering at the expense of working people who are seeing their hard earned money afford less and less.\n\nSo far surging prices haven’t driven customers away from their favorite stores, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the future.\n\nCoca-Cola (COKE) CEO James Quincey said in February that consumers will only accept higher prices for so long. And rising gas prices could push people to their breaking point – if they’re not already there. When household finances become strained, nonessential items and big-name brands with a cheaper alternative are the first to go.\n\n“It’s easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up,” he said at the time. “It’s much harder when there’s a real squeeze on income.”", "authors": ["Anneken Tappe"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}]}

Wade is sounding alarms for an unexpected part of the population: people looking to get pregnant and the doctors who are helping them.\n\nThe conservative justices, according to a draft majority opinion disclosed last week, are preparing to give states the full power to determine abortion policies within their borders. Experts say that could open up the legal terrain for states to interfere with the fertility process known as in vitro fertilization, in which a sperm fertilizes an egg outside the body.\n\nIn interviews with CNN, doctors who work in the fertility field, and academics who study the legal landscape around it, say there is grave uncertainty – both about how abortion laws already on the books will be interpreted and about how lawmakers and local prosecutors may seek to push the envelope, freed from the precedents that have effectively shielded the fertility process from government meddling. That lack of clarity, it is feared, will affect the treatments doctors are willing to offer IVF patients and the decisions people will have to make about how to pursue growing their families.\n\nThe anxiety was evident in an urgent bulletin from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine sent hours after the draft opinion was published, warning that “measures designed to restrict abortion could end up also curtailing access to the family building treatments upon which our infertility patients rely to build their families,” society President Dr. Marcelle Cedars wrote.\n\nThere are multiple stages of the fertility process that – without the Supreme Court’s current legal protections for abortion rights, which have been in place for 49 years– could be vulnerable to government interference, according to Seema Mohapatra, a law professor at SMU Dedman School of Law who specializes in assisted reproduction.\n\n“It really does have these practical effects where, because of the lack of protection of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, you actually might not be able to have this wanted child that you’ve been paying all this money and going through this physical process in order to have,” she said.\n\nAbout 2 in every 100 children born in the US are conceived through IVF, according to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“We are dangling in the wind right now,” one Midwestern reproductive endocrinologist told CNN about the uncertainty looming. The doctor spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their practice and the uncertain future of procedures like IVF in their state.\n\nA focus of the concern is how some states with anti-abortion trigger laws, like Tennessee, Arkansas and Kentucky, already define embryos as unborn children at the moment of fertilization – a stance that may provide a starting point for legislators to interfere with the IVF process.\n\n“States have already taken the liberty of having these expansive definitions. They just couldn’t really enforce them the way they wanted to because Roe and Casey stood in the way,” Rutgers Law School Dean and professor Kimberly Mutcherson said, referring to the 1973 and 1992 Supreme Court abortion precedents. But if Roe and Casey are overturned, Mutcherson said, that would effectively be the Supreme Court saying: “Do what you want to do, states!”\n\n“And that’s a pretty wild place to be in,” she said.\n\nIn Louisiana, legislators are already moving in a bold direction. Lawmakers advanced a bill last week that would criminalize abortion in the state and grant constitutional rights to “all unborn children from the moment of fertilization.” Notably, that bill would remove language in current Louisiana law that refers to the “implantation” of the fertilized egg before it is considered a person.\n\n“A bill like the one that’s proposed in Louisiana would prohibit IVF in that state, and that’s something we’re extremely worried about,” Dr. Natalie Crawford of FORA Fertility in Austin, Texas, told CNN. “We don’t think people understand the repercussions from some of these proposed bills.”\n\n‘It’s a process of conception, not a moment’\n\nWhen an individual or couple undergoes the IVF process, the work begins in a lab, where a sperm fertilizes an egg after weeks of preparation. The goal is to ultimately transfer a healthy embryo into a person’s uterus. But first, the embryo must grow to blastocyst stage, which typically occurs between five and seven days after fertilization.\n\n“It’s a process of conception,” the Midwestern doctor said. “Not a moment.”\n\nIVF clinics typically use two people’s genetic material to create multiple embryos because they don’t know which ones will grow to the right stage or which ones will result in a successful pregnancy.\n\n“The goal is generally to make as many embryos as possible,” the doctor explained. “That’s because, on average, half of all embryos are chromosomally abnormal.” These abnormalities can result in conditions like Down syndrome and trisomy 18 or may prevent the embryo from becoming a healthy pregnancy. Clinics and/or clients typically choose to discard them rather than implant them.\n\nThat creation of multiple embryos is where IVF clinics see potential legal trouble on the horizon. If a state defines an unborn child as existing at the moment of fertilization, clinics could violate the law by discarding chromosomally abnormal embryos or by terminating a pregnancy where multiple embryos have been implanted.\n\n“The chances of a successful IVF cycle aren’t that high, so doctors will often implant multiple embryos to maximize the odds at least one pregnancy comes to term,” said Mary Ziegler, a visiting Harvard Law professor who writes extensively on abortion issues. “Sometimes, to maximize the chances a pregnancy comes to term, some of those pregnancies are terminated. A lot of people in the anti-abortion movement look at that and say that’s abortion.”\n\nIndividuals who undergo IVF may also choose to freeze unused embryos for later use, or for backup if a pregnancy is ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n“There’s always extra embryos,” Mohapatra said. “You don’t know if it’s going to take on the first cycle.”\n\nCrawford posted a lengthy thread on Twitter highlighting how restrictive abortion laws in several states could be detrimental to IVF, explaining that the process to “fertilize eggs, freeze embryos, test embryos, and transfer/discard embryos … is essential for safe, accessible and effective IVF care.” Crawford continued, “The fear is that when Roe is overturned states will then individually decide their stance on this matter … if life begins legally at fertilization – then we are limited in the above technology.”\n\n‘What do I tell these patients?’\n\nThere’s no clear indication at this point if individual state legislatures will extend their abortion bans to explicitly apply to the IVF process. But ambiguity in how future abortion bans might be interpreted – particularly in a legal landscape where enforcement decisions could be made by individual prosecutors – is forcing those in the field to scrutinize what is possible.\n\n“If I were at an IVF clinic, we would be wasting a lot of hours debating, ‘What does this mean? What do we have to do? How do we protect our patients?’ ” asked Katie Watson, a bioethicist and lawyer who is an associate professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “So the chilling effect and the limitations on the smart practice of medicine will be significant even if it’s not what legislators intended.”\n\nThe Midwestern doctor who regularly sees patients battling infertility says the office phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about what a post-Roe world would mean for their reproductive journeys.\n\n“Receptionists have asked me, ‘What do I tell these patients?’ ” the doctor said, adding that it’s been hard to give a definitive answer.\n\nPart of the unknown is fueled by the discretion that individual prosecutors will have in enforcing abortion law.\n\n“All it takes in any event is a rogue prosecutor who wants to be aggressive in his or her interpretation of the law, and that could certainly create issues for those seeking IVF,” Kim Clark, senior attorney for Reproductive Rights, Health and Justice at the progressive advocacy organization Legal Voice.\n\nAnother complicating factor is what role civil enforcement measures – like the Texas six-week ban, allowing individual citizens to file lawsuits against anyone who facilitates a procedure prohibited by the ban – will play in the post-Roe world.\n\n“When you have these citizen enforcement statutes, suddenly any random neighbor who says a blastocyst is a [person] can sue that clinic, and that’s where the chilling is phenomenal,” Watson said.\n\nOne thing is clear, however. If Roe is erased, an array of measures targeting IVF could “much more easily move forward,” according to Judith Daar, the dean at Northern Kentucky University-Salmon P. Chase College of Law, who formerly chaired the ethics committee for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.\n\n“The reversal of Roe could motivate and certainly pave the way for new legislation that could specifically target IVF,” she said, while suggesting that states could, for instance, eventually ban the genetic testing that is now regularly performed on embryos to spot abnormalities before they’re implanted.\n\nMutcherson said fertility patients may seek to take proactive action, like move their embryos out of states expected to be hostile to abortion.\n\n“The question really now is are there things that people should be doing to protect themselves before laws start to change?” Mutcherson said.", "authors": ["Jessica Schneider Tierney Sneed", "Jessica Schneider", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/health/pregnancy-antidepressant-use-wellness/index.html", "title": "Antidepressant use during pregnancy doesn't harm child ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nExpectant mothers taking many common antidepressants need no longer worry the medication may harm their child’s future behavioral or cognitive neurodevelopment, according to a new study of over 145,000 women and their children across the United States followed for up to 14 years.\n\n“Results of previous studies on this topic have presented conflicting results. Due to our large population size and careful study design, we believe that our study offers clarity that could help patients and providers make treatment decisions in pregnancy,” said study author Elizabeth Suarez, an instructor at the Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Treatment Sciences at the Rutgers Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research.\n\nAntidepressant use during pregnancy was not associated with autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioral disorders, developmental speech, language, learning and coordination disorders or intellectual disabilities, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\n“We believe these results are reassuring when it comes to concerns about the potential effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children, especially for diagnoses that may be of greater concern to expectant parents like autism spectrum disorder,” Suarez said via email.\n\n“This is truly an important paper. Women and health professionals are often concerned about antidepressants in pregnancy, and sometimes decide to suddenly stop these medications as soon as pregnancy becomes known,” said Carmine Pariante, professor of biological psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London, in a statement.\n\nInstead, women with depression and other mental conditions for which antidepressants are prescribed should be told the risk in pregnancy “is not as high as previously thought,” said Pariante, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“I am grateful for this study,” Dr. Tiffany Moore Simas, a member of the Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines on Obstetrics for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CNN via email.\n\n“One in 5 perinatal individuals will experience a mental health condition,” said Moore Simas, who was not involved in the study. “We must stop shaming them for doing what is needed to care for themselves. Healthy babies need healthy mothers.”\n\nA controversial topic\n\nNumerous studies over the decades have found associations between antidepressant use during pregnancy and developmental concerns in children, predominately autism and ADHD. But newer research has called the quality of that prior research into question. Many older studies were observational in nature and often failed to control for contributing factors such as obesity and other health conditions, environmental toxins, inflammation and even maternal stress.\n\nOlder research also failed to consider the impact on a developing fetus carried by a mother with uncontrolled depression, anxiety or another psychiatric disorder. Not treating a mother’s mental disorder has also been linked to “stillbirth, preterm birth, growth restriction and birthweight weight issues, impaired bonding, adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, and increased risk of offspring mental health,” Moore Simas said.\n\nDepressed women can also miss prenatal visits, skip meals, overuse alcohol or cigarettes, and in general fail to care for their growing fetus as they fail to care for themselves, experts say.\n\nA very small number of antidepressants have been linked to an increased risk of birth defects, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so pregnant women should discuss their medication with their doctors.\n\n“We did not consider other potential adverse outcomes in our study. Our results for neurodevelopmental disorders should be weighed with the risk of other outcomes – such as a potential small increase in risk of preterm birth – and the benefits of treatment,” Suarez said.\n\nDespite the advance of knowledge showing little to any impact from most common antidepressants, many physicians and mothers-to-be are still wary of their use, Moore Simas said.\n\nConsultations between pregnant people and their doctors regarding antidepressant use are often “framed in the context of the risk of the medications – despite the data overall being reassuring,” she said. “Conversations about medication use for mental health in pregnancy or otherwise needs to account for the risk of untreated disease.”\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists meets regularly to update guidance on medications that are safe to use during pregnancy, a spokesperson told CNN, and will be reviewing recent research such as this new study.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/01/12/fact-check-vaccination-helped-eliminate-smallpox/4124284001/", "title": "Fact check: Vaccination helped eliminate smallpox", "text": "The claim: Smallpox killed more than 300 million in the 20th century, was defeated through vaccination\n\nVaccination has become a much talked about topic since the COVID-19 pandemic and one Facebook post is singing its praises.\n\n\"Smallpox killed more than 300 million people in the 20th century alone,\" claims Rico Blanco in a Jan. 1 Facebook post.\n\nBlanco states smallpox was never defeated with herd immunity — the phenomenon when immunized people within a community or population protect those who lack immunity, essentially serving as human bulwarks against disease transmission — only through vaccination.\n\nSimilar Facebook posts have also made the case vaccination was responsible for eliminating the deadly disease, which they claim killed \"3 out of every 10 people.\"\n\nMore:Fact check: What's true and what's false about the COVID-19 vaccine\n\nWhat is smallpox?\n\nSmallpox is a highly contagious and lethal infection caused by the variola virus, part of the orthopoxvirus family whose members include cowpox, monkeypox and camelpox.\n\nThe virus specifically infects humans and spreads primarily through inhaled respiratory droplets released while sneezing, talking or coughing. Smallpox gets comfortable inside its unwitting host for a week or two — known as the incubation period — before rashes appear all over the body, known as the eruptive stage. These raised, pus-filled rashes develop over a course of 10 days, giving the skin the appearance of bubble wrap.\n\nToward the later stages of infection, the rashes scab over and slough off. Survivors are left with pockmarks and scarring, particularly on the face since it has the highest concentration of oil-producing sebaceous glands. Other aftereffects include infertility in men, stillbirths and miscarriage in infected pregnant women, infections of the bones or brain, and blindness in rare instances, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMore:Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine mandates don't violate US employment law\n\nSmallpox in antiquity\n\nSmallpox itself is ancient, with historians speculating it first appeared around 10,000 B.C. in northeastern Africa, although evidence suggests it emerged 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. The virus spreads with its human hosts, through trade, war and later colonization, reaching the Americas via the Spanish and Portuguese by the 1500s.\n\nIt is estimated nearly 400,000 people died from smallpox annually in Europe by the end of the 18th century and 300 million in the 20th century alone, as the Facebook post claimed.\n\nDespite the tremendous death toll, people were not completely defenseless. Accounts of the 430 B.C. plague of Athens by Greek historian Thucydides mention those who initially survived smallpox appeared immune to subsequent infection. These survivors were often called upon to nurse the sick whenever any new epidemic struck.\n\nIn the 10th century, this observed immunity gave rise to a rudimentary vaccination method believed developed independently by Chinese and Indian physicians. Variolation, as the method came to be known, involved pulverizing smallpox scabs or pus from an infected individual to be sniffed up the nose or scratched into the skin.\n\nWhile the practice did confer immunity, recipients ran the risk of contracting smallpox themselves, albeit a milder form of the disease, and even causing epidemics. From the procedure, 1%-2% of variolated individuals died, compared to 30% after naturally contracting smallpox.\n\nMore:Fact check: Doctors say Hilary Duff likely didn't contract pink eye from COVID-19 tests\n\nA little help from a cow\n\nVariolation remained an important practice throughout Asia and Africa, reaching Europe and the New World colonies by the early 18th century, where it was first used to stop the Boston smallpox epidemic of 1721.\n\nIn the late 18th century, English physician Edward Jenner arrived at the observation that dairymaids were protected against smallpox because of their contact with cowpox, a now rare, self-limiting disease transmitted through lesions on the udder and teats to humans. Jenner postulated that to confer biological protection, much like with variolation, cowpox could be deliberately acquired through some sort of inoculation.\n\nIn May 1796, Jenner collected pus from the fresh scabs of a young dairymaid recently infected with cowpox and injected it into a 8-year-old boy. While testing what was essentially a live vaccine — a vaccine containing a weakened or attenuated form of a virus — on a human subject is ethically disconcerting, the young boy did not develop smallpox when injected with it six weeks later.\n\nVaccination, as the practice eventually came to be known, from the Latin for cow or vacca, was considered a groundbreaking medical discovery, gaining acceptance throughout Europe and paving the road for future vaccines. In the U.S., Jennerian vaccination was encouraged partly thanks to Thomas Jefferson, who conducted small vaccine trials himself and made it one of the new nation's first health priorities when elected president in 1801.\n\nMore:Fact check: Pregnant women do receive vaccines, but more study needed on COVID-19 shot\n\nSmallpox in the 20th century and beyond\n\nThere were some hiccups in smallpox vaccination as the 19th century progressed — moral stigmatization due to cases of syphilis inadvertently transmitted with vaccination, the scarce availability of infected animal sources, the discovery that smallpox immunity was not lifelong and required revaccination, to name a few. But by the end of World War II, smallpox was eradicated throughout Europe and North America.\n\nElsewhere, smallpox remained endemic in less developed regions like South America, West and East Africa, India and Indonesia. The Pan American Sanitary Organization, part of the World Health Organization, initiated a smallpox eradication program in 1950, which successfully eliminated the virus in all countries of the Americas except for Brazil. Years later, a global vaccination effort by the WHO implemented in 1959, at the behest of the Soviet Union, and again in 1967 wiped out smallpox in 31 countries.\n\nThere would be two more outbreaks and isolated cases of smallpox before the WHO would declare \"the world and all its people have won freedom from smallpox\" in May 1980. One of those outbreaks — the New York City smallpox outbreak of 1947 — has stood as a poignant example of swift public health planning: After an American businessman unwittingly brought the virus with him from Mexico City, those he had come in contact with were vaccinated, as well as over 6 million New Yorkers, in a span of less than a month.\n\nMore:Fact check: Improper use of COVID-19 test gives false positive for Coca-Cola\n\nEffective herd immunity depends on vaccination\n\nBecause immunity varies with age and not everyone can get vaccinated — such as those who are immunocompromised, have specific allergies or pregnant women with certain types of vaccines — herd immunity is a crucial protective phenomenon.\n\nTo establish it, one important factor is the number of immunized people within a population has to be at a certain percentage or threshold. According to the WHO, this figure was eight out of every 10 people for smallpox, based on its early eradication effort.\n\nAnd because pathogens are not confined by geographical borders, this 80% immunization or higher is not a threshold restricted to one population — it has to be shared by all, whether at a local, national or global level. This means if any populations have vaccination rates below the threshold, there is a great risk for disease transmission to other unvaccinated or vulnerable individuals, even in populations with adequate herd immunity, such as in the case with measles outbreaks in recent years.\n\nFor smallpox, this homogeneity in vaccination rates across varying populations was only successfully achieved with mass smallpox vaccination, as claimed by the Facebook post.\n\nA second important determinant for herd immunity is how long biological immunity against a pathogen lasts. While immunological memory forms with every new infectious encounter, this can fade over time, which is why booster shots are typically given. Smallpox immunity unfortunately does decline — after five to 10 years — but it is believed vaccinated individuals still have some protection against fatal outcomes should an outbreak, in the very rare event, reappear.\n\nRoutine smallpox vaccination in the U.S. was stopped in 1972, after it was declared eradicated. The CDC only recommends the vaccine to lab workers who work with smallpox or smallpox-like viruses, and to those who need long-term protection like military personnel.\n\nOur ruling: True\n\nWe rate the claim that smallpox, which killed 300 million people in the 20th century alone and was eliminated through vaccination, not herd immunity, as TRUE, as it is supported by our research. Smallpox is an ancient virus. The first vaccine created by Edward Jenner in the late 18th century helped control disease transmission and, two centuries later, eliminate smallpox worldwide, thanks to a global eradication effort implemented by the World Health Organization. Herd immunity, the phenomenon when immunized people within a community or population protect those who lack immunity by preventing disease transmission, is not possible unless a certain percentage or threshold of immunity is held uniformly across a population. For smallpox, this uniformity has only been achieved successfully through vaccination and not through any natural occurrence of herd immunity.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Black women may be more affected due to higher use of the products, the researchers noted.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, estimates that among women who did not use hair-straightening chemical products in the past 12 months, 1.6% developed uterine cancer by age 70, but about 4% of the women who frequently use such hair-straightening products developed uterine cancer by age 70.\n\nThat finding “also communicates that uterine cancer is indeed rare. However, the doubling of risk does lead to some concern,” said Chandra Jackson, an author of the study and researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n\n“In this study, women with frequent use in the past year had an over two-fold higher risk of uterine cancer,” she said. Frequent use was defined as more than four times in the previous year.\n\nCancer risk was most pronounced in Black women\n\nThe new study includes data on nearly 34,000 women in the United States, ages 35 to 74, who completed questionnaires about their use of certain hair products, including perms, dyes, relaxers and straighteners. The researchers, from the National Institutes of Health, also tracked the incidence of cancer diagnoses within the study group.\n\nThe researchers found a strong association between hair straightening products and uterine cancer cases but the use of other hair products – such as dyes and perms or body waves – was not associated with uterine cancer.\n\nThe study data also showed that the association between hair straightening products and uterine cancer cases was most pronounced for Black women, who made up only 7.4% of the study participants, but 59.9% of those who reported ever using straighteners.\n\nSeveral factors likely play a role in the frequent use of hair straightening products: Eurocentric standards of beauty, social pressures placed on Black and Latina women in workplace settings related to microaggressions and the threat of discrimination, along with desired versatility in changing hairstyles and self-expression.\n\n“The bottom line is that the exposure burden appears higher among Black women,” Jackson said.\n\n“Based off of the body of the literature in this area, we know that hair products marketed directly to Black children and women have been shown to contain multiple chemicals associated with disrupting hormones, and these products marketed to Black women have also been shown to have harsher chemical formulations,” she said. “On top of that, we know that Black women tend to use multiple products simultaneously, which could contribute to Black women on average having higher concentrations of these hormone-disrupting chemicals in their system.”\n\nThe researchers did not collect information on brands or ingredients in the hair products the women used, but they wrote in the paper that several chemicals identified in straighteners could contribute to the increased incidence of uterine cancer observed in their study.\n\n“To our knowledge this is the first epidemiologic study that examined the relationship between straightener use and uterine cancer,” Alexandra White, head of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group and lead author on the study, said in a news release Monday.\n\n“More research is needed to confirm these findings in different populations, to determine if hair products contribute to health disparities in uterine cancer, and to identify the specific chemicals that may be increasing the risk of cancers in women.”\n\n‘A new and growing area of research’\n\nSome substances found in hair-straightening products, especially those most used by and marketed to Black and Latina women, are hormone-disrupting chemicals, said Tamarra James-Todd, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new study but separately has led some of the earliest research finding links between hair products and cancer.\n\n“They modify our body’s normal hormonal processes. So, it makes sense to look at cancers that are hormonally mediated,” she said, adding that hormone-disrupting chemicals could impact other parts of the body too.\n\n“​The challenge is that the impact of these chemicals might not be limited to hormonal processes, but they could also impact other systems, including our immune and vascular systems. Understanding how these chemicals work beyond the hormonal system is still a new and growing area of research,” James-Todd told CNN.\n\n“So, it could be that the way these chemicals are operating is through altering ​not only hormonal responses, but also by altering immune or even vascular responses,” she said. “All of these processes are linked to cancer.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhile the new study is “well done” and shows an association between hair-straightening chemical products and increased uterine cancer risk, it is unable to determine that the products directly cause the cancer, Dr. Otis Brawley, professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and former chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said in an email to CNN.\n\n“It is unable to show cause, it could be pure association,” said Brawley, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nYet “the question how do we settle this is difficult. The scientific ideal is a randomized trial of 40,000 or so; 20,000 with regular hair straightener use and 20,000 never using it and never having used it and follow them for 20 years,” he said, adding that at this point, “it’s impossible for science to answer better than” the recent study.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/02/27/falling-sperm-counts-threaten-humanity-chemicals-blame-book-says/6842950002/", "title": "Falling sperm counts threaten humanity; chemicals to blame, book ...", "text": "Humanity is facing not only a coronavirus pandemic and a climate crisis, but its existence is also threatened by falling sperm counts because of chemical exposures, a prominent epidemiologist warns in a new book.\n\n\"Chemicals in our environment and other lifestyle factors in our modern age have harmed our reproductive health to the extent that, in the future, it may not be possible for most people to reproduce in the old-fashioned way,\" said Shanna Swan, an environmental and reproductive epidemiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York with more than four decades of experience in the field.\n\nSperm counts among men in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand declined more than 59% from 1973 to 2011, according to a meta-analysis Swan co-wrote in 2017.

These \"endocrine-disrupting chemicals\" include chemicals that are water-soluble and wash out of our bodies, such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), as well as \"forever chemicals\" that do not degrade, such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\n\nForever chemicals:Toxic 'forever chemicals' found in drinking water throughout US\n\nLatest COVID-19 updates:US administers about 2.4 million shots in a day, a new high; Johnson & Johnson vaccine expected to be authorized\n\nThe chemicals enter our bodies through foods and drink, microscopic airborne particles we inhale, and in the products we absorb through our skin, Swan said. They're found in plastic and vinyl, floor and wall coverings, medical tubing and medical devices, children's toys, nail polishes, perfumes, hair sprays, soaps, shampoos and more.\n\nPhthalates, for example, are commonly consumed through foods, she said.\n\n\"They’re added to plastic to make them soft and squishy – think shower curtains, rubber duckies, soft tubing. The processed food we eat passes through soft tubing to get into its packaging. When these chemicals in the plastic come in contact with food, the phthalates leave the plastic and leach into the food. When we eat the food, they get into our bodies,\" she said.\n\nEndocrine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with hormones in several different ways. Phthalates may \"trick the body\" into thinking it has more testosterone than it actually does, causing the body to stop producing testosterone and increasing the chances the man will be infertile or have a lower sperm count, Swan said.\n\nDr. Pat Hunt, a geneticist at the Washington State University School of Molecular Biosciences, has been studying the effect of chemical exposures on male and female fertility since a laboratory accident in 1998 alerted her to the harmful effects of household products.\n\n\"Over the years, I've watched the opinions of my scientific colleagues change as the evidence has become increasingly convincing,\" Hunt said. \"There’s no question that sperm counts have fallen. The hypothesis that sperm counts have fallen due to exposure to these chemicals has also gained more and more credence.\"\n\nSome trade groups, however, question the connection between endocrine-disrupting chemicals and adverse health outcomes, and some scientists have criticized studies for a lack of evidence demonstrating a direct causation between the two.\n\nVinyl Verified, an organization working to promote public perception of vinyl, writes on its website that \"a select number of competitive interests and agenda-driven activists have advanced a dishonest campaign to mislead consumers, and deny them their right to make their own decisions about vinyl.\"\n\nAnd some scientists question whether sperm counts are falling at all. Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at Britain’s University of Sheffield, said that while he believes prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals can affect male fetal development, he remains \"unconvinced by the data which suggests that sperm counts have fallen worldwide because of this.\"\n\n\"I think science and medicine has accepted this hypothesis uncritically,\" Pacey said. \"Extraordinary claims generally require extraordinary evidence – however, apparently not in this case.\"\n\nPacey takes issue with the way scientists have reached their conclusions – by conducting retrospective analyses of semen analysis data performed in the past. Pacey said this method of analysis is \"weak\" because the methods of laboratory andrology, such as training, have changed over time.\n\nThe 2017 study Swan co-wrote was \"an improvement\" because it used more control measures, but the study still not did present \"extraordinary evidence,\" Pacey said. \"I cannot prove this, but neither can they.\"\n\nLinda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences as well as the National Toxicology Program, said the 2017 study was \"impressive\" and noted Swan's work also draws on studies in animals, boys and young men.\n\n\"There are repeated studies by different investigators in different locations that support that sperm counts are falling,\" Birnbaum said. \"It’s complex what might be causing it. I don’t think there’s any one thing. But I do think endocrine-disrupting chemicals one part of the puzzle.\"\n\n'People are not choosing to lower their sperm count'\n\nWorldwide fertility dropped by 50% from 1960 to 2015, Swan writes. She acknowledges a host of socioeconomic factors are contributing to the decline, such as people choosing to have children later in life and having smaller families.\n\nBut what's surprising is that fertility is dropping across age groups, Swan writes. Not only are sperm counts in men gradually declining, but boys are also seeing higher rates of genital abnormalities. Among women, the risk of miscarriage has been rising across all ages.\n\n\"Part of this picture has an element of choice in it, and part of it doesn’t,\" Swan said. \"People are not choosing to lower their sperm count.\"\n\nLifestyle factors – including diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol or drug use – can alter hormone levels and are playing a role in the decline, Swan said. But Swan said she's most concerned about chemical exposures, particularly for pregnant women and children.\n\n\"The other lifestyle factors matter in a transient way,\" Swan said. \"The reason I’m so focused on these early exposures to endocrine disruptors is because that’s never going to change, and it’s going to be passed on to later generations. They’re much more important to the story, although they’re much less easy to control.\"\n\nEndocrine-disrupting chemicals don't just affect reproductive health. They have also been linked to \"numerous adverse health effects in almost all biological systems,\" including the immunological, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular systems, Swan writes.\n\n\"We can see tiny changes during development that, in an adult, can increase the rate of cancers,\" Hunt said. \"We’re setting up our children to have metabolic problems as adults, and I find that incredibly sobering and worrying.\"\n\nAnd we're not just hurting ourselves. We're harming animals, too.\n\n\"These ubiquitous environmental chemicals have taken a toll on the animal kingdom in many different ways,\" Swan writes. \"As a species, we’re failing to propagate and repopulate ourselves, and we’re hindering the ability of other species to do so.\"\n\nRemove, replace and regulate\n\nIn her book, Swan lays out an action plan to help people change their daily habits and reduce exposures. Instead of the traditional \"three Rs\" typically touted to promote reducing exposure to plastics and other environmental chemicals, Swan suggested promoting three new ones: \"Remove, replace and regulate\" endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\n\n\"The chemicals themselves have to be remodeled – substituted for chemicals that cannot interfere with human hormone systems. That’s absolutely critical,\" Swan said. \"They have to not be harmful at very low doses. And they have to not be persistent in the environment.\"\n\nHunt said her research on the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals has caused her to think about life \"completely differently.\"\n\n\"You can’t possibly eliminate plastics from your life, but you can buy different products,\" Hunt said. \"The plastics in my kitchen are silicone, and I use a lot of glass. There’s a rule in my house that plastics of any sort don’t go into the dishwasher and never go into the microwave. And I read labels obsessively.\"\n\nSwan also calls for much larger, societal changes, including greater government regulation of chemicals.\n\n\"We need to rethink our whole approach to chemical safety,\" Hunt said. \"We place the onus right now on federal regulatory agencies to demonstrate that these chemicals are harmful. The onus should be on demonstrating that they’re safe before they go into use, not demonstrating that they’re dangerous after they go into use.\"\n\nSwan said that for decades the U.S. has gone through cycles of public outcry about particular chemicals, such as BPA, only to replace the chemical with ones that are also harmful.\n\n\"This is a practice we call regrettable substitution, or, informally, whack-a-mole. You knock down one bad chemical for another one that has a new name but does the same thing,\" she said.\n\nSwan said she is launching a campaign tied to the book to educate the general public, along with the medical community, about the dangers of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Swan said she hopes to reach communities of color in particular, because many are disproportionately affected by the chemicals.\n\n\"Communities of color are differentially overexposed, for example, by decreased availability of fresh, unprocessed foods and their proximity to poorer air and water quality,\" Swan said. \"These communities have higher exposure and experience a higher impact from these chemicals. There’s an equity issue here.\"\n\n'These things are not separate'\n\nSwan said the discussion around the reproductive health crisis in 2021 is comparable to where the discussion around climate change was 40 years ago. \"Initially there was denial, and gradually people began to accept that this was a problem,\" Swan said.\n\nIn 1992, when a paper in the British Medical Journal suggested sperm counts had gradually declined over the past five decades, the paper \"was not taken seriously. It was criticized and pretty much ignored,\" Swan said. But in 2017, when Swan co-wrote the meta-analysis reaching the same conclusion, the paper became one of the most-referenced scientific papers worldwide that year.\n\n\"Where they had denied the problem in 1992, they were saying yes, it’s a problem,\" she said. \"Now, we need to move on to the next phase where we take responsibility as a society, as a planet.\"\n\nSwan said discussions of reproductive health should be included in discussions surrounding climate change and COVID-19. Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals, for example, are made from petroleum-producing byproducts. Moreover, recent papers have also shown that chemical exposures increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19.\n\n\"These things are not separate, and I think they should be considered together,\" Swan said. \"We have to recognize that we have a trifecta of risks coming down on us.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/02/covid-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-astrazeneca-what-to-know/6476436002/", "title": "COVID vaccine, explained: Pfizer FDA approval, side effects, Moderna", "text": "The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the first coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, and distribution of Pfizer's vaccine was underway over the weekend.\n\nModerna has also applied for emergency use authorization for its two-shot vaccine candidate, and more companies are expected to apply in the coming months. Meanwhile this week, Canada and the United Kingdom also authorized the widespread use of Pfizer's vaccine.\n\nAs vaccines are being produced in record time, what do we know about these shots? What are the side effects? Will you be immune? And will you have to take the vaccine once or every year?\n\nWe know you have questions, and we’re here to help. Ask us your vaccine questions through this online form, and we'll speak with public health experts to answer them below.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nIs there a vaccine for the coronavirus?\n\nThere are more than 200 vaccine candidates under development, with 52 in clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization. As of late November, Phase 3 clinical trials were in progress or being planned for five vaccines in the U.S., according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe U.S., United Kingdom and Canada have authorized the use of a vaccine developed by drug companies Pfizer and BioNTech. China and Russia began rolling out their own vaccines before completing late-stage clinical trials.\n\nPfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine:Key committee endorsement paves way for clearance by FDA and vaccinations in US to begin\n\nIs the vaccine safe?\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released a 53-page report summarizing data from Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 candidate vaccine trial. The data supports earlier findings that the vaccine is safe and will prevent 95% of people from becoming sick with COVID-19. Read more.\n\nIf you already had COVID-19, should you still get vaccinated?\n\nPeople who have had COVID-19 \"may be advised\" to get the vaccine, \"due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible,\" according to the CDC.\n\nIf you've had COVID-19 and recovered, you have what's called natural immunity. Studies have shown natural immunity to COVID-19 may last months to years. Immunity from a vaccine is called vaccine-induced immunity, and it's unclear how long that may last.\n\nWill the vaccine be safe for children and pregnant women?\n\nHistorically, major vaccines have not been tested during pregnancy because of concerns that both the pregnant person and fetus would be at risk for complications. Pregnant and nursing people were not included in the Pfizer/BioNTech study, so there is no data to suggest whether they should avoid vaccination.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, who directs the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, said Saturday that pregnant people, children and those who are immunocompromised should discuss vaccination with their providers and \"will need to consider on an individual basis.\"\n\nIn a Dec. 1 meeting of a CDC group that determines how vaccines should be allocated, several expert members said they expected the vaccine would be safe for mothers who are nursing because the virus itself does not seem to pass through the mother’s milk.\n\nThe Pfizer trial data only included children ages 16 and up, though the study has since been extended to age 12, and will include younger children as soon as the company decides what dose it wants to test in this group. Read more.\n\nRelated:No, the COVID-19 vaccine doesn’t cause infertility in womenmen\n\nWhat about 16- and 17-year-olds?\n\nAlthough there's not as much data for this age group as others, officials believe they know enough to conclude the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks, Marks said.\n\nSixteen and 17-year-olds rarely get severely ill with COVID-19, but they do transmit it easily, often without showing symptoms. And some in that age group work jobs in which they interact with the public, such as check-out clerks.\n\nWhat are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nAmericans will likely experience at least one side effect from the COVID-19 vaccine, but doctors say that’s normal and you should still get vaccinated. For the vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech, many trial participants endured side effects for a day or two after getting their shots, particularly the second one.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effect among vaccine recipients under age 55 was a sore arm, followed by fatigue (60% after the second shot); headache (52% after the second shot); other muscle aches (37%); and chills (35%). About 28% took pain medication after the first shot and 45% after the second shot. Read more.\n\nCan you get one dose from one vaccine and the second from another?\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines both require two doses, given 21 and 28 days apart, respectively. Since the vaccines differ in composition, storage and time between the two doses, experts say people must take the same vaccine for both doses.\n\nWhat is the level of immunity after one shot?\n\nThe vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech was 52% effective after the first dose, according to a recent FDA report. However, because everyone received a second dose three weeks after the first, there’s no evidence of protection lasting longer than a few weeks after the first dose. Read more.\n\nHow long will a COVID-19 vaccine be protective?\n\nThere is no data on how long a vaccine will be protective. FDA officials were expected to authorize Pfizer's vaccine in the midst of the pandemic because it is safe and at least transiently effective, rather than withholding it for two years to await the typical long-term results required for a full approval. Vaccine companies intend to follow trial participants for two years and submit a full application when they have that data. Read more.\n\nOnce you get vaccinated, can you still get sick or spread the virus?\n\nYes, it's possible. The potential vaccines are not 100% effective, so there’s a small chance you could encounter the virus and still get sick. It also typically takes \"a few weeks\" for the body to build immunity after vaccination, meaning a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick, according to the CDC.\n\nEven after vaccination, it's not clear whether someone could catch the virus that causes COVID-19 and pass it on to someone else, even without becoming ill. The studies designed to test the candidate vaccines only examined symptomatic infections, not whether vaccinated people could still be contagious. This means that people who are vaccinated can be pretty sure that they won’t develop COVID-19 themselves, but they could still pass it on to others without knowing they are infected. Future studies will explore this. Read more.\n\nCould the vaccine make subsequent infections worse?\n\nThere has been concern that getting vaccinated against the coronavirus might cause a subsequent COVID-19 infection, as some dengue vaccines have been shown to do for that disease.\n\nThe FDA concluded that use of the vaccine has not been widespread enough to know for certain, but that \"available data do not indicate a risk of vaccine-enhanced disease, and conversely suggest effectiveness against severe disease within the available follow-up period.\" The risk does remain over time as immunity against the disease wanes, the FDA said, and \"needs to be evaluated further in ongoing clinical trials.\" Read more.\n\nWhich vaccines will be only one shot?\n\nJohnson & Johnson is developing a single-dose vaccine. The company's chief scientist said last month that the company expects to have all the data it needs to file for authorization by February or sooner.\n\nWhat are the COVID-19 vaccine 'ingredients?'\n\nExperts say the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech looks pretty standard for a vaccine. They can be organized into four basic categories: the active ingredient (messenger RNA, in this case), fats, sugars and salt. Read more on ingredients.\n\nNone of the vaccines in development in the U.S. use the \"live\" virus that causes COVID-19, according to the CDC. Most of the vaccines under development introduce the \"spike\" protein found on the surface of the virus. They train the immune system to recognize this protein and attack in case of infection. But both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines depend on a technology never before used in a commercial vaccine: mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid. Read more on mRNA.\n\nWhat if I have had an allergic reaction in the past?\n\nAbout 1.6% of the population has had a severe allergic reaction to food or something in the environment, but they are eligible to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Marks said. Only people who have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or one of its components should not receive the vaccine. Sites where the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are administered will be able to treat allergic reactions, Marks said.\n\nTwo British people with severe allergies apparently had reactions to Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine this week. Allergic reactions were not a significant problem in the U.S. trial, in which more than 20,000 people received two doses of the vaccine. The U.S. trials kept out subjects who have had severe allergic reactions.\n\nWhere are the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines made?\n\nPfizer has two plants making its COVID-19 vaccine, one in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and one in Puurs, Belgium. The company has a distribution site in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, where its vaccine is being stored.\n\nModerna has started producing vaccine at its plant in Norwood, Massachusetts, and it will ramp up production in the next month with help from contract manufacturer Lonza Biologics, which has a facility in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n\nHow will the vaccine be shipped?\n\nShipment of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine involves Pfizer personnel taking five-dose glass vials of vaccine out of subzero freezers and packing them into specially designed shipping containers, Wes Wheeler, president of Global Healthcare at UPS, told USA TODAY.\n\nPfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is being shipped in insulated containers that hold between 195 and 975 five-dose vials and are about the size of a carry-on suitcase. The vials are stored in flat, pizza box-sized compartments, each of which holds 195 vials. A fully loaded thermal container, which is reusable, contains five of these and weighs about 70 pounds.\n\nPfizer will ship its vaccine using UPS and FedEx as its main distributors. Moderna's vaccine distribution is being coordinated by McKesson, the nation's largest medical supply distributor. Each carton will have a GPS tracker allowing it to be located in real-time anywhere in the world, as well as a Bluetooth tracker that can locate it within 10 feet inside a UPS facility, said Wheeler. Read more.\n\nHow much vaccine is there?\n\nApproximately 2.9 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will be distributed across the 50 states in the next few days, Gen. Gustave Perna, co-leader of Operation Warp Speed in charge of logistics, said Saturday. Another 2.9 doses are being held back to distribute later for the second shot, plus reserves.\n\nMore vaccine will be rolled out in the weeks and months to come, with Pfizer and Moderna expected to deliver a combined 300 million doses of their vaccines by the middle of next year, enough to vaccinate nearly half the population of the U.S.\n\nWhat is the vaccine delivery schedule?\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will be sent to to 636 hospitals, clinics and public health systems nationwide this week, with 145 sites receiving doses Monday, 425 on Tuesday and the final 66 on Wednesday, Perna said.\n\nOnce the initial doses have shipped, the system will begin regular deliveries. Each Thursday, Operation Warp Speed, the White House's coronavirus vaccine initiative, will ask vaccine producers how much vaccine they have made during the week, Paul Ostrowski, who leads supply, production and distribution for the federal government's Operation Warp Speed, who walked USA TODAY through the process. On Friday, staff will meet and decide how many doses can be allocated. States will put in their orders on Saturday and deliveries will happen on Monday morning, he said.\n\nUPS, FedEx and McKesson all have 24-hour hotlines sites can call if there are delivery troubles. In addition, Operation Warp Speed officials said they will have staff available at two operations centers, one in Washington and one in Atlanta, both with 24-hour hotlines. Read more.\n\nHow does Operation Warp Speed track doses?\n\nOperation Warp Speed created a software system called Tiberius that allows states and local jurisdictions to order and track vaccine. It records all allocations of COVID-19 vaccines to states, territories, cities and federal entities, said Col. Deacon Maddox, OWS Chief of Plans, Operations and Analysis. It works in conjunction with the CDC's Vaccine Tracking System, known as VTrckS, which has been distributing vaccine for children for a decade. Read more.\n\nHow much does the vaccine cost?\n\nModerna has agreed to provide the U.S. with 200 million doses and Pfizer at least 100 million by the middle of next year, have agreed to provide the U.S. with 100 million doses apiece, already funded through federal support of manufacturing and distribution. Vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost, according to the CDC.\n\n\"However, vaccine providers will be able to charge administration fees for giving or administering the shot to someone. Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient’s public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund,\" the CDC says on its website.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2022/05/13/male-birth-control-why-condoms-and-vasectomies-only-options/9732281002/", "title": "Male birth control: Why are condoms and vasectomies the only ...", "text": "Many unplanned pregnancies end in abortion, but options for male birth control are limited.\n\nGender bias, along with other factors, may be slowing development.\n\nThere cannot be equity in family planning without more options for men, experts say.\n\nNearly half of all pregnancies around the world are unintended, according to a report from the United Nations published in March. While some of these pregnancies become a source of joy, more than half of them end in abortion. Other unplanned pregnancies that come to term create a cascade of wide-ranging consequences, including fewer educational opportunities for the women who give birth, reduced participation in the labor market and risks to the mental and physical well-being of mother and child.\n\nIn the United States, the unintended pregnancy rate is significantly higher than in many other developed countries, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Those rates are highest among young women, low-income women and women of color.\n\nDespite the more than 120 million unintended pregnancies worldwide, options for male contraception are limited. Male-driven methods include withdrawal, condoms and vasectomy. One in 5 couples who use withdrawal becomes pregnant.

Its unsavory reputation has been largely based on flawed scientific studies in animals and humans, which have been debunked by more recent research.\n\nWhat is MSG?\n\nFirst discovered by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, MSG is made up of sodium and glutamate, one of the most abundant amino acids found within the human body and nature. Glutamate plays a crucial role in neuromuscular development, metabolism and many other vital biological functions.\n\nMSG by itself doesn't have much flavor, but when it's added into certain foods, it stimulates and heightens taste buds on our tongues that sense umami, a Japanese portmanteau meaning a pleasant, savory taste.\n\nWhen Ikeda first happened on MSG in 1907, he had distilled it from a glutamate-rich seaweed broth used extensively in Japanese cuisine. Today, MSG is made by fermenting starch, corn, wheat, beets or other sugar-rich foods with bacteria that eat the sugar and spit out proteins abundant in glutamic acid, an alternative form of glutamate. (Foods like yogurt, kimchi and sauerkraut also are made via fermentation.)\n\nFact check:Contact with wild parsnip harmful to humans and animals\n\nHumans have been eating glutamate-rich foods, like tomatoes and cheese, for centuries. MSG has long been associated with Chinese cooking, but it's also used to flavor Caribbean and Latin American sauces, Doritos, sandwiches at Chick-fil-A, low sodium products and many other processed foods, Dr. Stephen Prescott, president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, wrote in The Oklahoman.\n\nFlawed studies, no real scientific evidence\n\nHealth concerns over MSG arose in 1968 after a Chinese-American doctor wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine wondering if the flavor enhancer was the cause for his heart palpitations, numbness and weakness felt whenever eating at a Chinese restaurant.\n\nThe letter, published under the title \"Chinese-Restuarant Syndrome,\" spawned a flurry of animal and human studies in which subjects were given MSG either through an injection or orally. One 1969 study by Washington University researcher Dr. John Olney found injecting significantly large doses under the skin of newborn mice led to impaired brain development, stunted growth, obesity and infertility in female mice. Olney repeated the same experiment, this time giving MSG orally to rhesus monkeys, and came to a similar finding.\n\nBut later, in 19 other monkey studies by other researchers, no one observed results anything like Olney's.\n\nIn one human study where 71 healthy people were given either MSG or a placebo, both groups complained of symptoms like headaches or numbness roughly at the same rate, even when participants were swapped to the other option.\n\nIn following years, many organizations, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization and the American Medical Association, all declared MSG safe to eat.\n\nFact check:Meat digested like any other protein source\n\nIn 1992, the FDA launched a formal review of MSG's supposed ill effects, and in 1995 it concluded it was safe overall, although it may cause mild, short-term reactions like headaches, numbness and palpitations in a tiny part of the population. The report noted that the symptoms tended to occur in people who ate more than 3 grams of MSG without food. The typical serving of food with MSG added is less than 0.5 grams. Consuming six times that amount without food at one time is unlikely, the FDA said on its MSG question-and-answer website.\n\nA 2009 study found dietary glutamate does not cross the blood-brain barrier – a system of blood vessels that regulates what goes in and out of the brain and spinal cord – in large amounts and so is unlikely to affect brain function.\n\nA 2020 review of studies involving MSG also found many of its reported negative health effects \"have little relevance for chronic human exposure and are poorly informative as they are based on excessive dosing that does not meet with levels normally consumed in food products.\"\n\nThe impact of MSG on weight has been less clear-cut. Some studies have suggested it can cause weight gain, but others show there is no connection between the two.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nWe rate the claim that MSG is a deadly brain toxin that causes neurological disorders and other health problems FALSE, based on our research. MSG is a naturally occurring food substance that has been used for more than 100 years. Claims that it can be dangerous to human health are based on flawed scientific studies that have been debunked by more recent research.

The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy,” the party said in a statement on June 5 without directly referring to the comments from Sharma or Jindal.\n\nPolice in the Indian capital Delhi have also registered cases against Sharma and several others accused of disrupting public tranquility and incitement, according to a tweet from the Delhi police’s official Twitter account.\n\nA complaint was also earlier filed in Mumbai against Sharma for her inflammatory comments.\n\nOn June 8, Indian police said they had arrested a former BJP local youth leader in the northern city of Kanpur for posting inflammatory content on social media about Prophet Mohammed.\n\nThe incident has led to protests among the country’s Muslim minority in several states. In Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur on Friday, at least 54 people were arrested in connection with the protests, senior Kanpur police official Pramod Kumar told CNN.\n\nGlobal reactions\n\nThe BJP’s move to suspend its spokesperson failed to stop the controversy escalating beyond India’s borders.\n\nQatar, Kuwait and Iran summoned India’s ambassadors, and the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation issued statements of condemnation. Malaysia was the latest country to condemn the remarks. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the High Commissioner of India to Malaysia on Tuesday to convey their “total repudiation over this incident.”\n\nProtesters in the Pakistani city of Lahore called on Indian Prime Minister Modi to issue an apology. And some stores in Kuwait have removed Indian products from their shelves following similar calls for a boycott.\n\nThe hashtag “Anyone but the Prophet, oh Modi” has been trending on Twitter in all six Gulf countries, and as far away as Algeria. Oman’s outspoken Grand Mufti Sheikh Ahmad Al-Khalili, the chief religious figure in the country, called Sharma’s comments “a war on all Muslims” and a matter that “calls for all Muslims to rise as one nation.”\n\nModi has not publicly commented on the incident but Indian embassies in Gulf nations have made statements saying the comments “do not, in any manner, reflect the views of the government of India” and the government “accords the highest respect to all religions.”\n\nCNN has reached out to India’s Home Affairs Ministry for comment.\n\nThreats from al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent\n\nDepictions of Islam’s Prophet are considered blasphemous by many Muslims and offending images or comments have in the past led to mass boycotts, diplomatic crises, riots and even terror attacks.\n\nOn June 8, the terrorist network al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) issued a statement condemning the remarks from the BJP officials and called for revenge, warning they will “find refuge neither in their homes nor in their fortified army cantonments.”\n\nBut Mohammed Sinan Siyech, a non-resident fellow at Observer Research Foundation, a global think tank based in Delhi, said that such threats are more of a recruitment strategy than a solid plan.\n\n“In some ways this is them trying to publicize their views rather than taking action,” Siyech said.\n\nAQIS had not recruited many people since forming in the subcontinent in 2014 so might not have the capacity to carry out such an attack, he said.\n\nIn 2015, Islamist militants attacked the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had printed cartoons of the Prophet, and a Jewish supermarket in Paris, killing 17 people.\n\nAttitude to Muslims at home\n\nFor many of India’s 200 million Muslims, Sharma’s comments were not an isolated incident.\n\nThey came amid a broader trend in India, which has cracked down on its minority Muslim population ever since Modi’s BJP came to power nearly eight years ago.\n\nAnalysts say there has been a rise in support for extremist Hindu nationalist groups and suspected hate crimes against Muslims since 2014.\n\nIn January, a senior member of the right-wing Hindu Mahasabha political party called on her supporters to kill Muslims and “protect” the country. It triggered an outcry made worse by the subsequent lack of arrests.\n\nIn February, the southern state of Karnataka banned headscarves in classrooms, sparking protests in the state and major cities including the capital New Delhi. The demonstrations prompted rival protests from right-wing Hindus who chanted a religious slogan in support of the BJP.\n\nIn 2018, India’s current Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were “termites” and promised to rid the nation of them. And between 2015 and 2018, vigilante groups killed dozens of people – many of whom were Muslims – for allegedly consuming or killing cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn 2019, India’s Parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims. It led to extended protests and international condemnation.\n\nAnd in December 2020, Uttar Pradesh enacted a controversial anti-conversion law, making it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.\n\nAll of this, analysts say, is evidence that Modi and his BJP party have pushed an agenda of Hindu nationalism onto secular India, a country of 1.3 billion people.\n\nWhat the BJP’s reaction says about India’s relationship to Gulf states\n\nAnalysts said Modi has walked a tightrope between keeping his Muslim international allies happy while pushing his party’s Hindu nationalist agenda at home.\n\n“Modi has tried very hard to prevent his party’s domestic political agenda from spilling over and poisoning India’s relations with the Gulf states,” said Hasan Alhasan, a Bahrain-based fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who researches Indian foreign policy in the Gulf.\n\n“The extent to which Sharma’s comments have clouded India’s relations with the Gulf states is unprecedented, and that’s of course because she is, or was, the spokesperson of the BJP.”\n\nIndia has much to lose if it can’t keep a lid on the controversy. It comes as Gulf states and India look to enhance their economic partnership.\n\nIndia, the world’s third-biggest importer of oil, looks to the Middle East for 65% of its crude. The South Asian nation also sends to the Gulf states millions of workers who send home billions of dollars in remittances each year. And the UAE has singled out India among seven other nations as its future economic partner.\n\nThe Gulf states are key sources of India’s oil and gas imports, with bilateral trade worth more than $100 billion, according to Alhasan.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly stated where Mohammed Sinan Siyech works.

Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nOfficial memorial altars were set up in central Seoul Monday, with photos showing crowds visiting to pay their respects. Many were in tears and holding white flowers; others knelt and bowed deeply to the altar.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, his wife, Kim Keon-hee, and top officials including the prime minister and Seoul mayor joined the mourners.\n\nMany shops and businesses were closed to observe a week-long national period of mourning. Parts of central Seoul were nearly deserted – a highly unusual sight in the usually bustling capital that’s home to about 10 million people.\n\nPeople also paid respects at a makeshift memorial in Itaewon, outside a subway station near the alley where the crush occurred. The station entrance is adorned with rows of flowers, and offerings such as handwritten notes, bottles of the Korean liquor soju and paper cups filled with drinks.\n\nAmong the mourners was a civic group of the bereaved families of the Sewol Ferry disaster, which killed 304 people – mostly teens on a school trip – when the vessel sank in 2014.\n\n“As one who had suffered the same pain, my heart is torn and I’m rendered speechless,” one of the group’s members told reporters at the memorial, saying the families were saddened to see “a major disaster like this repeated.”\n\nQuestions about police numbers\n\nJust down the street, the entrance to the alley had been cordoned off, with security personnel standing guard as forensic teams clad in white protective suits scoured the area, still littered with trash and debris.\n\nAmid the grief, questions have emerged about the government’s handling of the incident and an apparent lack of crowd control before the tragedy.\n\nOne survivor, 22-year-old French exchange student Anne-Lou Chevalier, told CNN she passed out in the crowd after being “crushed” by fellow revelers. “At some point I had no air, and we were so crushed to other people that I couldn’t breathe at all. So, I just passed out,” Chevalier said.\n\nSeveral eyewitnesses and survivors said they had seen few or no police officers in the area before the situation deteriorated.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the minister of the interior and safety said only a “normal” level of security personnel had been deployed to Itaewon because the crowd there did not seem unusually large – whereas a “considerable number” of police had been sent to another part of Seoul in response to expected protests.\n\nMourners pay tribute for victims of the deadly Halloween crowd surge in Seoul on October 31, 2022.

In response, floods of protesters took to the streets, starting bonfires on a Tel Aviv highway and knocking down a police barricade outside Netanyahu's home.\n\nDemonstrations have swept across Israel for months over an effort by Netanyahu's right-wing government to overhaul the country’s judicial system. But Netanyahu's sudden ousting of the high-level minister who opposed the changes prompted the Biden administration to issue an unusual statement of concern.\n\n\"As the president recently discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu, democratic values have always been, and must remain, a hallmark of the U.S.-Israel relationship,\" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. \"Democratic societies are strengthened by checks and balances, and fundamental changes to a democratic system should be pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support. We continue to strongly urge Israeli leaders to find a compromise as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe escalating tensions came after the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Saturday night that Netanyahu's judicial overhaul posed a security threat to Israel. Military reservists have refused to sign up for duty and many more have threatened to do the same. Israel's consul general in New York resigned in protest.\n\nStill, Netanyahu’s far-right government was expected to advance some of the most controversial elements of its proposal.\n\nThe proposal could have wide-ranging implications for minority groups in the country, including Palestinians living in the West Bank and members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe blood-red ”Handmaid’s Tale” garb that for years showed up at left-leaning protests in the U.S. has become a fixture among protesters of the changes.\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nWhat are the Israel protests about?\n\nIsrael's Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, in January unveiled a plan for far-reaching judicial reforms that could significantly weaken Israel's Supreme Court's powers.\n\nIsraeli law allows for the nation's Supreme Court to strike down measures passed in its parliament if they go against what are known as the country’s \"Basic Laws\" – the closest thing Israel has to a governing Constitution.\n\nThe legislative blitz would overhaul the country’s judicial system by allowing the Knesset, Israel's parliament, to override Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority and giving politicians a greater role in the appointment of Supreme Court judges.\n\n\"The laws all aim to assure parliamentary supremacy,\" said Yehudah Mirsky, a professor of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University.\n\nProtests continue:Israelis continue protests against judicial overhaul\n\nWhen did the protests start?\n\nThe protests began after Levin announced the reforms in January and have grown to include a wide range of voices.\n\n\"(The protests) have grown steadily and become the most massive protest movement ever seen in Israel's history,\" Mirsky said. \"Significantly, many military reservists are saying they may not be able to go on serving in the army under an illiberal government like the one they see taking shape.\"\n\nHe added that the protests aren't confined to urban centers or the political left; demonstrations have broken out in Jewish settlements and among right-leaning centrists.\n\nWho would be most affected by the legislation?\n\nAny groups unaligned with Israel's far-right coalition could be negatively affected by the legislation, according to Steven Zipperstein, a professor of Jewish culture and history at Stanford University.\n\n\"The catalog would be very, very long,\" he said.\n\nChief among those affected would be Palestinians living in the West Bank, he said; the changes could unleash \"unlimited'' Jewish settlements in the area .\n\nSettlements refer to Israeli communities operating in territories not under the nation’s sovereignty, like the West Bank, according to the Israel Policy Forum. Some 127 settlements in the West Bank have legal status under Israeli law, though much of the world considers settlements to be illegal under international law, IPF says.\n\nThe land is significant in Jewish and Biblical history, with part of Jerusalem – the capital of the Kingdom of Israel during King David’s reign – encapsulated in the area. Some view the settlements as restoration of Israel’s biblical land before the Messiah’s return, according to the Washington Institute’s Fikra Forum. The settlements are built on land claimed by Palestinians and by religious Jews as well.\n\nMembers of the LGBTQ community could also be affected. In recent years, a series of landmark rulings in Israel’s Supreme Court and parliament — from the right to parent children through surrogacy to the prohibition of conversion therapy and employment discrimination — have strengthened rights for the LGBTQ community in the country. Israel has emerged as a safe haven for the LGBTQ community in the Middle East, and critics of the proposal say the legislation is a significant setback.\n\n''It doesn’t matter if you are a woman, Arab, gay or a person with disabilities, the reforms will end up hurting all minorities,” said Liat Ortar, one of an estimated 100,000 protesters outside the Knesset in Jerusalem last month.\n\nWhat do advocates of the changes say?\n\nNetanyahu has argued that the judicial reforms are needed to strengthen Israel's democracy.\n\n''It brings Israel in line with most of the democracies of the world, because Israel is right now an outlier,\" he said in a CNN interview in January. \"Israel has the most extreme judicial activism that's gone off the rails and we're trying to bring it back to where just about all the democracies are, both in the selection of judges and the balance between the diverse branches of government. It's gone haywire and I think that correcting or restoring Israeli democracy will make the democracy stronger.\"\n\nHow could the proposal affect Netanyahu?\n\nThe importance of Israel's Supreme Court was, until recently, recognized by Netanyahu himself. His \"change in heart\" is the byproduct of both a need to keep united his far-right coalition and the corruption charges he faces for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three scandals involving wealthy associates and powerful media moguls.\n\n\"The corruption charges that are being leveled against him will essentially be annulled if the Supreme Court decisions are rendered null and void,\" Zipperstein said.\n\nWhat has the U.S. said about the proposal?\n\nThe proposed changes have raised concerns in the U.S., which is Israel’s largest financial supporter.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called on Israel to reach a “consensus” on the issue. U.S. ambassador to Israel, Tom Nides, said he had told Netanyahu repeatedly to “pump the brakes” on the judicial overhaul. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned about democracy during his last visit to Israel.\n\nBut most high-ranking U.S. officials have stopped short of condemning the legislation.\n\n\"Their circumspection is understandable - but they need to make clear, especially to Netanyahu and those closest to him, what this would mean for Israel's strategic relationship with (the U.S.), without which it cannot survive,\" Mirsky said, adding that the message needs to be bipartisan.\n\nWhat's happens next?\n\nIsrael's Knesset advanced the \"override cluse\" bill last week, one of several in the reforms which will ensure a simple majority in parliament can override High Court rulings. The first reading passed with 61 votes for and 52 against, though it still needs to pass a second and third reading to become law.\n\n\"It's very difficult to imagine that there wouldn't be an incredibly strong reaction once this legislation is passed, if it is,\" Zipperstein said. \"It's the kind of it's a kind of scenario that is impossible to imagine not happening, and all but impossible to imagine it all ending decently.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/europe/crimea-saki-air-base-blast-russia-causes-intl/index.html", "title": "It's not yet clear what caused blasts at a Crimea air base. But ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen a series of explosions rocked a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, sending Russian vacationers fleeing from nearby beaches, it was clearly an embarrassment for Moscow. Western officials and analysts have since offered competing explanations about the cause.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the explosions – which sent enormous columns of smoke over the surrounding area – were caused by the accidental detonation of ammunition, and that no aircraft had been damaged.\n\nBut satellite imagery reviewed by CNN and other media, as well as Western security agencies, show at least eight aircraft were damaged, as was infrastructure at the air base at Novofedorivka, on Crimea’s west coast. One person was killed and 14 injured, the Crimean health ministry said.\n\nA satellite image from August 10, after the explosion, shows the charred remains of at least seven aircraft in the earthen berms. Planet Labs\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Defense noted the explosions in messages on social media but offered no explanation for them.\n\nOn Friday, the UK Ministry of Defence said: “The original cause of the blasts is unclear, but the large mushroom clouds visible in eyewitness video were almost certainly from the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas.\n\n“At least five Su-24 FENCER fighter-bombers and three Su-30 FLANKER H multi-role jets were almost certainly destroyed or seriously damaged in the blasts.”\n\nWestern military analysts assessed the air base’s apron was badly damaged and that buildings away from the apron were also damaged.\n\nCrisis and risk analysts at the Cavell Group noted commentary about “crater sizes, a possible Ukrainian SF [special forces] attack, partisans and more, but most indications are Ukrainian modified ballistic cruise missiles were used.”\n\nIn any event, the Cavell Group said, the “Saki attack was audacious and highly effective in both damaging Russian reinforcements and striking a significant psychological blow to morale amongst the Russian military and civilians.”\n\nNearby Crimean beaches were crowded with holidaymakers. There was a subsequent exodus from Crimea of hundreds of civilian vehicles across the Kerch Strait bridge, causing miles-long tailbacks. Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based analytical group, agrees that the jury is still out on what caused the explosions, absent any official statement from the Ukrainians.\n\n“ISW still cannot independently assess what caused the explosions at the airfield – satellite imagery depicts multiple craters and scorch marks, but such damage could have been caused by many things – special forces, partisans or missiles, on-site or from a distance,” ISW said in its update Wednesday.\n\nIt also noted that Russian accounts of the incident have been confused.\n\n“Mixed stories in Russian media and among Russian milbloggers indicate that either officials within the Russian Ministry of Defense have competing theories regarding the attack and are sharing them with the media, or that the Kremlin has failed to coordinate its information operation,” ISW said.\n\nA prominent military blogger in Russia, Yuri Podolyak, said Thursday that “judging by the [satellite] images from the Americans, it was just an act of sabotage, a terrorist attack.”\n\nHe was also critical of the safety precautions at the air base.\n\n“Storage and ammunition depots were hit. By the way, they were only a couple of hundred meters from the residential area, and they were completely open, which already brings us to the question of what the command of this military unit was thinking about,” Podolyak said. His Telegram channel has 2.2 million subscribers.\n\n“I think it was a combination of sabotage with negligence. When the warehouses were already hit, there was an explosion of fuel and ammunition. I have questions for the command of this air regiment: how is it possible to store ammunition like this?”\n\nAnother military blogger in Russia who goes by the name Rybar, with more than 600,000 subscribers, suggested the explosion was likely not caused by a missile strike.\n\nRybar noted that “none of the huge number of vacationers and residents of Novofedorivka observed the arrival of rockets. Numerous videos from the scene also do not show anything resembling an incoming munition.”\n\nCNN’s review of available imagery did not detect any incoming rockets or missiles, but the base is very close to the Black Sea.\n\nRybar speculated that a helicopter with a small bomb could have detonated fuel and ammunition, setting off a chain of explosions across the airfield. “The main source of ignition and subsequent detonations was located approximately in the area of one of the aircraft stands,” he said.\n\nWhile there is no evidence to support this scenario, Ukrainian helicopters have flown deep behind enemy lines before – notably in missions to the besieged Azovstal plant in Mariupol.\n\nRybar also suggested negligence as a possibiilty. “Similar cases have already occurred in Syria, when the carelessness of local military personnel led to the loss of aircraft.”\n\nWhatever caused the explosions, they could have significant implications for the overall conflict, especially if the attack were to have been carried out with any new long-range weapon system that Ukraine has developed.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence says that the loss of eight combat jets represents a minor proportion of the overall fleet of aircraft Russia has available to support the war.\n\nBut it noted that Saki is the main base for supporting the Russian navy in the Black Sea. “The fleet’s naval aviation capability is now significantly degraded. The incident will likely prompt the Russian military to revise its threat perception,” it said.\n\nIt may also cause a re-evaluation of the threat to Crimea which “has probably been seen as a secure rear-area,” the ministry said.\n\nAnd the Cavell Group said: “Many Russian strategic defences, infrastructure and military sites could be targeted within this range, some crucial to Russia’s invasion.”\n\nUkrainian commanders have already said that targets in Crimea are on their list.\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, Ukrainian Major General Dmytro Marchenko was asked whether targeting the only road bridge into Crimea from Russia across the Kerch Strait would be part of the Ukrainian military’s plan.\n\n“Yes, this is a necessary measure in order to deprive them of the opportunity to provide reserves and reinforce their troops from Russian territory,” Marchenko replied.", "authors": ["Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/960294/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-4-april-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 4 April 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Poll finds Starmer has work to do\n\nA study to mark Keir Starmer’s third anniversary makes for tough reading for the Labour leader as it showed that almost half of British voters believed he had not set out a clear vision.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}]}

Fresh from a row with Russia over the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Biden will throw himself into another geopolitical crisis when he visits Northern Ireland, a country that has been without a functioning executive for over 400 days. Biden’s isn’t the only intervention from a US president on the subject, though. Bill Clinton gave an interview to the Irish broadcaster RTE this week, saying it is a “miracle” the Good Friday Agreement survived Brexit. Clinton took part in last-minute talks before the landmark deal was signed in 1998 and called it an act of “bravery from all sides”. Clinton also took the opportunity to urge the Democratic Unionists, who are yet to return to power-sharing at Stormont amid a stalemate over Brexit, to engage with the institutions in the wake of Rishi Sunak’s Windsor framework with the EU. “I think we should say, ‘look, there’s something to work with here’,” said Clinton. “[Sinn Fein] doesn’t want to jam you, they want to work with you to resolve these things. How can we live together? How can we work together? How can we all put our heads on the pillow at night and feel at peace about what our children are going to face?” While Biden is known to share the same views as Clinton on the Stormont stalemate it is understood he will not be visiting the site of the executive itself on his trip, in the hope perhaps of keeping a lower profile than his immediate predecessor in the White House managed this week.

The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nHear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/04/trump-arrested-arraigned-takeaways/11594611002/", "title": "Takeaways: Donald Trump was arrested Tuesday. What you need to ...", "text": "For the first time in U.S. history, a former president surrendered to law enforcement and was placed under arrest.\n\nDonald Trump's arraignment Tuesday thrust the U.S. criminal justice system into dramatically new territory, testing the durability of courtroom rules and legal procedures that apply to all Americans – this time, the 45th chief executive of the nation.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nHere are takeaways from Trump's arrest:\n\n34 counts\n\nIn an indictment unsealed Tuesday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Trump with 34 felony counts for falsifying New York business records through a \"catch and kill\" scheme designed to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump, appearing before Judge Juan Merchan, pleaded not guilty to each of the counts.\n\nThe crux of the case centers on $130,000 in hush money payments that Trump's then-fixer Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Prosecutors also outlined a $30,000 payment to a former Trump Tower doorman “who claimed to have a story about a child Trump had out of wedlock.\"\n\nAnd they referenced a separate $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to silence her about an alleged affair prior to the 2016 election. Prosecutors said the latter two payments were facilitated by American Media Inc., which owns and operates the National Enquirer tabloid.\n\nThere's no state law that prohibits hush money payments. But Bragg said Trump falsified business records by concealing monthly reimbursement payments he made to Cohen as checks for legal services.\n\nBy itself, falsifying business records is a misdemeanor under New York law. Bragg charged Trump with more serious felony counts by arguing the records were falsified to cover up other crimes.\n\n\"Why did Donald Trump repeatedly make these false statements?\" Bragg said. \"The evidence will show that he did so to cover up crimes relating to the 2016 election.\"\n\nAlthough the indictment doesn't specify which additional crimes, Bragg said Trump violated New York election law and federal campaign finance law.\n\nTrump defiant in Mar-a-Lago speech\n\nHours after leaving the New York City court, Trump returned to his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, where he delivered a speech listing multiple grievances from Tuesday's arrest and last year's FBI search at Mar-a-Lago over classified records to President Joe Biden's son and losing the 2020 election.\n\n\"This fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election and it should be dropped immediately,\" he said.\n\nRomney, other Trump critics skeptical of Bragg's case\n\nEven some of Trump's biggest critics were quick to question whether Bragg presented enough new information to warrant the charges.\n\n“I believe President Trump’s character and conduct make him unfit for office,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who voted to remove Trump from office during the ex-president's second impeachment trial, said in a statement.\n\n\"Even so, I believe the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda.\"\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser-turned-critic, questioned whether Trump's hush payments represented a campaign contribution or expenditure under federal law.\n\n\"Speaking as someone who very strongly does not want Donald Trump to get the Republican presidential nomination, I'm extraordinarily distressed by this document,\" Bolton said in an interview on CNN. \"I think this is even weaker than I feared it would be. And I think it's easily subject to being quickly dismissed.\"\n\nAll eyes on Alvin Bragg\n\nBragg will arguably be as much the center of attention in this case as Trump.\n\n\"We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct,\" he said, defending bringing the case forward at a news conference after Trump appeared in court.\n\nThe district attorney said a \"trail of money and lies exposes a pattern\" that violates New York’s basic and fundamental business laws.\n\nFor Republicans, Bragg will be a lightning rod for their assertions that this case is at best a campaign promise and at worse political persecution.\n\nNation: Who is Alvin Bragg? Meet the attorney who will become the first prosecutor to charge a former president\n\nMore: Read the indictment. Donald Trump charged with crimes in New York.\n\nDuring the 2021 campaign for Manhattan district attorney, for instance, Bragg reportedly reminded voters that he sued the Trump administration “more than a hundred times” in his old job as assistant New York attorney general.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have largely emphasized how the justice system needs to play out without prejudice or favor.\n\nOthers have called attention to how Bragg, who is Black, has faced a barrage of death threats and racist email messages since the indictment was handed down by a grand jury.\n\nA courthouse circus amplified by members of Congress\n\nHours before Trump arrived to turn himself in, throngs of foes and fans had assembled at small a park near the courthouse.\n\nAmong them were two polarizing Republican lawmakers, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, and George Santos, of New York, who joined the pro-Trump side that was waving flags and blowing whistles.\n\n“The government has been weaponized against him,” Greene said. “I'm here to protest and use my voice to take a stand. Every American should take a stand.”\n\nPolitics: Marjorie Taylor Greene compares Trump to Jesus before his arrest and arraignment in New York\n\nMore: New York City Mayor Eric Adams warns Marjorie Taylor Greene, others ahead of Trump arraignment\n\nLater, Greene compared Trump to Jesus and Nelson Mandela in an interview with Right Side Broadcasting.\n\nAmong the anti-Trump demonstrators was Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, who shouted at Greene’s vehicle when it departed.\n\n“Get your hateful rhetoric out of New York City,” Bowman said via Twitter. “Democracy is all about love.”\n\nThe White House keeps quiet\n\nTuesday's circus-like atmosphere provided a striking split screen: a former president under arrest and President Joe Biden trying his best to act like he's not paying attention.\n\nAs Trump walked out of his vehicle to surrender at the Manhattan courthouse, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was in the middle of a press briefing, declining to comment to question after question about the Trump case.\n\n\"Obviously, he (Biden) will catch part of the news when he has a moment to catch up on the news of the day,” Jean-Pierre said at her daily briefing. “But this is not his focus for today.”\n\nMore:With 2024 looming, how long can President Biden stay silent on Trump's indictment?\n\nJean-Pierre cited the ongoing nature of the case in declining comment. Biden ignored questions shouted by reporters about Trump's case after declining comment last week.\n\nAnything Biden says could be used by Republicans to reinforce their case of a politically biased government and justice system.\n\nBut Biden's strategy of silence will be tested if Biden formally announces a 2024 reelection bid, which he's widely expected to do. If Biden remains silent, then Trump's claims of a rigged justice system – almost certain to ramp up heading into 2024 – would go unchallenged by the likely Democratic standard-bearer.\n\nHow long can Biden stay quiet on such a significant case – especially one with direct implications for his own political future?\n\nNo mugshot, but Trump fakes one to raise money\n\nHeading into the proceedings, it was unclear whether Trump would be held to the same standards as other defendants by getting fingerprinted and photographed for a mug shot.\n\nIn the end, Trump was required to provide fingerprints but was not subjected to a mug shot or handcuffs. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was ultimately made by Bragg's office.\n\nThat didn't stop the Trump campaign from creating its own Trump mug shot to raise money, however.\n\nWithin minutes of the former president being processed his 2024 campaign team put out its own \"mugshot\" with a picture of Trump over a “not guilty” banner in a fundraising email.\n\nPolitics: After arrest what's next legally and politically for the former president?\n\nTrump has used his indictment to rally Republicans, with even some of his potential Republican opponents accusing law enforcement of being weaponized against Trump.\n\nCampaign officials said Trump had $10 million in donations since the indictment last week.\n\nThe judge also did not order a gag order, meaning the former president can speak freely about the case without concern about repercussions in court.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison and Phillip M.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 5th of April, 2023. Today, a look at the charges against former President Donald Trump. Plus, what's the indictment mean for the 2024 election, and a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin could have major ramifications for abortion law.\n\n♦\n\nDonald Trump made history yesterday, becoming the first former president placed under arrest. At his arraignment in New York, we also found out exactly what charges he faces. USA Today Justice Department Correspondent Bart Jansen has more. Bart, welcome back to 5 Things.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWe now know the charges surrounding former President Donald Trump. So Bart, what are they?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, it's 34 counts of falsifying business records. So pretty easy to remember, it's the same thing 34 times, but what's curious about it is that that charge under New York State law is usually a misdemeanor. And in this case, because the prosecutors have associated it with another alleged violation of law, they've been elevated to felonies. So Trump faces 34 felonies for falsifying business records.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd were you surprised that there were so many felonies on this indictment?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, the number is striking, but what it really means is that Trump made a series of payments to his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, in exchange for Cohen arranging payments to two women for their silence before the 2016 election. So there was a series of 11 payments during 2017 to Cohen and then each one of those checks gets issued. There is also an entry into a corporate ledger. Okay, we got the invoice. Then there's another entry into a corporate ledger. The money has gone out. So basically, with each payment to Cohen, there were basically three notations and there are a couple of extra notations along the way. So it looks like a large number, but it's basically a series of payments to Michael Cohen for making the hush payments to two women.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, there was so much spectacle around the arraignment, itself, on Tuesday. Trump flew up from Florida on his big plane. There was tons of media presence across Manhattan. Did everything go smoothly with Trump's arraignment? And how similar was the process to what any other American faces when they're charged with a crime?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nI think the process went relatively smoothly, considering you've got a secret service motorcade that has to bring the defendant back and forth to the courthouse. Traffic in a big city is tough on any given day, but they got him in and out relatively smoothly. Part of the novelty of this case involving a former president is that he was processed, he was booked like a standard defendant, they took his fingerprints, but they did not take his mugshot, as you would with a typical defendant. Sources told us that that's because, typically, you'd have a mugshot in case a defendant was fleeing the charges and needed to be identified. In this case, Trump, of course, is one of the most recognizable faces on earth. And so I guess the District Attorney's Office decided that they didn't need the picture.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, we've talked on the show about the prospect of this wave of legal challenges that the Trump team might now unleash. What's the expectation here?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nYeah, Trump's legal team is expected to challenge these charges in a variety of ways. They told reporters outside the courthouse, Trump will be fighting these charges vigorously. Some of the initial challenges that appear obvious include the way the charges were elevated from misdemeanor to felony. Trump has criticized the judge in the case, saying that he might be unfavorable to him. The judge has already overseen a criminal case involving the Trump organization and its chief financial officer, who were each convicted in a case last fall. He might argue for a change of venue, to have the case heard in a different location than in New York, and he might just argue outright the case should be dismissed, that there's not enough evidence to prove that he falsified records. He argues that there were never any violations, that the payments that he made were part of a private arrangement that he had with Cohen and that he shouldn't be held accountable for what Cohen did on his end of the payments.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDo we have any sense of what the timeline looks like surrounding this case in the next few weeks and months?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, lawyers will be hashing out what the indictment says precisely, what evidence can be accepted at trial, those various motions. Whether you change venue, try to dismiss all those pretrial motions, I believe the judge has set an aspirational trial date of January, 2024, which would put it in the thick of the presidential campaign, if it goes at that timing. So we'll have to see whether that schedule actually holds, but I don't believe we're expecting to see Trump back in court anytime in the next few months.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart Jansen, great info for us. Thanks so much.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTrump's indictment is making waves in a number of ways, including its possible influence on the upcoming 2024 election. USA TODAY Politics Reporter Erin Mansfield explains. Hi, Erin. Thanks for hopping on the podcast on a busy week, to say the least.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThis indictment is unprecedented for many reasons. One of them is that it involves a presidential hopeful. I want to get into the impact of this on the 2024 presidential race. Will this indictment hurt or help Trump, politically?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nWell, we're seeing that his base is doubling down. His base has long believed that he was a subject of what they call a witch hunt, that all these different investigations that happened over the years are part of some conspiracy or some effort just to go after Donald Trump because he's Donald Trump, and we are most definitely seeing those people dig in. That is for certain.\n\nThe bigger question is going to be whether or not more average, more moderate voters who maybe could take or leave Trump are going to want to follow him through this indictment. It's going to test anyone who's not loyal to the Trump brand and anyone who simply maybe disagrees with Biden or just wants a Republican in there because maybe they're just very much not a Democrat. And that, I think, is still a question that's very much up in the air.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what are Trump's presidential rivals saying in the wake of this indictment?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nSo we saw Asa Hutchinson come out, basically declare his campaign as the anti-Trump candidate in response to this news. He's always been pretty anti-Trump, so that's not surprising, and we knew that he might run for president. The news has been overshadowed by the rest of the details of this. Nikki Haley was the first one to actually declare her candidacy. She went on Fox News and she questioned whether this was a politically motivated indictment. Ron DeSantis has not declared, but most people believe he is running. So I guess we can call him a presumed candidate. He came out and said he wasn't going to help with any type of extradition from Florida to New York, obviously, because the President lives in Florida. Now, that didn't end up being an issue because he surrendered voluntarily, but what we're seeing are people who essentially come down on Trump's side and it's a, how far on the side of this new issue are people going to come down?\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin, we've grown accustomed to expect protests whenever Donald Trump is involved, really. Are we seeing that either in New York, in Florida, or anywhere around the country after this arraignment?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nWell, absolutely, one of the first people who said they were going to go to New York to protest was Marjorie Taylor Greene, a very, very staunch ally of the former president. She was going with the New York Republican Club, which is a club that is very much moving toward the far right. They have ties to this far right group in Austria, essentially. We are seeing his base galvanized over this. And this is a guy who has said, for eight years now, \"I'm the subject of a witch hunt. People are coming after me.\" And for people who believe that, this is the culmination. And so this is kind of their moment.\n\nThe difference is that most of the people doubling down are very much the Trumpians, the people who want specifically Trump. They don't want a Republican, they don't want a conservative, they don't want even a populist. They want him.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo shifting away from the politics of all of this, Erin, what do these charges mean culturally in the wake of the Me Too era?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nOne of the things that's hard to communicate out there is that a lot of people think this is essentially just about hush money to an adult film actress. And while that is what precipitated this alleged business fraud, these charges have absolutely nothing to do with sex, with affairs, marriage, any of that. This is about accounting, it's about finance, it's about how he paid and what he said those payments were for.\n\nBut, what you can't ignore about the former president is that he came to power right before the Me Too Movement started, and some might say that he helped precipitate that. In 2016, woman, after woman, after woman was accusing him of sexual misconduct, whether it was assault or harassment or any other type of misconduct. And then here you have two women, and they were the ones who he was trying to silence. So in a way, it's kind of like, wow, two women finally seemed to have an impact and take him down a notch.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin Mansfield, with some great perspective for us, thanks so much.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHours after being arraigned in New York, former President Donald Trump was already back at his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate. There, he told supporters this:\n\nDonald Trump:\n\nAnd I never thought anything like this could happen in America.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTrump's 27-minute speech centered on describing various investigations as attempts to thwart his presidential campaign. He made false claims about the investigations and claimed, without evidence, that he's being singled out for political reasons. He especially went after New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg, calling him a failed district attorney and even going after his family.

Finland and Sweden began seeking expedited NATO membership along with the military support it can provide within weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sweden continues to wait for approval. The move more than doubles the length of NATO's border with Russia. In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement warning of retaliatory measures.\n\n♦\n\nMilwaukee Judge Janet Protasiewicz won a nationally watched judicial election yesterday that'll likely give liberals the edge on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. She defeated former justice Daniel Kelly in a race that was largely defined by abortion access in the state. Abortions were made illegal there after the US Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last summer. A ruling will likely be issued later this year around a lawsuit brought by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul to block the law. The Protasiewicz win gives liberals a four to three majority on Wisconsin's high court. The ruling could also have an impact on the state's congressional maps. Democrats might be emboldened to push for maps that split Wisconsin's congressional delegation more evenly. You can read more on USATODAY.com.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

Will it matter?", "text": "Opinion staff\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nToday is the day. Former President Donald Trump has been charged with 34 felony counts for allegedly falsifying business records. The charges are connected to hush money payments made to multiple people, including a former porn star and a Playboy Playmate. Trump surrendered at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office in New York Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIt will be a historic event that could impact the 2024 election and American politics for years to come. You can read coverage of today's news developments with USA TODAY's live blog.\n\nHere is where you can get running commentary and analysis of the arraignment and what comes next. We will be providing commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and in the comments here.\n\nTrump charged with 34 felonies\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has now been charged with 34 more felonies than any president in American history. The previous record was zero.\n\nAs if to celebrate this ignominious accomplishment, Trump’s presidential campaign immediately released a fake mug shot of the one-term, twice-impeached and now indicted president on a fundraising email because, apparently, being charged with felonies for falsifying business records is cool. I guess it bumps the street cred among what Trump has often called “the forgotten men and women of our country.”\n\nRead Trump's indictment:Former President Donald Trump charged with crimes in New York\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts which, given his proclivity for lying, is not the most reliable claim. Still, he’s innocent until proven guilty, so we’ll give him the same benefit of the doubt he has given Hillary Clinton, President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden and all the other never-even-remotely-indicted people he has said should be immediately imprisoned.\n\n– Rex Huppke, USA TODAY columnist\n\nTrump's legacy: He had less honor and was more crooked than Richard Nixon\n\n34 counts. All felonies. Donald Trump, only three years ago the most powerful person on the planet, is now arrested, charged and officially the most disgraced president in American history.\n\nHis presidential legacy is that he was more crooked and had less honor than Richard Nixon. As someone who grew up in the Watergate era, I didn’t think that was possible.\n\nBut Trump continues to lower the legal, ethical and moral standards for high office in this country.\n\nI wish I felt outrage that our nation elected this man and that tens of millions of Americans seemingly still support him. Instead, I feel deep sadness for what America has become.\n\n– Tim Swarens, USA TODAY Opinion deputy editor\n\nTrump will use arrest to dominate news cycle. Don't let him.\n\nLike many Americans and probably just people of the world, I'm watching the arraignment of Donald Trump play out.\n\nNetwork television is bursting with coverage. What are the charges? Will there be a mugshot?\n\nThese are all very important questions that are being asked and questions that news outlets will spend their day and week answering.\n\nI'll instead ask these questions:\n\nDid you know that thousands of kids in Tennessee marched on their state Capitol because they're tired of being afraid of dying at school?\n\nDid you know that gas prices are about to go back up because of OPEC oil cuts?\n\nDid you know that more than a dozen states will likely be at risk for severe weather and tornadoes?\n\nThose are trick questions by me, tbh. I know you know. Because those are the things Americans are dealing with. Those are the things Americans need help with.\n\nSo by all means, let Trump feel the full balance and force of the legal system. It's important. Just please remember that there is so much more happening that has a much bigger impact on our lives.\n\n– Louie Villalobos, USA TODAY Opinion deputy editor\n\nWhen can we finally be done with the angry old man of Mar-a-Lago?\n\nDonald Trump ought to be just an angry old man rattling and ranting around Mar-a-Lago while the rest of America and the world go about confronting the many serious problems we face.\n\nBut, of course, Trump has neither the decency nor the humility to simply fade away.\n\nSo, the sad and embarrassing spectacle of the arraignment of a former American president on criminal charges takes on more importance than it otherwise should because Trump, against all that is right and sane, may yet get the Republican presidential nomination next year.\n\nAnd given the deep chasm of political polarization that separates Americans, Trump, like virtually any GOP nominee, would be favored to win a minimum of 25 states. Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin might then be all that stands between us and what should be an unfathomable nightmare.\n\nWill the criminal charges brought against Trump by a grand jury and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg be enough to finally rid us of the Mar-a-Lago megalomaniac? I’m skeptical. The Trump dead-enders are beyond persuasion.\n\nI want to believe that Trump is unelectable – and the last three national elections are strong evidence in favor of that conclusion. But I also fear that we as Americans may be forced to put that hope to the test next year, no matter what happens in a New York courtroom in the months ahead.\n\n– Tim Swarens, USA TODAY Opinion deputy editor\n\nThe key word for everything surrounding this spectacle is “embarrassing.” Trump never came close to fulfilling his promise to make America great, but as the justice system finally catches up to him, he and those in his orbit have succeeded spectacularly at making America embarrassing.\n\nLike President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment by the House of Representatives.\n\nOr think former President Richard Nixon and Watergate. Nixon was never charged with anything, but we certainly don't take pride in his swath of presidential history. Trump’s situation is already far worse, and at least Nixon, unlike the Malcontent of Mar-a-Lago, was willing to do the right thing and go away.\n\n– Rex Huppke, USA TODAY columnist\n\nTrump indictment is embarrassing moment in US history:Trump's entire presidency was 'unprecedented.' His arraignment is just plain embarrassing.\n\nAlvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who now holds a bigger spotlight than any prosecutor since Donald Trump's old nemesis Robert Mueller, will likely show his hand publicly for the first time on Tuesday with the unsealing of an indictment handed down last week by a grand jury.\n\nA number of legal experts whom I've spoken with describe the case, based on what is now known publicly, as far from a slam dunk for prosecutors who are used to winning the vast majority of their cases.\n\nTrump, of course, is facing other criminal investigations beyond Bragg's office – an investigation by the district attorney in Atlanta over possible election interference in trying to overturn his election loss in the state in 2020; and a separate probe by Jack Smith, special counsel under the U.S. Justice Department, into Trump's retention of classified documents after he left the White House and possible election interference.\n\nThose investigations face their own legal hurdles if they are to be prosecuted. But Bragg, as the first one out the door, faces the most intense scrutiny, with Trump already attacking the prosecutor in ugly terms as an \"animal\" and raising the specter of violence from his prosecution.\n\nWith so much at stake, Bragg needs to get it right.\n\n– Eric Lichtblau, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter and author\n\nWhat is the evidence against Trump?:How strong is the case against Donald Trump? Why Alvin Bragg better get it right.\n\nIt’s possible to acknowledge that Democrats are overplaying their hand while also questioning why Trump keeps finding himself in these legal tangles. Don’t get me wrong. It seems pretty obvious that the Manhattan prosecutor is stretching the bounds of his office to make a name for himself, and many legal experts have questioned the soundness of the anticipated felony charges.\n\nSince before Trump became president, Democrats have overplayed their hand with investigations and claims that have proved untrue. And it’s possible that if Trump is indeed charged in the hush money case, it will actually help him politically.\n\nA recent poll showed the majority of Republicans and right-leaning independents think they would have a better shot at winning the White House with someone other than Trump.\n\nYet Trump’s hardcore base has remained fairly constant, and a Democratic “witch hunt” could be just the thing to win him even more support.\n\nTrump did some good things while president, including the appointment of three excellent Supreme Court justices. The reality at this point, however, is that he comes with too much baggage that he brought on himself, from the bizarre election denial in 2020 to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nDespite the real political motivation behind these criminal investigations into Trump, at some point Republicans need to ask themselves hard questions about why it is he keeps finding himself in these sticky situations.\n\nIsn’t it time to move on?\n\n– Ingrid Jacques, USA TODAY columnist\n\nTrump has overplayed his hand:Donald Trump wants you to think he's constantly the victim. Maybe he's just a bad dude.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg will be prosecuting a case that has been widely criticized as long on politics and short on the law. And he will have an even more unpalatable prospect in putting two key witnesses on the stand embodying a case that borders on the legally indecent: a former porn star and a disbarred lawyer.\n\nThe star witness is one of the most repellent figures in New York. It is only the latest reinvention of Michael Cohen – this time from legal heavy to redemptive sinner. Cohen spent much of his time when he worked for Trump threatening critics, journalists and even students.\n\nCohen may be joined on the stand by Stormy Daniels, who agreed to a $130,000 payment to hush up an alleged affair with then-businessman Trump. Bragg would have to show that Trump made the payment only with the election in mind, which would have made the money an undeclared campaign donation to himself. But there are a host of other reasons why a married celebrity would want to hush up a one-night stand with a porn star.\n\nIn John Edwards' prosecution in 2012, the Justice Department used the same theory to charge the former Democratic presidential candidate after a disclosure that he not only had an affair with filmmaker Rielle Hunter but also sired a child with her. Edwards denied the affair, and it was later revealed that Fred Baron, Edwards' campaign finance chairman, gave money to Hunter.\n\nThe Justice Department spent a king's ransom on the case to show that the third-party payments were a circumvention of campaign finance laws, because the payments were designed to bury an election scandal. Edwards was ultimately found not guilty on one count while the jury deadlocked on the other five.\n\nThe jury clearly believed there were ample reasons to hush up the affair beyond the election itself.\n\nOne could say that Trump and Cohen deserve each other, but the legal system does not deserve what may soon unfold in a New York courtroom.\n\n– Jonathan Turley, Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University\n\nWill Trump be arrested?:Between sketchy witnesses and the law, case comes up short.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/04/trump-arrest-arraignment-indictment/11594742002/", "title": "What's next for Trump?

Fingerprinting?\n\nBefore his arraignment, Trump was processed, mostly, like every other defendant in the criminal justice system. The former president went through the standard proceedings behind closed doors, including:\n\nA Miranda warning: Trump was read the standard Miranda warning that is given to all criminal suspects. He was told he had the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and that anything he said could be used against him in a court of law.\n\nTrump was read the standard Miranda warning that is given to all criminal suspects.

The indictment was unsealed to the public and Merchan outlined the charges against him, which were 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nAfterwards, Trump pleaded not guilty and was later released. Due to the nature of the charges, which are non-violent, and Trump being a first-time offender, the former president was not placed in jail.\n\nTrump's lawyers told reporters outside the courthouse after his arraignment that Trump is \"frustrated\" with the indictment, but determined to fight the allegations both legally and politically.\n\n\"He's frustrated, he's upset,\" Todd Blanche, one of Trump's attorney's said. \"It's not going to stop him.\"\n\nRelated:Donald Trump plans to turn his arraignment into a political spectacle. Here's how.\n\nWhat's next for Trump in court?\n\nTrump’s arraignment starts a legal process that could result in a trial, but Trump’s legal team is likely to file various pre-trial motions that includes dismissing the case outright or a change of venue.\n\nLegal analysts and experts told USA TODAY that Trump has plenty of avenues to slow-walk the case, something he hasn’t shied away from in his other court battles.\n\nMore in-depth coverage:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nDavid Super, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the arraignment will set a schedule for the future proceedings, setting deadlines for any motions the prosecutions or defense wishes to file – this is how Trump's legal team will fight the case.\n\n\"The most likely motion would be a motion to dismiss the case since obviously, President Trump has been very vocal that he believes this is unfounded,\" Super said.\n\nAfter the arraignment, prosecutors will have a 35-day deadline to provide Trump's legal team with relevant evidence to the case. This will open another legal avenue for Trump, Super said. Trump's legal team will be able to file more motions to suppress various pieces of evidence.\n\nAnd while all those legal challenges play out, Trump will be able to conduct business as usual as he gears for the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\n\nWhat's next for Trump in the GOP 2024 White House race\n\nPolitically, Trump’s campaign is hoping the criminal charges increase GOP turnout in Trump's favor.

Trump rebuffed taking any plea, they said, in part because of the potential political impact it could have of admitting any guilt.\n\nTwo Trump Organization entities are charged with nine counts of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors allege was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.\n\nIf convicted, the Trump Organization would face maximum fines of $1.6 million – the most allowed under New York state law for the charged conduct. The company would not be dissolved or face any other consequences. The Trump Organization has pleaded not guilty and has said the prosecution is politically motivated.\n\nNew York’s star witness is the Trump Organization’s long-time Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company where he has worked for nearly 50 years.\n\nWeisselberg pleaded guilty in August for failing to pay taxes on $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation he received in the form of a company-funded apartment in New York City, the lease on two Mercedes Benz, private school tuition for two of his grandchildren, and personal expenses including new beds and flat-screen televisions. As CFO, Weisselberg was the top executive handling the books of the company.\n\nOver the past several weeks Weisselberg has met with Manhattan prosecutors and lawyers for the Trump Organization to prepare for his testimony. He is not expected to implicate Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump or Eric Trump when he testifies.\n\nUnder his plea deal, Weisselberg agreed to testify truthfully at the trial, but he is not in a cooperation deal with the prosecution, which continues to investigate the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nIf he lives up to the terms of the deal, Weisselberg will face 100 days in jail, compared with 15 years in state prison that prosecutors said they would seek if they’re unsatisfied with his testimony.\n\n“He is required to testify truthfully regardless whether the prosecutors or defense lawyers are asking him questions,” said Weisselberg’s attorney, Nicholas Gravante Jr. of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. “This is not a cooperation agreement in that he is not required to meet with either side to be interviewed or prepared in advance of his testimony. However, Mr. Weisselberg has elected to meet, has met, and will continue to meet with both sides in order to assure that his testimony goes smoothly.”\n\nAlso expected to testify for the government is Jeffrey McConney, the Trump Organization’s controller. He is named as a co-conspirator in the indictment but was granted immunity to testify before the state grand jury investigating the company.\n\nTrump’s legal troubles continue\n\nTrump’s decision to forge ahead appears comes as his legal troubles intensify. The Justice Department is investigating Trump’s handling of classified documents and presidential records at Mar-a-Lago as well as efforts to stop the certification of the 2020 election results and transfer of power to President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump is also under criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney’s office in Georgia for efforts to subvert the election results in the peach state.\n\nHis legal exposure goes beyond the criminal investigations and include multiple lawsuits ranging from the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, a defamation lawsuit brought by former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, to a $250 million lawsuit filed last month by New York state Attorney General Letitia James. James sued Trump and his three eldest children and alleged they defrauded lenders and insurance companies by manipulating the value of condos, golf courses and office buildings on financial statements used to obtain favorable rates. Trump has denied wrongdoing in all of the lawsuits.\n\nThe Trump team is made up of New York criminal defense lawyers Alan Futerfas and Susan Necheles. They recently brought on for the trial two Philadelphia-based attorneys who represented Trump during his second impeachment trial tied to January 6: Michael van der Veen, a personal injury attorney, and William Brennan, who has represented clients on weapons charges and sexual assault charges.\n\nThe lead prosecutors on the case are Susan Hoffinger, the executive assistant district attorney and chief of investigations and long-time criminal defense lawyers, and senior trial counsel Joshua Steinglass, who has been in the Manhattan district attorney’s office for over two decades. He has prosecuted dozens of cases, including nearly a dozen members of the Proud Boys for a 2018 assault outside the Republican Club on New York’s Upper East Side.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

Fresh from a row with Russia over the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Biden will throw himself into another geopolitical crisis when he visits Northern Ireland, a country that has been without a functioning executive for over 400 days. Biden’s isn’t the only intervention from a US president on the subject, though. Bill Clinton gave an interview to the Irish broadcaster RTE this week, saying it is a “miracle” the Good Friday Agreement survived Brexit. Clinton took part in last-minute talks before the landmark deal was signed in 1998 and called it an act of “bravery from all sides”. Clinton also took the opportunity to urge the Democratic Unionists, who are yet to return to power-sharing at Stormont amid a stalemate over Brexit, to engage with the institutions in the wake of Rishi Sunak’s Windsor framework with the EU. “I think we should say, ‘look, there’s something to work with here’,” said Clinton. “[Sinn Fein] doesn’t want to jam you, they want to work with you to resolve these things. How can we live together? How can we work together? How can we all put our heads on the pillow at night and feel at peace about what our children are going to face?” While Biden is known to share the same views as Clinton on the Stormont stalemate it is understood he will not be visiting the site of the executive itself on his trip, in the hope perhaps of keeping a lower profile than his immediate predecessor in the White House managed this week.
