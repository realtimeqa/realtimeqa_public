Kennedy Library and Museum that his goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50% in the next 25 years. The President also said he wants to “create a more supportive experience for patients and families.”\n\nThe President – who lost his son to brain cancer – spoke in personal, passionate terms about his goal, which he called “bold, ambitious” and “completely doable.”\n\n“Cancer does not discriminate red and blue. It doesn’t care if you’re Republican or Democrat. Beating cancer is something we can do together,” the President said discussing the administration’s efforts to cut the number of deaths from cancer in the United States in half over the next 25 years.\n\nBiden’s speech came on the 60th anniversary of Kennedy’s original “Moonshot” speech, in which he unveiled his goal of landing a man on the Moon.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's what's been accomplished since JFK's 'moonshot' speech 01:58 - Source: CNN Business\n\n“When he set that goal, he established a national purpose that could rally the American people in a common cause and he succeeded,” Biden said of Kennedy. “Now, in our time, on the 60th anniversary of his clarion call, we face another inflection point. And together, we can choose to move forward with unity, hope and optimism. And I believe we can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone – the same national purpose that will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills to end cancer as we know it and even cure cancers once and for all.”\n\nTo “break the logjams” in Congress, Biden said he would use his authorities as President to increase funding for cancer research.\n\nThe President also announced that Dr. Renee Wegrzyn will become the inaugural director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, which is a new agency that aims to “drive biomedical innovation that supports the health of all Americans.” He is also expected to sign an executive order that will launch a National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative, the White House said.\n\n‘We’re finally going to make infrastructure begin to work’\n\nThe midterm elections are less than 60 days away, and Biden’s travel to Boston is his latest effort aimed at capitalizing on the political momentum spurred by recent legislative achievements and dropping gas prices.\n\nEarlier Monday, the President highlighted projects made possible by the bipartisan infrastructure law at Boston Logan International Airport’s Terminal E. New spending from the infrastructure law, he said, will create more than 5,000 jobs and expand capacity and increase accessibility at the airport.\n\nBiden, at the airport, stressed the importance of competing with other countries like China in addition to rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure.\n\n“We risk losing our edge as nation to China, and the rest of the world is catching up. That stops now, with investments like we’re celebrating here today,” the President said.\n\nBiden said: “Folks, America invented modern aviation. But we’ve allowed our airports to lag behind our competitors. Today, not a single solitary American airport, not one, ranked in the top 25 in the world. The United States of America. Not one airport ranks in the top 25 in the world. What in the hell’s the matter with us? It means commerce, it means income, it means security.”\n\nThe investments in the airport include $50 million to modernize Terminal E and $12 million to improve roadways. The President said in addition to being frustrating and inconvenient for passengers, traffic jams and delays on airport runways cause air pollution that harms the environment and directly affects neighboring communities.\n\nBiden told reporters Monday ahead of his trip to Boston: “We’re finally going to make infrastructure begin to work. We’re making a major investment as you know, up in a great city with an airport that is really behind the times, as most are. And we’re going to be spending a lot of money and we’re going to get it done quickly, and we’re going to go all through America making our airports the best in the world.”\n\n‘People are beginning to focus on what’s going on’\n\nOn Monday evening, the President also participated in a reception for the Democratic National Committee hosted at the home of Jonathan Lavine, the co-managing partner of Bain Capital.\n\nIn remarks at the event, according to reporters in the room, the President ticked off what he sees as his administrative accomplishments – including major legislative wins, lower gas prices and a reduction in inflation. He also sought to highlight how the nation is at an “inflection point” in history.\n\n“The fact is that extreme Republicans are going to take us backward,” Biden said, adding that “there’s a lot at stake and we have to choose a different path.”\n\nBiden warned the group, “If we lose the House and lose the Senate, it’s going to be a really difficult two years. I’ll be spending more time with the veto pen.”\n\nThe President pointed to a poll showing that his approval rating had improved, but added, “I don’t know how that holds.”\n\n“But I know … people are beginning to focus on what’s going on,” he continued. “We have to stay in the game. We have to stay in a big way. … There’s a lot at stake. … I don’t want to start from scratch again.”\n\nThe event hosted approximately 40 attendees and was expected to raise $2 million for the DNC and the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, according to a DNC official.\n\nBiden’s schedule for the rest of the week, as outlined by the White House, includes a celebration at the White House for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill – as well as a trip to the key battleground state of Michigan.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}]}

Egg prices soared 39.8%, while flour got 23.3% more expensive. Milk rose 17% and the price of bread jumped 16.2%.\n\nMeat and poultry also grew costlier. Chicken prices jumped 16.6%, while meats rose 6.7% and pork increased 6.8%. Fruits and vegetables together are up 9.4%.\n\nOverall, grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8%.\n\nEgg prices have soared over the past year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nWhy there’s no relief at the grocery store\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to tame inflation, but the central bank says that food prices are largely out of its control.\n\nThat’s because food prices are affected by global events, such as the war in Ukraine, which affects the costs of wheat and other commodities. Prices also reflect the impact of natural disasters like crop-killing droughts and diseases such as avian flu, which has constrained the supply of eggs and turkeys.\n\nPlus, it takes time for changes, such as decreases in ingredient prices, to funnel down to consumers. That means that relief from the surge grocery prices could lag declines in other areas.\n\nAnd demand for food isn’t flexible — consumers may be able to skimp on other items, such as clothing or gasoline, but they have to eat. Even so, shoppers are increasingly making changes to their diets and shopping habits to cope with rising costs.\n\nPeople are pulling back on certain items. Sales of frozen dinners and entrees have fallen about 11% by volume in August compared to the year prior, according to a report this week from IRI, a market research company. Cookie volumes and volumes of refrigerated juices fell nearly 9% and about 8%, respectively, in that period. Lower-income households in particular are skipping items like juice, snacks and candy.\n\nRecently, Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers, who may be trading down from more expensive restaurants. And Tyson (TSN) has noticed higher demand for chicken as shoppers buy fewer pricey steaks.\n\nWhat got more expensive\n\nThe seasonally adjusted prices of most grocery items ticked up from July to August, but there were some standouts.\n\nMargarine spiked the most, up 7.3%. Eggs were 2.9% more expensive and sugar was 2.4% higher, while flour and bread edged up 2.2%. Canned fruit prices rose 3.4% while fresh vegetables got 1.2% pricier.\n\nHot dog prices jumped 4.9%, while ham was up 1.3% and turkey rose 2.2%.\n\nSome meat prices fell, however. Bacon was .5% less expensive, while the price of pork roasts, steaks and ribs fell 1.9%.\n\nAnd some fruit prices moderated as well, with apples getting 2.3% cheaper and citrus fruits falling 1.6%.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}]}

He starred in the Bucs’ 19-3 win over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.\n\nAfter a year-long absence, Williams made a brief return to singles tennis this year when she competed at Wimbledon, the National Bank Open, the Western & Southern Open and the US Open, winning three matches. She also competed in doubles tennis in several tournaments.\n\n“I feel like tennis has given me so much and I feel like there’s no way that I don’t want to be involved in tennis somehow in the future,” she said.\n\n“I don’t know what that involvement is yet, but I do know that I love the sport so much.”\n\nOver the course of her 27-year tennis career, Williams won 39 grand slam titles across singles and doubles and 73 WTA Tour singles titles.\n\nAs part of her plans to “evolve away from tennis,” Williams said she would be focusing on her young family, as well as pursuing her business interests and charity ambassador roles.\n\nShe has also authored her first children’s book, “The Adventures of Qai Qai,” about a young girl’s journey with her doll and best friend, Qai Qai.

Jean-Luc Godard, the most iconoclastic of New Wave directors, had invented a resolutely modern, intensely free art. We lose a national treasure, a genius outlook.”\n\nBorn December 3, 1930 in Paris, France, to a doctor and a daughter of a Swiss investment bank founder, Godard hailed from a wealthy family, according to Reuters.\n\nWhile studying a degree in ethnology at the University of Paris, his foray into filmmaking began with the short movie “Opération Béton” (“Operation Concrete”) in 1954.\n\nJean-Luc Godard, photographed in the 1970s, has died at the age of 91. Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images\n\nGodard’s first feature film, “À bout de souffle” (“Breathless”) in 1960, was a celebration of the nonchalant improvisational cinematography that became synonymous with his style.\n\nIn the years that followed, his films revolved around complex issues such as fickleness, indignity and caprice.\n\nAmong his notable later works were his “trilogy of the sublime,” which consisted of three films that explored femininity, nature and religion – 1982’s “Passion,” the following year’s “Prénom Carmen” (“First Name: Carmen”) and “Je vous salue, Marie” (“Hail Mary”) in 1985.\n\nDanish-French actress Anna Karina, who starred in multiple works and was also married to the director for a short time, said working with Godard often meant they didn’t have a script and had to learn the dialogue just before shooting.\n\nMuch like his filmography, Godard had an idiosyncratic, rebellious streak. At the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, he appeared at a press conference via video chat instead of physically attending.\n\nDuring his long career, he was awarded an honorary César in 1987 and 1998, and received an honorary Academy Award in 2010.\n\nMany tributes have been posted on social media by members of the movie industry.\n\nIn a tweet, actor Antonio Banderas thanked Godard for “expanding the boundaries of the cinema.”\n\nEdgar Wright, the director known for “Baby Driver” and “Hot Fuzz,” called him “one of the most influential, iconoclastic film-makers of them all.”\n\nWright tweeted: “It was ironic that he himself revered the Hollywood studio film-making system, as perhaps no other director inspired as many people to just pick up a camera and start shooting.”\n\nFrench newspaper Liberation was the first to report Godard’s death.", "authors": ["Arnaud Siad Hafsa Khalil", "Arnaud Siad", "Hafsa Khalil"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}]}

That fact is unchanged. But anything less than complete accuracy in the data that we report – regardless of the size or the reason – is inconsistent with the standards of excellence to which Columbia holds itself,” the statement reads. “We deeply regret the deficiencies in our prior reporting and are committed to doing better.”\n\nIn February, Columbia Mathematics Professor Michael Thaddeus questioned the Ivy League school’s rise in rankings from 18th place, on its debut in 1988, to 2nd place in 2021. In a statement posted on Columbia University’s Department of Mathematics’ website, Thaddeus noted that “few other top-tier universities have also improved their standings, but none has matched Columbia’s extraordinary rise.”\n\nThaddeus pointed to data submitted by the university to U.S. News & World Report in questioning Columbia’s seemingly meteoric rise in rankings.\n\n“Can we be sure that the data accurately reflect the reality of life within the university?” Thaddeus rhetorically asked. “Regrettably, the answer is no.”\n\nThe math professor then tabulated data on “undergraduate class size, percentage of faculty with terminal degrees, percentage of faculty who are full-time, and student-faculty ratio” submitted by Columbia University to U.S. News & World Report and compares the data “with figures computed by other means, drawing on information made public by Columbia elsewhere.”\n\nIn his findings, Thaddeus said there were “discrepancies sometimes quite large” which seemed to always work in Columbia’s favor.\n\nIn response to Thaddeus’ findings, Columbia University Provost Mary Boyce said in a June statement that the university would “refrain from submitting data to U.S. News and World Report” for consideration in the publication’s 2022 undergraduate college rankings.\n\n“On two of the metrics questioned by our faculty member [Thaddeus], class size and faculty with terminal degrees, we determined we had previously relied on outdated and/or incorrect methodologies. We have changed those methodologies for current and future data submissions, as reflected in the newly posted Common Data Sets,” Boyce noted in June.\n\nBoyce said starting Fall 2022, the university would start participating in the Common Data Set (CDS) Initiative, “a collaborative effort among data providers in the higher education community and publishers” to provide accurate information to students seeking information on institutions of higher education, according to the initiative’s website.\n\nThe CDS Initiative, represented by U.S. News & World Report, the College Board and educational services company Peterson’s, was launched in 1997 to provide institutions of higher education with “a set of standards and definitions of data items rather than a survey instrument or set of data represented in a database.”\n\nU.S. News Chief Data Strategist Robert Morse told CNN Monday that schools report most of the information for their Best Colleges rankings directly to U.S. News.\n\n“Each year, U.S. News sends an extensive questionnaire to all accredited four-year colleges and universities,” he explained. “U.S. News, a founding member of the Common Data Set initiative, incorporates questions from the CDS and proprietary questions on this survey. U.S. News relies on schools to accurately report their data.”\n\nCoupled with the commitment of participating in the CDS Initiative, Boyce also announced the launch of a new webpage providing detailed context and analysis of the Columbia University undergraduate experience.\n\nIn July, U.S. News & World Report unranked Columbia University “from a number of rankings in the 2022 edition of Best Colleges (first published September 2021)” saying that the university “failed to respond to multiple U.S. News requests that the university substantiate certain data it previously submitted,” according to a blog post by U.S. News. It is unclear whether Thaddeus’ publication of his investigation into the data that Columbia presented to U.S. News & World Report may have contributed to the university being unranked.\n\nIn Friday’s statement, Boyce said the university posted two Common Data Sets, one for the Columbia College and Columbia Engineering, and one for Columbia General Studies.\n\n“The information included in the two Common Data Sets reflects the University’s work in recent months to review our data collection processes, following questions raised by a faculty member regarding the accuracy of certain data the University submitted to U.S. News and World Report in 2021 for its ranking of undergraduate universities,” Boyce said.\n\n“U.S. News publishes annual rankings for more than 11,500 schools and hundreds of individual programs as part of the Best Colleges, Best Graduate Schools, Best Online Programs, Best Global Universities and Best High Schools rankings,” Morse said in a statement Monday.\n\n“To produce the rankings, U.S. News collects tens of thousands of data points from the schools themselves and other sources, including the U.S. Department of Education, state and local governments and higher education associations. A very small proportion of the total number of schools that are ranked – typically less than 0.1% each year – inform U.S. News that they have misreported data that were used to calculate their school’s ranking.”\n\nU.S. News & World Report released a breakdown of how their publication calculated the 2022-2023 Best Colleges Rankings in an article Monday.", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian"], "publish_date": "2022/09/11"}]}

But Bruegel, a European economic think tank, analyzed statistics from Russia’s top 34 trading partners recently and estimated that China accounted for roughly 24% of Russia’s exports in June.\n\n“China-Russia trade is booming because China is taking advantage of the Ukraine crisis to buy Russian energy at a discount and replace Western firms that have exited the market,” said Neil Thomas, a senior analyst on China at Eurasia Group.\n\nRussia displaced Saudi Arabia in May as the top supplier of oil to China.

The country didn’t even appear on SWIFT’s list of top 15 yuan markets in February.\n\nRussian companies and banks are also increasingly turning to the yuan for international payments.\n\nLast week, Russia’s Gazprom said it would start billing China in yuan and ruble for natural gas supplies, while Russia’s VTB bank said it was launching money transfers to China in yuan.\n\nFor Beijing, it’s a boost to its ambitions to make the yuan a global currency.\n\n“Increased Russian use of the yuan also helps to inch forward China’s long-term goals to make the redback a global currency, to insulate itself from Western financial sanctions, and to enhance its institutional power in international finance,” said Thomas from Eurasia Group.\n\nFor Russia, this partnership with China “is born of desperation,” said Krach.\n\n“Because Russia has been severely weakened, in part by sanctions, Putin is willing to do a deal with a predatory power so long as it gains access to capital,” he added.\n\nChinese companies fill the vacuum\n\nChinese companies are also taking advantage of the exodus of Western brands from Russia.\n\nChinese smartphones accounted for two-thirds of all new sales in Russia between April and June, Reuters reported, citing Russia’s top electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado. Their total share in Russia has steadily increased from 50% in the first quarter, to 60% in April, and then to more than 70% in June, M.Video said.\n\nXiaomi was the best-selling smartphone maker in Russia in July, holding 42% of the market, according to Russian media Kommersant.\n\nSamsung (SSNLF), once the market leader, had only 8.5% of the market in July. Apple (AAPL) held 7%. The two companies accounted for almost half of the Russian market prior to the Ukraine invasion, but suspended sales of new products in the country after the war began.\n\nChinese cars have also flooded Russia.\n\nPassenger cars from Chinese manufacturers accounted for almost 26% of Russia’s market in August, the highest on record, according to Russian analytical agency Autostat. That compares with just 9.5% in the first quarter.\n\nMajor global auto players, including Ford and Toyota, have pulled back from Russia this year.\n\nLimits in ‘no limits’ partnership\n\nBut there are also significant limits in the China-Russia partnership, analysts said.\n\nChina is not providing military, commercial, or technological support that would “risk significant US sanctions on China,” said Thomas at Eurasia Group.\n\n“Beijing will not sacrifice its own economic interests to support Moscow,” he said.\n\nFearing a US backlash, China has so far “steadfastly” refused to violate international sanctions against Russia, forcing Moscow to request military support from North Korea, said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n“Beijing’s refusal to violate US and international sanctions reflects its begrudging acceptance that China remains reliant on Western capital and technology to sustain its ongoing development, even though Xi is personally inclined to assist Putin’s war effort,” he said.\n\nMoreover, China’s rapid economic slowdown this year will further constrain Xi’s willingness to help Putin. The Chinese president won’t want to risk anything that further destabilizes the economy mere weeks before he’s poised to secure an historic third term at the Communist Party’s congress.\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nFuture relations will likely remained strained, and China will want to keep its options open, analysts said.\n\n“There’s always been mistrust between the two regimes, which historically treated each other as rivals,” Krach noted.\n\nThe current Sino-Russia partnership is mainly a “defensive” one, enhanced by Beijing and Moscow’s shared view that NATO and the United States pose a “palpable national security threat,” said Susan Thornton, senior fellow and visiting lecturer at Yale Law School.\n\n“Russia’s war in Ukraine is not in China’s interest, but given Western hostility, China will not oppose Russia,” she added.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}]}
