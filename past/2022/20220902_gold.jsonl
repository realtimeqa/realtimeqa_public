{"question_id": "20220902_1", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/us/jackson-water-system-failing-thursday/index.html", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs Mississippi’s capital city entered a fourth day on Thursday with little or no water flowing from faucets, authorities were scrambling to get a failing water treatment plant plagued by decades of deferred maintenance back online.\n\nThe problem – which comes on top of a boil-water notice in effect for more than a month – has upended life in the city of roughly 150,000 residents, where schools were shuttered this week, businesses are forced to adapt and people have had to wait in long lines for bottled water they can use to drink, cook or brush their teeth.\n\nAfter days of work on the plant – including Wednesday’s installation of a rental pump – “significant gains” were made by Thursday morning, and water pressure is returning in some areas, city officials said. Areas closer to the plant “are experiencing almost normal pressure,” while areas farther away still have low to no pressure, they said.\n\n“We made some positive gains within the system. We are encouraged,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will head on Friday to Jackson, CNN has learned. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Jackson, which the governor said will let Mississippi tap into critical resources to respond to the crisis.\n\nThe tap water problem came to a head Monday, when river flooding nudged an already-damaged main treatment plant to failure, meaning many of Jackson’s faucets were delivering barely – if any – water. In some cases, the water has been brown.\n\nCity residents already had been told to boil their water since late July because of quality concerns, and the water system has been troubled for years.\n\nWater spews Thursday from a drain outside of Metrocenter Mall in Jackson, Mississippi. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe rental pump installed Wednesday at the treatment plant will help add 4 million more gallons of water a day into the system, authorities said they believe. The state also contracted with outside operators to begin work on critical emergency repairs.\n\nThe treatment plant sends treated water to above-ground tanks spread across the city, and those tanks – which send water to homes and businesses – are supposed to be full for optimal pressure, Gov. Tate Reeves has said. Failure of the plant’s pumps led tank levels to drop.\n\nMore than half the tanks “have begun filling back up,” city officials said Thursday in a news release. The plant’s pressure output increased to 78 pounds per square inch as of Thursday morning, while the goal is 87 psi, the release said.\n\nProper pH-measuring also is a challenge, Reeves said Thursday.\n\n“There have been some challenges with the sensors that are measuring the pH balance of the water coming into the facility,” Reeves said, adding operators at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant have worked with and “seen every pH level and they know exactly what they need to add” to normalize imbalances.\n\n“We think there is a potential for a relatively quick fix on that to get those sensors accurate,” the governor said. Officials are not sure the quick fix will work, but state and local officials want to try it, Reeves said.\n\nBut even as fixes are made, service has fluctuated. “There will be future interruptions … they are not avoidable at this point,” Reeves said Wednesday, adding he also urged residents not to drink the water without boiling it.\n\nLumumba was optimistic Wednesday water service could be restored this week, he said then, but “there is a huge mountain to climb in order to achieve that.”\n\nDaily life upended in Jackson\n\nWhile authorities rush to make repairs, get needed parts and deal with staffing shortages at Jackson’s water plants, the crisis is upending daily life.\n\nResidents are seeing cloudy, discolored water coming out of their faucets and are being told it should be adequate for sanitation purposes. They can’t use the water to drink, cook or wash dishes, but they can shower and wash their hands in it, officials said.\n\n“Please make sure in the shower that your mouth is not open,” Jim Craig, senior deputy and director of health protection at the Mississippi Department of Health, told residents Wednesday, adding pets should also not consume the water.\n\nIt’s not known when residents will no longer have to boil water, and that can’t be assessed until the water pressure returns to normal, the mayor has said.\n\nResidents have endured long lines to get bottled water and non-drinking water at distribution sites operated by the city. Some sites this week ran out of water and turned people away. The state Thursday opened seven new sites for distributing bottled water, in addition to city distribution sites, Reeves said.\n\nNational Guard tankers full of nonpotable water are seen Thursday at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds in Jackson, Mississippi. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nJackson resident Anita Shaw, 63, arrived early Thursday at a site where the Salvation Army was to distribute bottled water – a site the group says ran out of 2,700 cases a day earlier before everyone in a long line could get one.\n\nShaw expressed frustration: Residents have been without clean water service for more than a month; not everyone can afford to keep buying bottles, and lines for free water are long. Water coming from her faucet Thursday was light brown, she told CNN.\n\nShe’s still had to pay her $100 water bill, she said.\n\n“I paid $100 … and can’t use the water,” Shaw said. “What good is paying the water bill when you can’t use the water?”\n\nAll Jackson public schools shifted to virtual learning Tuesday. Jackson State University also shifted to online classes this week and set up portable showers and toilets across campus.\n\n“It’s like we’re living in a nightmare right now,” sophomore Erin Washington told CNN. Another student described seeing brown, smelly water coming out of faucets on campus.\n\nBusinesses – many still trying to recover from Covid-19-related setbacks – are also struggling. Most affected is the city’s hospitality industry, said Jeff Rent, president and CEO at Greater Jackson Chamber Partnership.\n\n“Hotels and restaurants, already on thin margins, either cannot open or they have to make special accommodations including the purchase of ice, water and soft drinks,” Rent said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant is seen Wednesday in Ridgeland, north of Jackson, Mississippi. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nLonger-term fixes are needed\n\nThough Jackson has seen numerous water problems over the years, acute problems have cascaded since late July, when cloudy water was noticed at the city’s O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant. The state imposed a boil-water notice for Jackson, because the cloudiness carries higher chance that the water could contain disease-causing organisms.\n\nAround the same time, the main pumps at O.B. Curtis – the city’s main treatment plant – were severely damaged, forcing the facility to operate on smaller backup pumps, Reeves said this week without elaborating on the damage. The city announced August 9 that the troubled pumps were being pulled offline.\n\nCity officials and Reeves’ office have not responded to CNN’s requests for details about the damage and the causes.\n\nLast week, the governor was warned that Jackson would soon fail to produce running water, Reeves said.\n\nThen, flooding: Heavy rains last week pushed the Pearl River to overflow and flood some Jackson streets, cresting Monday.\n\nIntake water from a reservoir was impacted by the heavy rainfall, creating a chemical imbalance on the conventional treatment side of the plant, Craig said Wednesday. This affected particulate removal, causing that side of the plant to be temporarily shut down and resulting in a loss of water distribution pressure.\n\nEven with the installation Wednesday of the temporary pump, substantial mechanical and electrical issues remain due to deferred maintenance, including various pumps and motors that must be replaced and sludge in basins that has accumulated to levels that are “not acceptable,” Craig said.\n\nStaffing issues have further complicated matters, officials said.\n\nQuad Johnson, center, carries packages of bottled water Wednesday to cars at a water distribution site at Grove Park Community Center in Jackson, Mississippi. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nJackson’s water system also got walloped in February 2021, when a severe winter storm hit, freezing and bursting pipes and leaving many residents without water for a month.\n\nThat came after the city’s water system in early 2020 failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection, which found the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA also recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi.\n\nAdvocates have previously pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of Jackson’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources to address them. About 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nAsked Wednesday about claims that the deterioration of the water infrastructure in Jackson is a result of environmental racism, Reeves said the state does not run the water systems.\n\n“In the state of Mississippi, we have a large number of municipalities that run their own water system. We have a large number of rural water associations that run their own water system. Prior to Monday of this week, the state of Mississippi runs exactly zero water systems,” he said.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh Jason Hanna Amir Vera", "Nouran Salahieh", "Jason Hanna", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}]}

They might just be worth eight figures at auction.\n\nA Mickey Mantle baseball card from 1952 sold for a jaw-dropping $12,600,000 early Sunday morning, according to a news release from Heritage Auctions shared with CNN. The sale makes the card the most valuable sports collectible in the world, according to the auction house.\n\nThe price almost doubled the previous record for a baseball card set when a rare Honus Wagner sold for $6.6 million last year. And it also beat out the record for any item of sports memorabilia, bypassing the $9.3 million sale of Diego Maradona’s famous ‘Hand of God’ jersey.\n\nThe Mickey Mantle card is especially valuable because it’s so well-preserved. The card was graded “Mint+ 9.5” by the Sportscard Guaranty Corporation, according to Heritage Auctions.\n\nMantle spent 17 years playing for the New York Yankees and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974. The record-breaking card is from his rookie season and was produced by trading card giant Topps.\n\nFor the auction house, the sale represents the growing draw of sports collectibles.\n\n“An eight-figure auction result in the sports market was the stuff of fantasy just a decade ago,” said Chris Ivy, Heritage’s director of sports auctions, said in the release.\n\n“We always knew this card would shatter records and expectations. But that doesn’t make it any less of a thrill to be part of an auction during which a single item breaks the eight-figure threshold for the first time. It’s an extraordinary accomplishment for our wonderful team of sports experts at Heritage Auctions. And, of course, we could not have done it without our consignor, Anthony Giordano, who put his trust in Heritage to bring this amazing card to market.”\n\nAnthony Giordano bought the Mantle card for what was a record-breaking price in 1991: $50,000. He kept it hidden away for three decades before bringing it to Heritage Auctions, according to the release.\n\n“It bears the finest qualities any 1952 Topps can possess: perfect centering, registration and four sharp corners,” said Ivy in the release. “That this Mantle rookie card remained in this condition for 70 years is a true miracle.”", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/08/28"}]}

I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me,” she said.\n\nAt her post-match news conference Monday, Williams was asked if this is definitely her last tournament.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve been pretty vague about it, right?” she said with a smile. “I’m going to stay vague because you never know.”\n\nThe opening-round win over Kovinić was the best Williams had looked since making her comeback from injury. She has managed to win just one match since returning to the circuit in June and was unable to get close to the form that helped her win her last grand slam title in 2017.\n\nBut Kontaveit, who had said she was excited to play against Williams, encountered a player who showed no signs of wanting to hasten her retirement.\n\n“I think she played really well,” said the Estonian during the post-match news conference. “I mean, I thought I didn’t play a bad match at all.”\n\nAfter the players split the first two sets, Williams stepped up her play for the decider, Kontaveit said.\n\n“She really switched it on from there,” she said. “There’s a few points here and there where I feel like I could have done better on my serve maybe. I mean, she was returning better. She was playing the rallies better. I felt like she did everything a little bit better in the third set.”\n\nThe passionate pro-Williams crowd was also a challenge, Kontveit added.\n\n“I mean, I think they were not rooting like against me. They just wanted Serena to win so bad,” she said. “So, I mean, I don’t think it’s a personal attack against me or anything. I mean, it’s fair.

This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion. If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.”\n\nThe updated boosters have instructions that tell our cells to make antibodies against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19: the original strain and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share the same spike.\n\nPfizer/BioNTech’s updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people 12 and older. Moderna’s updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people 18 and older.\n\nThe CDC said in the statement that it “also expects to recommend updated COVID-19 boosters for other pediatric groups” in the coming weeks.\n\nPeople are eligible for the updated boosters as long as they have completed all primary doses in their vaccine series. The committee recommended that the new boosters be given at least two months after the last dose of any Covid-19 vaccine and up to three months after an infection.\n\nThe new formulations do not replace shots for the primary series.\n\nThe boosters were approved based on studies in mice bred to have human ACE-2 receptors – the doors the coronavirus uses to get into our cells – but clinical trial data showing how well they may work in humans won’t be available for another month or two.\n\nThis is similar to the way annual flu shots are studied and approved, but it’s the first time for Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nIn approving the vaccines, regulators also reviewed data behind different two-strain boosters. Those carry instructions to fight the original strain of the Omicron variant, BA.1, along with the original virus. Those boosters have been studied in about 1,400 people. They have been authorized for use in the UK and Canada but will not be available in the US.\n\nSeveral of the committee members said Thursday that they were uncomfortable recommending a vaccine with no human data to back it.\n\n“We’re been extrapolating the data that has been seen with the bivalent BA.1, and hopefully, we’ll have similar data for BA.4 and BA.5,” said Dr. Pablo Sanchez, a pediatrician at Ohio State University and a member of the committee.\n\n“So I’m just concerned about that extrapolation. And because and ultimately, I really don’t want to establish a precedent of recommending a vaccine that we don’t have clinical data,” said Sanchez, who voted against the recommendation.\n\nThat prompted a quick rebuttal from government experts who work with the committee.\n\n“I just would like to remind the committee that every year, we use influenza vaccines that are based on new strains without clinical studies being done,” said Dr. Melinda Wharton, associate director for vaccine policy at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nDr. Doran Fink, deputy director of the FDA’s Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications, said, “I do appreciate the amount of discomfort that I’m hearing from committee members who are being asked to take this leap with the Covid vaccines that they haven’t been asked to make previously with the Covid vaccines.\n\n“FDA felt very comfortable with the approach of extrapolating the safety and effectiveness or rather the known and potential benefits,” Fink said. “We recognize that we’ve taken a different path than the regulatory authorities have in Europe and Canada.”\n\nFink said the US chose to go this route based on feedback from its independent advisory group and projections for the viruses that may be circulating in this country over the fall and winter.\n\nOn Thursday, the committee saw new modeling data that suggested there were substantial risks to waiting to roll out new boosters.\n\nAccording to the CDC’s forecasts, boosters given to US adults in September could prevent 137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 deaths than if the boosters were held until November.\n\nNew analyses on the cost-effectiveness of the boosters suggest that the US could save at least $63 billion in medical costs between August and March 31 if as many people get these boosters as got flu shots during the 2021-22 season.\n\nIn the studies that looked at the shot targeting BA.1 along with the original, the boosters broadened immunity against many variants, and they were proven to be better than the older single-strain boosters because they made higher levels of antibodies.\n\nModerna presented tantalizing data suggesting that the two-strain shots it developed against the Beta variant might extend the length of protection people get from their vaccines, which currently drops off significantly after about four months. It said a study on these results was being prepared for publication\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn mice bred to have human ACE-2 receptors, the two-strain vaccines against BA.4 and BA.5 protected better against infections in their lungs, compared with the original vaccine.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe uncrewed Artemis I mission will get another attempt at launching on a journey around the moon on Saturday.\n\nThe two-hour launch window opens at 2:17 p.m. ET on September 3.\n\nAfter the launch was scrubbed Monday morning, the launch team spent the remainder of the day evaluating data gathered during the attempt. Mission managers shared an update Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Artemis I stack, which includes the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, continues to sit on Launchpad 39B at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nOne of the rocket’s four RS-25 engines, identified as engine #3, could not reach the proper temperature range that is required for the engine to start at liftoff.\n\nThe engines need to be thermally conditioned before supercold propellant flows through them before liftoff. To prevent the engines from experiencing any temperature shocks, the launch controllers increase the pressure of the core stage liquid hydrogen tank to send a little bit of the liquid hydrogen to the engines. This is known as a “bleed.”\n\nThe liquid hydrogen is about minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 252 degrees Celsius).\n\nEngine #3 was probably about 30 to 40 degrees warmer than the other engines, which reached about minus 410 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 245 degrees Fahrenheit), said John Honeycutt, manager of the Space Launch System Program at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama.\n\nMission managers suspected that the engine #3 issue was actually a problem with the bleed system, rather than the actual engine. A faulty sensor may be providing an incorrect reading of the engine temperature, Honeycutt said.\n\n“The way the sensor is behaving doesn’t line up with the physics of the situation,” Honeycutt said.\n\nThe team plans to begin the bleed 30 to 45 minutes earlier in the countdown than it occurred on Monday and monitor the engine temperature during the bleed.\n\n“Coming into yesterday’s attempt, we said that if we couldn’t thermally condition the engines, we’re not going to launch,” Sarafin said. “That’s the same posture that we’re going into Saturday.”\n\nRemoving and replacing the sensor would be tricky at the launchpad, so the only alternative is rolling it back into the Vehicle Assembly Building for servicing, said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, Artemis launch director at NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program.\n\nSeveral other issues, like storms, a leak on an 8-inch line used to fill and drain the rocket core stage’s liquid hydrogen and a hydrogen leak from a vent valve on the core stage’s intertank also caused delays Monday morning that prevented liftoff during the two-hour launch window.\n\n“”We agreed on what was called option one, which was to operationally change the loading procedure and start our engine chill down earlier. We also agreed to do some work at the pad to address the leak that we saw at the hydrogen tail service mask umbilical,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager, NASA Headquarters.\n\nThe current forecast for Saturday includes a chance of showers and thunderstorms in the morning and early afternoon hours, so the launch team will keep a close eye on the forecast, said meteorologist Mark Burger, launch weather officer with the US Space Force’s 45th Weather Squadron.\n\nThere is a 60% chance of a weather violation during the launch window, Berger said.\n\nThere is still a backup opportunity for the Artemis I mission to launch on September 5 as well.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is just the beginning of a program that will aim to return humans to the moon and eventually land crewed missions on Mars.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misspelled meteorologist Mark Burger's name.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}]}
{"question_id": "20220902_9", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/success/child-raising-costs-rise/index.html", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nSoaring inflation has made almost everything more expensive. And it has significantly increased the cost of one major budget buster – raising kids.\n\nIt now costs $310,605 for a married middle-income couple with two children to raise their youngest child from birth through high school, according to a recent estimate from the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe estimate builds on a 2017 report from the US Department of Agriculture. Back then, the agency estimated that it cost a middle-income, married couple $233,610 to raise a child to the age of 17. The price factored in expenses for food, shelter and other necessities for a child born in 2015, but notably not the cost of a college education.\n\nBrookings found that today’s record-high inflation has dramatically increased those costs. Brookings first shared the numbers with the Wall Street Journal.\n\n“It causes people to recognize that when you start having a family or when you increase the size of your family, you’re going to have to make some tradeoffs with other items in your budget,” said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings Institution who authored the study with Brookings’ senior research assistant Morgan Welch.\n\nHousing is the biggest expense for families and accounts for almost a third of the total child-rearing costs. The median home price in July – $403,800 – was up 10.8% from a year ago, marking more than a decade of year-over-year monthly gains. And prices rose across the country, with 80% of US metro areas seeing double-digit home price increases last quarter.\n\nFood is the second most expensive budget item when raising a child, the USDA found, making up 18% of the total cost in its original calculation. Sawhill noted their most recent estimation did not adjust the allocation of costs for different items.\n\nOver the past year, grocery prices rose 13.1%, the largest annual increase since 1979, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found. Almost every grocery staple is more expensive due to inflation – prices for eggs soared 38%, chicken jumped to 17.6% and milk is up 15.6%.\n\nSawhill said the estimate already had to make a big assumption about what inflation is going to look like in the future. The number is still based on expenses for a child born in 2015, so Brookings had to estimate the inflation rate past the child’s current age of seven.\n\nWhen it put out its estimates, the USDA had been using an inflation rate of 2% from 2015 onward, but Sawhill assumed 4% in the new estimation by looking at historical trends that arose after the US emerged from the high inflation rate environment of the late 1970s.\n\n“In ’79, the Federal Reserve stepped hard on the brakes to bring down what was at that time, double-digit inflation,” Sawhill said. “And it took at least a decade for those numbers to get back to normal.”", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}]}
