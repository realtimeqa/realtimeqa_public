Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the robot was operating without a tether for the first time. Robotics developers often use tethers to support robots because they aren’t capable enough to walk without falling and damaging themselves.\n\nThe Optimus’ abilities appear to significantly trail what robots from competitors like Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics are capable of. Boston Dynamics robots have been seen doing back flips and performing sophisticated dance routines without a tether.\n\nTesla plans to use its AI expertise to develop a humanoid robot. Tesla\n\n“The robot can actually do a lot more than we just showed you,” Musk said at the event. “We just didn’t want it to fall on its face.”\n\nTesla also showed videos of its robot performing simple tasks like carrying boxes and watering plants with a watering can.\n\nMusk claimed that if the robot was produced in mass volumes it would “probably” cost less than $20,000. Tesla maintains that Optimus’ advantage over competitors will be its ability to navigate independently using technology developed from Tesla’s driver-assistance system “Full Self Driving,” as well as cost savings from what it has learned about manufacturing from its automotive division. (Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” requires a human that is alert and attentive, ready to take over at any time, as it is not yet capable of fully driving itself.)\n\nTesla has a history of aggressive price targets that it doesn’t ultimately reach. The Tesla Model 3 was long promised as a $35,000 vehicle, but could only very briefly be purchased for that price, and not directly on its website. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 now costs $46,990. When Tesla revealed the Cybertruck in 2019, its pick-up truck that remains unavailable for purchase today, it was said to cost $39,990, but the price has since been removed from Tesla’s website.\n\nTesla AI Day is intended largely as a recruiting event to attract talented people to join the company.\n\nMusk claimed the robot could be transformative for civilization. The robot displayed Friday, despite its limitations compared to competitors, was significantly ahead of what Tesla revealed a year ago, when a person jumped on stage in a robot suit and danced around.\n\n“‘Last year was just a person in a robot suit,” Musk said before the robot walked on stage. “We’ve come a long way. Compared to that, it’s going to be very impressive.”\n\nTesla is not the first automaker to develop a humanoid robot. Along with Hyundai’s Boston Dynamics, Honda worked on robots dubbed “Asimo” for nearly 20 years. In its final form, Asimo was a child-size humanoid robot capable of untethered walking, running, climbing and descending stairs, and manipulating objects with its fingers.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}]}

Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nThe hurricane’s impact on local municipalities in Florida and South Carolina is so severe that it is expected to slash third-quarter economic growth in those states by 3 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, according to Oxford Economics.\n\nWhat’s more, the storm also stands to take a bite out of national gross domestic product growth in the near term.\n\nGregory Daco, chief economist with EY Parthenon, projected Hurricane Ian could have a -0.3 percentage point impact on third-quarter GDP and bring down fourth-quarter GDP by 0.1 percentage points. Taking Ian’s estimated impact into account, Daco now projects GDP growth of 1.7% in the third quarter and a contraction of 1.4% in the fourth quarter.\n\n“You have power outages, you have flight cancellations, you have disruptions to energy extraction and refinement, you have disruptions to crops — all of those are part of normal economic activity,” Daco said.\n\nAnd some of that lost economic activity is never regained or even fully replaced by reconstruction efforts, he said.\n\n“We have to be careful about this so-called ‘broken window fallacy’ — this idea that if you break a window, because you have to repair it, you’re essentially generating output,” he said. “That does not hold in the case of a natural disaster in any form.”\n\n“You do not double up on the energy production after a hurricane; you do not double your crops … you’re not going to work twice as hard next week because you had no power this week,” he added.\n\nAlthough an immense effort of reconstruction and repair work will be undertaken, and that effort will bolster economic output, the benefits will filter out over multiple months, he added.\n\n“In terms of the impact on growth, it’s likely to be invisible, relative to the national economy,” he said.\n\nThe magnitude of impact to local economies and to key tourism-centric industries in Florida and South Carolina are likely to be “severe,” according to Matthew Martin, a US economist with Oxford Economics.\n\n“Damage to Florida’s and South Carolina’s leisure and hospitality, retail trade and health care industries will be key for assessing the economic impact, since they collectively account for about 20% of each state’s GDP and 40% of jobs,” Martin wrote in a note published Friday.\n\nNoting the hurricane “does not pose a major threat to the US economy,” Martin wrote that the supply chain stress is expected to be relatively modest. The ports of Florida and Charleston, South Carolina, process less than 10% of total US imports, and some have already resumed operations, he wrote.\n\nA couple walks past damage from Hurricane Ian on Litchfield Beach, South Carolina on October 1, 2022. Melissa Sue Gerrits/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nStill, the impacts will be felt by a wide range of industries — among them aerospace, health care, electronics, automotive, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and manufacturing — at a time when supply chains are trying to recover from disruptions caused by the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine, said Bindiya Vakil, chief executive officer of Resilinc, which provides supply chain modeling and risk-management software to companies like IBM, General Motors and Amgen.\n\nMore than 4,600 facilities and more than 74,000 different types of parts are located in the affected areas in Florida, she said.\n\n“Ripple effects from [these types of events] can last for more than five to six months,” she said.\n\nThe affected parts cannot make it on time to factories that are relying on their delivery, Vakil said. Without these raw materials, those factories cannot deliver in time to their customers, she added, noting these disruptions could prove especially painful in industries such as consumer electronics and automotive.\n\n“These industries are already reeling from the semiconductor shortage,” she said.\n\nCNN Business’ Matt Egan contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}]}

Yates and released Monday, was based on more than 200 interviews and reveals the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) under the US Soccer Federation (USSF) failed to provide a safe environment for players.\n\n“Our investigation has revealed a league (NWSL) in which abuse and misconduct — verbal and emotional abuse and sexual misconduct — had become systemic, spanning multiple teams, coaches, and victims,” the report reads. “Abuse in the NWSL is rooted in a deeper culture in women’s soccer, beginning in youth leagues, that normalizes verbally abusive coaching and blurs boundaries between coaches and players.”\n\nThe report comes about a year after the 12-team NWSL was thrown into chaos following a report by The Athletic detailing allegations of sexual coercion and misconduct against Paul Riley, who coached three NWSL franchises over eight seasons. He was fired by the North Carolina Courage after The Athletic cited players on the record alleging that for years, Riley used his influence and power to sexually harass players and in one incident, coerce a player into having sex with him.\n\nRiley denied the accusations in the report. CNN has not been able to reach Riley for comment.\n\nIn the wake of that report, then-NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird resigned and the league called off all matches scheduled for that weekend. By the end of the year, half of the league’s teams had parted ways with their coaches after player complaints, the Yates report notes.\n\nMonday’s report states that sexual misconduct and abuse was far more widespread than just one coach or incident.\n\n“In well over 200 interviews, we heard report after report of relentless, degrading tirades; manipulation that was about power, not improving performance; and retaliation against those who attempted to come forward,” the report states. “Even more disturbing were the stories of sexual misconduct. Players described a pattern of sexually charged comments, unwanted sexual advances and sexual touching, and coercive sexual intercourse.”\n\nThe league said Monday it would review the findings.\n\n“We recognize the anxiety and mental strain that these pending investigations have caused and the trauma that many — including players and staff — are having to relive,” the league said in a statement.\n\nThe league’s own investigation in conjunction with the players’ union is ongoing, the NWSL said.\n\nThe Yates report features submitted first-hand accounts from players who describe abuses from head coaches as well as team management.\n\nIn one case, a head coach allegedly asked a player to review match footage 1-on-1 at his house only to show pornography instead. According to the report, the same manager “sexually coerced” that player and “grabbed and groped her in public, but out of view.”\n\nThere are multiple allegations or findings in the report of sexual harassment and misconduct by head coaches.\n\nThe report notes abusive coaches were able to move from team to team despite accusations levied against them because the league and the federation feared the organizations could be named in any potential defamation or employment lawsuits.\n\nYates recommends a public “list of individuals disciplined, suspended, or banned by USSF, a USSF Organization Member, or SafeSport.”\n\nThe US Center for SafeSport is an organization authorized by Congress and designed to end sexual, emotional and physical abuse in Olympic sports.\n\n“This is very emotional for me, and honestly I’m having trouble absorbing everything in the report,” US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone told reporters during a video conference call. “I think it will take some time to really read through it and think about the actions and inactions of certain people and then will take us some time to think about what needs to be done in terms of discipline.”\n\nEarlier, she said the US Soccer Federation, as the national governing body for soccer, “is fully committed to doing everything in its power to ensure that all players — at all levels — have a safe and respectful place to learn, grow and compete.”\n\nThe NWSL players association praised the players who cooperated with the investigation and spoke up about the abuse and misconduct.\n\n“As difficult as this report is to read, it has been even more painful for Players, whether known or unknown, to live it. We appreciate their efforts to seek the truth in support of our work to transform NWSL,” the association said.\n\n“These stories have inspired us to engage in collective action to bring about change. By sharing our stories, Players are reclaiming the League and the sport,” the association added.\n\nUS Soccer initiated the investigation a year ago by hiring Yates and the legal firm King and Spalding to review allegations, conduct interviews and recommend solutions. The federation says it gave Yates and the firm full autonomy and access in order to produce a complete, independent report.\n\nA US Soccer statement noted the federation’s board of directors had voted to release the full report on Monday while preserving “victim privacy and confidentiality.”", "authors": ["David Close Eric Levenson", "David Close", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nScientists had long hoped and theorized that the most common type of star in our universe — called an M dwarf — could host nearby planets with atmospheres, potentially rich with carbon and perfect for the creation of life. But in a new study of a world orbiting an M dwarf 66 light-years from Earth, researchers found no indication such a planet could hold onto an atmosphere at all.\n\nThe mission, which includes some historic firsts, moved forward even as rising geopolitical tensions brew on the ground.\n\nThe four crew members — astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada of NASA, astronaut Koichi Wakata of JAXA, or Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and cosmonaut Anna Kikina of Roscosmos — took off aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft at 12 p.m. ET from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nAfter reaching orbit, NASA shared footage of the crew aboard their capsule, sharing their excitement as they explained that they brought along a “freefall indicator” — a small, stuffed doll in the likeness of Albert Einstein. The toy was left to float around the cabin, signaling that the crew had entered weightlessness.\n\nEinstein, who first conceptualized the Theory of Relativity, had the “happiest thought of his entire life” when he realized that a “person in freefall can feel their own weight,” Cassada explained in a dispatch from the Crew Dragon spacecraft.\n\n“We live in the same world, we live in the same universe. Sometimes we experience it in a very different way from our neighbors. We can all keep that in mind … and continue to do amazing things,” Cassada said, and Kikina could be seen pumping her fist as he spoke. “And do it together.”\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, October 5.

Terry Renna/AP Prev Next\n\nDubbed Crew-5, the mission is the sixth astronaut flight launched as a joint endeavor between NASA and SpaceX, a privately held aerospace company, to the space station.\n\nThe spaceflight marks a historic moment, as Mann not only became the first Native American woman ever to travel to space. She’s also serving as mission commander, making her the first woman ever to take on such a role for a SpaceX mission.\n\nWhat’s more, Kikina is the first Russian to join a SpaceX mission as part of a ride-sharing deal NASA and Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, inked in July. Her participation in the flight is the latest clear signal that, despite mounting tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the decades-long US-Russia partnership in space will persist — at least for now.\n\nThe Crew Dragon spacecraft is now on a slow, precise trek to the ISS, which orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface. The spacecraft is aiming to dock with the space station on Thursday around 5 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s notable about this flight?\n\nLaunching NASA astronauts to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft is nothing new. The space agency collaborated with SpaceX for years to transition the task of shuttling people to and from the space station after NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nWith the return of astronaut launches from US soil, SpaceX has offered a stage for several historic firsts. The Crew-4 Dragon mission, for example, carried NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins, the first Black woman ever to join the ISS crew.\n\nOn this flight, Mann, a registered member of the Wailacki tribe of the Round Valley Reservation, became the first Native American woman ever to travel to orbit.\n\n“I am very proud to represent Native Americans and my heritage,” Mann told reporters before launch. “I think it’s important to celebrate our diversity and also realize how important it is when we collaborate and unite, the incredible accomplishments that we can have.”\n\nIn her role as commander, Mann will be responsible for ensuring the spacecraft is on track from the time it launches until it docks with the ISS and again when it returns home with the four Crew-5 astronauts next year. Never before has a woman taken on the commander role on a SpaceX mission, though a couple of women served in that position during the Space Shuttle Program.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with Crew Dragon spacecraft sat at launch pad 39A on October 3 as preparations continued for the Crew-5 mission. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKikina, the Roscosmos cosmonaut, became the first Russian ever to launch on a SpaceX vehicle at a time when US-Russian relations are hitting near fever pitch over the Ukraine war.\n\nOfficials at NASA have said repeatedly that joint operations with Russia on the ISS, where the two countries are the primary operators, will remain isolated from the fray. Kikina’s flight comes just weeks after NASA’s Dr. Frank Rubio launched to the ISS aboard a Roscosmos Soyuz capsule.\n\n“I really love my crewmates,” Kikina told reporters after she arrived at the Florida launch site on Saturday. “I really feel good, comfortable. … We will do our job the best way: happy.”\n\nDuring a post-launch news conference, Sergei Krikalev, the executive director of Human Space Flight Programs at Roscosmos, commented on the significance of the US-Russian partnership.\n\n“We just continue what was started many years ago, in 1975 when the Apollo-Soyuz crew worked together,” Krikalev said, referring to an in-space meet up in 1975 that became a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation between the United States and Russia. “Now we continue that.”\n\nREAD MORE: Meet the space trailblazers of color who empowered others to dream\n\nWho are the other astronauts on board?\n\nMann and her fellow NASA astronaut Josh Cassada, who grew up in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, both joined NASA in 2013. Cassada has described Mann as one of his “closest friends on the planet.”\n\nAs with Mann, this mission is the first trip to space for Cassada and Kikina.\n\nFor veteran astronaut Wakata, who has previously flown on both NASA’s space shuttle and Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft, this trip marks his fifth spaceflight mission.\n\n“I still remember when I first flew and saw our beautiful home planet,” he recalled during an August press conference. “It was so wonderful, such a beautiful planet, then I felt very lucky to be able to call this planet our home.”\n\nWhat will they do in space?\n\nAfter reaching the ISS, the crew will join the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS — including four NASA astronauts, a European Space Agency astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThere will be a handover period, where the current ISS crew will help the newly arrived astronauts settle in before a separate Crew Dragon spacecraft brings the four astronauts who were part of SpaceX’s Crew-4 mission back home.\n\nThen the Crew-5 astronauts will set to work conducting spacewalks, during which astronauts exit the ISS, to maintain the space station’s exterior, as well as performing more than 200 science experiments.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on printing human organs in space, understanding fuel systems operating on the Moon, and better understanding heart disease,” according to NASA.\n\nCrew-5 is slated to return from space in about five months.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}]}

She was 90.\n\nLynn’s family said in a statement to CNN that she died Tuesday at her home in Tennessee.\n\n“Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills,” the statement read.\n\nThey asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial will be announced later.\n\nLynn, who had no formal music training but spent hours every day singing her babies to sleep, was known to churn out fully textured songs in a matter of minutes. She just wrote what she knew.\n\nShe lived in poverty for much of her early life, began having kids by age 17 and spent years married to a man prone to drinking and philandering – all of which became material for her plainspoken songs. Lynn’s life was rich with experiences most country stars of the time hadn’t had for themselves – but her female fans knew them intimately.\n\n“So when I sing those country songs about women struggling to keep things going, you could say I’ve been there,” she wrote in her first memoir, “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” “Like I say, I know what it’s like to be pregnant and nervous and poor.”\n\nLynn scored hits with fiery songs like “Don’t Come Home A’ Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ On Your Mind)” and “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man),” which topped the country charts in 1966 and made her the first female country singer to write a No. 1 hit.\n\nHer songs recounted family history, skewered lousy husbands and commiserated with women, wives and mothers everywhere. Her tell-it-like-it-is style saw tracks such as “Rated X” and “The Pill” banned from radio, even as they became beloved classics.\n\n“I wasn’t the first woman in country music,” Lynn told Esquire in 2007. “I was just the first one to stand up there and say what I thought, what life was about.”\n\nShe grew up dirt-poor in the Kentucky hills\n\nShe was born Loretta Webb in 1932, one of eight Webb children raised in Butcher Hollow in the Appalachian mining town of Van Lear, Kentucky. Growing up, Lynn sang in church and at home, even as her father protested that everyone in Butcher Hollow could hear.\n\nLoretta Lynn wears a cowboy hat and a fringe western style jacket while holding an acoustic guitar as she poses for a portrait in circa 1960 in Nashville, Tennessee. Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nHer family had little money. But those early years were some of her fondest memories, as she recounts in her 1971 hit, “Coal Miner’s Daughter”: “We were poor but we had love; That’s the one thing that daddy made sure of.”\n\nAs a young teenager, Loretta met the love of her life in Oliver “Doolittle” Lynn, whom she affectionately called “Doo.” The pair married when Lynn was 15 – a fact cleared up in 2012, after the Associated Press discovered Lynn was a few years older than she had said she was in her memoir – and Lynn gave birth to their first of six children the same year.\n\n“When I got married, I didn’t even know what pregnant meant,” said Lynn, who bore four children in the first four years of marriage and a set of twins years later.\n\n“I was five months pregnant when I went to the doctor, and he said, ‘You’re gonna have a baby.’ I said, ‘No way. I can’t have no baby.’ He said, ‘Ain’t you married?’ Yep. He said, ‘You sleep with your husband?’ Yep. ‘You’re gonna have a baby, Loretta. Believe me.’ And I did.”\n\nThe couple soon headed to Washington state in search of jobs. Music wasn’t a priority for the young mother at first. She’d spend her days working, mostly, picking strawberries in Washington state while her babies sat on a blanket nearby.\n\nBut when her husband heard her humming tunes and soothing their babies to sleep, he said she sounded better than the girl singers on the radio. He bought her a $17 Harmony guitar and got her a gig at a local tavern.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1960 that she’d record what would become her debut single, “Honky Tonk Girl.” She then took the song on the road, playing country music stations across the United States.\n\nAfter years of hard work and raising kids, telling stories with her guitar seemed like a break.\n\nLoretta Lynn performs in 2016 during South By Southwest in Austin, Texas.

She quickly befriended country star Patsy Cline, who guided her through the fame and fashion of country stardom until her shocking death in a plane crash in 1963.\n\nCline “was my only girlfriend at the time. She took me under her wing, and when I lost her, it was something else. I still miss her to this day,” Lynn told The Denver Post in 2009. “I wrote ‘You Ain’t Woman Enough to Take My Man,’ and she said, ‘Loretta, that’s a damn hit.’ It shocked me, because you don’t expect somebody like Patsy Cline to tell you that you have a hit. Right after she passed, I put the record out, and it was a hit.”\n\nHer best-known songs drew from her life and marriage\n\nLynn’s struggle and success became the stuff of legend, an oft-repeated story of youth, naivete and poverty.\n\nFrom “Fist City” to “You’re Lookin’ at Country,” Lynn always sang from the heart, whether she was telling off a woman interested in Doo or honoring her Appalachian roots. But her music was far from conventional.\n\nShe rankled the conservative country establishment with songs like “Rated X,” about the stigma fun-loving women face after divorce, and “The Pill,” in which a woman toasts her newfound freedom thanks to birth control – “They didn’t have none of them pills when I was younger, or I’d have been swallowing them like popcorn,” Lynn wrote in her memoir.\n\nShe documented her upbringing in the bestselling 1976 memoir “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” co-written with George Vecsey. A 1980 biographical film by the same name won an Academy Award for actress Sissy Spacek and brought Lynn wider fame. Lynn’s success also helped launch the music careers of her sisters, Peggy Sue Wright and Crystal Gayle.\n\nLynn’s legend faced questions in 2012 when The Associated Press reported that in census records, a birth certificate and marriage license, Lynn was three years older than what most biographies stated. It didn’t mar Lynn’s success, but did make the oft-repeated tales of her teen marriage and motherhood less extreme.\n\n“I never, never thought about being a role model,” Lynn told the San Antonio Express-News in 2010. “I wrote from life, how things were in my life. I never could understand why others didn’t write down what they knew.”\n\nLynn always credited her husband with giving her the confidence to first step on stage as a young performer. She also spoke in interviews, and in her music, about the pain he caused over their nearly 50 years of marriage. Doolittle Lynn died in 1996 after years of complications from heart problems and diabetes.\n\nIn her 2002 memoir, “Still Woman Enough,” Lynn wrote that he was an alcoholic who cheated on her and beat her, even as she hit him back. But she stayed with him until his death and told NPR in 2010 that “he’s in there somewhere” in every song she wrote.\n\n“We fought one day and we’d love the next, so I mean … to me, that’s a good relationship,” she told NPR. “If you can’t fight, if you can’t tell each other what you think – why, your relationship ain’t much anyway.”\n\nLynn won numerous awards throughout her career, including three Grammys and many honors from the Academy of Country Music. She earned Grammys for her 1971 duet with Conway Twitty, “After the Fire is Gone,” and for the 2004 album “Van Lear Rose,” a collaboration with Jack White of the White Stripes that introduced her to a new generation of fans.\n\nThen President Barack Obama awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Loretta Lynn in 2013. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nShe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988, and her song “Coal Miner’s Daughter” was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. She received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010, and in 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Lynn “gave voice to a generation, singing what no one wanted to talk about and saying what no one wanted to think about.”\n\nHer career and legend only continued to grow in her later years as she recorded new songs, toured steadily and drew loyal audiences well into her 80s. A museum and dude ranch are dedicated to Lynn at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.\n\n“Working keeps you young,” she told Esquire in 2007. “I ain’t ever gonna stop. And when I do, it’s gonna be right on stage. That’ll be it.”\n\nLynn was hospitalized in 2017 after suffering a stroke at her home. The following year she broke a hip. Her health forced her to quit touring.\n\nIn early 2021, at the age of 89, she recorded her 50th album, “Still Woman Enough.”\n\nThe title song, which she sang alongside successors Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire, sounded like a mission statement that captures the ethos of her career:\n\n“I’m still woman enough, still got what it takes inside;\n\nI know how to love, lose, and survive;\n\nAin’t much I ain’t seen, I ain’t tried;\n\nI’ve been knocked down, but never out of the fight;\n\nI’m strong, but I’m tender;\n\nWise, but I’m tough;\n\nAnd let me tell you when it comes to love;\n\nI’m still woman enough.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gumbrecht Scottie Andrew", "Jamie Gumbrecht", "Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}]}

It’s been a great honor.”\n\nHe said he never tried to focus on trying to hit a record home run.

Some observers think the ball is now worth millions of dollars.\n\n“We’ll see what happens with that. It’d be great to get it back,” Judge said. “But that’s a souvenir for a fan.

Your dad’s legacy, you want to uphold that, but getting a chance to meet their family, they’re wonderful people,” he said. “And getting a chance to have my name next to someone as great as Roger Maris, Babe Ruth and those guys is incredible.”\n\nBarry Bonds set the major league record with 73 home runs in 2001.\n\nThe other two players to hit more home runs than Judge in a season are Mark McGwire (who did so twice) and Sammy Sosa (three times).\n\nIt is unclear whether Judge will play Wednesday in the final game of the regular season, but he has an outside chance of winning the American League triple crown (leading the circuit in batting average, runs batted in and home runs).\n\nJudge is first in home runs and RBIs, but trails Minnesota Twins star Luis Arráez in batting average.\n\nHe said he wants to play but it will be up to Boone, who has to get his team ready for the playoffs.\n\nHome run records are not new to Judge.

Ashin Rangani/TMX\n\n“With all the publicity and excitement, plus the fact that it’s Aaron Judge of the Yankees, I wouldn’t be surprised if another auction house or sports investment group purchases the ball for $5 million in the current environment of the sports memorabilia market.\n\n“Assuming that Judge doesn’t play tonight [against the Rangers], this ball will live forever in New York Yankee lore.”\n\nHowever, Ken Goldin, the founder of Goldin Auctions, calls the $2 million price tag a “drastic overpay” and “more of a publicity stunt,” instead valuing the ball at $1.25 million.\n\n“It’s a historic achievement that is boosted by the fact he is a loved player and plays for the New York Yankees,” Goldin told CNN, adding that $1.25 million would make this the second most expensive baseball ever sold.\n\nIn 1999, Mark McGwire’s 70th home run baseball fetched $3 million at auction including commission, at the time making it the most money ever paid for a sports artifact.\n\nDavid Hunt, president of Hunt Auctions, agrees that higher valuations are used as a tool to generate “branding and media coverage” for auctions houses and that Judge’s 62nd home run ball is “more of a $500,000 to $1 million item from an estimated standpoint.”\n\n“But to be clear,” Hunt told CNN, “I certainly could see a path where it would bring a million or maybe even two if the proper bidders got involved. That’s not impossible.”\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, Lelands auction house called Judge’s 62nd home run ball “the most valuable baseball hit in recent years … estimated to fetch over seven figures.”\n\n“It’s just incredible that a $20 baseball can turn into a seven figure ball with one crack of the bat,” the statement added.\n\n‘We’ll see what happens’\n\nWhen Judge tied Maris’ record with his 61st home run last week, no fans were able to catch the ball as it fell into the bullpen and was eventually passed along to Judge, who then gave it to his mother.\n\nMichael Kessler, the 20-year-old fan who caught Judge’s 60th home run, exchanged the ball for a clubhouse meet-and-greet with the Yankees slugger, four signed baseballs and a signed game bat, according to MLB.com.\n\n“I don’t know where it’s at,” Judge told reporters when asked about the fate of his 62nd home run ball.\n\n“We’ll see what happens with that. It’d be great to get it back but that’s a souvenir for a fan. They made a great catch out there and they’ve got every right to it.”\n\nJudge runs the bases in Arlington, Texas, after hitting his 62nd home run of the season. Cooper Neill/MLB/Getty Images\n\nSince breaking Maris’ 61-year-old record with his 391-feet drive in the first inning of Tuesday’s game against the Rangers, Judge has received widespread praise – including from President Joe Biden.\n\n“Congrats @TheJudge44 on home run 62. History made, more history to make,” Biden wrote on Twitter.\n\nBarry Bonds holds the major league single-season record of 73 home runs, but many have cast doubt on that landmark given he – along with other players of that era – was embroiled in performance-enhancing drug scandals and allegedly used steroids. Bonds has denied those allegations.\n\n‘Special, historic piece’\n\nWhile it remains unclear whether Judge will play Wednesday in the final game of the regular season, he has an outside chance of winning the American League triple crown by leading the circuit in batting average, runs batted in and home runs.\n\nHe is first in home runs and RBIs but trails Minnesota Twins star Luis Arráez in batting average.\n\nIf Judge does play on Wednesday and hits another home run, that would likely alter the value of Tuesday night’s ball.\n\n“It’s not his final home run ball, it’s not the one that established a new record and thus it’s not nearly as viable,” Hunt explained.\n\nBut there’s also a scenario whereby Youmans’ catch only increases in value.\n\n“If we go another 15, 20, 30 years and nobody breaks that record, this could end up being a very, very special, historic piece, which would point towards a higher value range,” said Hunt.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}]}

Gavin Newsom signed the Freedom to Walk Act into law on Friday, according to a news release from Assemblymember Phil Ting, who wrote the bill.\n\nThe law stipulates that pedestrians can only be ticketed for jaywalking – or crossing outside of an intersection – if there is “immediate danger of a collision,” says the release.\n\nThe new law will take effect on January 1.\n\nIn the release, Ting seemed to reference racist policing and the unfair targeting of Black pedestrians for jaywalking arrests.\n\n“It should not be a criminal offense to safely cross the street. When expensive tickets and unnecessary confrontations with police impact only certain communities, it’s time to reconsider how we use our law enforcement resources and whether our jaywalking laws really do protect pedestrians,” said Ting.\n\n“Plus, we should be encouraging people to get out of their cars and walk for health and environmental reasons.”\n\nAccording to the release, jaywalking is “arbitrarily enforced” in California, and disproportionately affects “people of color and lower-income individuals who cannot afford tickets that can often total hundreds of dollars.”\n\nIn 2020, protests erupted when an Orange County sheriff’s deputy shot and killed Kurt Reinhold, a homeless Black man, after stopping him for allegedly jaywalking.

Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a brief news conference Sunday, Bolsonaro said the voting reflected the poor economic conditions felt by poorer Brazilians, and promised to appeal to voters who are worried about rising prices.\n\n“We have a second round ahead where everything becomes the same, the (television advertising) time for each side becomes the same. And now we are going to show it better for the Brazilian population, especially the most affected class, the consequence of the ‘stay at home, we’ll see the economy later’ policy,” Bolsonaro said.\n\nBolsonaro, who has routinely discredited the Brazilian electoral system and threatened to not accept its results, managed to beat Lula in the southeast states, the most populous of the country.\n\nMore than 123 million Brazilians waited in long lines to vote in the world’s fourth largest democracy, while another 32 million abstained. According to TSE President Alexandre de Moraes, the extensive queues were caused by new biometric security checks and higher than expected voter turnout.\n\nSeveral other presidential candidates were in the running but trailed far behind the two frontrunners.\n\nSimone Tebet of the Brazilian Democratic Movement came third with 4.1% of valid votes, and Ciro Gomes of the Democratic Labour Party received 3.05% of the vote.\n\nGomes said in a news conference Sunday that he is “deeply concerned” about Brazil’s political polarization. “I have never seen a situation so complex, so challenging, so potentially threatening to our fortunes as a nation,” he said.\n\nAfter voting alongside his wife, Rosangela da Silva, at a Sao Paulo school on Sunday, Lula told reporters: “We don’t want more discord, we want a country that lives in peace. This is the most important election. I am really happy.”\n\nHe also referenced the 2018 elections, where he had been unable to run – or vote – because of a corruption conviction that was overturned last year.\n\n“Four years ago I couldn’t vote because I had been the victim of a lie in this country. And four years later, I’m here, voting with the recognition of my total freedom and with the possibility of being president of the republic of this country again, to try to make this country return to normality,” Lula said.\n\nSupporters of Brazilian former President Luiz Inácio \"Lula\" da Silva react as they watch the vote count of the legislative and presidential election, in Sao Paulo, Brazil on October 2.

Bruno Kelly/Reuters Prev Next\n\nLula vs. Bolsonaro on the campaign trail\n\nWhile there were nearly a dozen candidates on the ballot, the race was dominated from the outset by Lula and Bolsonaro, two titans of Brazilian politics who engaged in a bruising campaign season marked by bitter verbal attacks and a series of violent incidents between rival supporters.\n\nBolsonaro, 67, ran for re-election under the conservative Liberal Party. He has campaigned to increase mining, privatize public companies and generate more sustainable energy to bring down energy prices. He has vowed to continue paying a R$600 (about $110) monthly benefit known as Auxilio Brasil.\n\nHis government is known for its support for ruthless exploitation of land in the Amazon, leading to record deforestation figures. Environmentalists are warning that the future of the rainforest could be at stake in this election.\n\nBolsonaro has also been widely criticized for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 686,000 people in Brazil have died from the virus.\n\nLula, 76, focused his campaign on getting Bolsonaro out of office and highlighted his past achievements throughout his campaign.\n\nHe left office with a 90% approval rating in 2011, and is largely credited for lifting millions of Brazilians from extreme poverty through the “Bolsa Familia” welfare program.\n\nHis campaign promised a new tax regime that will allow for higher public spending. He has vowed to end hunger in the country, which has returned during the Bolsonaro government. Lula also promises to work to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nLula, however, is also no stranger to controversy. He was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, on charges stemming from the wide-ranging “Operation Car Wash” investigation into the state-run oil company Petrobras. But after serving less than two years, a Supreme Court Justice annulled Lula’s conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for him to run for president for a sixth time.\n\nFollowers of former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio \"Lula\" da Silva react as they listen to the partial results after polls closed in Rio de Janeiro on October 2, 2022. Silvia Izquierdo/AP\n\n‘If they are clean elections, no problem’\n\nBolsonaro, who has been accused of firing up supporters with violent rhetoric, has sought to sow doubts about the result and said that the results should be considered suspicious if he doesn’t gain “at least 60%.”\n\nOn Saturday, he repeated claims that he expected to win in the first round of presidential elections “with a margin higher than 60%,” despite being 14 points behind in the most recent poll that day.\n\nBoth Bolsonaro and his Liberal Party have claimed that Brazil’s electronic ballot system is susceptible to fraud – an entirely unfounded allegation that has drawn comparisons to the false election claims of former US President Donald Trump.\n\nThere have been no proven instances of voter fraud in the electronic ballot in Brazil.\n\nThe Supreme Electoral Court has also rejected claims of flaws in the system, as “false and untruthful, with no base in reality.”", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha Kara Fox Rodrigo Pedroso Caitlin Hu", "Camilo Rocha", "Kara Fox", "Rodrigo Pedroso", "Caitlin Hu"], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}]}
