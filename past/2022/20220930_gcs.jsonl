Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOn Monday, a NASA spacecraft will deliberately slam into an asteroid called Dimorphos.\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission, or DART, aims to see if this kind of kinetic impact can help deflect an asteroid posing a threat to Earth.\n\nThis illustration shows the DART spacecraft heading toward the asteroid Dimorphos. John Hopkins APL/NASA\n\n“We are moving an asteroid,” said Tom Statler, NASA program scientist for the DART mission. “We are changing the motion of a natural celestial body in space. Humanity has never done that before.”\n\nHere’s what you need to know about this mission.\n\nWhat exactly is DART?\n\nThe DART spacecraft is about the size of a school bus. It has been traveling to reach its asteroid target since launching in November 2021. The spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid system on September 26. Impact is expected at 7:14 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere is it going?\n\nThe spacecraft is heading for a double-asteroid system, where a tiny “moon” asteroid, named Dimorphos, orbits a larger asteroid, Didymos.\n\nDidymos. which means “twin” in Greek, is roughly 2,560 feet (780 meters) in diameter. Meanwhile, Dimorphos measures 525 feet (160 meters) across, and its name means “two forms.”\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers).\n\nNeither Dimorphos nor Didymos is at risk of colliding with Earth – before or after the collision takes place.\n\nWhat will DART do?\n\nDART is going down in a blaze of glory. It will set its sights on Dimorphos, accelerate to 13,421 miles per hour (21,600 kilometers per hour) and crash into the moon nearly head-on.\n\nThe spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won’t obliterate the asteroid.\n\nInstead, DART will try to change the asteroid’s speed and path in space. The mission team has compared this collision to a golf cart crashing into one of the Great Pyramids – enough energy to leave an impact crater.\n\nThe impact will change Dimorphos’ speed by 1% as it orbits Didymos. It doesn’t sound like much, but doing so will change the moon’s orbital period.\n\nThe nudge will shift Dimorphos slightly and make it more gravitationally bound to Didymos – so the collision won’t change the binary system’s path around the Earth or increase its chances of becoming a threat to our planet.\n\nWhat will we get to see?\n\nThe spacecraft will share its view of the double-asteroid system through an instrument known as the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation, or DRACO.\n\nThis imager, which serves as DART’s eyes, will allow the spacecraft to identify the double-asteroid system and distinguish which space object it’s supposed to strike.\n\nThis instrument also is a high-resolution camera that aims to capture images of the two asteroids to be streamed back to Earth at a rate of one image per second in what will appear nearly like a video. You can watch the live stream on NASA’s website, beginning at 6 p.m. ET Monday.\n\nDidymos and Dimorphos will appear as pinpricks of light about an hour before impact, gradually growing larger and more detailed in the frame.\n\nDimorphos has never been observed before, so scientists can finally take in its shape and the appearance of its surface.\n\nWe should be able to see Dimorphos in exquisite detail before DART crashes into it. Given the time it takes for images to stream back to Earth, they will be visible for eight seconds before a loss of signal occurs and DART’s mission ends – if it was successful.\n\nThe spacecraft also has its own photojournalist along for the ride.\n\nA briefcase-size satellite from the Italian Space Agency hitched a ride with DART into space. Called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, or LICIACube, it detached from the spacecraft on September 11. The satellite is traveling behind DART to record what happens from a safe perspective.\n\nThree minutes after impact, LICIACube will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video of the impact plume and maybe even spy on the impact crater. The CubeSat will turn to keep its cameras pointed at Dimorphos as it flies by.\n\nThe images and video, while not immediately available, will be streamed back to Earth in the days and weeks following the collision.\n\nHow will we know if the mission was successful?\n\nThe LICIACube won’t be the only observer watching. The James Webb Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope and NASA’s Lucy mission will observe the impact. The Didymos system may brighten as its dust and debris is ejected into space, said Statler, the NASA program scientist.\n\nBut ground-based telescopes will be key in determining if DART successfully changed the motion of Dimorphos.\n\nThe Didymos system was discovered in 1996, so astronomers have plenty of observations of the system. After the impact, observatories around the world will watch as Dimorphos crosses in front of and moves behind Didymos.\n\nDimorphos takes 11 hours and 55 minutes to complete an orbit of Didymos. If DART is successful, that time could decrease by 73 seconds, “but we actually think we’re going to change it by about 10 minutes,” said Edward Reynolds, DART project manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nStatler said he would be surprised if a measurement of the period change came in less than a few days but even more so if it took more than three weeks.\n\nWhat if DART misses and doesn’t hit the asteroid?\n\n“I’m highly confident that we were going to hit on Monday, and it will be a complete success,” said Lindley Johnson, NASA planetary defense officer.\n\nBut if DART misses its proverbial dart board, the team will be ready to ensure the spacecraft is safe and all its information downloaded to figure out why it didn’t hit Dimorphos.\n\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory’s Mission Operations Center will intervene if necessary, even though DART will have been operating autonomously for the final four hours of its journey.\n\nIt takes 38 seconds for a command to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, so the team can react quickly. The DART team has 21 contingency plans it has rehearsed, said Elena Adams, DART mission systems engineer at the Applied Physics Lab.\n\nWhy do we need to test this, and why on this asteroid?\n\nDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is comparable to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. An asteroid the size of Dimorphos could cause “regional devastation” if it hit Earth.\n\nThe asteroid system is “the perfect natural laboratory” for the test, Statler said.\n\nThe mission will allow scientists to have a better understanding of the size and mass of each asteroid, which is crucial to understanding near-Earth objects.\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with an orbit that places them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) from Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe valuable data collected by DART will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially the understanding of what kind of force can shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that could collide with our planet.\n\nWhy don’t we just blow up the asteroid, like in ‘Armageddon’?\n\nMovies make combating asteroid approaches seem like a hurried scramble to protect the planet, but “that’s not the way to do planetary defense,” Johnson said. Blowing up an asteroid could be more dangerous because then its pieces could be on a collision course with Earth.\n\nBut NASA is considering other methods of changing the motion of asteroids.\n\nThe DART spacecraft is considered to be a kinetic impactor that could change the speed and path of Dimorphos. If DART is successful, it could be one tool for deflecting asteroids.\n\nAnother option is a gravity tractor, which relies on mutual gravitational attraction between a spacecraft and an asteroid to tug the space rock out of its impacting trajectory into a more benign one, Johnson said.\n\nAnother technique is ion beam deflection, or shooting an ion engine at an asteroid for long periods of time until the ions change the asteroid’s velocity and orbit.\n\nBut both of these take time.\n\n“Any technique that you can imagine that changes the orbital speed of the asteroid in orbit is a viable technique,” Johnson said.\n\nAn international forum called the Space Planning Commission has brought 18 national space agencies together to assess what might be best to deflect an asteroid, depending on its size and path.\n\nFinding populations of hazardous asteroids and determining their sizes are priorities of NASA and its international partners, Johnson said. The design for a space-based telescope called the Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission is currently in review.\n\nWill any other spacecraft fly by Dimorphos in the future?\n\nThe Didymos system won’t be lonely for too long. To survey the aftermath of the impact, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will launch in 2024. The spacecraft, along with two CubeSats, will arrive at the asteroid system two years later.\n\nHera will study both asteroids, measure physical properties of Dimorphos, and examine the DART impact crater and the moon’s orbit, with the aim of establishing an effective planetary defense strategy.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/world/dart-mission-nasa-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA's DART mission successfully slams into an asteroid | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA NASA spacecraft has intentionally slammed into an asteroid in humanity’s first test of planetary defense.\n\nThe impact occurred at 7:14 p.m. ET greeted by cheers from the mission team in Laurel, Maryland. The DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, launched 10 months ago.\n\nWhile the asteroid, Dimorphos, was not at risk of impacting Earth, this demonstration could determine how to deflect space rocks that could pose a threat to Earth in the future.\n\n“We’re embarking on a new era of humankind, an era in which we potentially have the capability to protect ourselves from something like a dangerous, hazardous asteroid impact,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division. “What an amazing thing. We’ve never had that capability before.”\n\nA detailed view of Dimorphos can be seen seconds before the DART spacecraft hit the asteroid. NASA\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos were relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers). The team estimates that the spacecraft hit the asteroid at a point about 55 feet (17 meters) away from the space rock’s center.\n\nThe goal of the spacecraft, in addition to impact, is to affect the motion of an asteroid in space, but DART team members say it will take about two months for scientists to determine if the asteroid’s orbit changed.\n\nThe mission is heading for Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting the near-Earth asteroid Didymos. The asteroid system poses no threat to Earth, NASA officials have said, making it a perfect target to test out a kinetic impact – which may be needed if an asteroid is ever on track to hit Earth.\n\nThe event will be the agency’s first full-scale demonstration of deflection technology that can protect the planet.\n\n“For the first time ever, we will measurably change the orbit of a celestial body in the universe,” said Robert Braun, head of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory’s Space Exploration Sector.\n\nINTERACTIVE: One spacecraft’s journey to test Earth’s planetary defenses\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with orbits that place them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) of Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects, or NEOs, that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nCollision course\n\nAstronomers discovered Didymos more than two decades ago. It means “twin” in Greek, a nod to how the asteroid forms a binary system with the smaller asteroid, or moon. Didymos is nearly half a mile (0.8 kilometer) across.\n\nMeanwhile, Dimorphos is 525 feet (160 meters) in diameter, and its name means “two forms.”\n\nOn the day of impact, images taken by DRACO will not only reveal our first look at Dimorphos, but the spacecraft will use them to autonomously guide itself for an encounter with the tiny moon.\n\nDuring the event, these images will stream back to Earth at a rate of one per second, providing a “pretty stunning” look at the moon, said Nancy Chabot, planetary scientist and DART coordination lead at the Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers).\n\nThe spacecraft will accelerate at about 15,000 miles per hour (24,140 kilometers per hour) when it collides with Dimorphos.\n\nThe DART spacecraft also revealed what Dimorphos looks like for the very first time.\n\n“It looks adorable, it’s so cute,” said Carolyn Ernst, DRACO Instrument Scientist at the Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab. “It looks in a lot of ways like some of the other small asteroids we’ve seen.”\n\nThe egg-shaped asteroid’s surface, covered in boulders, looked similar to Bennu and Ryugu, two other asteroids that were visited by spacecraft in recent years. The scientists suspect that Dimorphos is a rubble pile asteroid made of loosely bound rocks.\n\nThe team is eager to learn more about the impact crater left behind, which they estimate to be about 33 to 65 feet (10 to 20 meters) in size. There may even be shattered pieces of the spacecraft in the crater.\n\nIt aims to crash into Dimorphos to change the asteroid’s motion in space, according to NASA. This collision will be recorded by LICIACube, or Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, a companion cube satellite provided by the Italian Space Agency.\n\nThe briefcase-size CubeSat hitched a ride with DART into space. It recently deployed from the spacecraft and is traveling behind it to record what happens.\n\nThree minutes after impact, the CubeSat will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video. The video, while not immediately available, will be streamed back to Earth in the weeks and months following the collision.\n\nProtecting the planet\n\nDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is relative to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. The spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won’t obliterate the asteroid.\n\nThe fast impact will only change Dimorphos’ speed as it orbits Didymos by 1%, which doesn’t sound like a lot – but it will change the moon’s orbital period.\n\nAn illustration shows NASA's DART spacecraft and the Italian Space Agency's LICIACube before the collision with Dimorphos. Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA\n\n“Sometimes we describe it as running a golf cart into a great pyramid or something like that,” Chabot said. “But for Dimorphos, this really is about asteroid deflection, not disruption. This isn’t going to blow up the asteroid; it isn’t going to put it into lots of pieces.”\n\nThe nudge will shift Dimorphos slightly and make it more gravitationally bound to Didymos – so the collision won’t change the binary system’s path around the Earth or increase its chances of becoming a threat to our planet, Chabot said.\n\nDimorphos completes an orbit around Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After the impact, that may change to 11 hours and 45 minutes, but follow-up observations will determine how much of a shift occurred.\n\nAstronomers will use ground-based telescopes to observe the binary asteroid system and see how much the orbital period of Dimorphos changed, which will determine if DART was successful.\n\nSpace-based telescopes such as Hubble, Webb and NASA’s Lucy mission will also observe the event.\n\nIn four years, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will arrive to study Dimorphos, measuring physical properties of the moon, and look at the DART impact and the moon’s orbit.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe valuable data collected by DART and Hera will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially the understanding of what kind of force can shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that could collide with our planet.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/world/nasa-dart-mission-preview-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA spacecraft will intentionally crash into asteroid | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

The images were released on Thursday.\n\nThe observatories were both witness to humanity’s first test of asteroid deflection technology. While neither Dimorphos nor Didymos, the larger asteroid it orbits, pose a threat to Earth, the double asteroid system was a perfect target for the DART spacecraft to attempt to change the motion of an asteroid slightly.\n\nThe Webb and Hubble images can be used to learn more about the surface of Dimorphos, which had never been seen until these detailed views collected by DART streamed back from the spacecraft on Monday. The telescope observations can also shed light on how much material was released from the asteroid’s surface at the moment of impact and how quickly it was ejected.\n\nBoth telescopes view the universe in different wavelengths of light, which can show if the cloud of material was just full of dust or included larger chunks of rock.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope captured wispy material drifting away from Dimorphos after impact. NASA/ESA/CSA\n\nScientists will use observations from Webb and Hubble, along with ground-based telescopes, to determine if DART successfully altered the motion of the asteroid.\n\nThe Webb telescope wasn’t designed to track speedy asteroids, but the observatory’s team was able to lock onto Dimorphos and capture 10 images of the asteroid. Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera was used to spy wispy plumes of material drifting away from the point of impact. More of Webb’s instruments will observe the asteroid in the future to reveal additional information about its composition.\n\nHubble observed Dimorphos with its Wide Field Camera 3 before the impact as well as 15 minutes after the collision to watch things unfold in visible light. The observatory captured 45 images.\n\nThese images by the Hubble Space Telescope show expanding plumes of material rising off Dimorphos.

But astronomers noticed that some of the rays seem slightly curved, and they want to study them to determine why.\n\nDidymos appeared to brighten threefold after the impact and remained steady even eight hours later, based on what Hubble captured.\n\nHubble will continue to keep an eye on Dimorphos over the next three weeks to see how the plume expands and dissipates over time.\n\nOn Tuesday, the first images were released from ground-based telescopes and Italy’s LICIACube, a shoebox-size satellite, that followed the DART mission.\n\nTogether, the data from so many different vantage points of the collision will inform another mission intending to head to the impact site.\n\nIn 2024, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will launch to study the double asteroid system in great detail.\n\n“We’ve been looking forward to the DART impact for over 17 years, and it’s so exciting to see it through the eyes of the greatest space observatories Webb and Hubble,” said Ian Carnelli, Hera mission manager, in a statement. “These images provide us with clues of what happened in the first hours after impact, and clearly there is much more happening than we had foreseen.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/world/asteroid-tests-warning-system-scn/index.html", "title": "'Tiny' asteroid strikes Earth testing early warning system | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe early warning system to detect asteroids that pose a threat to Earth, operated by NASA and its collaborators around the world, got to flex its muscles.\n\nIt successfully detected a small asteroid 6 1/2 feet (2 meters) wide just hours before it smashed into the atmosphere over the Norwegian Sea before disintegrating on Friday, March 11, according to a statement from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Tuesday. That’s too small to pose any hazard to Earth, NASA said.\n\nA still from an animation showing asteroid 2022 EB5's predicted orbit around the sun before crashing into the Earth's atmosphere on March 11. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nOften such tiny asteroids slip through the surveillance net, and 2022 EB5 – as the asteroid was named – is only the fifth of this kind to be spotted and tracked prior to impact. (Fear not, a larger asteroid would be discovered and tracked much further from Earth – years ahead of any potential devastating impact.)\n\n“Tiny asteroids like 2022 EB5 are numerous, and they impact into the atmosphere quite frequently – roughly every 10 months or so,” said Paul Chodas, the director of JPL’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, which tracks potentially hazardous comets and asteroids that could collide with our planet.\n\n“But very few of these asteroids have actually been detected in space and observed extensively prior to impact, basically because they are very faint until the last few hours, and a survey telescope has to observe just the right spot of sky at the right time for one to be detected.”\n\nThe asteroid was spotted just two hours before it made impact by astronomer Krisztián Sarneczky at the Piszkéstető Observatory in northern Hungary, who flagged it to the Minor Planet Center’s Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page, NASA said.\n\nNASA’s “Scout” impact hazard assessment system, which automatically searches the Minor Planet Center’s database for possible new asteroids or other space objects took these early measurements to calculate the trajectory of 2022 EB5.\n\nAs soon as the system determined that 2022 EB5 was going to hit Earth’s atmosphere, NASA flagged the object on the Scout web page to notify the near-Earth object observing community, which was able to provide more observations.\n\n“Scout had only 14 observations over 40 minutes from one observatory to work with when it first identified the object as an impactor. We were able to determine the possible impact locations, which initially extended from western Greenland to off the coast of Norway,” said Davide Farnocchia, a navigation engineer at JPL who developed Scout. “As more observatories tracked the asteroid, our calculations of its trajectory and impact location became more precise.”\n\nNASA said “this real-world event” suggested that the “impact prediction models at CNEOS are highly capable of informing the response to the potential impact of a larger object.”\n\nAsteroids and other near-Earth objects zip past our planet multiple times a week.

Didymos is around half a mile long, while Dimorphos is 520 feet long.\n\nDidymos' orbit around the sun comes relatively close to our planet, making it a Near-Earth object. In 2003, it came around 4.5 million miles close to Earth. However, the two asteroids were picked by NASA because they say they poses no real threat to Earth.\n\nElena Adams, an engineer for DART, said the system has been in development for the past five years. If the launch gets delayed later in November, the team has a window to launch by Feb. 15, 2022.\n\nLindley Johnson, planetary defense officer for NASA, said the total cost of the mission, from its inception to the year-long observations after the impact, will cost NASA around $330 million.\n\nIf the November launch goes according to plan, the DART spacecraft will embark on a nearly yearlong journey to the asteroids at roughly 15,000 miles per hour, and is expected to approach them around Sept. 26-Oct. 1, 2022. The DART system is significantly smaller than Dimorphos, and unlike in \"Armageddon,\" the plan isn't to completely destroy it, but rather \"give it a small nudge.\"\n\nNancy Chabot, lead coordinator for DART, said giving Dimorphos a nudge will affect its orbit around Didymos by about 1%. That may seem small, but if an asteroid were to head toward Earth, the technology used could make all the difference.\n\n\"You would just give this asteroid a small nudge, which would add up to a big change in its future position, and then the asteroid and Earth wouldn't be on the collision course,\" Chabot said.\n\nThere are many questions NASA hopes will be answered by the impact, such as how much momentum is needed to nudge an asteroid, how fast will it move after the impact, if debris will go in multiple directions and if the material the asteroid is made up of matters. A camera will be deployed by the spacecraft before impact to provide visuals of the mission, and scientists will be able to see the effects of it through telescopes.\n\nNear-Earth object passing now: Several asteroids bigger than Great Pyramid of Giza will approach Earth in coming weeks\n\n'Peace and Love':NASA spacecraft named Lucy rockets into the sky with diamonds\n\nHate seeing snakes?: Blame the asteroids that killed the dinosaurs, scientists say\n\nThe team that spoke with the media on Thursday reiterated there are no threats of an asteroid that could cause significant damage in the immediate future, and that this is all about being prepared.\n\n\"We don't want to be in a situation where an asteroid is headed toward Earth and then have to be testing this kind of capability. We want to know about both how the spacecraft works and what the reaction will be by the asteroid to the impact before we ever get in a situation like that,\" Johnson said.\n\nCurrently, there are over 27,000 Near-Earth objects in our solar system, 891 of which are at least the same size as Didymos, according to NASA. In order for an asteroid or comet to be considered a Near-Earth object, it needs to come within 120.8 million miles of our planet.\n\nJohnson said the reason to do this now is in case of an object that has never been detected suddenly approaches Earth. Until that happens, NASA plans do to additional tests like this one in the future.\n\n\"We might be testing other techniques or other ways to possibly deflect an asteroid,\" he said.\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/us/five-things-june-27-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for June 27: Roe v.

On Wednesday, more than 20 million Americans across 16 states were under heat alerts and some cities shattered decades-old records. Macon, Georgia, reached 105 degrees, beating the previous record of 101 degrees set in 1925. New heat records were also set in Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina. And unfortunately, meteorologists say there’s no relief in sight. The heat in the South and the Plains is expected to continue to build through the weekend with much of the region expected to set more records in the coming days, the National Weather Service said.

Three top officials who led the Justice Department in the final days of the Trump administration will testify at today’s hearing about how the former President and his allies sought to enlist the department to give their baseless fraud allegations credibility, according to committee aides. The officials will also make a case that Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with an official who bought into his claims of fraud, committee aides said.

But even with House GOP leaders opposing the bill, some Republican members have already indicated they plan to vote for it, and the Democrat-controlled House is expected to be able to pass the legislation once it passes in the Senate.

Arredondo and responding law enforcement agencies have faced fierce criticism over the length of time officers waited in a hallway outside adjoining classrooms at the school where an 18-year-old gunman and the victims were located. The gunman fired at officers in the first minutes of the incident – with two receiving grazing wounds – according to an updated timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety.

However, Covid-19 vaccination is still expected to provide substantial protection against severe disease, and vaccine makers are working on updated shots that might elicit a stronger immune response against the variants.

Both countries have previously refrained from joining for historic and geopolitical reasons. There is “strong bipartisan support” for Finnish accession to NATO, US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said during a visit to Finland today. However, Russia has warned the Nordic nations of “far-reaching consequences” if the countries join the alliance.

Yes.” The governor’s comments come as the Supreme Court’s conservative majority seems likely to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide. More than a dozen states have so-called trigger laws on their books, meaning that abortion will almost immediately be banned if Roe v.

At least 17 deaths have been reported in connection with Ian.\n\nThe death toll in Charlotte County was at least eight or nine, Charlotte County Commissioner Joseph Tiseo told CNN Thursday afternoon. About five people are believed to have died in Lee County, the sheriff there said.\n\nOne person who was in hospice care died in Osceola County, Emergency Management Director Bill Litton said.

Andrew West/USA Today Network Prev Next\n\nFlorida residents assessing storm damage Thursday found collapsed buildings, ongoing flooding, downed power lines and impassable roads, including a key bridge connecting Sanibel and Captiva islands to Florida’s mainland that has been washed out.\n\nApproximately 40 people were taken off the Sanibel Thursday, 12 of whom were injured. Due to the damage to the causeway, first-responders are only able to get to the island by boat.\n\n“The island is in rough shape,” said Sanibel Police Chief Bill Dalton. “The power infrastructure is severely damaged. I would be surprised that there’s a single structure on the island that hasn’t been impacted by the storm.”\n\nSanibel, in Lee County, “got hit with really biblical storm surge,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Lee County Utilities issued a systemwide boil-water notice for all customers effective immediately due to the impacts of the hurricane, according to county officials.\n\n“I just literally got out of a helicopter where I was able to take a complete tour of the entire county and there’s really no words that I can say to tell you what I’ve seen,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marcino said on CNN Thursday. “The Fort Myers Beach area, buildings, major, major homes and buildings completely washed away with vehicles in the water, vehicles in the bay, boats are upside down.”\n\nDeSantis said Thursday night that he surveyed damage in Charlotte County and Lee County.\n\n“Some of the damage was indescribable,” DeSantis said, adding he saw cars and homes floating in water. “The most significant damage I saw was on Fort Myers Beach. Some of the homes were wiped out, some were just concrete slabs.”\n\nAbout 200 people have been rescued by the Fort Myers Fire Department, Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN Thursday night. The search and rescue operations appear to have come to an end in the city, according to Anderson.\n\nAnderson said city has not had any fatalities. On Friday, the city will open “several food, water and ice distribution centers,” Anderson said.\n\nA boil water notice is in effect in the city of Fort Myers, according to a government statement posted Thursday. “This applies to water consumed for drinking, washing dishes, and brushing teeth among other uses,” the statement said.\n\nLee County – which includes Fort Myers — issued a boil water notice Wednesday.\n\nOfficials in Kissimmee – just south of Orlando – told CNN Thursday evening “it’s been a worst-case scenario” for the city.\n\n“One of our hospitals here, Osceola Regional – which is a trauma two-level center – was surrounded by water this morning. Our rescues could not make entry,” Bill Litton, Osceola County’s emergency management director, told CNN Thursday evening.\n\nEmergency responders conducted rescues by air, land and boat to save people trapped by the floodwaters. As of 2 p.m. Thursday, more than 500 people have been rescued in Charlotte and Lee counties, the Florida Department of Emergency Management said in a tweet. In Orlando, emergency responders navigating a street-turned-river told CNN they had conducted at least 200 rescues since early Thursday morning.\n\nThe US Coast Guard’s 7th District rescued 68 people Thursday, which is included in the 700 state-wide rescues the governor reported Thursday, according to Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson.\n\nFlorida First Lady, Casey DeSantis, said Thursday she launched the Florida Disaster Fund to assist in rescue efforts. The fund raised more than $10 million within 24 hours of its launch, she said.\n\nThe rescue efforts come a day after Ian came ashore near Cayo Costa as a Category 4 hurricane with 150-mph winds, making it one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall on Florida’s west coast. The storm cut a path from near Fort Myers in the southwest across to the eastern part of the state, and its combination of wind, rain and storm surge caused flooding that DeSantis called “a 500-year flood event.”\n\nHere are the latest developments:\n\n• Hurricane warnings for South Carolina: Hurricane warnings are in place for the entire coast of South Carolina. In addition, Tropical Storm warnings are in place from Jupiter, Florida, up the east coast to Duck, North Carolina.\n\n• Record-high storm surges: Ian’s storm surge hit up to 12 feet in some places in western Florida. On Thursday morning, a storm surge warning – meaning life-threatening surges could hit – was in place for a coastal stretch from northeastern Florida into an area north of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n• More than a foot of rainfall: Lehigh Acres near Fort Myers got 14.42 inches of rain, and Warm Mineral Springs near Port Charlotte got 11.05 inches. Up to 30 inches of rain may have fallen in parts of Florida by storm’s end, forecasters say.\n\nRescue teams navigate waters to free trapped residents\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 04:14 - Source: CNN 'I know we all look crazy': Resident shares why she didn't leave before storm\n\nSunrise on Thursday gave Florida residents their first look at Ian’s overnight wrath – and the results were not pretty.\n\nAs Ian pushed inland, ocean water piled up onshore Wednesday – 12 feet in some places – and 150-mph winds whipped. 911 call centers in several counties were inundated.\n\nScott Carlos, who rode out the storm in his fourth-story Fort Myers condo, saw waves of water crash into homes across the street, up to their roofs, he said. Roads are littered Thursday with washed-out vehicles, he told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“Everybody’s garages basically just gave out. … Cars are everywhere, smashed up in the street. There’s debris everywhere,” he said.\n\nAs Ian continued moving northeast, heavy rain and flooding has been reported in the Orlando area, where 8 to 12 inches of rain had already fallen and up to 4 more inches of rain was expected. In Orlando, a reporter for CNN affiliate WESH rescued a woman after seeing her trying to drive through floodwaters, carrying her on his back in waist-high water to dry ground, WESH video showed.\n\nIn Fort Myers – where about 90% of electric customers were without power – Fire Chief Tracy McMillion told residents to stay inside, and to stay hopeful. “We’re coming for you, be encouraged,” he told residents Wednesday night.\n\nThe city’s downtown streets were flooded Wednesday with almost 4 feet of water, Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN.\n\nThomas Podgorny was trapped in his two-story home in Fort Myers with three others, watching vehicles float away outside and worrying about others who did not evacuate, he told CNN Wednesday evening.\n\n“I’ve lost my house. I have water and gas flowing through my bottom floor,” he said. “My neighbors have very little breathing room in their one-story house.”\n\nOne couple there was trapped in their home when the ceiling caved in.\n\n“Something is dripping on me,” Belinda Collins recalled her partner saying. “He got up, and the ceiling – the family room ceiling – caved in.” They called 911 and were waiting for a call back about when it would be safe to leave, they said.\n\nIn Port Charlotte, the storm tore off the roof above a hospital’s ICU with patients inside Wednesday, forcing staff to move them to a post-operation recovery area, Dr. Birgit Bodine, an internal medicine specialist at the facility, told CNN.\n\nWater gushed down stairwells to other floors, and other patients needed to be moved either to beds in hallways or to a different, dry wing of the hospital.\n\n“We still have water in hallways that we’re still sloshing through,” but patients are safe in dry beds, and as many as possible were transferred to the dry wing, Bodine told CNN Thursday morning.\n\nPeople in nearby Collier County, which includes Naples, were also trapped in their homes, calling for help, after electricity went out. In Naples, half the streets were not passable Wednesday because of high water, officials said.\n\n“Some are reporting life threatening medical emergencies in deep water. We will get to them first. Some are reporting water coming into their house but not life threatening. They will have to wait. Possibly until the water recedes,” the Collier County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday evening.\n\n9/28 5pm EDT: #Ian will cross the FL peninsula and likely bring life-threatening storm surge on Thursday & Friday along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, & South Carolina, where a storm surge warning is in effect. Residents should follow any advice from local officials. pic.twitter.com/Q8eZ9PfVpg — NHC Storm Surge (@NHC_Surge) September 28, 2022\n\nComplicating matters, neighboring Lee County’s 911 system was down and calls were being rerouted to Collier County, Chief Stephanie Spell told CNN. “At this point the majority of our 911 calls are water rescues,” Spell added.\n\nIn Sarasota County, sheriff’s deputies and fire crews had a backlog Thursday morning of more than 500 calls for help to respond to, the county sheriff’s office said. Deputies were “responding to the highest priority calls” that still were in the queue Thursday morning, the office said.\n\nResidents in parts of Pasco County were also asked to boil their tap water as the water distribution system in the area lost pressure and a water main ruptured.\n\nIn Manatee County, residents were asked to limit flushing, showering, doing dishes and laundry due to power outages impacting the system.\n\nIn Cape Coral, authorities were getting reports of significant structural damage across the city, Ryan Lamb, the city’s fire chief and emergency management director, told CNN.\n\nDeSantis has asked President Biden to approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also asking Biden to grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian’s landfall.\n\nSouth Carolina braces for incoming storm\n\nWith Ian again a Category 1 hurricane, a state of emergency was declared in Charleston County Thursday.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to hit South Carolina Friday near or just after these high tide times in the 11 a.m. hour. It’s currently located about 240 miles south of Charleston and is moving toward the north-northeast at 10 mph, according to the hurricane center.\n\n“We are looking at an early afternoon landfall,” said CNN Meteorologist Tom Sater. “The entire southeastern coastline is pretty much going to be inundated with a surge again. It’s not going to be what we saw in southwest Florida, but in Charleston you toss in … 7 feet of a surge, the entire downtown historic area is flooded.”\n\nCoastal cities along the East Coast like Jacksonville, Florida, Savannah, Georgia, and Wilmington, North Carolina, could see anywhere from 2-7 feet of storm surge, Sater said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the biggest variable with Hurricane Ian may be “human reaction” to the storm.\n\n“It’s people failing to take the necessary precautions. That’s the real danger that we have, is human error,” McMaster said. “Doesn’t make much difference whether this comes in at hurricane strength or below at storm strength or somewhere on the line, cause it’s going to be blowing strong winds and it’s going to be all over the state at different levels.”\n\nThe US Geological Survey coastal change forecasts released Thursday predicts waves and surges will likely cause 11% of South Carolina’s dunes and 1% of Georgia’s dunes to be continuously covered by ocean water.\n\n“This is the most severe type of storm effect on coastal beaches, with flooding behind the dunes that may impact coastal communities,” a news release from the USGS said.\n\nAdditionally, 43% of South Carolina’s dunes and 24% of Georgia’s dunes are expected to be overwashed by Ian. This means sand will be pushed inland, resulting in changes to the coastal landscape that could block roadways.\n\n“Overwash can reduce the height of protective sand dunes, alter beach profiles and leave areas behind the dunes more vulnerable to future storms,” the release said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had the incorrect location for storm witness Scott Carlos.

For our latest coverage of Hurricane Ian, see updates from Friday, Sept. 30.\n\nClick here for a lite version of this page with a quicker load time.\n\nIan became a hurricane again Thursday evening after hammering Florida with heavy rains and powerful winds, leaving a rising death toll and thousands of residents desperately seeking rescue from the effects of one of the most devastating storms in U.S. history.\n\nThe large system, which had been downgraded to a tropical storm on its way out of Florida and into the Atlantic ocean, is expected to head toward the Carolinas and Georgia. Ian's sustained winds increased to 85 mph late Thursday and it could bring \"life-threatening flooding, storm surge and strong winds'' to those states, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the storm caused a \"500-year flooding event\" and said Coast Guard helicopters were plucking trapped residents from the roofs of homes. Communities across the state were or will be swamped by the overwhelming waters, he said.\n\n\"The impacts of this storm are historic and the damage that has been done is historic,\" DeSantis said. \"We've never seen a flood event like this, we've never seen a storm surge of this magnitude.\"\n\nAt least 14 people were reported dead in counties across the state, a number that's expected to rise substantially. Sheriffs in southwest Florida said 911 centers were inundated by thousands of stranded callers, some with life-threatening emergencies. More than 1.9 million Florida homes and businesses were without power Thursday evening.\n\nHurricane Ian-related losses thus far range between $25 and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday in an initial analysis of the damage.\n\nEven after Ian had weakened to a tropical storm and headed out to the Atlantic early Thursday, its outer bands were still buffeting the state. The storm flooded entire communities, leaving residents stranded in their homes after making landfall Wednesday with 150-mph maximum sustained winds – just 7 mph shy of a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane scale.\n\nMajor to record flooding will continue across central Florida and considerable flooding is expected in portions of the Carolinas and southern Virginia through Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm previously tore into Cuba, killing two people and bringing down the entire country's electrical grid.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►President Joe Biden declared an emergency in South Carolina and ordered federal assistance for the state, according to a White House statement. Ian is located about 185 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina, and is moving north-northeast at 10 mph, the hurricane center said late Thursday.\n\n►The U.S. Coast Guard was searching for a group of more than 20 Cuban migrants after their boat sank in stormy weather near the Florida Keys. A U.S. Border Patrol agent tweeted that nine have been rescued and that the search for the rest continues.\n\n►Ian’s strength at landfall tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane when measured by wind speed to strike the U.S. It's tied with five other hurricanes that reached 150 mph — two in Florida, two in Louisiana and one in Texas.\n\n►Waffle House, known for always being open, said 35 outlets were shut down due to the storm as of Thursday morning.\n\n►Residents described the terror after a tornado tore through a condominium complex near Delray Beach on the Atlantic side of South Florida, ripping off roofs and turning over vehicles. \"I felt things blow past my head and face,\" resident Jim Travis said. \"When I opened the door, my apartment was destroyed.\" Read more.\n\nQuick links:\n\nGET TEXT UPDATES : Sign up here for text updates on Hurricane Ian.\n\n: Sign up here for text updates on Hurricane Ian. HURRICANE IAN TRACKER: Where is Ian headed? See the map.\n\nReenergized Ian expected to make landfall in South Carolina\n\nLike a villain in a horror movie, Ian is coming back to wreak havoc just when it seemed to go away.\n\nOnce a Category 4 hurricane, Ian was a tropical storm as it moved Thursday off the coast of Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean, where the warm water reenergized it. In the afternoon, Ian once again became a hurricane — meaning it packs winds of at least 74 mph — and is expected to make landfall once again, this time Friday in South Carolina.\n\nHurricane and storm surge warnings have been issued for the South Carolina coast because of Ian's predicted approach, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nForecast call for a storm surge of several feet and flooding in low areas along the coast, like Charleston, where Mayor John Tecklenburg warned residents: “Take this storm seriously. Tomorrow, stay home and stay out of harm’s way.”\n\nCollapsed causeway, shark swimming on a street part of Ian's legacy\n\nParts of Florida's Gulf Coast were devastated as Ian swept through the state, damaging buildings and homes and flooding communities.\n\nSanibel Island in Lee County, near where the hurricane made landfall, was among the hardest hit. Parts of the Sanibel Causeway collapsed, disconnecting the barrier island of 6,300 residents from the mainland.\n\n“Sanibel is destruction ... it got hit with really biblical storm surge,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said.\n\nSanibel Island officials said two people died as a result of the hurricane. At a Thursday night news conference, the officials said members of at least 200 households remained on the island during the storm. At least 40 uninjured people were evacuated and another 12 injured ones were taken to hospitals.\n\nIn Fort Myers, the water on the streets of one neighborhood was so deep a shark was seen swimming through it. In Cape Coral just to the south, photos showed a sailboat washed up in the middle of a road near homes.\n\nWater coursed through the streets of Naples, creating giant waves that made roads impassable and flooded the city’s fire department. A video posted by Naples Fire Rescue showed crews working to salvage equipment and firetrucks in more than 3 feet of water.\n\nAbout 70 miles north along the coast, intense storm surge flooded a hospital's lower level emergency room in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds ripped away part of the roof from its intensive care unit, according to a doctor who works there.\n\nWater gushed down from above onto the ICU, forcing staff to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of whom were on ventilators – to other floors, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital.\n\nAt least 14 deaths confirmed in Florida, toll expected to grow\n\nThe destruction and upheaval left behind by Ian has made it difficult to get an accurate assessment of the loss of life, but there are already reports of 14 deaths, and more are expected.\n\nTwo of them were reported by officials in Sanibel Island, where residents of at least 200 households declined to evacuate and rode out the storm.\n\nCharlotte County Commissioner Chris Constance told CNN Thursday afternoon there have been six confirmed fatalities in the county, which is just north of Fort Myers.\n\nAlso speaking to CNN, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said at least five deaths have been confirmed in his county, which includes Cayo Costa — the island near Cape Coral where the storm made landfall Wednesday.\n\nAnd a 72-year-old man in Deltona, about 30 miles northeast of Orlando, died after falling into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in the heavy rain, the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nConstance said four shelters in his county had to be evacuated because of structural damage, and many roads were impassable because of downed power lines or flooding.\n\n“It is the biggest catastrophe I have ever seen in my lifetime,” said Constance, speaking from Broward County in South Florida, where he traveled ahead of the storm. “This is unprecedented and I was in Punta Gorda through Hurricane Charley (in 2004). While that was devastating, this is so much bigger, is affecting so many more people.''\n\nBiden: Ian could be 'deadliest hurricane in Florida's history'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday that Ian could be the “deadliest hurricane in Florida's history,” vowing the federal government will provide assistance “however long it takes” to ensure a full recovery.\n\n“The numbers are still unclear, but we're hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life,” Biden said after he was briefed on FEMA’s disaster response at the agency’s headquarters in Washington.\n\nAt least 13 people were reported dead in counties across the state, though Florida officials have not provided an official death total from the storm. It wasn’t clear on what Biden based his estimate on the loss of life. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane killed up to 2,500 in Florida. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 killed 43 people.\n\n“We know many families are hurting today, and our entire country hurts with them.'' Biden said. \"My message to the people of Florida and to the country is that at times like these America comes together.”\n\nThe president said he offered Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis “the fullest federal support” in a phone conversation Thursday morning and told Florida mayors to “call me directly” if they need help.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHurricane Ian losses: $25-$40 billion\n\nHurricane Ian-related losses, mostly in Florida, range between $25 and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday in an initial analysis of the damage.\n\nFitch said the losses could climb higher “depending on the effect of the storm in the Carolinas.” The storm made landfall Wednesday on the Gulf Coast and traveled across central Florida before exiting on Thursday as a tropical storm. It has since turned into a Category 1 storm and headed toward South Carolina.\n\nIn comparison to other storms, Fitch said Hurricane Katrina’s losses were $65 billion in 2005 and Hurricane Ida’s losses were $36 billion last year.\n\n- Sergio Bustos\n\nIan the 'ultimate villain' at Disney World; parks to start reopening Friday\n\nWhile Disney World was closed to guests Thursday as Ian swept across central Florida, some who were already staying at the park's resorts weathered the storm with limited staff and upset children.\n\nJan Tuckwood, who splits time between Lake Worth, Florida, and Charlotte, North Carolina, said Disney's Swan Reserve hotel felt like the Twilight Zone to her and her family.\n\n\"Disney World is as you would imagine it to be if an incredible amount of children have been pent up for two days and basically had their hopes dashed by the ultimate villain, Hurricane Ian,\" she said.\n\nDuring the storm, water started leaking into their hotel room on the 14th floor and they were relocated to another room, she said.\n\nDisney officials said the parks were being assessed for damage Thursday and operations would resume in a phased approach Friday.\n\n– Suzy Fleming Leonard, Florida Today\n\nErosion-control rocks tossed by high surf\n\nIn Flagler Beach, county emergency officials reported damage to the end of the pier as a result of the high and pounding surf, the National Weather Service in Jacksonville said, adding that public reports indicated the surf was tossing erosion-control rocks over the beachside highway State Road A1A.\n\nAt Pellicer Creek near Marineland, the tide gauge reached a height of 4 feet over the high-water mark, which represents major flooding of the Intracoastal Waterway, as a result of storm surge. A Weatherstem camera showed flooding of the University of Florida's Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience.\n\n-- Dinah Pulver\n\nIan as viewed through a peephole in North Port\n\nElizabeth Hayes watched the entirety of Hurricane Ian pass over her home in North Port, 50 miles northwest of Fort Myers, through a peephole in her shutters. The longtime resident says she was not prepared for the devastating flooding – and she knows more floodwater is on its way.\n\nHeyes said only the roof of her shed in the yard is above water. North Port residents are using small boats, kayaks and paddle boards to inspect homes that flooded along the Myakkahatchee Creek on Thursday morning.\n\n“We’ve seen it flood, we’ve boated in and out before, but this is devastating,” Hayes said.\n\nAirports closed, flights canceled\n\nMost Florida airports remained closed Thursday and numerous flights were canceled. Airports that are open are dealing with delays as well as cancellations.\n\nNearly 2,000 U.S. flights were canceled Thursday, and the highest numbers were across Florida, according to Flight Aware, which tracks flight status in real time. Travel through parts of Georgia and the Carolinas was also impacted as the storm moved north. Tampa International Airport officials tweeted that damage assessments were underway.\n\n\"We are closely coordinating our reopening with the FAA, TSA, airlines, and other partners based on roadway safety, facility readiness, and required staffing,\" the post said. \"We hope to have an update on reopening plans later today.\"\n\n– Eve Chen, USA TODAY\n\nSection of Sanibel Causeway crashes into sea\n\nA section of the Sanibel Causeway collapsed into San Carlos Bay, cutting off access to the barrier island where 6,300 people normally live. A mandatory evacuation order had been issued for the island ahead of the storm but authorities said about 200 households stayed behind.\n\nDeSantis said Thursday morning that more than 100 engineers in pairs of two will work to assess the bridges along the west coast of Florida.\n\nBiden issues disaster declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration to make federal funding available to affected residents in the Florida counties of Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hillsborough, Lee, Manatee, Pinellas, and Sarasota. DeSantis said he would ask that the declaration be expanded as more counties report crippling damage from Ian.\n\nAssistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help residents and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. Federal funding also is available for debris removal.\n\nBiden said his administration was \"continuing to take swift action to help the families of Florida. ... I want the people of Florida to know that we will be here at every step of the way.\"\n\nSt. Petersburg dodged worst of Ian\n\nAfter thousands of people evacuated earlier this week, preparing for life-threatening storm surge, residents in St. Petersburg awoke Thursday to minimal damage.\n\nPolice directed traffic at intersections with broken traffic lights. Some trees had fallen, blocking roadways and taking down power lines. In Coquina Key, an island community south of downtown, a Norfolk Island pine had snapped in half, its branches scattered in a yard. Nearby, Dale Fredrick used a chainsaw to cut branches of another downed tree blocking a roadway.\n\n“It won’t take long,” Fredrick, 58, said. “Just little by little.”\n\nHurricane Ian tracker\n\nUSA TODAY's Hurricane Ian tracker will remain updated and offer the latest look at where the storm is headed.\n\nLee County sheriff fears 'hundreds' could be dead but DeSantis says nothing confirmed\n\nThe hurricane’s center made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon near Cayo Costa, a barrier island just west of heavily populated Fort Myers in Lee County.\n\n\"While I don't have confirmed numbers, I definitely know the fatalities are in the hundreds,\" Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said on ABC-TV's \"Good Morning America.\" \"There are thousands of people that are waiting to be rescued.\"\n\nPressed on the numbers, Marceno said, \"So far confirmed in the hundreds. Meaning that we are responding to events, drownings. Again, unsure of the exact details because we are just starting to scratch the surface on this assessment.\"\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis attempted to downplay the sheriff's assessment, telling \"Good Morning America'' those numbers weren't verified.\n\nWHAT IS STORM SURGE?Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\n“None of that is confirmed,” DeSantis said at a morning briefing at the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. “What that is, there were 911 calls from people in their homes saying, ‘Hey, the water is rising. I’m going to go up in the attic, but I’m really worried.’”\n\n“Of course, those folks now are going to be checked on,” DeSantis said. “I think you’ll have more clarity about that in the next day or so, as (rescuers) are able to go to those locations and determine whether people need services.”\n\nMore than 1.9M Floridians without power\n\nMore than 1.9 million homes and businesses across Florida were without power Thursday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. Most of the homes and businesses in 12 counties were without power, although authorities said they were making progress in restoring electricity.\n\nDeSantis said the power grids in Lee and Charlotte counties will likely have to be rebuilt.\n\n\"Lee and Charlotte are basically off the grid at this point,\" DeSantis said. \"That's going to be more than just connecting a power line back to a pole.\"\n\nHospital roof partially torn off, fire station flooded: Damage in Florida\n\nParts of Florida's Gulf Coast saw major damage as Hurricane Ian swept through the state, damaging buildings and homes and flooding communities.\n\nWater coursed through the streets of Naples, creating giant waves that made roads impassable and flooded the city’s fire department. A video posted by Naples Fire-Rescue showed crews working to salvage equipment and firetrucks in more than 3 feet of water. In Cape Coral, about 30 miles up the coast, photos showed a sailboat washed up in the middle of a road near homes.\n\nNearby Fort Myers saw intense storm surge flooding coastal communities and the area around WINK News, a local CBS affiliate. Videos showed water reaching car windshields in the studio's parking lot and some of the storm surge leaking into the building.\n\nFarther north along the coast, intense storm surge flooded a hospital's lower level emergency room in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds ripped away part of the roof from its intensive care unit, according to a doctor who works there.\n\nWater gushed down from above onto the ICU, forcing staff to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of whom were on ventilators – to other floors, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital. Staff members used towels and plastic bins to try to mop up the sodden mess.\n\nOfficials warned flash floods were possible across the state, which could lead to pollution and radioactive waste overflow.\n\nSAFFIR-SIMPSON WIND SPEED SCALE:Breaking down wind speed scale for hurricanes.\n\nHOW DOES HURRICANE IAN COMPARE:Category 5 hurricanes are rare.

You also can text or WhatsApp your Ian stories to CNN +1 332-261-0775.\n\nCNN —\n\nIan, now a post-tropical cyclone, was moving farther inland Friday night after pummeling South Carolina with fierce winds and a destructive storm surge, less than two days after killing at least 45 people in Florida and leaving behind an apocalyptic path of destruction.\n\nThe storm made its second landfall in the US near Georgetown, South Carolina, Friday afternoon as a Category 1 hurricane. By Friday night, it was continuing to pack 60 mph winds but was expected to weaken overnight and dissipate over North Carolina or Virginia late Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nFlash flooding was possible in parts of North and South Carolina and southeast Virginia Friday night, while the storm also threatened parts of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia with tornadoes through Saturday morning, the hurricane center added.\n\nTwo days earlier, Ian made landfall along Florida’s southwestern coast as a major Category 4 hurricane, ravaging coastal communities, turning roads into streams and leaving behind wreckage and debris.\n\nAs communities in the Sunshine State were beginning to pick up the pieces after the powerful storm, authorities in South Carolina late Friday began assessing the damage to their state. Authorities in Pawleys Island, a coastal South Carolina town roughly 70 miles north of Charleston, were cataloging the damage Friday night.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nTwo piers in the state – Cherry Grove Pier in North Myrtle Beach and Pawleys Island Pier – partially collapsed due to the storm. Water had receded on the two causeways, but Pawleys Island police announced they were not letting anyone back on the island until safety assessments were conducted in the morning.\n\nMore than 128,000 customers were in the dark across the state as of 9:30 p.m. Friday, according to poweroutage.us. In North Carolina, more than 330,000 customers were out of power and in Florida, more than 1.4 million.\n\nKnee-deep water inside homes\n\nIn North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Kyle Faust waded through knee-deep water inside his home Friday after the storm roared through. Across Horry County, where the city is located, officials reported Friday night crews were conducting damage assessments and clearing debris, while some roads remained closed.\n\nMyrtle Beach Police urged residents to stay inside and not drive on flooded roadways.\n\n“It’s a pretty scary sight,” Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune remarked earlier of Hurricane Ian. “I’m seeing way too many cars passing by. And I think people just don’t realize how dangerous it is to be out in these types of conditions. We’ve seen so many people’s cars get stuck, and emergency personnel has to go out and rescue people.”\n\nShelters in Charleston County will remain open until 4 p.m. on Saturday, the county wrote in a news release. Buses will start taking people from the shelters back to the original pick-up locations Saturday morning.\n\n“A lot of prayers have been answered,” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. “This storm is not as bad as it could have been, but don’t let your guard down yet. We are not out of the woods, there is water on the roads, still heavy winds, and it is still dangerous in many parts of the state.”\n\nCharleston International Airport’s airfield closed Friday because of high winds and extended the closure until Saturday morning, the airport said.\n\nIn Florida: At least 45 reported dead\n\nFlorida, meanwhile, confronted the dizzying destruction Ian wrought through much of the peninsula Wednesday and Thursday after it smashed into the southwest coast and plowed through central and northeastern areas.\n\nAt least 45 deaths have been reported in the state. Among them, friends of Kevin Behen, who told CNN on Friday night he knew of two men who died making sure their wives were able to escape the home they were all sheltering in that began to flood.\n\n“These guys pushed their wives out the windows to where a tree was,” Behen explained. “They just looked at their wives and they said, ‘We can’t hold on anymore, we love you. Bye,’ and that was it.”\n\nHomes on the coast were washed out to sea, buildings were smashed throughout the state, and floodwater ruined homes and businesses and trapped residents, even inland in places like the Orlando area.\n\nHundreds of rescues have taken place by land, air and sea, with residents stuck in homes or stranded on rooftops, and searchers have made many wellness checks, especially in the Fort Myers and Naples areas, where a storm surge inundated streets and homes.\n\n“It looked as though someone had just dropped from the sky picked up hotels and buildings and took them away,” Lee County manager Roger Desjarlais said. “We also know that not as many people evacuated from those islands as we had hoped for. We know there has to be many fatalities yet to be accounted for.”\n\nIan may have caused as much as $47 billion in insured losses in Florida, according to an estimate from property analytics firm CoreLogic, which could make it the second-most expensive storm in the state’s history when adjusted for inflation after 1992’s Hurricane Andrew.\n\nPresident Joe Biden continued to pledge federal support for Florida as it deals with the devastation caused by the storm, which he noted was “likely to rank among the worst … in the nation’s history” and will likely take “months, years” to rebuild.\n\nAnd the storm’s aftermath poses new, deadly dangers of its own. Some standing water is electrified, officials warned, while maneuvering through debris-strewn buildings and streets – many without working traffic signals – risks injury. Lack of air conditioning can lead to heat illness, and improper generator use can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nMany without homes, water, power\n\nClaudette Smith, the public information officer for the sheriff’s office in Charlotte County, just north of Fort Myers, told CNN the county is in desperate need of help as emergency services continue to be inundated.\n\n“We need everything, to put it plain and simple. We need all hands on deck,” Smith stressed. “The people who have come to our assistance have been tremendously helpful, but we do need everything.”\n\nMany members of the community are without homes, water, and electricity, and there is currently only one operating hospital in the county.\n\nHere’s what to know about the destruction in Florida:\n\n• Deaths in Florida: At least 45 deaths suspected to be related to Ian have been reported in Florida, including 16 in Lee County, 12 in Charlotte County, eight in Collier County, four in Volusia County, one in Polk County, one in Lake County, one in Manatee County and two in unincorporated Sarasota County, according to officials. Unconfirmed death cases are being processed by local medical examiners, who decide whether they are disaster-related, state emergency management Director Kevin Guthrie said.\n\n• Hundreds of rescues and thousands of evacuations: The US Coast Guard has performed over 275 rescues in Florida, Rear Admiral Brendan McPherson told CNN. More than 700 rescues have happened across Florida so far, the governor reported Thursday, and thousands of evacuees have been reported. In Lee County, a hospital system had to evacuate more than 1,000 patients after its water supply was cut off, while other widespread evacuations have been reported in prisons and nursing homes. In Fort Myers, the fire chief was “pretty comfortable” by Friday morning everyone needing help there had been rescued, Mayor Kevin Anderson said. The Coast Guard is treating this like a military operation searching “block by block to make sure that everybody gets out.”\n\n• Historic flooding: Record flooding was recorded across central and northern Florida, including at least three rivers hitting all-time flood records. Officials in Orlando warned residents of dangerous flooding, which exceeded a foot in some areas.\n\n• Much of Fort Myers Beach obliterated: A helicopter flight over Fort Myers Beach shows utter devastation: empty or debris-littered lots where homes and businesses used to be and boats tossed into mangroves. “You’re talking about no structure left. … You’re talking about homes that were thrown into the bay. This is a long-term fix, and it’s life-changing,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said.\n\n• Coastal islands isolated from mainland: Sanibel and Captiva islands in southwest Florida are cut off from the mainland after several parts of a critical causeway were torn away. At least two people were killed in the storm in Sanibel, and the bridge may need to be completely rebuilt, local officials said. Chip Farrar, a resident of the tiny island of Matlacha, told CNN 50 feet of road essential to reaching the mainland bridge has been washed out, and a second nearby bridge has also collapsed.", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris Alaa Elassar Jason Hanna Elizabeth Wolfe", "Christina Maxouris", "Alaa Elassar", "Jason Hanna", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/weather/hurricane-ian-florida-path-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Ian continues to batter Florida as a Category 1 storm ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Affected by the storm?

Lee County’s began at 6 p.m. and is in place until further notice, while Charlotte County’s begins at 9 p.m. and ends at 6 a.m.\n\nCity of Naples Fire Rescue posted video of a water rescue in Naples, Florida. City of Naples Fire Rescue\n\nIn Punta Gorda, CNN’s Randi Kaye took shelter in a parking garage as she described how the streets were devoid of people and cars. Trees were either knocked down or standing and stripped bare. Debris could also be seen flying down the street and the only vehicle visible in the city had “STORMCHASER” written on the side.\n\nThe storm made landfall as a Category 4 near Cayo Costa around 3:05 p.m., with winds near 150 mph, according to the hurricane center. At this point, Hurricane Ian is tied for the strongest storm to make landfall on the west coast of the Florida peninsula, matching the wind speed of Hurricane Charley in 2004. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday Ian will rank as one of the top five hurricanes to ever hit the Florida peninsula, behind Hurricanes Andrew (1992) and Michael (2018).\n\nIan weakened to a Category 1 hurricane by Wednesday night as it moved across central Florida, churning sustained winds of 90 mph.\n\nNearly 2 million Florida utility customers were without power as of 6 p.m., according to PowerOutage.us. Officials in Cape Coral and Punta Gorda reported significant impacts, and the storm surge set records for the highest water levels ever observed in Fort Myers and Naples.\n\n“The storm surge is very significant. We’re seeing cars and boats float down the street. We’re seeing trees nearly bent in half,” Frank Loni, an architect from California staying in Fort Myers Beach for the storm, said midday Wednesday. “There’s quite a bit of chaos on the streets.”\n\nDeSantis said storm surge from Ian has hit up to 12 feet in some areas.”It is our meteorologist’s view that the storm surge has likely peaked and will be less in the coming hours,” he said.\n\nIan is expected to retain hurricane strength through the day and into tomorrow as the center of the storm moves northeast over the Florida Peninsula, passing close to Orlando and Daytona Beach, before moving back into the Atlantic Ocean Thursday afternoon. Hurricane warnings have been issued for not only southwest Florida, but also much of central Florida from coast to coast.\n\nA number of other weather advisories have also been issued throughout Florida. A flash flood emergency impacting more than 300,000 people is in effect south central Sarasota county, southeast Manatee, northwest Desoto, Hardee, and northwest Highlands counties through 10:45 p.m..\n\nAn extreme wind warning is in effect for Sebrin, Avon Park and Arcadia until 9:30 p.m. for extremely dangerous hurricane winds as the storm passes.\n\n‘The worst storm I have ever seen’\n\nWater levels in Fort Myers rose more than 6 feet over the span of seven hours and were still rising as strong winds continue to push water from the Gulf of Mexico ashore, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.\n\n“I’ve been here since the mid-70s, this is actually – by far – the worst storm I have ever seen,” Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nAbout 96% of Fort Myers is without electricity, Anderson told CNN’s Anderson Cooper late Wednesday. The mayor does not know how many people did not heed evacuation orders, but there are thousands currently in shelters.\n\nAnderson also emphasized that it is still unsafe to be outside and that people should stay away from floodwaters.\n\n“There’s no telling what’s in those waters, they are not safe. You know you could step on debris. You know, there’s runoff from sewers and just – it’s just not a good situation,” he said.\n\nJennifer Dexter, a spokesperson for the town of Fort Myers Beach, told CNN backup water pumps are down.\n\n“When the backup water pump system goes down, that shows you how serious it is,” Dexter said. A boil water notice went into effect due to storm surge, loss of power and damage to the backup generators for the drinking water supply.\n\nPresident Biden spoke with the mayor Wednesday, the White House said in a statement. The two leaders “discussed Fort Myers’ ongoing needs including support for the elderly members of the community, families that live in mobile homes and other community members who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the storm,” according to a readout of the call provided by the White House.\n\nThe President also tried to reach the mayors of Cape Coral, Sarasota and the Chair of Charlotte County, Florida, but was unable to reach them and left messages instead, the White House said.\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall in Florida as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon. Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIn Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor urged residents Wednesday to shelter in place, saying the worst of the storm is “yet to come.”\n\n“We are expecting that we’re going to get the majority of the rain and the higher winds starting about 8 p.m. and they’re going to last throughout the night,” she said. “We are still expecting widespread flooding throughout our city, and anywhere from tropical storm wind speeds to the possibly of category one hurricane wind speeds.”\n\nCastor said that officials are expecting flooding sometime in the next 24 hours.\n\n“We’re going to see the continued rain, the rain will increase dramatically and then that water is going to come back into the Bay as Hurricane Ian continues its northeasterly trajectory.”\n\nFurther south, The Olde Naples Seaport, a community of condos that overlooks the Naples Bay, was consumed by storm surge, according to video shot by Graham Pederson. Pederson experienced knee-high water trying to escape.\n\nIn another video shot from the second floor, wind is seen whipping trees and trucks nearly submerged by the water. Pederson retreated to the second floor to wait out the storm, his brother-in-law Kyle Wendel told CNN.\n\nVideo was taken from Estero Blvd in Fort Myers Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, September 28, 2022. Frank Loni\n\nDeSantis said Wednesday calls for help are coming into several counties due to the storm. The governor said emergency responders have received calls from people in evacuation zones that did not evacuate. Those calls are being logged, he said.\n\n“Local first responders will deploy as soon as it’s safe to do so,” DeSantis said. “By and large until the storm passes, they are not going to go into a situation for rescue and put their own folks at risk.”\n\nDeSantis requested Biden approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state due to Hurricane Ian, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also requesting that the President grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian’s landfall.\n\nIan already producing record water surge levels\n\nMuch of west-central Florida and places inland face “historic” storm surge, rain and crushing winds. “This is a wind storm and a surge storm and a flood storm, all in one,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.\n\nImages and video have showed extensive flooding in coastal neighborhoods in Naples and Fort Myers Beach.\n\nStorm surge began rising late Wednesday morning – more than 4.5 feet above normal highest tides was recorded before noon in Naples, already higher than the previous record there of 4.02 feet from Hurricane Irma in 2017.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for flood-prone areas on the coast, and the National Weather Service warned those who stayed behind to move to upper floors in case of rising water levels.\n\nIan’s dangers still include:\n\n• Storm surge: Some 12 to 18 feet of seawater pushed onto land was predicted Wednesday for the coastal Fort Myers area, from Englewood to Bonita Beach, forecasters said. Only slightly less is forecast for a stretch from Bonita Beach down to near the Everglades (8 to 12 feet), and from near Bradenton to Englewood (6 to 10 feet), forecasters said.\n\nLower – but still life-threatening – surge is possible elsewhere, including north of Tampa and along Florida’s northeast coast near Jacksonville.\n\n• Winds: Southwest Florida is facing “catastrophic wind damage” from ongoing hurricane-force winds. Winds near the core of Hurricane Ian could exceed 140 mph, with higher gusts, the hurricane center said. Multiple locations, including Sanibel Island, recorded wind gusts above 100 mph.\n\n• Flooding rain: 12 to 30 inches of rain could fall in central and northeastern Florida – including Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. That makes for a top-of-scale risk for flooding rainfall across this area. This amount of rain would usually be two to three months’ worth, but is now falling in less than two days, according to CNN meteorologist Gene Norman.\n\n“As this storm passes your community, understand this is still a hazardous situation” because of downed powerlines, misuse of generators and standing water, Gov. DeSantis said during a Wednesday evening news conference.\n\nWhere the hurricane is headed\n\nIan’s center is expected to move over central Florida through Thursday morning. Heavy rain and flooding also is possible in southern Florida, Georgia and coastal South Carolina. The governors of Virginia, North and South Carolina have already declared states of emergency in their respective states.\n\nStorm warnings have expanded northward to North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. update. A tropical storm warning has been extended to Surf City and a tropical storm watch has been issued from north of Surf City to Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\n\nA storm surge watch has been issued north of South Santee River, South Carolina, to Little River Inlet.\n\nBecause Ian slowly approached land, the worst conditions could remain over some areas for eight or more hours.\n\n“Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river flooding is expected” across central and southern Florida, the hurricane center said.\n\nBy late Thursday, Ian is due to emerge over the Atlantic Ocean, where it could strengthen again and affect another part of the US.\n\nPrior to nearing Florida, Hurricane Ian pummeled Cuba on Tuesday, leaving at least two dead and an islandwide blackout. The US Coast Guard said it has rescued at least three people off the Florida coast, about 2 miles south of Boca Chica.\n\n“They were brought to the local hospital for symptoms of exhaustion and dehydration. Air crews are still searching,” the Coast Guard said in a tweet.\n\nAccording to US Border Patrol Chief for the Miami Sector, the agency has been searching for more than 20 migrants after the arrival of Cubans who swam to shore after their boat sank due to Ian.\n\nAfter the devastation in Cuba, more than 2.5 million people in Florida were advised to flee, including 1.75 million under mandatory evacuation orders – no small ask in a state with a large elderly population.\n\nOfficials prepare for post-storm rescue\n\nSarasota County Sheriff Deputies block the access to a downtown bridge over to the barrier islands as Hurricane Ian approaches Florida's Gulf Coast on September 28. Steve Nesius/Reuters\n\nLaw enforcement officials around the state warned that people who stayed behind in evacuation areas cannot expect rescuers to respond to calls for help during the storm when winds are high.\n\n“If you call for help, once we pull (officers) off the road … we’re not coming. … We’re not putting people in peril when (others) didn’t heed the mandatory evacuation order,” Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said Wednesday.\n\nNot everyone moved. Chelsye Napier, of Fort Myers, stayed home with her fiance and cats despite being in an evacuation zone, she told CNN Wednesday. They waited “because we don’t know anyone down here,” and ultimately decided to stay put, she said.\n\nIan's winds could be catastrophic Category 4: 130-156 mph • Most of the area is uninhabitable for weeks or months. • Power outages last weeks to months. • Fallen trees and power poles isolate residential areas. + Well-built framed homes sustain severe damage. Category 5: 157+ mph + A high percentage of framed homes are destroyed. Source: National Hurricane Center\n\n“If anything happens, we have everything that we need here. We’ve got food, we got water. We have everything that we need here,” she said. “So it’s all OK for right now. We’ll see, though, later on.”\n\nAs millions were told evacuate, 176 shelters opened statewide and hotels and Airbnbs opened to people leaving evacuation zones, DeSantis said.\n\nLocal governments and state agencies also prepared those living in nursing homes and other senior care facilities to evacuate. Florida has around 6 million residents over the age of 60, according to the state’s Department of Elder Affairs – nearly 30% of its total population.\n\nHeather Danenhower, with Duke Energy, walks around utility trucks that are staged in a rural lot in The Villages of Sumter County on Wednesday. Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP\n\nAuthorities also readied services to fan out and respond to calls for rescue and then, in the aftermath of the hurricane, for recovery and repair efforts.\n\nNearly 400 ambulances, buses and support vehicles were responding to areas where the hurricane was expected to make landfall, according to the governor’s office.\n\nDeSantis activated 5,000 Florida National Guard members for Ian’s response operations, and 2,000 more guardsmen from Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina were being activated to assist.\n\nFlorida urban search and rescue teams also were prepping.\n\n“We have five state teams that are activated with additional five FEMA teams that are in play,” Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said at a news conference Tuesday night. “We have over 600 resources to bear in addition to these out-of-town teams.”\n\nHelp is coming from out of state, too. At least 26 states have answered the call for assistance by Florida, DeSantis said Wednesday evening, including Alabama and Louisiana.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards tweeted Wedensday his state has already sent “significant resources” to Florida.\n\n“We are also prepared to send additional help once damage assessment begins,” Edwards’ tweet read.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey tweeted her state sent Blackhawk helicopters to help. Tennessee and Louisiana also sent resources to aid in search and rescue.\n\n“If they need it and we’ve got it, then we’re going to send it,” Ivey tweeted.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Eric Levenson Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Eric Levenson", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/01/hurricane-ian-live-updates-north-carolina-virginia-florida/8141280001/", "title": "Hurricane Ian live updates: Death toll rises; 1,000 rescued in Florida", "text": "Editor's note: Don't have power?

Four people died in North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said Saturday.\n\nNow a post-tropical cyclone, Ian churned northward Saturday across central North Carolina heading toward Virginia after hammering the coast of South Carolina and devastating swaths of Florida.\n\nPower was knocked out to over 64,000 customers in North Carolina and more than 21,000 in Virginia as of Saturday evening, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nIn South Carolina, nearly 7,000 people were still without power after Ian toppled trees and flooded roadways. Still, no deaths were immediately reported in South Carolina and damage was minimal, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a Saturday news conference.\n\n\"There is damage. There's some heartbreak. There's work to be done,\" he said. \"But all in all, it is a good story for South Carolina.\"\n\nMeanwhile, over 1 million people remained without power in Florida as officials assessed the damage and continued search and rescue efforts. The storm left a broad trail of destruction in the state, flooding areas on both of its coasts, tearing homes from their slabs and demolishing beachfront businesses.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday that Hurricane Ian is “likely to rank among the worst in the nation’s history” and Florida will take “months – years – to rebuild.”\n\nGET TEXT UPDATES:Sign up here for text updates on Ian.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►Florida Gov.

The storm is expected to weaken and dissipate over south-central Virginia by Saturday night.\n\nBut until then, Ian will bring gusty winds and drop 2 to 4 inches of rain with local maximums of 6 inches onto the central Appalachians and coastal mid-Atlantic, which may see limited flash and urban flooding.\n\nMajor river flooding is expected in parts of central Florida into next week, but swells seen in the Southeast should subside over the weekend.\n\n'BABY, IT'S TIME TO GO':First-time Florida mom gives birth in midst of Ian's wrath\n\nA PATH OF DESTRUCTION:Photos show Hurricane Ian's damage in Cuba, Florida, Carolinas\n\nDeath toll likely to grow in Florida, other states\n\nThe destruction left behind by Ian has made it difficult to quickly know how many had perished in the storm, but the death count has climbed to 32, the Associated Press said Saturday.\n\nOn Friday morning, Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said there were as many as 21 deaths, but only one had been confirmed as the result of the storm, while officials were evaluating 20 other deaths.\n\nAmong the newly reported deaths in Florida were a 62-year-old woman who was injured and drowned after a tree fell on a mobile home, a 54-year-old man found trapped in a window after drowning and a woman tangled in wires in Florida's Lee County.\n\nMost of the people who died in Florida drowned, but others died in the aftermath of the storm, including an elderly couple who died after their oxygen machines lost power.\n\nThe storm also killed at least four people in North Carolina, including a 25-year-old man whose vehicle hydroplaned, a 24-year-old woman whose vehicle slipped off a wet road and struck a tree, a 22-year-old man who drowned in his truck and a 65-year-old man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning from his generator, Gov. Cooper said in a Saturday statement.\n\n\"We mourn with the families of those who have died and urge everyone to be cautious while cleaning up to avoid more deaths or injuries,\" Cooper said.\n\nNo deaths have been immediately reported in South Carolina, Gov.

Heavy equipment rolled through on trailers, and there were major detours in place because of flooding-related safety closure of nearby Interstate 75.\n\nTree-trimmers, water-damage repair workers and electricians were busy at work restoring services to an area that saw heavy winds but relatively less damage than neighboring Edgewater.\n\nAfter getting up early, Douglas Schuler, 75, waited in line for an hour at Costco to get gas for his generator, which he’s been sharing with neighbors. He said he still doesn’t have reliable cell service but wanted people to know his neighborhood in the South Venice area was recovering.\n\n“I’ve got relatives in the Midwest who are probably wondering if we’re OK,” he said. “We’re a lot better off than most.”\n\nAfter getting gas, Schuler loaded his SUV with a chainsaw and other equipment to clear broken branches from around the South Venice Baptist Church, where he’s set to be named a deacon on Sunday.\n\nHe’s seen a few of his fellow parishioners around and encouraged them to attend Sunday services but wasn’t sure who would actually show up.\n\n“We’ll see how many come,” he said. “We’re going to try make life feel normal.”\n\n— Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY\n\nInland Florida choked by river flooding\n\nRising waters continue to wreak havoc in Florida, where river flooding persists long after winds have passed.\n\nAs heavy rains flow into suburban and inland areas, continued river flooding shows how Ian's impacts have stretched far beyond Florida's beaches and coastal towns.\n\n\"It's causing a lot of problems really across the state,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday, adding that some parts of central Florida have more standing water than parts of southwest Florida.\n\nThe rising waters have turned roads into canals, flooded vehicles and trapped families in waterlogged homes. In North Port, a Sarasota suburb, residents are beginning to run out of food and water.\n\n\"Water just keeps going up,\" said Samuel Almanzar, 42. \"Who knows when it is going to stop.\"\n\nLocal officials have said some areas will see rising water levels over the next two days and encouraged residents of flooded neighborhoods to evacuate.\n\nCrews from 30 states rush to restore power in Florida\n\nOf its 2.1 million customers who lost power after Hurricane Ian, Florida Power & Light, a utility that serves about half of Floridians, has restored electricity to two-thirds of them, or 1.4 million customers, Bryan Garner, a spokesperson for the company, told USA TODAY on Saturday.\n\nCrews of about 21,000 people, including those providing aid from 30 states, are working to restore electricity to remaining customers, most of whom can expect power by next week. Garner said FPL will have clearer timelines for hardest-hit communities by Saturday night.\n\n\"In those hardest hit areas, there's likely such catastrophic damage that, even if we get the grid repaired, there will be homes and businesses that will not be able to receive power,\" he said. \"For some homes and businesses, something may have to be rebuilt and electricians may have to come in, so they may be out for an extended period of time.\"\n\nFlooding expected but still 'heartbreaking'\n\nAs Ian drenched some areas with up to 17 inches of rain, floodwaters spilled out of scenic lakes, ponds and rivers and into homes, forcing emergency evacuations and rescues.\n\nResearchers who study flooding, development and climate change were horrified by the emerging images but not surprised. For years, they’ve warned sprawling development in Florida and other coastal states isn’t sustainable, especially with the warming climate supercharging hurricane rainfall.\n\n\"This is kind of what we had expected for days in advance, and it's still heartbreaking to see so many people stranded,\" said Kevin Reed, associate professor in atmospheric science at Stony Brook University in New York.\n\nHe and other experts said they expect Ian's devastation to lead to a push for Florida to do more to protect residents from future flooding as the warming climate makes natural disasters and rainfall more extreme.\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nAt least 25 dead in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona\n\nLess than two weeks after Hurricane Fiona devastated Puerto Rico and plunged the island into darkness, the country's health department announced that at least 25 people have died from the storm.\n\nThe deaths may be either directly or indirectly related to the hurricane, the department said.\n\nEighteen of the deaths were people over 65, while 15 were men while 10 were women.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Thao Nguyen, Jorge Ortiz, Doyle Rice, Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/28/hurricane-ian-live-updates-tracker-path-forecast/10447576002/", "title": "Hurricane Ian one of strongest storms in US history; 2M in Florida ...", "text": "This page recaps the news of Wednesday, Sept. 28.

Click here for a lite version of this page with a quicker load time.\n\nHurricane Ian slammed into Florida's southwestern coast Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history, tearing apart homes and buildings and leaving some residents stranded as storm surge flooded communities.\n\nThe storm made landfall near Cayo Costa as a Category 4 storm Wednesday afternoon with maximum sustained winds measured at a stunning 150 mph — only 7 mph slower than a Category 5, the highest status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale of Hurricane Intensity. It slowed as it lashed the state and was downgraded to a Category 1 storm Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center reported.\n\n\"It is going to have major, major impacts in terms of wind, in terms of rain, in terms of flooding,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned in a briefing Wednesday. \"So this is going to be a nasty, nasty day, two days.\"\n\nAs of 11 p.m. ET, the storm's center was located 70 miles south of Orlando. The storm was moving north-northeast at 8 mph with weakening maximum sustained winds at 90 mph, according to the hurricane center. Ian is forecast to continue to weaken and move slowly over Florida, slamming much of the state with life-threatening storm surge, catastrophic winds and flooding, the National Hurricane Center said. It then is set to trek north-northwest, likely hitting parts of Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n► More than 2 million are without power in Florida, according to PowerOutage.us. That number might continue to rise as the storm continues its trek across the state.\n\n► In Naples, Fla., the first floor of a fire station was inundated with about 3 feet of water and firefighters worked to salvage gear from a firetruck stuck outside the garage in even deeper water, a video posted by the Naples Fire Department showed.\n\n► Ian’s strength at landfall tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane when measured by wind speed to strike the U.S. It's tied with five other hurricanes that reached 150 mph — two in Florida, two in Louisiana, and one in Texas.\n\n► Residents described the terror after a tornado tore through a condominium complex near Delray Beach, ripping off roofs and turning over vehicles. \"I felt things blow past my head and face,\" resident Jim Travis said. \"When I opened the door, my apartment was destroyed.\" Read more.\n\nQuick links:\n\nGET IAN TEXT UPDATES: Sign up here for text updates on the latest\n\nHURRICANE TRACKER: Where is Ian headed? See the map.\n\nIAN FORECAST: Ian likely to spend days dumping rain on Florida. Here's the outlook.\n\nIan weakens to Category 1 hurricane, will continue to lash Florida Thursday\n\nHurricane Ian weakened to a Category 1 storm late Wednesday, a sharp downgrade from the strong Category 4 storm it was when it made landfall earlier in the day.\n\nThe storm's wind speeds slowed drastically throughout the day after making landfall in Florida. By 11 p.m. ET, maximum sustained winds were measured at 90 mph, down from 150 mph earlier in the day, the National Hurricane Center reported. Forecasters say the storm will soon be downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves east across Florida.\n\nThe center of the hurricane is expected to move over central Florida overnight, approaching Florida's east coast Thur. It will then turn north-northwest into the Atlantic Ocean and back toward Georgia and South Carolina on Friday, the center said.\n\nAlthough further weakening is expected, Ian could be near hurricane strength when it moves across the state tomorrow and into Friday when it approaches coastal states to the north.\n\n911 callers report being stranded in homes\n\nHurricane Ian’s massive wind gusts, storm surge and flooding have wiped out 911 emergency call centers and trapped people in their homes, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe storm forced the rerouting of emergency calls and delayed responses in Lee, Hendry and Glades counties, DeSantis said during a Wednesday evening briefing.\n\nAnd in the coastal city of Naples, the sheriff’s department reported on Facebook that it was getting “a significant number of calls of people trapped by water in their homes\" and that it would prioritize reaching people “reporting life threatening medical emergencies in deep water.”\n\nEarlier in the day, the sheriff’s office said multiple parking garages had flooded with cars underwater.\n\n2 million without power in Florida. Restoring it could take days, weeks\n\nNearly 2 million Floridians were without power as of 10 p.m. ET, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n\"That number is going to grow,\" DeSantis said. \"You’re going to get more power outages.\"\n\nThe massive hurricane could force Florida Power & Light (FPL) to do a “complete rebuild” in some parts of Florida’s west coast, which could take days or weeks, the utility company told CNN.\n\n“What we're seeing already just from some of the early visuals, we expect that there are going to be parts of our system on the West Coast, which will need to be rebuilt and that is going to take longer — could be a number of days, could be a matter of weeks, depending on the nature of the damages,” said Dave Reuter, chief communications officer for Florida Power & Light.\n\nMore customers, he said, will be losing power as the path of the storm crosses central Florida.\n\nCoast Guard looks for Cuban migrants after boat sinks off Florida Keys\n\nFour Cuban migrants swam to shore in the Florida Keys, and three others were rescued from the ocean after their boat sank Wednesday, shortly before Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwest Florida. But it’s possible that 20 more people are still missing, officials said.\n\nThe four Cubans reached Stock Island, just east of Key West, and reported their vessel sank because of inclement weather, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Chief Patrol Agent Walter N. Slosar posted on Twitter.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard initiated a search and rescue mission for 23 people and managed to find three survivors about two miles south of the island chain, officials said. The survivors were taken to a local hospital for symptoms of exhaustion and dehydration. Air crews continued to search for the remaining migrants.\n\nIan larger than 2004 Hurricane Charley that caused 31 deaths\n\nHurricane Ian is following an eerily similar path to the strongest recorded hurricane to hit Southwest Florida — and it is nearly three times its size.\n\nHurricane Charley ravaged Southwest Florida in August 2004, and 31 people died in relation to the hurricane, the CDC said.\n\nBut despite its damage, Charley was a relatively small hurricane: it was fairly contained to a limited area in its swath across Florida. The worst storm surge was around seven feet in a small area of the state's west coast.\n\nHurricane Ian is much larger. As of Wednesday morning, its area of hurricane-force winds was nearly three times larger than Charley's, up to 45 miles from the center, and its area of tropical-storm-force winds extended outward up to 175 miles.\n\n“This is way, way, way bigger than Charlie,\" DeSantis said during a press conference Wednesday.\n\nIan's winds prompt rare 'extreme wind warning'\n\nAn extreme wind warning was in effect was in effect for portions of southwest Florida for extremely dangerous hurricane winds as Ian came ashore. \"Treat these imminent extreme winds as if a tornado was approaching and move immediately to an interior room or shelter NOW!,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\nStorm slowing down means 24 hours of 'wind pushing water'\n\nNational Weather Service Director Ken Graham said the storm was moving at 9 mph and was slowing down. It will take 24 hours or more to cross the state, he said – \"24 hours of rainfall, 24 hours of wind pushing the water.\"\n\nSome areas will see 24 inches of rain, some will see storm surge of 18 feet, he said.\n\n\"This is a devastating storm for parts of Florida, not just on the southwest coast but inland,\" he said. \"This is going to be a storm we will talk about for many years to come. It's a historic event.\"\n\nGeorgia, South Carolina to see Ian's fury\n\nIan was expected to weaken after landfall, the hurricane center said, but the storm could remain near hurricane strength when it moves over Florida's east coast Thursday. And could still hold its power as it approaches the northeastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts late Friday.\n\nHeavy rainfall will spread across the Florida peninsula through Thursday.\n\n\"Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flooding is expected across portions of central Florida with considerable flooding in southern Florida, northern Florida, southeastern Georgia and coastal South Carolina,\" the service said in an advisory.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued a state of emergency order for the entire state and said up to 500 National Guard troops were preparing to be called up if needed.\n\nFEMA: Storm surge, flooding biggest concerns\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Director Deanne Criswell says her biggest concern is the expected storm surge and inland flooding from heavy rains as the storm crawls across Florida over the next two days. She urged residents across the state to heed the warnings of local officials for the \"historic and catastrophic impacts that we are already beginning to see.\"\n\n\"Water is dangerous, period,\" Criswell said at a briefing Wednesday. \"From coastal storm surge to inland flooding, the majority of the state of Florida is in Ian's crosshairs.\"\n\nPREPARE YOUR POOL FOR A HURRICANE: Pool owners guide\n\nWAFFLE HOUSE OUTLETS BOW TO IAN:How bad will hurricane hit Florida?

For the latest coverage of Hurricane Ian from Wednesday, Sept. 28, see our live updates here.\n\nHurricane Ian strengthened into an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds at 140 mph, and is expected to cause life-threatening storm surge, catastrophic winds and flooding in the Florida Peninsula, the National Hurricane Center said Wednesday.\n\nTornadoes also are a risk and several warnings and watches have been issued around the state into Wednesday morning as rain bands move across Florida.\n\nIan slammed into Cuba on Tuesday, a Category 3 monster pounding the island with 125 mph winds. High winds and storm surge are still expected farther north into the Tampa Bay region, state Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Floridians faced mandatory evacuation orders as the National Hurricane Center expanded its hurricane warning along more than 150 miles of the state's Gulf Coast. Power outages can be expected statewide, Florida Power & Light warned.\n\nLATEST NEWS:Hurricane Ian nears historic Category 5 status, closes in on Florida\n\nAs of Tuesday night, power outages were already occurring in the Florida Keys and South Florida, according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nOn the forecast track, the center of Ian is expected to approach the west coast of Florida within the hurricane warning area Wednesday morning, and make landfall later.\n\nAt 5 a.m., the center of Hurricane Ian was located 75 miles west-southwest of Naples.\n\nThe center of Ian is forecast to move over central Florida Wednesday night and Thursday morning and emerge over the western Atlantic by late Thursday.\n\nAlong with the howling winds, parts of Central Florida could see 12 to 16 inches of rain, and 2 feet is possible in isolated areas, the hurricane center said. DeSantis said there was potential for \"historic\" storm surge and flooding.\n\n\"In some areas, there will be catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge,\" DeSantis said Tuesday. \"Because of the size of the storm, it's kicking up a lot of surge. The Gulf is going to be very angry as this comes in.\"\n\nThe Florida Keys saw hurricane-force winds and heavy rain late Tuesday as Ian advanced toward the state, DeSantis said during a news conference Tuesday night.\n\nA storm surge warning remains in effect along the state's west coast with the highest risk in the Naples to Sarasota region.\n\nDeSantis warned that flooding was likely across much of west Florida. He also raised the possibility that after landfall, a weakening Ian would continue to march across Central Florida before exiting the state Friday near Volusia County on the Atlantic coast.\n\n“This is a lot of nasty weather that we’re in store for over the next few days,” DeSantis said.\n\nWHAT IS STORM SURGE? Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nOther developments:\n\n►8,000 customers were without power in southeastern Florida and 30,000 utility workers are standing by to help respond to power outages, DeSantis said.\n\n►In preparation for flooding and damages, 176 disaster shelters have opened and more shelters are expected to open, according to DeSantis.\n\n►DeSantis’ authorization, a total of 5,000 Florida Guardsmen are being activated to State Active Duty and pre-positioned at armories across the state for Ian response operations. 2,000 Guardsmen from Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina are also being activated to assist.\n\n►Orlando International Airport will shut down Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Over 1,200 flights slated for Tuesday and Wednesday have been canceled due to the anticipated hurricane, according to flight-tracking site Flightaware.com.\n\n►The hurricane center expanded its hurricane warning to include Bonita Beach north through Tampa Bay to the Anclote River. Fort Myers is in the hurricane zone, and Tampa and St. Petersburg could still get a direct hit by a major hurricane for the first time in a century.\n\nTampa may not see landfall, but big hit likely\n\nTampa was no longer the most likely place for landfall, but the local forecast still calls for massive amounts of rain. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Kottlowski said Tampa will still get a storm surge, but nothing like anticipated in earlier forecasts. And \"it's very possible this thing could kind of wobble\" further north than what computer models are suggesting.\n\nThe Tampa area sits at sea level, which makes it especially vulnerable to storm surge, weather service meteorologist Christianne Pearce said.\n\n“Any amount of storm surge could be significant in those areas, especially with as much it's been built up, and storm surge and any kind of inland flooding could be significant,” Pearce said.\n\nStorm will slow, linger over Florida 'for a long time'\n\nFEMA administrator Deanne Criswell, speaking at a White House briefing, said the storm will make landfall somewhere between Tampa and Fort Myers. The entire state will be affected, and \"everyone needs to stay focused,\" she said. By the time Ian reaches Florida, the storm will slow to about 5 mph, which means storm surge is the biggest concern, she said.\n\n\"This is significant because what his means is that Floridians are going to experience the impacts of this storm for a very long time,\" she said.\n\nFlorida theme parks preparing to close\n\nFlorida's theme parks are hurriedly preparing for its arrival. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, just miles from where the hurricane was previously expected to make landfall, was the first park to shutter ahead of the storm. Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando and LEGOLAND Florida will follow suit on Wednesday.\n\n\"Everything revolves around the safety of our guests and team members,\" Universal Orlando Resort said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nEvacuees need not go too far\n\nGuthrie said those looking to leave the storm's path may not have to go far.\n\n\"Many people in the Southwest Florida area, your best bet is going to be evacuate across the state,\" Guthrie said. \"Just go straight across the state to Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach.\"\n\nDeSantis said that for some evacuees, moving to a nearby building on higher ground might be sufficient.\n\n\"This is not necessarily saying you have to evacuate to another state,\" DeSantis said. \"When we say evacuate, we don't mean keep traveling until you have no chance of getting rained on.\"\n\nWaiting for the storm on Sarasota County's Siesta Key\n\nAndrew and Pam Trapani were resigned to riding out Hurricane Ian in their Siesta Key home Tuesday. They thought about leaving as the forecast worsened, but by the time the Trapanis considered evacuating, they couldn't find a hotel. They decided their house – built in 2017 at 17 feet of elevation with hurricane-resistant windows and a whole-house generator – was safe enough. It sits on 55 pilings driven 35 feet into the ground and has a bottom floor designed for floodwater to wash through.\n\nAndrew Trapani said it always felt as if the region was protected from big storms. But he isn't overconfident.\n\n\"I'm not much of a drinker, but I'll probably have a few Scotches the next few days,\" he said.\n\nSanibel businesses board up; shops prep for Ian\n\nNick Ticich and his family have owned the T-Shirt Hut in Sanibel, about 50 miles south of Venice, since the 1950s. Over the past 50 years, the family has battled a handful of hurricanes and won nearly every time. Yet after his family almost lost the store when Hurricane Charley ripped through the tiny town in 2004, he said he still feels the need to board up for each oncoming disaster.\n\n\"It could come at us,\" Ticich said as he boarded up his shop. \"We can lose the building. We can lose everything.\"\n\nCuba without electricity after Ian slams power grid\n\nIan made landfall on Cuba's western tip, where officials set up shelters, rushed in emergency personnel and worked to protect crops in Cuba’s tobacco-growing region.\n\n\"Significant wind and storm surge impacts (are) occurring over Cuba,\" said Daniel Brown, senior hurricane specialist and the warning coordination meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\nCuba’s Electric Union said in a statement that work was underway to gradually restore service to the country’s 11 million people during the night. Power was initially knocked out to about 1 million people in Cuba’s western provinces, but later the entire grid collapsed.\n\nThe storm was forecast to roll off Cuba and strengthen to a Category 4 storm over warm Gulf of Mexico waters. The storm's winds could reach 140 mph before reaching Florida as soon as Wednesday.\n\nHurricane Ian tracker\n\nIan will slow over the Gulf, growing wider and stronger, “which will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts along the west coast of Florida,” the hurricane center said.\n\nIan was forecast to emerge over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday and approach the west coast of Florida on Wednesday and Wednesday night. The storm is predicted to slow during this period, the National Hurricane Center warned in an advisory.\n\n\"This would likely prolong the storm surge, wind and rainfall impacts along the affected portions of the west coast of Florida,\" the advisory says.\n\nRAPID INTENSIFICATION:What does that mean?\n\nLANDFALL IN CUBA:Hurricane Ian grows stronger\n\nHeavy rain, flooding forecast for Southeast\n\nHeavy rainfall is expected to affect the Southeast on Friday and Saturday, the weather service said. \"Widespread, considerable\" flash and urban flooding are expected mid- to late week across central and northern Florida, southern Georgia and coastal South Carolina. Significant, prolonged river flooding is expected across central to northern Florida.\n\nLimited flash and river flooding is expected over portions of the Southeast into the mid-Atlantic mid- to late week.\n\nWHAT IS STORM SURGE?:It's often a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nFlorida National Guard called into duty\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has issued a statewide state of emergency, said 5,000 Florida National Guard members were being called into duty, and 2,000 more are being sent to Florida from nearby states. The state is working to load 360 trailers with more than 2 million meals and more than 1 million gallons of water to prepare for distribution. Urban Search and Rescue Teams are ready to mobilize where needed, DeSantis said.\n\n“There is going to be an interruption of power, so just plan on that,\" DeSantis said. “The impacts are going to be far and wide.\"\n\nHURRICANE CATEGORIES EXPLAINED:Breaking down the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind speed scale\n\nWhat is 'rapid intensification'?\n\n\"Rapid intensification\" is a process in which a storm undergoes accelerated growth: The phenomenon is typically defined to be a tropical cyclone (whether a tropical storm or hurricane) intensifying by at least 35 mph within 24 hours. Ian is predicted to fit this definition. The storm's winds were forecast to approach 140 mph by late Tuesday.\n\nRapid intensification occurs when a tropical storm or hurricane encounters an \"extremely conducive environment,\" Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. That typically includes very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of midlevel moisture. Out of the nine hurricanes with winds of 150 mph or greater that struck the U.S. mainland over 103 years, all but one saw the explosion of force and power known as rapid intensification.\n\nCategory 4 storms can cause 'catastrophic' damage\n\nIf the storm struck as a Category 4 hurricane, it could cause \"catastrophic\" damage, and power outages could last weeks or months, according to the National Weather Service's description of storms that strong. Areas can be uninhabitable for weeks or months, the weather service says.\n\n“Even if you’re not necessarily right in the eye of the path of the storm, there’s going to be pretty broad impacts throughout the state,\" DeSantis warned.\n\nContributing: Ashley Williams; Celina Tebor, Doyle Rice, Eve Chen and Jane Onyanga-Omara, USA TODAY; Zac Anderson and Steven Walker, Sarasota Herald-Tribune; Samantha Neely, Cheryl McCloud and Diane Pantaleo of Fort Myers News-Press; John Kennedy, Hannah Morse, and Sergio Bustos, USA TODAY Network; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/30/hurricane-ian-live-updates-death-toll-damage-path-forecast/8133688001/", "title": "Hurricane Ian live updates: Storm hits Carolinas; Florida death rising", "text": "Editor's note: Don't have power? Click here for a lite version of this page with a quicker load time.\n\nIan started trekking through the Carolinas Friday, hammering the coast of South Carolina with flooding as it made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, then taking aim at North Carolina as a post-tropical cyclone.\n\nThe second landfall on the U.S. mainland came as Floridians surveyed the damage days after the storm battered the state. Ian is expected to wreak havoc on numerous states along the East Coast as it moves inland over the weekend.\n\nIn South Carolina, trees have been toppled, roads flooded and over 69,000 households had already lost power, officials said at a Friday news conference. That number had risen to over 180,000 customers without power immediately after landfall, according to poweroutage.us. The state's five shelters were at 15% capacity ahead of landfall.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said no deaths have been reported in the state yet, \"but there's still life-threatening conditions.\" He urged residents to stay off flooded roadways.\n\n\"This is not as bad as it could have been. A lot of prayers have been answered,\" he said. \"...But we're not out of the woods.\"\n\nIan is the first landfalling hurricane in South Carolina since Matthew in 2016, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nOfficials in Florida, meanwhile, were assessing the damage and continuing search and rescue efforts after Ian slammed into the Fort Myers area on Wednesday as a Category 4 storm.\n\nLocal officials said they were sorting through potentially dozens of deaths to determine if they were storm related. On Friday, the Associated Press reported the death toll was at least 27.\n\nIan left a broad swath of destruction in Florida, flooding areas on both of its coasts, tearing homes from their slabs, demolishing beachfront businesses and leaving more than 2 million people without power.\n\nEven though the storm system has long passed over Florida, new issues were still presenting themselves Friday night. A 14-mile stretch of Interstate 75 was closed in both directions in the Port Charlotte area because of the amount of water in the Myakka River, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThere had been 700 rescues as of Friday morning, officials said. Meanwhile, 1.5 million customers were still without power across the state, and Lee County was without water after a main break.\n\n\"There's been really a Herculean effort,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said Friday morning.\n\nSens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott sent a joint letter Friday to the Senate Appropriations Committee chairs to secure funding to “provide much needed assistance to Florida.”\n\n\"Hurricane Ian will be remembered and studied as one of the most devastating hurricanes to hit the United States,” they wrote. “Communities across Florida have been completely destroyed, and lives have been forever changed.\"\n\nGET TEXT UPDATES:Sign up here for text updates on Ian.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►President Joe Biden declared an emergency in South Carolina and ordered federal assistance, according to the White House.\n\n►Losses from Hurricane Ian so far range between $25 billion and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday.\n\n►At least nine people were rescued after a boat with more than 20 migrants sank in stormy weather near the Florida Keys. On Friday, the Coast Guard said one person's body was recovered near Ocean Edge Marina.\n\n►Airports in Tampa and Orlando were expected to reopen Friday, while Fort Myers Airport in southwest Florida remained closed Friday. More than 1,660 flights were canceled Friday due to the storm, according to FlightAware.\n\n► Volusia County Community Information Director Kevin Captain said at a news conference Friday afternoon that the Daytona International Speedway has been flooded by Hurricane Ian. \"Even our iconic speedway is underwater,\" he said.\n\nDeath toll likely to grow in Florida\n\nThe destruction left behind by Ian has made it difficult to quickly know how many had perished in the storm, but the death count reaches at least 27, the Associated Press reported Friday.\n\nEight were in Collier County and 12 were in Charlotte County, where the only operating hospital is no longer accepting new patients due to lack of capacity, Chris Constance, the county’s commissioner, told CNN.\n\nLocal officials were also reporting deaths:\n\nSanibel Island officials reported two deaths on Thursday.\n\nofficials reported two deaths on Thursday.

The move clears the way for FEMA assistance during recovery efforts. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said at a Friday press conference the administration was certain to add more counties to that list.\n\nCape Coral Fire Chief Ryan Lamb said Ian was a \"catastrophic\" event.\n\n\"It’s going to take years.

Another option would have been to “crawl into a dumpster” – but, he wondered, would that really be safe in a hurricane?\n\n“The main goal is to stay out of the rain,” William said. “The water – that’s what can carry you away.”\n\nRain whipped trees and power lines and left many areas on Charleston’s downtown peninsula under water. Parts of four piers along the coast, including two at Myrtle Beach, collapsed into the churning waves and washed away. Online cameras showed seawater filling neighborhoods in Garden City to calf level.\n\n-Joanna Johnson and Clare Amari, the Spartanburg Herald-Journal; The Associated Press\n\nIsland forecast: A look at Kiawah, Hilton Head and Pawleys\n\nKiawah Island: Located about 26 miles south of Charleston, the island could see up to 1.5 inches of rain throughout Friday until Ian shifts to the north, said NWS Charleston meteorologist Douglas Berry. Gusts were ranging between 35 and 45 mph Friday morning, but he said the risk of flooding would be worse in Charleston and right along the coast.\n\nThe island’s location on Ian’s west side and an offshore flow – when air moves from land to sea – could lower Kiawah Island’s tides, resulting in minor possible coastal flooding issues through Friday afternoon. There are no current flood advisories for the island.\n\nHilton Head Island: Tropical storm conditions were expected along the island, which is about 97 miles southwest of Charleston. The popular tourist destination could see up to 2 inches of rain Friday, with hurricane conditions possible. A high surf advisory, flood watch and hurricane and storm surge warnings were in effect Friday morning.\n\nPawleys Island: Gusts up to 100 mph could be in store for Pawleys Island, located 73 miles north of Charleston, said NWS Wilmington meteorologist Jordan Baker. The island is under both storm surge and hurricane warnings. “Wind is certainly a big issue this time, and we're watching the surge,” Baker told USA TODAY. “That area and could see inundation up to 4 to 7 feet.” A popular pier in the area collapsed and floated away amid the storm.\n\n'Heartbreaking' aftermath on a tiny Florida island\n\nOn tiny Matlacha Island near Fort Myers, the clatter of helicopters and airboats grew as the day progressed Friday, with volunteers and formal authorities alike coordinating evacuations and searches. The air stunk of mud and rotting food, and dozens of houses were destroyed, with many more significantly damaged.\n\nIan knocked out both bridges to the island, a primarily residential area with small shops, motels and tiny homes, intertwined with canals and boat docks. The storm laid a carpet of slick mud along portions of the island, and the loss of power meant food was beginning to rapidly rot.\n\n“It’s a mess,” said Sarah Yacko, 35, looking down from a second-floor balcony at the devastation in her neighborhood. “It’s really heartbreaking. I’ve been coming here since I was in diapers.”\n\nLike many, Yacko and her family evacuated during the storm but returned immediately by boat, worried about their homes and cars. Boats jostled for position along the canal accessing the island, swerving to avoid floating debris and newly formed and uncharted sandbars.\n\nStaggered by the destruction of her community, inn owner Janette Fraissinet, 61, took comfort in catching up with neighbors who’d also boated in for the day. She is not exactly sure what comes next — residents suspect it will be weeks before they get electricity back, and probably even longer to get drinking water, sewage service or a road back to the mainland. Her motel and the owner's cottage are destroyed.\n\n“Last week, a guy offered me a million dollars for the hotel,” she said. “Last week I was a millionaire. Now I’m homeless.”\n\nDragging a cooler filled with gas cans, Julie Burden, 45, worried aloud about the fate of the three adjacent small houses she owns: two are rentals, and she lived in the third with her young son and elderly grandfather.\n\nRounding the corner, she got her first glimpse of the street.\n\n“Oh my God,” she repeated, her bare feet sliding in the mud. “Oh my God.”\n\nAll three of the homes were intact, but mud filled each, and the winds tore off portions of the roofs, and flipped the boat dock from the back door to the front.\n\n“I was going to sit right there in that chair and ride it out but I looked at my little 9-year-old and he was so scared,” Burden said.\n\nBurden said she planned to start cleaning her house immediately but despaired at the task ahead.\n\n“I mean, it could have been worse,” she said.\n\n-Trevor Hughes\n\nFloridians voice regrets after staying put during hurricane\n\nYolande Welch – 95, with a bandaged leg and an injured shoulder – sat at the Port Sanibel marina with a Sanibel firefighter’s hand on her shoulder.\n\nFirefighters and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation officers had rescued her from Sanibel earlier in the day. Welch heard a loud crash in her living room Wednesday as one of her glass pane doors snapped and threatened to break off. She hurt her shoulder while trying to hold onto the door.\n\n\"It was hell,\" Welch said. \"I’ve been through five hurricanes, and this is the worst one.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale local Christopher Gyles has vacationed to Captiva Island with his family since 1991. Many of his 40 fellow family members fled to Fort Lauderdale, but some, including Gyles, stayed behind. Now, he said it was a bad idea.\n\nGyles said they watched debris being sucked into the gulf. It wasn't until Thursday morning that they were rescued by boat.\n\nEric and Vera Siefert, longtime Sanibel and Captiva residents in their 60s, also said staying was a dangerous error. Four of the coconut trees on their property were ripped down by high winds. As the storm surge rose to about 10 feet, water began flooding into their home.\n\n\"We were afraid,\" Eric said. \"We were crawling on top of furniture and we thought it was going to be the end.\"\n\n– Lisa Nellessen Savage, The News-Press\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Thao Nguyen, Jorge Ortiz, Doyle Rice, Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/us/power-outage-what-to-do/index.html", "title": "What to do if you're in the middle of a power outage | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Affected by the storm?

Ian is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rains to parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas over the next few days, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n“Ian is going to be a life-changing event. This is a very powerful, catastrophic storm that is going to do significant damage,” said Eric Silagy, CEO of Florida Power & Light.\n\nIf you’re without power during the hurricane, here’s what you can do to stay safe.\n\nThe basics\n\nIt’s crucial to ensure electric appliances are disconnected to avoid any harm or damage from power surges, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nFEMA also recommends keeping freezers and refrigerators closed to help maintain cooler temperatures for food preservation.\n\nFor good measure, turn off the main power breaker in your house and do not use any devices that are wet.\n\nWatch out for carbon monoxide\n\nGenerators should only be used outdoors and placed more than 20 feet away from doors and windows, even if they are closed.\n\nThe devices emit carbon monoxide, which is a poisonous gas that can be lethal.\n\n“(Carbon monoxide) is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\n\nThe CDC also recommends ensuring battery-operated carbon monoxide detectors are placed near sleeping areas.\n\nDiscard flooded and too-warm food\n\nFood that has been comprised by floodwater should not be consumed and should be thrown away, officials advise.\n\nRefrigerated food that reaches at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit should be discarded, FEMA says\n\nIf you have medications that require refrigeration, find out how long they can be without it before their safety expires.\n\nUse flashlights instead of candles\n\nAvoid using candles during a blackout if possible. If you must use them, keep them away from anything that could catch fire and do not leave them unattended, the CDC says. Ensure a fire extinguisher is available and those around you know how to use it.\n\nAvoid floodwaters as much as possible\n\nAlthough it can be unavoidable when dangerous flooding is happening, stay out of floodwaters as much as possible.\n\nFloodwaters can lead to the risk of drowning or being washed away from the intensity of flow and winds. They can hide dangerous downed power lines and can also be chemically harmful because they contain germs, dangerous substances, human and livestock waste, the CDC says.\n\nCheck on your neighbors and loved ones\n\nWhen it’s safe, reach out to people around you to make sure they are doing well.\n\nThose who have medical equipment that require power, like respirators, should be taken to locations with generators or a friend’s or neighbor’s home that hasn’t been impacted.\n\nAnd remember: The elderly and young children are especially vulnerable to extreme weather.\n\nProtect your pets\n\nDo not leave your pets behind if you evacuate during a power outage and never tie them outdoors during extreme weather events. “If you leave your pets behind, they may be lost, injured – or worse,” the CDC says.\n\nTake the proactive step to contact your local emergency management office to learn about whether they have opened shelters to accommodate pets. To find a shelter near you, check out the Humane Society website. Be mindful that diseases can spread among pets and humans during extreme weather events.\n\nConserve power when possible\n\nPower can be rationed by turning off and unplugging nonessential lights and appliances. Don’t use large appliances like ovens or washing machines if you can avoid it.\n\nThermostats should be set to 68 degrees because heightened demand could trigger more blackouts – or extend them.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}]}

He and his husband, Shane, figured that would help them get through the coming winter since their Lake Harmony, Pennsylvania, home is heated by electricity.\n\nIt didn’t turn out that way. The couple is now paying $472 a month on the budget plan, up from around $290 a month last winter. That prompted Bell to resume his part-time job as a police officer on top of his full-time position as a state dog warden. The increase, combined with rising costs for food and other essentials, has left Bell debating whether to take on another part-time gig.\n\n“The prices of everything have escalated to the point that a part-time job may not be enough to supplement the increases of bills that we have budgeted,” said Bell, 41, whose husband works as a certified nursing assistant while studying for his nursing degree.\n\nJason Bell may have to take on a second part-time job, on top of his full-time position, to afford his heating bills this winter. Courtesy Jason Bell\n\nLike Bell, many Americans are bracing for the cold reality that they will have to shell out even more to keep their homes warm this winter.\n\nFamilies are expected to pay an average of 17.2% more for home heat this coming season, compared to last winter, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. That comes on top of a big price increase last winter, bringing the two-year hike to more than 35%.\n\nThose who heat with natural gas are facing the largest spike, with their cost for the winter heating season expected to soar 34.3% to $952, the association said.\n\nThe tab for heating oil is expected to jump 12.8% to $2,115. And those whose heat runs on electricity can expect to see a nearly 7% increase to $1,328.\n\nSome people may not realize that heating their homes will be costlier this winter, especially since gasoline prices had been falling for months.\n\n“In a lot of people’s minds, gasoline and home energy are the same,” said Mark Wolfe, the association’s executive director. “The surprise here is that the prices for heating fuels are going to be popping.”\n\nHigh energy prices\n\nEnergy prices are on the rise in part because of the repeated heat waves that baked much of the United States this summer. That forced utilities to draw down on their natural gas reserves, which are also used to generate electricity, compounding the strain on inventory levels that were already below historical averages.\n\nOil prices, which spiked last winter after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, are declining but are still higher than they were last year.\n\nDan Pfoltzer was paying his landlord $150 a month to cover the cost of oil in the small house he rents in Nassau, New York. But over the summer, knowing that oil prices were up, Pfoltzer increased it to $310 a month so he wouldn’t be hit with a big bill over the winter.\n\n“By the time this tank runs out, the money will be there for the next tank,” said Pfoltzer, 71, who lives alone and drives a school bus.\n\nStill, the increased cost means that he won’t be able to pay all of his other bills, including those stemming from cancer treatment a few years ago. To keep his oil usage as low as possible, he plans to turn down the thermostat a few degrees to 67 and bundle up if he’s cold.\n\nOn the coast of Maine, Dale Christensen, Sr. and his family are already planning to use electric blankets in their living room and bedrooms this winter in an effort to minimize their heating bills. The 53-year-old is also looking at buying space heaters.\n\nChristensen, a rural mail carrier, is already paying back his landlord for the $900 it cost to fill the oil tank when they moved into their rental house earlier this year. He’s expecting to receive a $1,300 bill later this fall to refill it for the start of winter and likely two more after that during the season.\n\nDale Christensen, Sr. expects his family will have to use electric blankets to keep warm this winter in Maine. Dale Christensen, Sr.\n\nHeat wasn’t an issue for the Christensens last winter because they lived in an apartment where it was included, though the couple had to make sure their elderly parents, who are on fixed incomes, stayed warm in their homes.\n\n“Every year, we worry about our parents for the heating costs,” he said. “This year is even more stress and strain because, of course, now we have to pay for our heat.”\n\nThe family has applied for aid from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, to defray part of the cost of their oil bill. But Christensen isn’t counting on it until he hears whether they are approved.\n\nLess federal assistance available\n\nMaking matters worse is there is far less money in LIHEAP’s coffers this year, even though roughly 20 million American households — or 1 in 6 families — are behind on their utility bills.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act, which Congress approved in March 2021, provided a $4.5 billion boost to the program for this fiscal year, on top of a $3.8 billion regular appropriation. The stimulus money was mainly used to reduce the pandemic-fueled spike in arrears.\n\nBoth the House and Senate are looking at providing a $4 billion appropriation for LIHEAP for fiscal 2023, though lawmakers have yet to approve the federal government funding bill for the coming year. The Biden administration has asked for an additional $500 million for LIHEAP on top of what lawmakers are considering, while the energy directors association has called for $5 billion more.\n\nRequests for help have been pouring in, even before the cold weather sets in, state energy directors say.\n\nAt this time last year, Energy Services Inc. in Wisconsin was getting a record 300 calls a day to its customer care center. Now, the nonprofit group, the main LIHEAP administrator in the state, is fielding more than 1,000 calls a day. A family of three making up to roughly $52,000 a year is eligible as long as funding is available.\n\n“The need hasn’t gone away. It’s accelerating at such a rapid pace,” said Timothy Bruer, Energy Services’ executive director, who noted that his group ran out of LIHEAP crisis assistance money in fiscal 2022 for the first time in three decades. “Keeping the heat and power on, which is a basic necessity, has become an unaffordable luxury for tens of thousands of Wisconsin’s most vulnerable, at-risk households.”\n\nIn Massachusetts, the Worcester Community Action Council typically doesn’t start receiving LIHEAP applications until the temperature starts to fall, said Mary Knittle, director of energy sources at the nonprofit group. But this year they’ve been coming in “fast and furious,” she said, noting that first-time applications for the upcoming winter are up 60% compared to this time last year.\n\nResidents are bracing for higher charges. One energy provider in the state just emailed its customers to inform them that electric bills will be an estimated $114 higher each month for average usage, compared to last winter — an increase of 64%, she said. It cited higher electric supply prices as the main reason.\n\nEven those who don’t heat with electricity will be affected since it typically takes electricity to run home heating systems.\n\nMartin Silva, Sr. is expecting to pay about 30% more to heat his home this winter. Courtesy Martin Silva\n\nAt the same time, Knittle will have far less money to distribute this winter, though the appropriation hasn’t been set yet. Last fiscal year, her agency received $24.6 million in LIHEAP funding, including a $13.9 million boost from the American Rescue Plan that has since been exhausted.\n\n“Anxiety is very, very high,” Knittle said, noting that a family of three making roughly $68,500 is eligible for help in Massachusetts.\n\nMartin Silva, Sr. is already hundreds of dollars behind on both his water and electric bills for the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, home he shares with his wife. He’s expecting it will cost around $130 a month for natural gas to heat their drafty, old house, up from roughly $100 last year.\n\nA dump truck driver, Silva hopes to repay his debts by cutting back even more on expenses, including trips to see his ill, elderly parents in New York City twice a month. But the mounting expenses have left him feeling “crushed.”\n\n“You can’t get ahead, no matter how hard you try,” said Silva, 51.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/us/five-things-may-16-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for May 16: Buffalo shooting, Church shooting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’ve gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

On Wednesday, more than 20 million Americans across 16 states were under heat alerts and some cities shattered decades-old records. Macon, Georgia, reached 105 degrees, beating the previous record of 101 degrees set in 1925. New heat records were also set in Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina. And unfortunately, meteorologists say there’s no relief in sight. The heat in the South and the Plains is expected to continue to build through the weekend with much of the region expected to set more records in the coming days, the National Weather Service said. On the other hand, severe storms are expected to dump several inches of rain in some parts of the Southwest today.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol plans to draw attention today to former President Donald Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to bolster his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Three top officials who led the Justice Department in the final days of the Trump administration will testify at today’s hearing about how the former President and his allies sought to enlist the department to give their baseless fraud allegations credibility, according to committee aides. The officials will also make a case that Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with an official who bought into his claims of fraud, committee aides said. Separately, the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Georgia Republican Party chairman for information related to the Trump campaign’s fake elector scheme.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:58 - Source: CNN Sheriff: At least 1 dead, 4 wounded in California church shooting\n\n3. Gun laws\n\nDespite Russia’s threats, Finland said yesterday it will seek to join NATO and Sweden is on the verge of following suit. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson announced her party’s support to apply to join the US-backed alliance, saying her country must “adapt to reality” and make decisions based on the current climate. Both countries have previously refrained from joining for historic and geopolitical reasons. There is “strong bipartisan support” for Finnish accession to NATO, US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said during a visit to Finland today. However, Russia has warned the Nordic nations of “far-reaching consequences” if the countries join the alliance. Separately, EU leaders are ratcheting up their economic action against Russia and are preparing a sixth sanctions package that could be done within days.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:26 - Source: CNN Finland's president 'not worried' Turkey will block his country's NATO bid\n\nThe Senate is poised to take a critical vote today to advance a major bipartisan gun safety bill toward final passage. House Republican leaders, however, are lining up in opposition to the legislation. But even with House GOP leaders opposing the bill, some Republican members have already indicated they plan to vote for it, and the Democrat-controlled House is expected to be able to pass the legislation once it passes in the Senate. If passed, it would be the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Democrats and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n4. Uvalde\n\nNebraska’s Republican governor Pete Ricketts says he will call a special session to pass a total ban on abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this term. When asked if he thought the state should require a young girl who was raped to carry the pregnancy to term, Ricketts told CNN, “They’re still babies, too. Yes.” The governor’s comments come as the Supreme Court’s conservative majority seems likely to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide. More than a dozen states have so-called trigger laws on their books, meaning that abortion will almost immediately be banned if Roe v. Wade is no longer in effect, and Nebraska nearly passed its own such law last month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:22 - Source: CNN GOP governor says that rape victims should have to carry child to term\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pedro Arredondo was suspended on Wednesday after weeks of brewing anger over his department’s botched response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School nearly a month ago. Arredondo and responding law enforcement agencies have faced fierce criticism over the length of time officers waited in a hallway outside adjoining classrooms at the school where an 18-year-old gunman and the victims were located. The gunman fired at officers in the first minutes of the incident – with two receiving grazing wounds – according to an updated timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Yet more than 70 minutes would elapse before the gunman was shot and killed by officers who stormed the room. This week, the top Texas official in charge of the investigation described the response as an “abject failure.”\n\n5. Coronavirus\n\nTwitter’s legal team has accused Elon Musk of violating a nondisclosure agreement regarding the social media company’s number of bot accounts, the Tesla CEO said in a tweet Saturday. On Friday, Musk tweeted that his $44-billion cash deal to take Twitter private was ” temporarily on hold” while he awaited data on the proportion of its fake accounts. Twitter accused Musk of breaching an agreement after Musk tweeted that the sample size for the social media platform’s checks on automated users was 100, “because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate,” Musk said in a tweet. He later said that “There is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:11 - Source: CNN Darcy: This is what makes Elon Musk so provocative\n\nA new study suggests coronavirus subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 appear to escape antibody responses from vaccination and prior infection.

However, Covid-19 vaccination is still expected to provide substantial protection against severe disease, and vaccine makers are working on updated shots that might elicit a stronger immune response against the variants.

January 6\n\nOil prices soared to their highest level in 13 years today, raising fears about a further spike in inflation that could damage the global economy. The surge is due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the US and European allies consider banning Russian oil imports, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN yesterday. If Russia’s oil exports are cut off, experts say it will put more strain on an already tight oil market, resulting in even higher gas prices across the US. The average price for a gallon of regular gas hit $4 yesterday, the highest level since 2008. There are now 18 states, plus Washington, DC, where the price of gas is $4 or greater. The highest prices are being seen in California, where the statewide average stands at $5.29 a gallon.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:12 - Source: CNN Blinken: 'Very active discussion' with Europe about Russian oil import ban\n\nThe January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol plans to draw attention today to former President Donald Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to bolster his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

She brought down a chair so she can read there.\n\nAnd, to avoid using her stove while upstairs, she makes sandwiches and warms up food in the microwave.\n\nMorris, 65, already had her power shut off in June – when the thermometer in the Chicago area hit at least 90 degrees on seven days – after falling behind on her payments. She was forced to use savings to settle the nearly $500 tab, which she can’t do again since she’s on a fixed income after retiring last year.\n\n“You can’t afford to turn your air on anymore. That’s very sad,” said Morris, who is also staying home more because of high gas prices. “Any other summers, I will turn my air on. But this summer, it’s just way too expensive.”\n\nHeat waves have impacted the vast majority of the US during the first half of the summer, forcing Americans to deal with sweltering conditions. More than 100 million people were under heat alerts on Tuesday.\n\nHigh-temperature spells have become more frequent and intense with each passing decade, and they last longer than they did before, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nBut many people have had to curtail their air conditioning usage to try to keep their electricity bills in check, as they also struggle with the spike in price for food, gas and other essentials.\n\nAmericans’ electric bills are expected to increase by 20% to an average of $540 for this summer, compared to the same period last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\nBut even if people limit their usage, they may still get bigger bills. That’s because residential electricity prices are rising at a faster pace this summer than in many previous years, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The increase is driven in part by the surge in cost of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity. Natural gas prices jumped following a production slump during the pandemic, as well as shortages due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nAir conditioning, however, is not merely for comfort. It’s a necessity for many people, particularly those in poor health. More than 700 people in the US die from heat-related causes every year, on average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The deaths are generally considered preventable.\n\n“Extreme heat events are deadly, and they are increasingly frequent,” said Stephen Walls, a clean building advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Cooling assistance could help avoid hundreds of deaths per year.”\n\nLack of federal assistance\n\nBut there’s far less government aid available to help people afford to cool their homes, compared to heating them in the winter, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\nThe federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, helps low-income Americans pay their heating and cooling bills. The money is distributed through states and local community groups, but only 34 states and the District of Columbia offer cooling aid to their residents. All states run programs to help people keep the heat on in the winter.\n\nWhat’s more, just 15% of the federal funds is used to cover cooling costs.\n\nCongress poured $4.5 billion into LIHEAP from the American Rescue Plan, adding to the program’s $3.8 billion allocation for the current fiscal year. But it still isn’t enough to meet the need for heating alone, much less cooling.\n\n“The core problem is we don’t have enough money to run a robust cooling program,” Wolfe said, noting that the importance of this hasn’t “registered yet” in Congress.\n\nAlice Gachuzo-Colin of Springdale, Arkansas, turned to a local nonprofit agency last month to ask for help paying her electric bill so her power wouldn’t be shut off in the middle of the night. But she was told it had no available funds and to try again later.\n\nSo she had to drain nearly all her savings to pay the $256 bill. And for July, the tab is $314, which she has had to point out to her three children.\n\n“Yesterday, there was a big, huge meltdown in my house because my kids were like ‘I’m hot,’ and I’m like ‘Y’all, the light bill is 300 and something dollars,’” Gachuzo-Colin, 43, who works as a personal banker at a local bank, said in mid-July.\n\nTypically, she pays $160 or $170 a month during the summer.\n\nGachuzo-Colin tries to limit the family’s air conditioning usage, but it’s tough when the temperature often exceeds 90 degrees and her 13-year-old daughter’s asthma worsens in the heat. The Springdale area is on track to have its fourth-warmest summer on record.\n\nElectric companies have expanded their flexible billing and payment programs during the pandemic to help customers stay current, Adam Cooper, senior director for customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned electric companies, wrote in an email. Many allow customers to enter balance billing programs, where they pay the same amount every month. This smooths out seasonal spikes in usage.\n\nThe companies also reach out to consumers suffering from financial hardships and educate them about assistance programs, such as LIHEAP, Cooper said.\n\nBut repayment plans don’t always relieve the financial strain on families. Minneapolis resident Scott Norcross entered one recently so his power wouldn’t be shut off after he fell a few hundred dollars behind in payments, mainly from using the air conditioner over the last few months. He now has to shell out around $100 on top of his monthly bill, which he says is three times more than it used to be prior to the pandemic.\n\n“Our electric bill had just gone higher and higher and higher,” said Norcross, 55, who is disabled and is affected by the heat. “We can’t really afford the extra payment, but we have to do something if we want to keep the electric on.”\n\nNorcross, whose wife is a personal care assistant and older son works in retail, applied for energy aid but was told his family’s income was $800 over the limit.\n\nSo the couple and their two young adult sons sit in their car and run the air conditioner for 20 to 30 minutes to cool off a few times a day, depending on how hot it is. The temperature climbed to at least 90 degrees on Tuesday, which would be the 13th time it’s hit that level this year.\n\nShutoffs loom\n\nOnly 17 states, plus the District of Columbia, have protections that prevent utility companies from turning off the power of people who fall behind in their bills. But they only take effect when temperatures hit a certain level or when a heat advisory is in place, Wolfe said. For Nevada and Delaware, for instance, that threshold is 105 degrees.\n\nThis compares to 33 states and the District of Columbia that prevent utilities from shutting off the heat during the winter.\n\nNearly all states and the District of Columbia provide some protection for residents with certified medical conditions, though many only delay the disconnection for 30 days.\n\nStill, many people whose health is compromised by hot temperatures don’t qualify.\n\nThough he suffers from a thyroid condition that makes him very sensitive to heat, Walter Protheroe now sets his air conditioner at 78 degrees, instead of a more comfortable 72 degrees.

On Wednesday, more than 20 million Americans across 16 states were under heat alerts and some cities shattered decades-old records. Macon, Georgia, reached 105 degrees, beating the previous record of 101 degrees set in 1925. New heat records were also set in Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina. And unfortunately, meteorologists say there’s no relief in sight. The heat in the South and the Plains is expected to continue to build through the weekend with much of the region expected to set more records in the coming days, the National Weather Service said. On the other hand, severe storms are expected to dump several inches of rain in some parts of the Southwest today.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol plans to draw attention today to former President Donald Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to bolster his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Three top officials who led the Justice Department in the final days of the Trump administration will testify at today’s hearing about how the former President and his allies sought to enlist the department to give their baseless fraud allegations credibility, according to committee aides. The officials will also make a case that Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with an official who bought into his claims of fraud, committee aides said. Separately, the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Georgia Republican Party chairman for information related to the Trump campaign’s fake elector scheme.\n\n3. Gun laws\n\nThe Senate is poised to take a critical vote today to advance a major bipartisan gun safety bill toward final passage. House Republican leaders, however, are lining up in opposition to the legislation. But even with House GOP leaders opposing the bill, some Republican members have already indicated they plan to vote for it, and the Democrat-controlled House is expected to be able to pass the legislation once it passes in the Senate. If passed, it would be the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Democrats and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:24 - Source: CNN What to expect from South Korea's next president\n\n4.

Arredondo and responding law enforcement agencies have faced fierce criticism over the length of time officers waited in a hallway outside adjoining classrooms at the school where an 18-year-old gunman and the victims were located. The gunman fired at officers in the first minutes of the incident – with two receiving grazing wounds – according to an updated timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety.

January 6\n\nThe Justice Department has announced the first sedition charges related to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The charges, leveled against members of a far-right extremist group called the Oath Keepers, raise the stakes of the year-long investigation. Sedition is a serious federal crime that is defined in the US Code as two or more people trying to overthrow the US government. The case undercuts wider attempts to downplay the events of the riot by highlighting that some of those involved traveled to the Capitol specifically prepared for violence. In another big development, the House Select Committee investigating the attack has issued four subpoenas to Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Alphabet, the parent company to Google and YouTube, Twitter and Reddit to provide more documentation on what the social media giants did to address misinformation and extremism that contributed to the insurrection.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:29 - Source: CNN CNN legal analyst explains what Oath Keepers leader's arrest indicates\n\nThe January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol plans to draw attention today to former President Donald Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to bolster his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Three top officials who led the Justice Department in the final days of the Trump administration will testify at today’s hearing about how the former President and his allies sought to enlist the department to give their baseless fraud allegations credibility, according to committee aides. The officials will also make a case that Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with an official who bought into his claims of fraud, committee aides said. Separately, the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Georgia Republican Party chairman for information related to the Trump campaign’s fake elector scheme.\n\n3. Gun laws\n\nAnother key inflation measure reached a record high in 2021. The US producer price index, which tracks what America’s producers get paid for their goods and services on average over time, rose 9.7% last year — the biggest increase since the Bureau of Labor statistics began recording such data in 2010. This metric is important because it can help show what cost increases contributed to rising wholesale prices, and how that is passed on to the consumer. The government also sees it as a reliable bellwether of inflation. According to a new survey, more than half of global CEOs fear inflation will stay elevated until mid-2023 or beyond.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:59 - Source: CNN 'It's insane': Gas station owner reveals what inflation is doing to his business\n\nProgressive Democrats have announced they will not vote for the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill without passing the $3.5 trillion package that is aimed at enacting President Joe Biden’s economic agenda. That vote is scheduled for next week, and as it stands, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a handful of votes to get anything passed. President Biden will increase his engagement with Congressional Democrats today, including a meeting with Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to try and get all the Democratic factions in line. Yesterday, the House also passed a bill to avoid a government shutdown and suspend the US debt limit. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, so the country is still approaching a possible shutdown and financial precipice in the coming weeks.\n\n4. Uvalde\n\nA week of diplomatic talks between Russia and Western powers has come to a less-than-optimistic end. The US and its NATO allies had hoped to convince Russia to de-escalate aggressive military maneuvers along its border with Ukraine. However, Russia did not commit to pulling back the more than 100,000 troops amassed there, and made demands of NATO that the organization said were non-starters. The Russian military even conducted live-fire exercises along the border as the talks were ongoing. After the meetings, a senior US official said the “drumbeat of war is sounding loud and the rhetoric has gotten rather shrill.” It’s still unclear what the US plans to do if Russia doesn’t de-escalate, but also doesn’t invade Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:52 - Source: CNN Hear Ukrainian deputy PM's message for Europe amid Russia tensions\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pedro Arredondo was suspended on Wednesday after weeks of brewing anger over his department’s botched response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School nearly a month ago. Arredondo and responding law enforcement agencies have faced fierce criticism over the length of time officers waited in a hallway outside adjoining classrooms at the school where an 18-year-old gunman and the victims were located. The gunman fired at officers in the first minutes of the incident – with two receiving grazing wounds – according to an updated timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Yet more than 70 minutes would elapse before the gunman was shot and killed by officers who stormed the room. This week, the top Texas official in charge of the investigation described the response as an “abject failure.”\n\n5. Coronavirus\n\nA new study suggests coronavirus subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 appear to escape antibody responses from vaccination and prior infection. The levels of antibodies that a previous infection or vaccinations would provide are several times lower against these two subvariants compared with the original coronavirus, according to new data published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, Covid-19 vaccination is still expected to provide substantial protection against severe disease, and vaccine makers are working on updated shots that might elicit a stronger immune response against the variants. BA.4 and BA.5 are the fastest-spreading variants reported to date and caused an estimated 35% of new Covid-19 infections in the US last week, recent data shows.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\n‘Baby Shark’ becomes the first YouTube video to hit 10 billion views\n\nThat’s one view for every time it’s looped through your brain against your will.\n\nHow long you should wear your N95 and other mask care tips\n\nUnfortunately, the answer is not “until it gets swallowed by a tote bag or ground into the floor mats of your car.”\n\n‘Exquisite’ 2,000-year-old Roman figure found during railway excavation\n\nArchaeology is cool, but so is leaving-cursed-objects-in-the-ground-where-you-found-them-ology!

Her previous best finish was winning silver at the 2006 Olympics.\n\n(Looking for a recap of Tuesday's events? We've got you covered.)\n\nAnother stunning mistake has taken American skiing star Mikaela Shiffrin out of contention for a medal in her second consecutive event at the Olympics.\n\nShiffrin, who wiped out in the women's giant slalom on Monday, was one of the favorites in the slalom -- an event where she claimed the gold eight years ago in Sochi.\n\nShaun White and Chloe Kim advanced to the finals of the men's and women's halfpipe competitions. White, a three-time gold medalist in the event, is competing in his final Olympics.\n\nMeanwhile, freeskier Colby Stevenson soared onto the podium in the men's big air competition.\n\nTV SCHEDULE: How and what to watch each day of the Beijing Olympics\n\nOLYMPICS MEDAL COUNT: Track the hardware in Beijing by country\n\nCHASING GOLD: Get the best Olympic stories straight to your inbox with our newsletter\n\nEXCLUSIVE OLYMPIC UPDATES: Sign up for texts to get the latest news and behind-the-scenes coverage from Beijing\n\nDenmark's men's hockey team made history Wednesday when they beat Czech Republic 2-1.\n\nDenmark's men and women made their Olympic debuts in hockey this year and the Danish men earned their first win with a two-goal first period. Former NHL player Frans Nielsen and Markus Lauridsen had goals for Denmark.\n\n\"This is a huge moment for Danish hockey. We're not usually at the Olympics,\" coach Heinz Ehlers said. \"We're so happy and proud right now.\n\n\"It's not like we win here today and we think we're Olympic champions,\" Ehlers continued. \"We're realistic and know that we have to work really hard and get a little bit of luck to win hockey games.\"\n\nThe Danish women claimed their first Olympic win earlier this week 3-2, also against the Czech Republic.\n\n-- Analis Bailey\n\nBiney advances in thrilling short-track finish\n\nBEIJING – U.S. short-track speedskater Maame Biney was in last place entering the final curve of her 1000-meter heat Wednesday night.\n\nShe ended up winning – by three thousandths of a second.\n\nBiney, 22, and teammate Kristen Santos both advanced to Friday's quarterfinal round, the latter in far more comfortable fashion than the former. While Biney eked out a win, Santos led for much of her heat before crossing the finish line first.\n\nThe American women had much better luck Wednesday than the men, both of whom failed to advance in the 1500. Andrew Heo and Ryan Pivirotto each made the quarterfinals but did not go any further, with Heo placing fifth of six skaters in his race and Pivirotto disqualified for an infraction.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nTeam USA finally won its first gold medal. Here's what you missed overnight Wednesday:\n\nLindsey Jacobellis wins snowboardcross, Team USA's first gold medal\n\nLindsey Jacobellis is golden, and so is Team USA.\n\nJacobellis, 36, won gold in women's snowboardcross at the Beijing Olympics. France's Chloe Trespeuch finished in second.\n\nJacobellis is one of the most successful snowboarders in her sport but most Americans remember her for the 2006 Olympic race in which she held the lead late before falling performing a method on the last jump. She settled for silver.\n\nAt the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, Jacobellis finished fourth.\n\nShe's the most decorated bordercross athlete of all time. She achieved 31 wins and 57 podiums in 104 World Cup starts.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nLindsey Jacobellis among four Americans to advance to snowboard cross quarters\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — All four Americans have advanced to the women’s snowboard cross quarterfinals by placing in the top two of their respective heats (of four riders) on Tuesday.\n\nThat includes 2006 silver-medalist Lindsey Jacobellis, who is competing in her fifth Games. She won her heat by more than one second. Meghan Tierney entered the round in 16th and held onto the final spot in the quarterfinals by outlasting Lara Casanova of Switzerland despite the two bumping while coming around the second-to-last bend.\n\nStacy Gaskill also won her heat handily, and Faye Gulini’s victory made it a clean sweep for the U.S.\n\nSixteen riders remain in the competition.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nShaun White leads trio of Americans who qualify for halfpipe final\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Shaun White will have one more competition in the halfpipe, only a few runs remaining between him and the end of a competitive snowboarding career.\n\nThe three-time Olympic gold medalist advanced to Friday’s final at the Beijing Olympics, qualifying fourth at Genting Snow Park.\n\nFellow Americans Taylor Gold and Chase Josey also qualified for the final, ranking seventh and 12th, respectively. Lucas Foster had a hard fall on his second run and finished in 17th. Only the top 12 advance to the final.\n\nWhite, 35, is competing in his final Olympics and last snowboarding competition. It’s a fitting place to end for a rider whose three Olympic golds made him famous and elevated his sport.\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nOlympic medals in team figure skating delayed by legal issue\n\nBEIJING – An ongoing legal issue that could affect the medalists in the team figure skating competition at the Beijing Olympics has caused the award ceremony to be delayed, the IOC said Wednesday.\n\nThe ceremony to award the Russian team the gold medals, the United States silver and Japan bronze was pulled from its scheduled slot late Tuesday.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said the reason was a “legal consultation” required with the governing body of skating. Details of the case were not specified.\n\n“We have athletes that have won medals involved,” Adams said at the daily news briefing.\n\nIn a one-line statement, the International Skating Union also cited ongoing legal talks.\n\nIf any athlete and team were disqualified, an appeal would likely follow to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Canada placed fourth and would be in line to be upgraded.\n\nSome skaters in the men’s competition are due to finish their events Thursday and leave China soon after.\n\n“Everyone is doing absolutely everything that the situation can be resolved as soon as possible,” Adams said.\n\nHowever, he cautioned “as you know, legal issues can sometimes drag on.”\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nMikaela Shiffrin on Beijing disappointment: 'It feels like everything, but it's not'\n\nBEIJING – Two races, 10 gates.\n\nThat’s the sum total of Mikaela Shiffrin’s performance so far at the Beijing Olympics, a Games where she was expected to contend for multiple medals. Two days after skiing out in the first run of the giant slalom, Shiffrin did the same in the first run of the slalom Wednesday.\n\nAfterward, she sat in the snow for several minutes, crying and looking despondent. These were her two best events, races in which she has won gold medals, and she didn’t even get through the first run. It’s the first time she has failed to finish back-to-back technical races since December 2011, when she was 16 years old.\n\n“We came all this way. We’re not done yet but GS and slalom, those were my biggest focuses, so it really feels like a lot of work for nothing,” Shiffrin said afterward, still appearing shell-shocked. “(People) will try to say, `This happens’ and `It’s OK’ and `Don’t be too hard on yourself’ and all of that, but it is a lot of work for a grand total of five gates in the GS and five gates in the slalom. So that is not lost on me.\n\n“It feels like everything,” she added, “but it’s not.”\n\nThere are still three races left: the super-G, the Alpine combined and the downhill. While Shiffrin didn’t rule out competing in all three, she didn’t rule it in, either, saying the U.S. team has others who are just as capable.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nFreeskier Colby Stevenson adds another silver to USA's collection\n\nBEIJING – American Colby Stevenson took home the silver medal in the big air men’s freeskiing final, putting down two monster runs after crashing on his first attempt.\n\nStevenson’s impressive switch left 1800 on his last run – five full rotations in the air – launched him onto the podium but he had to survive seven skiers with an opportunity to pass him. In the end, none of them did, including teammate Alexander Hall.\n\nStevenson, 24, nearly died in a car crash six years ago that left him with a fractured skull and multiple other injuries.\n\n-- Dan Wolken\n\nStunned Mikaela Shiffrin still 'processing' after slalom exit\n\nMikaela Shiffrin said she's \"second guessing the last 15 years\" of her skiing career after falling in women's slalom, the second consecutive race she did not finish at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nDuring an emotional interview with NBC following the race on Wednesday, the two-time Olympic champion said she's questioning \"everything I thought I knew about my own skiing and slalom and racing mentality.\"\n\nShiffrin said she's still \"processing\" what happened on the mountain after she skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of the slalom Wednesday. The DNF comes two days after she skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of the giant slalom.\n\n-- Cydney Henderson\n\nChloe Kim eyes another gold in halfpipe\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Chloe Kim is in position to claim gold again.\n\nThe Olympic champion in Pyeongchang four years ago, Kim easily advanced in qualifying on Wednesday at Genting Snow Park. That gives her the opportunity to become the first woman to win two gold medals when she competes in the final on Thursday.\n\nKim moved on to the final with a mellow, for her, first run that included two 720s and a 900. She’ll be expected to do tricks with 1080 degrees of rotation, and possibly higher, in the final.\n\n“I was really nervous my first run because we’re at the Olympics, but I’m so happy I put one down,” Kim told NBC after qualifying. She did not take questions from print media after the competition.\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nTriple corks could make – or break – halfpipe hopefuls\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Perhaps it was Shaun White toying with the triple cork in the halfpipe that made this day inevitable.\n\nMaybe it was the march of progression as snowboarders attempted and mastered difficult double corks. Perhaps it was having the right riders to push it there.\n\nWhatever the causes, the triple cork in the halfpipe is here – and it’s very likely to play a role in the Olympic final. (Qualifying begins Wednesday in Beijing, late Tuesday in the U.S.)\n\nThe trick requires three off-axis flips with varying degrees of rotation.\n\n“If you’re a strategist, you’re going save that in your arsenal and use it if you need to,\" said NBC snowboarding analyst Todd Richards. \"That trick could take you out for the day.”\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nShocking disappointment for Mikaela Shiffrin in women's slalom\n\nBEIJING – Mikaela Shiffrin’s second race ended even sooner than her first.\n\nThe two-time Olympic champion skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of the slalom Wednesday. She had appeared to slip around the second gate, but kept her balance, only to ski off the course shortly afterward.\n\nAfterward, she sat in the snow and took a long look at the course.\n\nThe DNF comes two days after she skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of the giant slalom. Shiffrin called that a “huge disappointment” and said she would never get over it, but would have to put it to the side because she still had races left at the Beijing Olympics. Clearly, though, she wasn’t unable to get past it, and now the pressure on Shiffrin, who was predicted to win multiple medals here, will only grow.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nMikaela Shiffrin seeks redemption in women's slalom\n\nDespite wiping out in her first event in Beijing, Mikaela Shiffrin still needs just one more Olympic gold to put her all alone among American alpine skiers. She currently has two gold medals, tying Americans Ted Ligety and Andrea Mead Lawrence.\n\nHer journey, however, has been anything but smooth. From a back injury late last year to a COVID-19 diagnosis, to Monday's disappointment, Shiffrin has experienced a wealth of emotions.\n\nAs USA TODAY's Nancy Armour writes, Shiffrin can't let her earlier mistake carry over into the other races on her Olympic schedule.\n\nChloe Kim defending 2018 Olympic title in women's halfpipe\n\nChloe Kim the first athlete to hold snowboarding titles from all four major events: the Olympics, World Championships, X Games, and Youth Olympics. She is also the only athlete in X Games history to win three gold medals before the age of 16.\n\nShe'll compete in the women's snowboarding halfpipe in Beijing, with qualifying alread underway.\n\nSince halfpipe snowboarding debuted in the Olympics in 1998, no woman has won two gold medals. But Kim isn't just aiming for a medal. She's trying for three new tricks.\n\nThough she hasn't said what they are, it's safe to guess they would progress the sport since she is already doing some of the hardest tricks in halfpipe snowboarding.\n\n--Analis Bailey, Rachel Axon\n\nShaun White's last Olympics and chance for gold\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing will be Shaun White's final ride.\n\nOne of the most recognizable figures in Team USA history, thanks to his flowing red hair and podium success, the legendary snowboarder said on Dec. 15 these Olympics – his fifth – will be his last.\n\nBy now, the sport has caught up to White, and he would be the first to say so. That won't stop him from seeking a fourth gold medal in the men's halfpipe in Beijing to add to his legacy.\n\nOutside of the Olympics, White has 15 Winter X Games golds, in addition to five Summer X Games medals in skateboarding.\n\nAnother Russian women's hockey player out due to positive COVID test\n\nBEIJING – Confusion and controversy surrounding the Russian women’s hockey team’s COVID-19 situation took another turn Tuesday in Beijing.\n\nA day after Russia’s game against Canada was delayed an hour as the teams awaited that morning’s test results, another Russian player – forward Polina Bolgareva -- tested positive for the virus, coach Yevgeni Bobariko told state news agency RIA Novosti, according to The Associated Press and Reuters.\n\nThat brings the total number of Russian players out due to COVID isolation – meaning they’ve tested positive and have not received two negative tests more than 24 hours apart – to eight, per the AP.\n\nCanada and Russia played their game, a 6-1 Canadian victory, with KN95 masks on their faces. Russia removed the masks prior to the third period because the test results came back, they said afterward. Canada left the masks on.\n\n\"Everybody saw how we played against Canada with masks and took them off after the second period, when we received the results of our tests. They were all negative,” Bobariko told the state news agency, per Reuters.\n\nBut Bolgareva’s results “turned positive” upon returning to the Olympic Village after the game, the coach said.\n\n“I don’t understand how this is happening,” he added.\n\nBolgareva played 17:39 against the U.S. on Saturday, a 5-0 U.S. win.\n\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation attributed Monday’s delay, officially, to “health and safety issues.”\n\nRegarding Bolgareva’s reported positive, the IIHF referred USA TODAY Sports to the International Olympic Committee, which still has not commented on Monday’s events.\n\nCanada forward Emily Clark, who was infected with the virus in December and whose results came back inconclusive on Monday, did not play against Russia. She played 19:39 against the U.S. in the Canadians’ 4-2 win Tuesday.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhat's with all those stuffed pandas at the medal ceremonies?\n\nIf you’ve been keeping up with the Winter Olympics in Beijing, you might have noticed Olympians from countries around the world posing with a plush toy panda after they compete.\n\nBut why are some of the winning athletes posing with the toy after their events instead of immediately receiving their medals?\n\nAfter some of the competitions, the champions receive the panda mascot of the games, Bing Dwen Dwen, and are given their medals later at a special ceremony.\n\nThe Bing Dwen Dwen toys come stuffed inside a plastic shell that represents ice and is decorated with a gold wreath. Bing means “ice” in Mandarin Chinese, though it also symbolizes purity and strength. Dwen Dwen means robust and lively and it also represents children.\n\n-- Marina Pitofsky\n\nWomen ski jumpers disqualified for baggy uniforms\n\nFive female competitors were disqualified from the mixed team ski jump final in the Beijing Winter Olympics over uniform violations.\n\nTheir jumpsuits were allegedly deemed too large, which could give a skier a leg up during the event, according to multiple reports.\n\nKatharina Althaus of Germany told reporters after she was disqualified, “We were looking forward to the second competition at the Olympics. [The International Ski Federation] destroyed that with this action – they destroyed women's ski jumping.\n\n\"Our names are now (out) there and we just pulled the crap card. That is how you destroy nations, development and the entire sport,” she added, Reuters reported.\n\nThis year marked the first time the mixed team ski jumping event was included at a Winter Olympics. All of the competitors who were disqualified are women.\n\n-- Marina Pitofsky\n\nNathan Chen in in great position to win skating gold\n\nBEIJING – Nathan Chen’s four-year quest now has less than 48 hours to go.\n\nWith a massive fist pump following some of the most beautiful jumps ever landed under the unforgiving spotlight of the Olympic Games, Chen exorcized the demons from Olympic short programs past to skate a world-record-breaking men’s short and put himself in position to win the gold medal in Thursday’s long program.\n\nChen, 22, received more points from the judges than any man ever has – 113.97 – for his soaring quadruple jumps and exquisite artistry to “La Boheme” to take an almost six-point lead over his closest challenger, Japanese 18-year-old Yuma Kagiyama.\n\nNOTE: USA Network replays Chen and the other top skaters' short programs starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}]}

Final results are expected later Monday, but it’s expected to take weeks for a new government to be formed.\n\nMeloni entered Italy’s crowded political scene in 2006 and co-founded the Brothers of Italy in 2012, a party whose agenda is rooted in Euroskepticism and anti-immigration policies.\n\nLeader of Brothers of Italy Giorgia Meloni casts her vote in Rome on Sunday, September 25, 2022. Yara Nardi/Reuters\n\nIn the last election in 2018, the party won just 4.5% of the vote, but its popularity has soared in recent years, underscoring Italy’s longstanding rejection of mainstream politics, seen most recently with the country’s support of anti-establishment parties such as the Five Star Movement and Salvini’s League.\n\nCelebrating the early results on Sunday evening, Salvini said on Twitter, “Center-right in clear advantage both in the House and in the Senate! It will be a long night, but already now I want to say THANK YOU.”\n\nMeloni differs from her coalition partner leaders on the issue of Ukraine. Whereas Berlusconi and Salvini have both said they would like to review sanctions against Russia because of their impact on the Italian economy, Meloni has been steadfast in her support for defending Ukraine.\n\nA 45-year-old mother from Rome, Meloni is deeply conservative, openly anti-LBGT, and has threatened to place same-sex unions, which were legalized in Italy in 2016, under review. She has also called abortion a “tragedy,” raising fears for the future of women’s rights in the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:57 - Source: CNN Ultra-conservative likely to become Italy's first female prime minister\n\nThe preliminary results showed the center-left coalition, led by the left-wing Democratic Party and centrist party +Europe had won around 22% of the vote, while former prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s bid to revive the Five Star Movement appeared to have been unsuccessful, with around 15%.\n\n‘A sad evening’\n\nIn a Facebook post, Conte promised to lead an “uncompromising opposition.”\n\n“We will be the outpost for the progressive agenda against inequalities, to protect families and businesses in difficulty, to defend the rights and values of our Constitution.”\n\nDebora Serracchiani of the Democratic Party also conceded defeat early Monday morning, calling the results a “sad evening for the country.”\n\n“Undoubtedly we cannot, in light of the data seen so far, not attribute the victory to the right dragged by Giorgia Meloni. It is a sad evening for the country,” Serracchiani told reporters.\n\nSunday’s snap national election was triggered by party infighting that saw the collapse of Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government in July.\n\nVoters headed to the polls amid a number of new regulations, with voting hours also contained to one day rather than two.\n\nOther changes included a younger voting age for the Senate and a reduction in the number of seats to elect – down from 685 seats to 400 in the Senate and from 315 to 200 in the lower House of Parliament. That parliament is scheduled to meet on October 13, at which point the head of state will call on party leaders to decide on the shape of the new government.\n\nThe buildup to the election was dominated by hot-button issues including Italy’s cost-of-living crisis, a 209 billion euro ($200 billion) package from the European Covid-19 recovery fund and the country’s support for Ukraine.\n\nThe incoming prime minister – the sixth in just eight years – will be tasked with tackling a number of challenges, with soaring energy costs and economic uncertainty among the country’s most pressing.\n\nAnd while Meloni is slated to make history as Italy’s first female prime minister, her politics do not mean that she is necessarily interested in advancing women’s rights.\n\nEmiliana De Blasio, adviser for diversity and inclusion at LUISS University in Rome, told CNN Meloni is “not raising up at all questions on women’s rights and empowerment in general.”\n\nThe Italian results come as other far-right parties in other European countries have marked recent gains. That includes Sweden’s anti-immigration party, Sweden Democrats – a party with neo-Nazi roots – which is expected to play a major role in the new government after winning the second largest share of seats at a general election earlier this month.\n\nAnd in France, while far-right ideologue Marine Le Pen lost the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron in April, her share of the popular vote shifted France’s political center dramatically to the right.\n\nAlthough Macron and Meloni ideologically diverge, the French president said Monday that France respects Italy’s decision to elect a government headed by Meloni.\n\nSince former German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepped down in December, Macron has increasingly emerged as the top EU leader – a position that would put him at odds with the Euroskepticism expressed by the Brothers of Italy.\n\n“The Italian people have made a democratic and sovereign choice. We respect it,” Macron said, according to the Elysee Palace.\n\n“As a neighbor and friend, we must continue to work together. It’s as Europeans that we will succeed in overcoming our joint challenges,” he added.\n\nIn a social media post early Monday, Meloni dedicated her projected win to “all the militants, managers, supporters and every single person who – in these years – has contributed to the realization of our dream, offering soul and heart spontaneously and selflessly.”\n\nShe added: “We won’t betray your trust. We are ready to lift Italy up.”", "authors": ["Kara Fox Barbie Latza Nadeau Antonia Mortensen Nicola Ruotolo Sharon Braithwaite Valentina Didonato", "Kara Fox", "Barbie Latza Nadeau", "Antonia Mortensen", "Nicola Ruotolo", "Sharon Braithwaite", "Valentina Didonato"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/09/26/giorgia-meloni-italy-far-right-leader/8118084001/", "title": "'Italy chose us': Who is Giorgia Meloni, likely to be nation's first ...", "text": "Eric J.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nRome CNN —\n\nI am often asked what Giorgia Meloni – leader of the national conservative Brothers of Italy party, and next prime minister of the country – is really up to.\n\nWhat comparables should we be looking at? Hungary, Poland, Brazil and even the United Kingdom (not to mention the United States under Donald Trump) are all countries where the “destra” or “right wing” seized power at least in part on the back of nationalist sentiment.\n\nBut 45-year-old Meloni, who is on course to become Italy’s youngest and first female prime minister after claiming victory in Sunday’s election, does not fit into neat definitions. Her meteoric rise is perhaps best described as an audacious balancing exercise.\n\nOn the one hand, Meloni has attempted to brush away the post-fascist aura of her party, whose past includes political operators who were self-admittedly fascist or felt nostalgic about Benito Mussolini. On the other hand, she has been blowing kisses to capital markets, pledging to stick to the fiscal discipline and European Union budget rules of outgoing prime minister and staunch Euro-Atlanticist, Mario Draghi.\n\nDespite her young age, Meloni has been in politics for quite some time. In 2008, she got her baptism of fire, serving as minister of youth under Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The cabinet position she held back then was a relatively minor one, but the consensus was that Meloni was being groomed for power.\n\nAt the time, I was a young consigliere at the Italian Treasury, and I felt that perhaps there was more to Meloni. She looked as if she had literally consecrated her life to politics; it seemed more a vocation for her, a calling, than a profession. Because of this, she did not strike me at all as another protégé of a party leader trying her hand at government.\n\nYears later, in 2021, Meloni’s autobiography came out. I rushed to buy a copy. In vivid detail, the book explains how painful Meloni’s youth was, and how important it was for her to become a party militant. Meloni’s father had abandoned both her and her sister Arianna, and the right-wing Italian Social Movement filled this gap. (She later helped found the breakaway political movement Brothers of Italy).\n\nLearning about Meloni’s upbringing, I thought that my earlier impressions were somewhat confirmed: The trauma of a lost father put Meloni on a mission to seek a sense of purpose. All of a sudden, Meloni looked like Bruce Wayne, who embarked on a journey to become Batman after his parents’ assassination. And yet, Batman is a vigilante who sets out to rid the streets of Gotham City of its many villains, whereas Meloni flirted several times with the idea of becoming the mayor of her city, Rome, but never actually went for it.\n\nThe trauma of a lost father put Meloni on a mission to seek a sense of purpose. Francesco Galietti\n\nIn 2016, Meloni first threw her hat into the ring but eventually pulled out from the mayoral race. In 2021, Meloni again did not step up, instead backing right-wing candidate Enrico Michetti, who lost out to Roberto Gualtieri of the center-left Democratic Party. It is generally assumed that if Meloni herself had run in the 2021 race, the chances of success of the right would have been very high. So why then hasn’t she gone for it? After all, Rome isn’t like any other Italian municipality and enjoys global visibility like few other cities in the world. Did Meloni deliberately decide to “sacrifice” Rome to play the long game?\n\nThere is little doubt that Meloni’s rise in polls reflects widespread disgruntlement and protest votes, which in Italy we have seen at least since 2013. In fact, this was already the case with anti-establishment parties such as the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini’s League of recent years. Not unlike them, Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party has risen very quickly in the polls, from single-digit levels to around 25%.\n\nMeloni’s timing looks better than previous upstarts. In fact, if one considers the overall conditions of Italy’s right these days, Berlusconi, who will turn 86 later this week, is not going to play in the sandbox for much longer. Moreover, Salvini’s limits are clear and his “pivot to Russia” stance have made him politically radioactive, after President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. This means that Meloni cannot only dream of becoming Italy’s first female prime minister – but also of consolidating Italy’s conservative bloc.\n\nBoth tasks will probably require keeping moderates on board, and bringing in new ones. Just how serious is Meloni about all this? Meloni is still actively using her nativist, anti-woke storytelling repertoire. She also rallied to populist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s side earlier this month, when the European Parliament voted to denounce the “existence of a clear risk of a serious breach” by Hungary of core EU values.\n\nBut Meloni also isn’t afraid of normalizing her party, and she could follow the example of her former boss and mentor Gianfranco Fini. In 2003, Fini chose to normalize his party’s relations with Israel and made a highly symbolic visit there. Arguably, back in the day, this move was not received well by some of Fini’s supporters. And yet, it changed the party’s perception for good.\n\nToday, Meloni routinely describes Moscow’s invasion as an “unacceptable large-scale act of war by Putin’s Russia against Ukraine,” and advocates sending weapons to the government in Kyiv. Indeed, with the wind in her sails, Meloni is messaging a larger public, both to woo potential voters and to calm eventual critics. In fact, she knows that without a strong Atlanticist stance it would be impossible for her party to run the country these days. Meloni, moreover, seems to have a flowing dialogue with the outgoing prime minister and hugely respected former president of the European Central Bank, to the point where we have already seen insinuations that Draghi has become Meloni’s own “leadership coach” and guarantor.\n\nOf course, as is often the case with Italian politicians who are touted for top jobs, Meloni is quite the charmer – so many are convinced they have an “exclusive” dialogue with her. Draghi-ites are confident that, given the chaos around Italy, they have Meloni’s ear, and that this will be the case for some time.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd yet, Steve Bannon, the global alt-right guru, also regularly chats with Meloni. In an effort to help Meloni tell her story, Bannon just rolled out an unprecedented Italian franchise of his “War Room” show. Inevitably, this warrants the question: Who is the real Meloni? Is she the responsible party leader who has been on an evolutionary path to morph Brothers of Italy into a post-populist party, or Viktor Orban’s friend in Rome? Only time will tell.\n\nIn the meantime, the biggest test to understand if Meloni actually wants to protect Draghi’s legacy will be the appointment of Italy’s next finance minister. Will she propose someone from Draghi’s old guard for this job?

Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn Sweden, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats are expected to play a major role in the new government after winning the second largest share of seats at a general election earlier this month. The party, now mainstream, initially had roots in neo-Nazism.\n\nEurope’s conservative right certainly feels like it’s enjoying a revival after a few quiet years.\n\n“Something is definitely happening. From France and Italy, major European powers, to Sweden … it feels as though a rejection of the manifestly failing pan-European orthodoxy is taking hold among our citizens,” says Gunnar Beck, a Member of the European Parliament representing Alternative for Germany (AfD).\n\nAfD is a far-right party that became the first to be placed under surveillance by the German government since the Nazi era. At the time, the Central Council of Jews in Germany welcomed the decision, saying: “The AfD’s destructive politics undermine our democratic institutions and discredit democracy among citizens.”\n\nThe AfD sent shockwaves through Europe in 2017 after securing over 12% of the vote in Germany’s federal elections, making it the third largest party and official opposition.\n\nWhere is this momentum coming from?\n\n“The cost-of-living crisis is undermining governments and European institutions. Of course the war in Ukraine has made things worse, but things like the European Green Deal and monetary policy from the European Central Bank were pushing up inflation before the war. The erosion of living standards means people are naturally becoming dissatisfied with their governments and the political establishment,” Beck adds.\n\nMarine Le Pen took 41% of the vote in the final round of the French presidential election this year. Yves Herman/Reuters\n\nCrisis always creates opportunities for parties in opposition, whatever their political ideology. But the politics of fear in the context of crisis does tend to lend itself more readily to right-wing populists.\n\n“In the case of Meloni and her party, she was able to criticize both the establishment figure of Mario Draghi, an unelected technocrat installed as Prime Minister, and the populists that had propped up his coalition government,” says Marianna Griffini, lecturer in the Department of European and International Studies at King’s College London.\n\nGriffini says that Italy’s recent woes have made it particularly susceptible to anti-establishments ideas. “We suffered as a country very badly in the pandemic, especially very early on. Lots of people died, lots of businesses shut down. We had a difficult time getting support from the rest of the EU. Ever since, the establishment and governments of both Conte and Draghi have been easy targets to throw rocks at.”\n\nWhy does crisis create such a unique opportunity for right-wing populists? “Most research shows that conservative voters have a greater need for certainty and stability. When our society changes, conservatives are psychologically tuned to see this as a threat. So it’s far easier to unite those people against real changes or perceived threats, like energy crisis, inflation, food shortage, or immigrants,” says Alice Stollmeyer, executive director of Defend Democracy.\n\nAnd there are plenty of perceived threats for the populists to point fingers at right now.\n\n“Rising food and fuel prices, falling trust in democratic institutions, growing inequality, declining class mobility, and concerns over migration have created a sense of desperation that unscrupulous leaders can easily exploit,” says Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham, in central England.\n\nMeloni is the latest in a long line of successful populist politicians in Italy. Gabriele Maricchiolo/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nHe believes the current combination of crisis is a “perfect storm for liberal democracy - and it will take far greater efforts from those who believe in inclusion, responsible government and human rights to weather it.”\n\nThe fact that we are talking about this most recent wave of populism means that, by definition, we have seen right-wing populists reach power before and we have seen them defeated. Why, then, is the prospect of another wave so alarming to those who oppose it?\n\n“The paradox of populism is that it often identifies real problems but seeks to replace them with something worse,” says Federico Finchelstein, a leading expert in populism and author of the book “From Fascism to Populism in History.”\n\n“The failures of political elites an institutions, they seek to replace with powerful, cult-like leadership. Trump was a natural at it and he encouraged others like Erdogan, Bolsonaro and even Orban to go even further,” Finchelstein adds, referring to the authoritarian leaders of Turkey, Brazil and Hungary, where democratic norms have been seriously undermined in recent years.\n\nHe also points out that populists are “on the whole very bad at running governments, as we saw with Trump and others during the pandemic.”\n\nThat, in a nutshell is the potential danger of this populist wave. At a time of severe crisis, those claiming to have solutions might make everything a lot worse for the citizens they end up serving. And if things get worse, more crises are inevitable, which means more fear is inevitable, along with further opportunities for the populists.\n\nIn Italy, it’s worth nothing that Meloni is just the latest – if the most extreme – in a long list of successful populist politicians. Those who succeeded before her and entered government became her targets in opposition.\n\nIf Europe’s crisis cycle continues, then it’s plausible that in a few years from now we will be discussing the rise of another extreme populist exploiting the fears of citizens. And anyone who follows European politics closely knows only too well that hundreds of such people are waiting in the wings, emboldened and encouraged each time one of their tribe takes on the establishment and wins.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/us/five-things-may-16-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for May 16: Buffalo shooting, Church shooting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’ve gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

On Wednesday, more than 20 million Americans across 16 states were under heat alerts and some cities shattered decades-old records. Macon, Georgia, reached 105 degrees, beating the previous record of 101 degrees set in 1925. New heat records were also set in Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina. And unfortunately, meteorologists say there’s no relief in sight. The heat in the South and the Plains is expected to continue to build through the weekend with much of the region expected to set more records in the coming days, the National Weather Service said. On the other hand, severe storms are expected to dump several inches of rain in some parts of the Southwest today.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol plans to draw attention today to former President Donald Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to bolster his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Three top officials who led the Justice Department in the final days of the Trump administration will testify at today’s hearing about how the former President and his allies sought to enlist the department to give their baseless fraud allegations credibility, according to committee aides. The officials will also make a case that Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with an official who bought into his claims of fraud, committee aides said. Separately, the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Georgia Republican Party chairman for information related to the Trump campaign’s fake elector scheme.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:58 - Source: CNN Sheriff: At least 1 dead, 4 wounded in California church shooting\n\n3. Gun laws\n\nDespite Russia’s threats, Finland said yesterday it will seek to join NATO and Sweden is on the verge of following suit. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson announced her party’s support to apply to join the US-backed alliance, saying her country must “adapt to reality” and make decisions based on the current climate. Both countries have previously refrained from joining for historic and geopolitical reasons. There is “strong bipartisan support” for Finnish accession to NATO, US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said during a visit to Finland today. However, Russia has warned the Nordic nations of “far-reaching consequences” if the countries join the alliance. Separately, EU leaders are ratcheting up their economic action against Russia and are preparing a sixth sanctions package that could be done within days.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:26 - Source: CNN Finland's president 'not worried' Turkey will block his country's NATO bid\n\nThe Senate is poised to take a critical vote today to advance a major bipartisan gun safety bill toward final passage. House Republican leaders, however, are lining up in opposition to the legislation. But even with House GOP leaders opposing the bill, some Republican members have already indicated they plan to vote for it, and the Democrat-controlled House is expected to be able to pass the legislation once it passes in the Senate. If passed, it would be the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Democrats and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n4. Uvalde\n\nNebraska’s Republican governor Pete Ricketts says he will call a special session to pass a total ban on abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this term. When asked if he thought the state should require a young girl who was raped to carry the pregnancy to term, Ricketts told CNN, “They’re still babies, too. Yes.” The governor’s comments come as the Supreme Court’s conservative majority seems likely to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide. More than a dozen states have so-called trigger laws on their books, meaning that abortion will almost immediately be banned if Roe v. Wade is no longer in effect, and Nebraska nearly passed its own such law last month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:22 - Source: CNN GOP governor says that rape victims should have to carry child to term\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pedro Arredondo was suspended on Wednesday after weeks of brewing anger over his department’s botched response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School nearly a month ago. Arredondo and responding law enforcement agencies have faced fierce criticism over the length of time officers waited in a hallway outside adjoining classrooms at the school where an 18-year-old gunman and the victims were located. The gunman fired at officers in the first minutes of the incident – with two receiving grazing wounds – according to an updated timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Yet more than 70 minutes would elapse before the gunman was shot and killed by officers who stormed the room. This week, the top Texas official in charge of the investigation described the response as an “abject failure.”\n\n5.

It won 53% of the vote with almost all ballots counted, enough for a commanding lead over a united coalition of opposition parties.\n\nThe election campaign was dominated by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which put Orban’s lengthy association with Russian President Vladimir Putin under scrutiny. In his victory speech, Orban called Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky one of the “opponents” he had to overcome during the campaign.\n\nHungary is heavily reliant on Russian energy and Orban has dodged opportunities to condemn Putin’s assault on its neighboring state, complicating the EU’s efforts to present a united front against him. Putin congratulated Orban on his victory, a Kremlin spokesperson said Monday, adding: “Despite the difficult international situation, the further development of bilateral partnership fully meets the interests of Russia and Hungary.”\n\nOrban faced a more organized opposition campaign than in previous polls, but his Fidesz party nonetheless won comfortably across much of the country. Opposition leader Peter Marki-Zay even failed to win in his own district, where he had served as mayor.\n\n“We have such a victory it can be seen from the moon, but it’s sure that it can be seen from Brussels,” Orban said in his speech on Sunday night, making light of his government’s long-running tensions with EU leaders.\n\n“We will remember this victory until the end of our lives because we had to fight against a huge amount of opponents,” Orban said, citing a number of his political enemies including the Hungarian left, “bureaucrats” in Brussels, the international media, “and the Ukrainian president too – we never had so many opponents at the same time.”\n\nThe results indicate that Fidesz will hold 135 seats in Hungary’s 199-seat parliament, meaning Orban would retain a two-thirds majority that will allow him to enact further changes to Hungary’s constitution.\n\nThe far-right, anti-vaccine party Our Homeland also made it to Parliament, winning seven seats in a strong showing.\n\nBut Orban did not have a perfect night; a controversial referendum on banning educational materials and programs for children that are considered to promote homosexuality and gender reassignment – seen by critics as an attempt to demonize Hungary’s LGBTQ community – failed to attract enough votes to be considered valid.\n\nA thorny relationship with the EU\n\nOrban has gained close control of Hungary’s judiciary, media and education institutions during his 12-year stint in power, which is now set to be extended until 2026. He has pushed legislation targeting migrants and the LGBTQ+ community, and has spoken of his intention to build an “illiberal” state within the EU.\n\nCritics have long complained that he has tilted the political playing field against his opponents. Last month, Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE), recommended a full-scale international monitoring operation of the April 3 poll – a rare move for an EU state – after assessing claims of “a general deterioration of the conditions for democratic elections.”\n\nBut after a crushing victory on Sunday, Hungary is unlikely to revert from its collision course with Brussels leadership.\n\n“The whole world could see this evening in Budapest that the Christian Democrat politics, the conservative politics and the nationalistic politics won,” Orban said on Sunday night. “Our message to Europe is that it’s not the past but the future. This will be our common European future.”\n\nOrban visited his ally Putin weeks before Moscow invaded Ukraine.

He has supported most of the EU’s sanctions against Russia since it invaded Ukraine, but has resisted going further and pitched himself as a peacemaker to voters.\n\nOn Wednesday, his foreign minister accused Ukraine’s government of coordinating with Hungary’s opposition parties, without citing evidence.\n\nThe opposition criticized him for his stance. “Putin is rebuilding the Soviet empire and Orban is just watching it with strategic calm,” opposition leader Marki-Zay said at a rally in March, Reuters reported.\n\nBut Marki-Zay conceded defeat late on Sunday, telling supporters: “We don’t debate the victory of Fidesz, but we debate that this election was democratic and even.\n\n“We will stay in this country, stand up for each other, hold hands and won’t let each other go. Hard times are coming, regardless of the election results. We know that they will blame us, we will be the scapegoats, so it’s more important than ever to hold each other’s hand and not let go.”\n\nEven before the invasion, Orban had a thorny relationship with the EU. His government has been lambasted by senior figures in the bloc over rule of law issues; earlier this year, Europe’s top court allowed the EU to block funding to Hungary and Poland for violating democratic rights.\n\nCrusading against Western liberal values has also formed a centerpiece of Orban’s premiership, and a referendum was also held Sunday on his controversial law that bans educational materials and programs for children that are considered to promote homosexuality and gender reassignment.\n\nLGBTQ rights groups encouraged voters to spoil their ballots, in order to prevent it from reaching the threshold of required to be considered valid. The tactic appeared to have worked; while those who responded sided mostly with the government, only 3.5 million valid votes were cast, short of the 4.1 million needed to validate the referendum.\n\nBut Orban’s law, which he frames as a “child protection” measure, is already in place and the ballot was seen as symbolic. Orban previously framed a 2016 referendum on migrant quotas as a victory even though it was similarly invalid, and human rights groups fear he will use the results of this ballot to further target the LGBTQ community.", "authors": ["Cnn'S Rob Picheta Balint Bardi", "Cnn'S Rob Picheta", "Balint Bardi"], "publish_date": "2022/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/us/five-things-march-7-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for March 7: Ukraine, Oil prices, Covid-19 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’ve gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

On Wednesday, more than 20 million Americans across 16 states were under heat alerts and some cities shattered decades-old records. Macon, Georgia, reached 105 degrees, beating the previous record of 101 degrees set in 1925. New heat records were also set in Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina. And unfortunately, meteorologists say there’s no relief in sight. The heat in the South and the Plains is expected to continue to build through the weekend with much of the region expected to set more records in the coming days, the National Weather Service said. On the other hand, severe storms are expected to dump several inches of rain in some parts of the Southwest today.\n\n2. January 6\n\nOil prices soared to their highest level in 13 years today, raising fears about a further spike in inflation that could damage the global economy. The surge is due to delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets and as the US and European allies consider banning Russian oil imports, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN yesterday. If Russia’s oil exports are cut off, experts say it will put more strain on an already tight oil market, resulting in even higher gas prices across the US. The average price for a gallon of regular gas hit $4 yesterday, the highest level since 2008. There are now 18 states, plus Washington, DC, where the price of gas is $4 or greater. The highest prices are being seen in California, where the statewide average stands at $5.29 a gallon.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:12 - Source: CNN Blinken: 'Very active discussion' with Europe about Russian oil import ban\n\nThe January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol plans to draw attention today to former President Donald Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to bolster his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Three top officials who led the Justice Department in the final days of the Trump administration will testify at today’s hearing about how the former President and his allies sought to enlist the department to give their baseless fraud allegations credibility, according to committee aides. The officials will also make a case that Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with an official who bought into his claims of fraud, committee aides said. Separately, the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Georgia Republican Party chairman for information related to the Trump campaign’s fake elector scheme.\n\n3. Gun laws\n\nThe Senate is poised to take a critical vote today to advance a major bipartisan gun safety bill toward final passage. House Republican leaders, however, are lining up in opposition to the legislation. But even with House GOP leaders opposing the bill, some Republican members have already indicated they plan to vote for it, and the Democrat-controlled House is expected to be able to pass the legislation once it passes in the Senate. If passed, it would be the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Democrats and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n4. Uvalde\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pedro Arredondo was suspended on Wednesday after weeks of brewing anger over his department’s botched response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School nearly a month ago. Arredondo and responding law enforcement agencies have faced fierce criticism over the length of time officers waited in a hallway outside adjoining classrooms at the school where an 18-year-old gunman and the victims were located. The gunman fired at officers in the first minutes of the incident – with two receiving grazing wounds – according to an updated timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Yet more than 70 minutes would elapse before the gunman was shot and killed by officers who stormed the room. This week, the top Texas official in charge of the investigation described the response as an “abject failure.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:23 - Source: CNN Video shows deadly tornado rip through Iowa\n\n5.

She turned it down in 2019 in support of Colin Kaepernick and his role in social justice protests.\n\nWe called it:Who should play the halftime show when Super Bowl 2023 returns to Arizona?\n\nRihanna: The biggest pop star of her generation?\n\nRihanna is such a great choice that in February, when we did a story headlined \"Who should play the halftime show when Super Bowl 2023 returns to Arizona?,\" she was on the short list.\n\nWe're pleased to see the NFL has taken our advice.\n\nNamed the wealthiest woman in music by Forbes magazine in 2021, Rihanna is perhaps the biggest pop star of her generation with dozens of massive hit singles that could turn up in that halftime show.\n\nShe has topped the Billboard Hot 100 14 times, from 2006's \"SOS\" to 2016's \"Work,\" a Drake collaboration that could mean a Drake appearance at the Super Bowl.\n\nAlmost:Did Taylor Swift turn down the 2023 Super Bowl halftime show in Arizona?\n\nThink of the potential cameos at a Rihanna halftime show\n\nThe opportunities for cameos are endless, from Jay-Z on \"Umbrella\" to Britney Spears on \"S&M\" (although it may hard to get that past the NFL).\n\nThere's also Calvin Harris on \"We Found Love\" or maybe even Kanye West and Paul McCartney on \"FourFiveSeconds.\"\n\nAnd you know McCartney would be down for it.\n\nShe also has two huge chart-topping hits with Eminem that could come into play (\"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"The Monster\").\n\nOther giant hits at Rihanna's disposal include \"Take a Bow,\" \"Disturbia,\" \"Rude Boy,\" \"Only Girl (in the World)\" and \"Diamonds,\" all of which hit No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\nJay-Z calls Rihanna 'a generational talent\n\nJay-Z called her \"a generational talent\" in the NFL announcement and he's right. She is.\n\nHe also called her \"a woman of humble beginnings who has surpassed expectations at every turn\" and \"a person born on the small island of Barbados who became one of the most prominent artists ever.\"\n\nWe detect no lies in any of what Jay-Z had to say.\n\nWe haven't heard much from Rihanna on the music front since 2016, the year her latest album, \"Anti,\" hit the streets. She been featured on collaborations with Future, DJ Khaled, Kendrick Lamar, N.E.R.D. and PartyNextDoor since then.\n\nThis would be the perfect way to announce her return to the spotlight — perhaps in advance of a tour?\n\nShe hasn't toured since 2016, when the Anti World Tour hit what was then called Talking Stick Resort Arena in Phoenix.\n\nReview: The hits kept coming when Rihanna brought her Anti World Tour to Phoenix\n\n3 reasons why Rihanna is a natural for Super Bowl 2023 halftime\n\nThe approach she took to squeezing in as many hits as possible in that performance marked her as a natural for the kind of set that seems to work so well at halftime.\n\nShe kept things moving, offering fans at least a taste of more than 20 songs in a set that often felt like one extended suite as one song bled into the next – a medley here, a mashup there.\n\nShe also brought plenty of showmanship, charisma and spectacle to the proceedings, emerging in a hooded cloak at the back of the arena to open the concert with “Stay,” before riding a floating catwalk to the main stage.\n\nShe's also an excellent singer who's been dogged by accusations that she lip-syncs live. But accusing a halftime performer of lip-syncing is practically a Super Bowl tradition.\n\nRockists of a certain age will not be happy with this choice. But they'd have hated any choice that wasn't making records in the '70s (or doing all they could to sound like they were making records in the '70s).\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

On Wednesday, more than 20 million Americans across 16 states were under heat alerts and some cities shattered decades-old records. Macon, Georgia, reached 105 degrees, beating the previous record of 101 degrees set in 1925. New heat records were also set in Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina. And unfortunately, meteorologists say there’s no relief in sight. The heat in the South and the Plains is expected to continue to build through the weekend with much of the region expected to set more records in the coming days, the National Weather Service said. On the other hand, severe storms are expected to dump several inches of rain in some parts of the Southwest today.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol plans to draw attention today to former President Donald Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to bolster his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Three top officials who led the Justice Department in the final days of the Trump administration will testify at today’s hearing about how the former President and his allies sought to enlist the department to give their baseless fraud allegations credibility, according to committee aides. The officials will also make a case that Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with an official who bought into his claims of fraud, committee aides said. Separately, the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Georgia Republican Party chairman for information related to the Trump campaign’s fake elector scheme.\n\n3. Gun laws\n\nUkrainian authorities have found 440 graves at a mass burial site in Izium, an eastern city recently recaptured from Russian forces, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said in a Twitter post today. “We want the world to know what is really happening and what the Russian occupation has led to,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that Ukrainian and international journalists will be shown the site to see what had been uncovered. Izium was subject to intense Russian artillery attacks in April and was taken back by Ukrainian forces on Saturday, delivering a strategic blow to Russia’s military assault in the east. Separately, the White House announced a $600 million security package for Ukraine on Thursday, providing its military with another round of assistance during its ongoing counteroffensive against Russia.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:51 - Source: CNN At least 440 unmarked graves found in recently liberated Ukrainian town\n\nThe Senate is poised to take a critical vote today to advance a major bipartisan gun safety bill toward final passage. House Republican leaders, however, are lining up in opposition to the legislation. But even with House GOP leaders opposing the bill, some Republican members have already indicated they plan to vote for it, and the Democrat-controlled House is expected to be able to pass the legislation once it passes in the Senate. If passed, it would be the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Democrats and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n4. Uvalde\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pedro Arredondo was suspended on Wednesday after weeks of brewing anger over his department’s botched response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School nearly a month ago. Arredondo and responding law enforcement agencies have faced fierce criticism over the length of time officers waited in a hallway outside adjoining classrooms at the school where an 18-year-old gunman and the victims were located. The gunman fired at officers in the first minutes of the incident – with two receiving grazing wounds – according to an updated timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Yet more than 70 minutes would elapse before the gunman was shot and killed by officers who stormed the room. This week, the top Texas official in charge of the investigation described the response as an “abject failure.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:04 - Source: CNN Senator calls out GOP colleague's resistance to codify same-sex marriage\n\n5. Coronavirus\n\nA new study suggests coronavirus subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 appear to escape antibody responses from vaccination and prior infection. The levels of antibodies that a previous infection or vaccinations would provide are several times lower against these two subvariants compared with the original coronavirus, according to new data published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, Covid-19 vaccination is still expected to provide substantial protection against severe disease, and vaccine makers are working on updated shots that might elicit a stronger immune response against the variants. BA.4 and BA.5 are the fastest-spreading variants reported to date and caused an estimated 35% of new Covid-19 infections in the US last week, recent data shows.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:29 - Source: CNN Business This is where Perseverance found more organic matter than ever on Mars\n\nHAPPENING LATER\n\nPresident Biden to personally meet with Griner and Whelan families\n\nPresident Biden will meet with the families of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan at the White House today, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. This is the first time he will meet with them in person. Griner was detained in Russia in February for carrying vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges and said she accidentally packed the cartridges while in a hurry. She was convicted in August and sentenced to nine years in jail.

The advisory was lifted on Thursday after heavy rains last month and issues at a failing water plant ultimately led to residents being unable to use or drink water for weeks. While samples now show clean water has been restored, officials say it is possible that there will be further interruptions to the city’s water system. Jackson’s issues with water go back years, with boil water advisories becoming almost a fact of life in the city.\n\nTODAY’S QUOTE\n\n“You know what’s worse than high inflation and low unemployment?

His remarks, however, come shortly after Bolduc won the Republican nomination this week – and after months of campaigning on false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. Bolduc is now gearing up to take on Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in November. Her seat represents a top pickup opportunity for Republicans, who are trying to erase Democrats’ slim Senate majority this fall.\n\nTODAY’S WEATHER\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:44 - Source: CNN Rain for areas of western California and your weekend forecast\n\nCheck your local forecast here>>>\n\nAND FINALLY\n\nDelicate Patterns Carefully Carved Into Fruits And Vegetables\n\nIncredible Origami\n\nThis artist pulls inspiration from traditional Japanese patterns to create masterpieces out of fruits and vegetables.

President Joe Biden has offered to exchange Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms trafficker serving a 25-year US prison sentence. Multiple sources told CNN that the plan to trade Bout for Whelan and Griner received the backing of Biden after being under discussion since earlier this year. The President’s support for the swap overrides opposition from the Department of Justice, which is generally against prisoner trades. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday that the US presented the “substantial proposal” to Moscow “weeks ago” for Whelan and Griner. When asked about the possible swap, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said “so far, there is no agreement on this issue.”\n\n2.

Along with potentially extending the pause, the White House has suggested Biden is considering canceling $10,000 per borrower, excluding those who earn more than $125,000 a year.

This means Singapore’s Changi International loses its crown after taking top spot from 2013 to 2020.\n\nConducted from August 2020 until July 2021, and assessing customer service and facilities across more than 500 airports, the annual customer survey for the passenger’s choice awards saw many travellers vote for their favourite airport based on pre-pandemic travel experiences, the awards organisers said. Meanwhile, others voted after their Covid-19 airport experience during the past 12 months.\n\nAirports in Europe and Asia dominated the 2021 awards. Japan was voted best-rated country overall, with three airports in the top ten, including both of Tokyo’s airports. Moving from No.102 in 2020 to No.17 in this year’s survey, Istanbul Airport in Turkey was named the world’s most improved airport in 2021.\n\nHere we take a look at the world’s top ten airports, as voted by airline passengers, starting with Hamad International...\n\nDoha, Qatar Hamad International Airport As well as taking the No.1 spot for the world’s best airport, Hamad International was also named the best airport in the Middle East, the world’s best airport in the 25 to 35 million passenger category, and best airport staff in the Middle East. “Inaugurated in 2014, Hamad International Airport has rapidly become a customer favourite,” said Edward Plaisted of Skytrax. “Achieving this honour is very much a team effort.” The airport is “gearing up for an influx of crowds” as Doha and Qatar will host the Fifa World Cup next year, says Travel+Leisure magazine. It has been implementing new changes ahead of the World Cup, including “increasing its annual capacity to 53 million passengers and building a 110,000 sq ft tropical garden, complete with a waterfall that is nearly 900ft tall”.\n\nTokyo, Japan Tokyo Haneda Airport Haneda Airport in Tokyo was a big winner in the 2021 Skytrax World Airport Awards. Ranked No.2 in the world, it was also named best airport in Asia, the world’s best domestic airport, the world’s best airport for cleanliness, and the best airport for passengers with restricted mobility and accessible facilities. It is the first of three Japanese airports in the top ten.\n\nSingapore Changi International Airport Changi International in Singapore has been a frequent winner of the world’s best airport title. However, for the time in nearly a decade it’s been knocked off the top spot and is No.3 in 2021. Third place is “an achievement for any other airport”, CNN says, but “perhaps not from the perspective of its superfans, who regularly praise the airport’s ease, comfort and top-notch food and drink options”.\n\nSeoul, South Korea Incheon International Airport Seoul’s Incheon International Airport takes fourth place in the 2021 awards. It is certified as a five-star airport for facilities, comfort, cleanliness, shopping, food and beverages, staff service and security/immigration. “The opening of Terminal 2 at Incheon Airport has greatly alleviated passenger density in Terminal 1,” Skytrax said. “T2 provides superb architecture, technology and passenger comfort.”\n\nTokyo, Japan Tokyo Narita Airport Narita joins fellow Tokyo international airport Haneda in the top ten. The main international gateway to the Greater Tokyo region of Japan, Narita is a major hub for airlines including ANA, Japan Airlines and Delta Air Lines, says the Capa Centre for Aviation.\n\nMunich, Germany Munich International Airport Munich Airport retained its stronghold at the awards - taking sixth spot overall and named the best airport in Europe and best airport in central Europe. After a year hit by Covid, the volume of traffic at Munich Airport is beginning to “soar once again”, Travel Daily News reports. The Bavarian state capital’s airport is the second busiest in Germany and with more than 150 retail stores and 50 places to eat and drink, “it’s like a city centre, offering travellers and visitors plenty to see and do”, Skytrax says.\n\nZurich, Switzerland Zurich Airport No.7 on the overall list, Zurich is Switzerland’s largest airport. Widely recognised as one of Europe’s best airports, Zurich is “a cavalcade of services, conveniences, and essentially, everything you would want from an airport”, says Expatica. In the 2021 awards it was named best airport for five to ten million passengers, Covid-19 airport excellence, and best airport for cleanliness in Europe.\n\nLondon, England Heathrow Airport London’s Heathrow was named best airport for 20 to 25 million passengers in the 2021 awards, as well as the best airport in western Europe. One of the world’s busiest international airports, it is the primary hub for British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Coming a very respectable eighth in the 2021 ranking, Heathrow is “way ahead of rival hub Gatwick, which comes 69th”, the Daily Mail reports.\n\nOsaka, Japan Kansai International Airport The closest major airport to the cities of Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe, Kansai has become an important international hub for Japan. It provides one of the largest networks for both domestic and international routes with 24-hour operations. Kansai is the third Japanese airport in the top ten.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2013/06/19/ratings-emirates-named-worlds-best-airline/2437131/", "title": "Ratings: Emirates named world's best airline", "text": "Ben Mutzabaugh\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nEmirates was tabbed as the world's best airline, according to the annual airline ratings published by SkyTrax.\n\nEmirates' win was its first top finish in the SkyTrax World Airline Awards since 2002.

Still, it is one of the strongest hurricanes to make landfall on the west coast of the Florida peninsula and unleashed catastrophic floods and life-threatening storm surge. The monster storm has flooded roads and homes, uprooted trees, sent cars floating in the streets and left nearly 2.5 million homes and businesses without power as of this morning. Ian is on track to advance inland with strong winds and heavy rains expected in portions of Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas over the next few days, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe January 6 committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol plans to draw attention today to former President Donald Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to bolster his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Three top officials who led the Justice Department in the final days of the Trump administration will testify at today’s hearing about how the former President and his allies sought to enlist the department to give their baseless fraud allegations credibility, according to committee aides. The officials will also make a case that Trump considered replacing the acting attorney general with an official who bought into his claims of fraud, committee aides said. Separately, the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Georgia Republican Party chairman for information related to the Trump campaign’s fake elector scheme.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:41 - Source: CNN See Russian men bused away to fight in Putin's war\n\n3. Gun laws\n\nThe Senate is poised to take a critical vote today to advance a major bipartisan gun safety bill toward final passage. House Republican leaders, however, are lining up in opposition to the legislation. But even with House GOP leaders opposing the bill, some Republican members have already indicated they plan to vote for it, and the Democrat-controlled House is expected to be able to pass the legislation once it passes in the Senate. If passed, it would be the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Democrats and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:00 - Source: CNN CNN report: The NASA mission that could 'potentially save all of humankind'\n\n4. Uvalde\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pedro Arredondo was suspended on Wednesday after weeks of brewing anger over his department’s botched response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School nearly a month ago. Arredondo and responding law enforcement agencies have faced fierce criticism over the length of time officers waited in a hallway outside adjoining classrooms at the school where an 18-year-old gunman and the victims were located. The gunman fired at officers in the first minutes of the incident – with two receiving grazing wounds – according to an updated timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Yet more than 70 minutes would elapse before the gunman was shot and killed by officers who stormed the room.

The levels of antibodies that a previous infection or vaccinations would provide are several times lower against these two subvariants compared with the original coronavirus, according to new data published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, Covid-19 vaccination is still expected to provide substantial protection against severe disease, and vaccine makers are working on updated shots that might elicit a stronger immune response against the variants. BA.4 and BA.5 are the fastest-spreading variants reported to date and caused an estimated 35% of new Covid-19 infections in the US last week, recent data shows.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 00:50 - Source: CNN Italy elects most far-right government since WWII\n\nTHIS JUST IN\n\nAt least 7 children among the dead in Russia school shooting\n\nAt least seven children have been killed in a school shooting in the western Russian city of Izhevsk, Russian state media reported earlier today.

The “boutique feel” is achieved with carpeted hallways, bright and charmingly inviting seating areas, 80 stores and restaurants, thousands of live plants, trees and shrubs and a wide array of art and entertainment offerings.\n\nNine airlines will eventually operate out of Changi T4, with Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, Cebu Pacific, AirAsia, Spring Airlines and Vietnam Airlines set to be operating from the terminal by Tuesday (Nov. 7).\n\nVIDEO: What makes Changi the world's best international airport (story continues below)\n\nHigh-Tech T4\n\nWhile “compact,” T4 makes use of the latest technology to get passengers checked in, through immigration and onto their planes.\n\nThere are 65 automated check-in kiosks and 50 automated bag drops in the Departure Hall, and counter service available for those who need it. Automated Immigration Gates (AIGs) use a facial and thumbprint biometric recognition system that can match the photos of registered passengers against the ones in their passports. As an extra layer of security, at the automated boarding gates a facial recognition system matches the photo taken at the immigration gate with the face of the person scanning their boarding pass.\n\nEntertaining T4\n\nChangi’s T4 has a \"petals\" theme that starts curbside and is repeated throughout the building, including in the six-section “Petalclouds” kinetic installation by ART+COM that runs through the center of the building and changes shape to specially-commissioned music.\n\nARCHIVES: World's best airport?

It recovered slightly as European traders came online, rising back to $1.07.\n\nThe currency slump follows British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng’s announcement on Friday that the United Kingdom would implement the biggest tax cuts in 50 years at the same time as boosting government borrowing and spending in the face of high inflation.\n\n“Serious questions are already being asked about the economic competency of the new government,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. “So much so that markets are factoring in a strong chance of a substantial emergency rate hike from the Bank of England in order to shore up the currency and confidence in the markets.”\n\nThe new tax-slashing fiscal measures, which include scrapping plans for an increase in corporation tax and slashing the top rate of income tax, have been criticized as “trickle-down economics” by the opposition Labour Party and even lambasted by members of the Chancellor’s own Conservative party.\n\nKwarteng doubled down at the weekend, hinting in TV interviews Sunday of more tax cuts to come, saying Friday’s measures were “just the start” as the government goes all out for growth.\n\nFormer Tory chancellor Lord Ken Clarke criticized the tax cuts on Sunday, saying they could lead to the collapse of the pound.\n\n“I’m afraid that’s the kind of thing that’s usually tried in Latin American countries without success,” Clarke said in an interview with BBC radio.\n\nThe pound has been hammered by a string of weak economic data, but also the steep ascent of the US dollar, a safe haven investment that sees inflows in times of uncertainty.\n\nThe euro also hit a 20-year low after Giorgia Meloni claimed victory in a general election in Italy. Investors are monitoring what would be the most far-right government since the fascist era of Benito Mussolini, which has raised concerns about cohesion within the European Union.\n\nBut the pound is suffering more than most due to the economic outlook in the United Kingdom, which faces the highest inflation among G7 nations, and the government’s huge fiscal gamble on growth. It has lost nearly 21% so far this year, compared with a fall of 15% in the euro.\n\nThe previous record low for the British pound against the US dollar was 37 years ago on February 25, 1985, when one pound was worth a little over $1.05.\n\n“Should there be any escalation to the war in Ukraine … we would see further sharp downside in the pound as well as the euro,” said Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, an Australian brokerage firm.\n\n“One should not underestimate the crisis that is all of Europe at the moment and the pound is more vulnerable than most,” he said.\n\nThe soaring US dollar also sent major Asian currencies tumbling on Monday.\n\nAsian markets and currencies crack\n\nChina’s yuan slid 0.5% on the onshore market to the lowest level in more than 28 months. The offshore yuan fell 0.4%.\n\nThe rapid declines prompted the People’s Bank of China to impose a risk reserve requirement of 20% on banks’ foreign exchange forward sales to clients, starting Wednesday. That should make it more costly to buy foreign currencies via derivatives, which might slow the pace of the yuan’s decline.\n\nElsewhere in the region, the Japanese yen dropped 0.6% against the dollar to 144. Last Thursday, the Japanese central bank intervened in the currency market for the first time since 1998 to prop up the yen when it hit 145. The yen rebounded slightly following the intervention, but soon resumed the slide.\n\nStock markets in Asia were also in turmoil on Monday, after US stocks sold off on Friday as fears of a recession grew.\n\nSouth Korea’s Kospi declined 2.7%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 (N225) dropped 2.4%, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 1.4%. In Europe, London’s FTSE 100 (UKX) was the weakest index, but Germany’s DAX (DAX) and France’s CAC also slipped lower. Italian stocks got a lift after slumping last week ahead of the elections.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a third consecutive 75-basis-point hike in an aggressive move to tackle white-hot inflation that has been plaguing the US economy.\n\nEven without the Fed action, Europe is facing a recession due to the war in Ukraine, and China is looking at “a substantially weak growth dynamic” because of domestic factors, the DBS analysts said.\n\n“Add on top of that a sharp decline in US dollar liquidity and sharply higher US interest rates, the world economic outlook looks particularly precarious,” they added.\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Laura He Jessie Yeung Jonny Hallam", "Laura He", "Jessie Yeung", "Jonny Hallam"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/business/russia-ruble-banks-sanctions/index.html", "title": "Sanctions slam Russian economy | CNN Business", "text": "London/Moscow CNN Business —\n\nRussia was scrambling to prevent financial meltdown Monday as its economy was slammed by a broadside of crushing Western sanctions imposed over the weekend in response to the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin held crisis talks with his top economic advisers after the ruble crashed to a record low against the US dollar, the Russian central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20%, and the Moscow stock exchange was shuttered for the day. It will stay closed Tuesday, the central bank announced.\n\nThe European subsidiary of Russia’s biggest bank was on the brink of collapse as savers rushed to withdraw their deposits. Economists warned that the Russian economy could shrink by 5%.\n\nThe ruble lost about 25% of its value to trade at 104 to the dollar at 12:15 p.m. ET after earlier plummeting as much as 40%. The start of trading on the Russian stock market was delayed, and then canceled entirely, according to a statement from the country’s central bank.\n\nThe latest barrage of sanctions came Saturday, when the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\n“The ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,” wrote Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, in a note on Monday.\n\nFreezing reserves\n\nPutin’s government has spent the past eight years preparing Russia for tough sanctions by building up a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves including currencies and gold, but at least some of that financial firepower is now frozen and his “fortress” economy is under unprecedented assault.\n\n“We will … ban the transactions of Russia’s central bank and freeze all its assets, to prevent it from financing Putin’s war,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe United States also banned US dollar transactions with the Russian central bank in a move designed to prevent it accessing its “rainy day fund,” senior US administration officials said.\n\n“Our strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,” a senior administration official said.\n\nPeach at Capital Economics estimates that at least 50% of Russia’s reserves are now off limits to Moscow.\n\n“External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,” the Russian central bank said, announcing its dramatic rate hike and series of other emergency measures. “This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation,” the bank added.\n\nRussia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they will become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\nThe crackdown on its leading banks, and the exclusion of some of them from the SWIFT secure messaging system that connects financial institutions around the world will also make it harder for it to sell exports — including oil and gas despite the fact that Russia’s vital energy trade has not yet been directly targeted with sanctions.\n\nFinnish oil refiner Neste said it had mostly replaced Russian crude oil with other supplies.\n\n“For a long time, Russia has been methodically preparing for the event of possible sanctions, including the most severe sanctions we are currently facing,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “So there are response plans, and they are being implemented now as problems arise.”\n\nA run on the banks\n\nBut analysts warned that the turmoil could lead to a run on Russian banks, as savers try to secure their deposits and hoard cash.\n\n“The sanctions target Russia’s domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia’s central bank to continue hiking rates and/or to use its foreign exchange reserves,” the Institute of International Finance said in a report published Monday.\n\n“Furthermore, we believe that the [central bank] will have to institute strict capital controls and possibly declare a bank holiday as bank runs accelerate and demand for foreign exchange continues to rise sharply,” it added.\n\nPeople stand in line to use an ATM money machine in Saint Petersburg, Russia February 27, 2022. ANTON VAGANOV/REUTERS\n\nOne early casualty was the European subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender that has been sanctioned by Western allies. The European Central Bank said Sberbank Europe, including its Austrian and Croatian branches, was failing, or likely to fail, because of “significant deposit outflows” triggered by the Ukraine crisis.\n\n“This led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position,” the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSberbank (SBRCY) shares listed in London fell by nearly 70%. Other Russian companies with foreign listings were also hammered. Gas giant Gazprom (GZPFY) dropped 37% in London trading. Shares in internet service provider Yandex (YNDX) were suspended from trade on the Nasdaq, alongside seven other Russian companies listed in New York.\n\nNasdaq declined to comment. But a person familiar with the matter told CNN that the exchange was asking Russian companies whether they need to make material disclosures following the sanctions announced in recent days by the United States and other nations.\n\nThe Russian central bank last week intervened in the currency markets to try to prop up the ruble. And on Friday, it said it was increasing the supply of bills to ATMs to meet increased demand for cash. On Monday, the Russian government ordered exporters to exchange 80% of their foreign currency revenues for rubles — a measure analysts said was aimed at relieving pressure on the Russian currency.\n\nThe central bank also temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, although it did not specify which assets. The government had also ordered a ban on foreign exchange loans and bank transfers by Russian residents outside of Russia from March 1, Reuters reported.\n\n— Charles Riley, Laura He and Chris Liakos contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Mark Thompson Anna Chernova Vasco Cotovio", "Mark Thompson", "Anna Chernova", "Vasco Cotovio"], "publish_date": "2022/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/investing/ruble-russian-stocks-crash/index.html", "title": "Russian stocks crash and ruble plunges to record low | CNN Business", "text": "London/Paris CNN Business —\n\nRussian stocks crashed and the ruble hit a record low against the dollar on Thursday after Russian troops launched an attack on Ukraine.\n\nThe invasion is likely to trigger a new wave of “full scale” sanctions aimed at President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle and Russia’s oil-dependent economy.\n\nA broad offensive by Russian forces targeted military infrastructure across Ukraine as well as several airports. The assault began hours before dawn and quickly spread across central and eastern Ukraine as Russian forces attacked from three sides. Ukrainian officials said more than 40 soldiers and as many as 10 civilians had been killed, and the deputy interior minister reported “fierce fighting” at an airbase near the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe Moscow stock exchange had suspended trading earlier on Thursday but when dealing resumed, stocks went into free-fall.\n\nThe MOEX index plunged as much as 45% before recovering slightly to close down 33%, while the RTS index — which is denominated in dollars — ended the day with losses of 39%. The crash wiped about $70 billion off the value of Russia’s biggest companies.\n\nRussian banks and oil companies were among the hardest hit in volatile trading, with shares in Sberbank (SBRCY) — Russia’s largest lender — losing 43% of their value. Rosneft, in which BP (BP) owns a 19.75% stake, also shed 43%. BP (BP) shares dropped 4.6% in London. Gazprom (GZPFY), the giant gas company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, was down 35%.\n\nRussia’s central bank said in a statement that it had instructed brokers to suspend short sales “given the current situation in the financial market and to protect the rights and legitimate interests of investors.” That means they can no longer borrow securities to sell in anticipation of buying them back at a lower price. The order took effect at 11:00 a.m. local time.\n\nThe ruble was trading at nearly 88 to the dollar, down 8%, after earlier hitting a new record low of 89.60. The Russian central bank said it would intervene in the currency market and provide extra liquidity to the banking sector.\n\n“This emotional reaction was inevitable, but at the same time it will stabilize,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said about the market turmoil in a call with foreign journalists. “All the necessary measures have been taken for this,” he added.\n\nThe United States, European Union, United Kingdom and other allies announced limited new sanctions on Russia earlier this week after Moscow said it would send troops into two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine. Germany said it was suspending certification of the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.\n\nUS, EU and UK officials have made clear that much tougher measures would follow should Russia invade.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday the European Union is set to unleash “the full packet of sanctions” against Russia, adding that the world must respond resolutely or run the risk of paying an even higher price.\n\n“We woke up in a different world today,” Baerbock told reporters at a news conference in Berlin, adding “we will launch the full package of massive sanctions against Russia.”\n\nThe Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia called for Russia to be ejected from SWIFT, the secure messaging services that facilitates payments among 11,000 financial institutions in 200 countries.\n\n“The entire international community must firmly condemn Russia’s aggression and impose the toughest possible sanctions in response to such outrageous acts, including disconnecting Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT),” the foreign ministers of the three countries said in a joint statement.\n\nIn a statement, SWIFT said it was “a neutral global cooperative” and “any decision to impose sanctions on countries or individual entities rests solely with the competent government bodies and applicable legislators.”\n\nExcluding Russia from SWIFT would cause its economy to shrink by 5%, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin estimated in 2014 — the last time this sanction was considered in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea\n\nSberbank said it was prepared for any developments and had worked through scenarios to guarantee its customers’ funds, assets and interests were protected, Reuters reported.\n\n— Charles Riley contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Mark Thompson Chris Liakos", "Mark Thompson", "Chris Liakos"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/investing/china-covid-yuan-usd-weakening-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Yuan to US dollar: China's currency still dropping after worst month ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nThe Chinese currency is declining rapidly as the world’s second largest economy falters under the weight of Covid restrictions.\n\nSince the start of the year, investors have been moving money out of China, driven by concerns about rising lockdowns in major cities, and Beijing’s close ties with Moscow in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The links have raised fears that China could be targeted by Western sanctions if it helps Moscow.\n\nThe yuan — also known as the renminbi — hit its lowest levels since September 2020 early on Friday in the onshore market that Beijing controls as well as offshore, where it can trade more freely.\n\nThe currency recovered later in the day to stand around 6.78 per US dollar. In the past three months, the yuan has lost about 7% of its value against the greenback. In April alone, it posted its biggest monthly drop on record. In the same month, China’s foreign exchange reserves fell by the most since late 2016.\n\nIt is a stark turn for the yuan, which was one of the strongest currencies in the world in 2021.\n\nAnalysts say a combination of Beijing’s Covid restrictions and rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve have made investors wary about keeping their money in China. The country witnessed record outflows from Chinese bonds in February and March.\n\n“[A] stronger US dollar, dampened sentiment towards China’s economic outlook and narrowed interest rate spread between China and the US all contributed to the rapid depreciation of the currency,” said Goldman Sachs analysts on Friday.\n\nLockdowns continue\n\nSo far, at least 32 cities in the country remain under lockdown, as President Xi Jinping’s government relentlessly pursues its zero Covid policy, which has hit almost every industry and pushed the economy backwards.\n\nAuthorities this week tightened Covid restrictions on the country’s two most important cities — Shanghai and Beijing — after Xi pledged to “unswervingly” double down on the strict zero-Covid policy.\n\nWorries over these restrictions intensified further on Friday when China banned citizens from going overseas for non-essential reasons.\n\n“Nervousness around China remaining closed for the near future,” has translated into a preference for the US dollar over the yuan, said Stephen Innes, managing partner for SPI Asset Management in a research note on Friday.\n\nChina’s balancing act\n\nThe central bank has tried to limit the damage.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the People’s Bank of China in late April cut the amount of foreign exchange banks must hold as reserves to 8% from 9%.\n\nThat stemmed the yuan’s decline for a few days, but it soon started falling again.\n\nA weaker currency has some upside. As the yuan gets cheaper, it makes China’s exports more competitive.

Russia would become one of the world’s five biggest economies, they claimed.\n\nPutin’s quest to dominate his neighbors, starting with his assault on Georgia in 2008, and continuing with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and last month’s invasion of Ukraine, has shredded what remained of the authoritarian leader’s economic dreams.\n\nIn early 2008, one US dollar would buy roughly 25 rubles. The Russian currency has depreciated significantly since then, and Western sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine have pushed it into freefall. On Wednesday, one US dollar could buy 117 rubles in Moscow after the currency fell 10% and hit a new record low. The ruble has been even weaker in the offshore market this week.\n\nThe latest slide came after Russia’s central bank banned Russians from buying hard currencies and ordered banks to cap withdrawals from foreign currency accounts at $10,000 for the next six months, moves that could help preserve some of the country’s dollar reserves and support the ruble.\n\nSergey Aleksashenko, a former Russian finance ministry and central bank official, described the strategy as “incredible foolishness” that could lead to a run on the banks.\n\n“Apparently, the outflow of foreign currency deposits from Russian banks has exceeded the Bank of Russia’s forecasts and put under question the banks’ ability to meet their obligations,” he wrote in a newsletter.\n\n“The biggest mistake monetary authority may make in Russia is to touch private savings — if there was no bank run until now, it’s going to happen,” added Aleksashenko.\n\nRussia has been scrambling to prevent financial meltdown since the United States, European Union and other Western allies imposed sanctions on much of the country’s banking system, including freezing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of reserves Moscow had been stockpiling for years to shield the economy. Analysts estimate that more than half of Russia’s reserves of foreign currency and gold are now off limits.\n\nThe central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20%, and temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners. The government has ordered exporters to exchange 80% of their foreign currency revenues for rubles, and banned Russian residents from making bank transfers outside Russia.\n\nThe ruble has come under intense pressure, and Moscow’s failure to defend the currency will translate to economic pain. Russia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they will become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\nFitch Ratings slashed Russia’s credit rating on Tuesday and warned that a default was “imminent.”\n\n“The further ratcheting up of sanctions, and proposals that could limit trade in energy, increase the probability of a policy response by Russia that includes at least selective non-payment of its sovereign debt obligations,” the ratings agency said in a statement.\n\nEven with Russia on the brink of default, Western countries are continuing to unleash punishing restrictions designed to further isolate Moscow. The United States and the United Kingdom banned Russian energy imports on Tuesday, and the European Union said it would attempt to reduce natural gas imports by 66% this year.\n\nFor Moscow, the costs are adding up. The central bank’s decision to prevent Russians from buying US dollars marks the end of the ruble, according to Anders Åslund, an economist and former adviser to the Russian government.\n\n“All ruble convertibility is over.

Now, it takes only 54 rubles to equal a dollar, evidence that moves by Russia's Central Bank to defend the currency have paid off.\n\nThe bank's key rate, which was boosted to 17% last December, is now 14%, still sky-high compared to Western economies.\n\nFinancial analysts said the ruble's surprising recovery is also due to an upward correction in oil prices, which have leveled off, and less geopolitical risk about a war in Ukraine that could create a new Russian standoff with the West. The Ukraine government and rebels in the east are observing a cease-fire, although fighting in some areas continues.\n\n\"There is no bad news, at least, on the geopolitical front,\" Central Bank first deputy chairwoman Ksenia Yudina wrote in an article for the Vedomosti newspaper on Sunday.\n\nYudina cited high interest rates as the main reason for the ruble's rally. \"Russian assets are some of the most high-yielding in the world,\" she wrote.\n\nPrivate analysts said the ruble fell too far during the winter. \"The ruble was very much oversold last year, and its collapse was not just due to falling oil prices,\" said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank. Oil bottomed out and began a slight recovery, she said, but the real reasons for the ruble's growth over the last month lie in Russia's high yields.\n\n\"When we look at comparative yields, Russia is looking pretty attractive\" for investors, Orlova said.\n\nStill, Orlova does not rule out continued volatility for the ruble, as its recent decline from just under 50 to the dollar last Friday indicate. \"You can't really say that the ruble is strong, given that it was 30-35 to the dollar at the beginning of 2014,\" she said. \"It's merely reached its fundamental value of 50-55 to the dollar.

The Braves are just two wins behind first place in the National League East. Chief Executive Officer Terry McGuirk said he hoped they’d be back to the White House again soon.\n\nIn August 2021, the Braves were a mess, playing barely at .500. But then they started winning. And they kept doing it, clinching the World Series in six games over the Houston Astros.\n\nBiden called their come-from-behind win one of “history’s greatest turnarounds.”\n\n“This team has literally been part of American history for over 150 years,” said Biden. “But none of it came easy … people counting you out. Heck, I know something about being counted out.”\n\nPlayers lined up on risers behind Biden, grinning and waving to the crowd, but the player most discussed was one who hasn’t been on the team in nearly 50 years and who died last year: Hall of Famer Hank Aaron.\n\nHammerin’ Hank was the homerun king for 33 years, dethroning Babe Ruth with a high flier to centerfield on April 8, 1974. He was one of the most famous players for Atlanta and in baseball history, a vocal and clear-eyed chronicler of the many hardships thrown his way – from the poverty and segregation of his Alabama youth to the racist threats he faced during his pursuit of one of America’s most hallowed records. He died in January at age 86.\n\n“This is team is defined by the courage of Hank Aaron,” Biden said.\n\nMcGuirk said Aaron, who held front office positions with the team and was one of Major League Baseball’s few Black executives, was watching over them.\n\n“He’d have been there every step of the way with us if he was here,” McGuirk added.\n\nThe president often honors major league and some college sports champions with a White House ceremony, typically a nonpartisan affair in which the commander in chief pays tribute to the champs’ prowess, poses for photos and comes away with a team jersey.\n\nThose visits were highly charged in the previous administration. Many athletes took issue with President Donald Trump’s policies and rhetoric on policing, immigration and more. Trump, for his part, didn’t take kindly to criticism from athletes or their on-field expressions of political opinion.\n\nUnder Biden, the tradition appears to be back. He’s hosted the NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks and Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers at the White House. Biden on Monday joked about first lady Jill Biden’s Philadelphia allegiances.\n\n“Like every Philly fan, she’s convinced she knows more about everything in sports than anybody else,” he said.

After the NBA shut down in March 2020, sports were largely absent from American and global life in the months following.\n\n\"I think what we discovered is we need sports more than we ever realized,\" Biden said.\n\nHe also referenced Dodgers Stadium being used as a COVID-19 testing and, later, vaccine administration site, one of 11 MLB stadiums to combine to vaccinate over 1 million people through March. The stadium was also used as an outdoor voting site for the 2020 Presidential Election.\n\n\"Above all, as we beat this pandemic and celebrate fans coming back to stadiums, we celebrate something else: a national achievement,” Biden said. “We came together as fellow Americans, front-line workers, friends, families, neighbors looking out for one another. Dodgers Stadium was the heart of that effort.”\n\nPitcher Clayton Kershaw, a three-time Cy Young award winner, spoke prior to the team gifting both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, a California native, their own Dodgers jerseys.\n\n\"Last season was a special one for us, but it was also a challenging one for our country and our hope was that we were able to provide just a little bit of joy and comfort and relief to our fans that were going through some tough times,\" Kershaw said.\n\nEarly in his speech, Biden called the Dodgers a \"pillar of American culture and American progress,\" referencing Los Angeles greats Vin Scully, Sandy Koufax, Fernando Valenzuela and Jackie Robinson.\n\n“Now you’re building a new dynasty for a new generation,” he said. “I’ve often said that it’s never a good idea to bet against the American people. I tell that to every world leader I encounter.

He was replaced during the eighth inning and not on the field for the win. However, during the team's post-game celebration, Turner returned to the field.\n\nSports teams have received invitations to visit the White House for over 100 years.

What followed was a weekend of non-stop coverage of national anthem protests.\n\nThen Trump rescinded a White House invitation to the NBA champion Golden State Warriors after their star player Stephen Curry expressed ambivalence.\n\nIt follows a pattern of Trump breaking with presidential traditions — some substantive, and others more ceremonial. In response to opposition, he skipped the Kennedy Center Honors and the White House Correspondents' Dinner. And he frequently injects political comments into non-political events like the Boy Scout Jamboree and previous ceremonies honoring championship football teams.\n\nTo use the sports metaphors favored by presidents on these occasions, a championship team's invitation to the White House should be a slam dunk. They give a president an opportunity to appear presidential, to be a \"winner by association,\" and to adopt the team's victory as an American moment.\n\nMore:Analysis: This is a major political week for Trump. But his NFL feud is overshadowing his agenda\n\nSanders on Trump's NFL insults: 'It's always appropriate' for president to defend flag\n\n\"These are important ceremonies, otherwise they wouldn’t be happening,\" said Michael Hester of the University of West Georgia, who has studied presidential sports ceremonies. \"They're perfect for a president to use their office, to use their pulpit, to articulate national values.\"\n\nPresidents have invited sports teams to the White House since at least Andrew Johnson, according to the White House Historical Association. Johnson invited two amateur baseball teams — the first professional team was still four years away — in August, 1865, just three months after the end of the Civil War.\n\nOther teams were recognized sporadically, but it wasn't until Jimmy Carter that the tradition began to take hold. Reagan expanded and popularized the practice, with frequent references to The Gipper, a reference to his movie portrayal of the college football star. Over time, Olympic medalists, collegiate teams and women's sports have also been recognized.\n\nRegardless of president or party, those events have largely followed the same script. There are some subtle differences: Republicans talk more about individual achievement, while Democrats talk more about teamwork, for example.\n\nAnd while presidents sometimes compare championship sports teams to presidential campaigns, Trump has perhaps gone further than his predecessors. Honoring the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Trump told a long story about how coach Bill Belichick supported him in the campaign. At a ceremony to present the Commander in Chief Trophy to the Air Force Academy Falcons — and with cadets as a backdrop — he blasted Democrats three times, putting the officially apolitical cadets in an awkward situation.\n\nTrump's polarizing presidency has caused an increasing number of athletes to say they won't attend the White House ceremonies.\n\n\"Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\" Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\nLeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers — perhaps Curry's biggest on-court rival — defended Curry and called Trump a \"bum\" on Twitter. \" Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!” he said.\n\nAt the Cavalier's media day outside Cleveland Monday, James accused Trump of being divisive. \"The thing that kind of frustrated me and pissed me off a little bit is the fact that ... he used the sports platform to try to divide us. And sports is so, is so, is so amazing,\" James said.\n\nBut White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday the remarks were intended to be unifying, not divisive.\n\n\"Look, this isn't about the president being against anyone,\" she said. \"This is about the president and millions of Americans being for something; being for honoring our flag, honoring our national anthem, and honoring the men and women who fought to defend it.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump has done any lasting damage to the role of the president as the sports-fan-in-chief. After he disinvited the Warriors, he made clear that the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team was still invited.\n\nThe Stanley Cup champions confirmed their attendance, saying the Penguins \"respect the institution of the Office of the President, and the long tradition of championship teams visiting the White House.\"\n\n\"Any agreement or disagreement with a president's politics, policies or agenda can be expressed in other ways,\" the team said in a statement. \"However, we very much respect the rights of other individuals and groups to express themselves as they see fit.”\n\nBut Hester says Trump's sports rhetoric has already broken barriers.\n\n\"With Trump everything is personal. I can't imagine a previous president disinviting someone,\" he said. \"He flips all of these traditional ways we think about using the presidency on their head. Just burn every political science book. Everything we’ve been teaching is wrong. This guy breaks all the rules.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/mike-jones/2018/06/06/malcolm-jenkins-eagles-donald-trump-white-house-protests/679281002/", "title": "Malcolm Jenkins won't let NFL players' message be silenced", "text": "PHILADELPHIA – YOU AREN’T LISTENING.\n\nMalcolm Jenkins presented his message in the simplest, black-and-white form he could think of: in all-caps, written in Sharpie on poster boards.\n\nJournalists encircled the Philadelphia Eagles safety and social justice leader, eager to hear his thoughts on President Trump’s decision to revoke the football team’s invitation to visit the White House this week for what would have been a celebration of February’s Super Bowl victory.\n\nBut Jenkins did not speak. His bearded face remained emotionless as reporters hurled questions at him. To each he simply raised another sign, many of which bore sobering statistics on the justice system.\n\n“What does that have to do with not going to the White House yesterday?” one reporter called out.\n\n“Malcolm, do you feel it was fair for the president to cancel the White House trip even though a large majority of the team wasn’t going?” another asked.\n\n“Are you upset with the White House for canceling the event?” came another.\n\nUpset? Over a canceled trip to the White house?\n\nJenkins had it right with the “YOU AREN’T LISTENING” poster.\n\nMore:Coach Doug Pederson: Canceled White House visit 'is what it is,' and Eagles remain united\n\nMore:Steve Kerr: President Trump treating Eagles situation like a 'political game'\n\nMost Eagles players didn’t waste energy on the yanked White House invitation. Most of them hadn't been set to go anyway.\n\nThe unfairness that they’re concerned with involves those faced daily by people of color, at-risk youth and poverty-stricken Americans.\n\nMany of the Eagles players had no desire to rub shoulders with Trump, who lacks a sympathetic ear on such issues. He’s the same person who last fall referred to any player who kneeled as a “son of a bitch\" for protesting during the playing of the national anthem. The president did not engage on the issues driving the protests and instead painted players as anti-patriotic and unappreciative of the military.\n\nSo as the president again bashed the NFL, touting the canceled visit as a matter of respect for The Star-Spangled Banner, Jenkins and his teammates stuck to their message.\n\nJenkins’ poster board responses stuck to his original point:\n\n• “More than 60 percent of people in prison are people of color.”\n\n• “Nearly 20,000 juveniles enter the adult criminal system each year, most for non-violent crimes.”\n\n• \"In 2018, 439 people shot and killed by police (thus far). In U.S. Pop. – 8 percent African-American males; Shot by police – 25 percent African-American males”\n\n• “Any given night, 500,000 sit in jail. Convicted? No. Too poor? Yes.”\n\nJenkins’ other posters displayed a lengthy list of NFL players, which he called “TRUE PATRIOTS” because of their charitable work. Many of those players were his fellow members of the Players Coalition, which worked with team owners to secure $90 million for social justice efforts over the next several years.\n\nThe list of players included exiled quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has now given $1 million to charity. Another was Jenkins’ teammate Chris Long, who donated his entire 2017 salary to Philadelphia schools.\n\nLong also faced a barrage of questions. He did speak, but avoided getting caught in a war of words with the president. Like Jenkins, Long understands that’s what feeds Trump and his supporters. He recognizes that accusations of anti-patriotism or disrespect for the military are nothing more than ill-informed opinions and distraction tactics.\n\nNone of those ploys can detract from the players' true mission, Long said.\n\n“I don’t feel like the work these guys are doing in the community can be hijacked,” he said. “You’ve got guys like Malcolm doing tremendous work in the community dealing with criminal justice reform, meeting with legislators. We’ve got a bunch of guys doing great work in their community, and really all across the league. Some of the best men I know are guys I’ve met that are pro football players and who really had the opportunity to not give a crap about people with less than them, but they do it anyway. They go in the community to help people who have less and use their platform well.”\n\nEver since Kaepernick began taking a knee during the national anthem two years ago to raise awareness of the police violence against people of color, opponents of the protest have tried to tell players to “stick to sports.” But they’re ignoring the point.\n\nWith his stunt this week, the president succeeded in a few regards. He further strengthened his standing in the eyes of those who are willing to gulp down his narrative with little to no concern for the facts. And he further alienated the portion of the population fighting for equality and reform.\n\nHe again used the NFL – the country’s most powerful sports league and the exclusive club to which Trump tried in vain to gain membership with a failed attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014 – as his pawn. But he did not accomplish anything truly meaningful.\n\nAt a time when so many, from the White House to some NFL fans, are telling professional football players how to conduct themselves, perhaps a better solution is take a page from their playbook.\n\nGet to know each other.\n\n“One of the beautiful things about the NFL is you have a true melting pot of guys from all over the country,” said Eagles center Jason Kelce, who declined to say if he planned on attending the White House, because it was irrelevant at this point.\n\nHe continued, “You’ve got guys from rural America, guys from inner city Detroit, guys that have grown up in upper class, to middle class, to guys that have grown up in single-parent households and have nothing. I think there’s all sorts of different viewpoints and different beliefs, and one thing you learn quickly in this league is, everyone has different beliefs, but you learn to quickly put that aside and as a team you accomplish great things, you develop empathy and sympathy for one another, to learn and develop the ability to work together, and to be honest, I think our country could follow that a little bit more.”\n\nThat’s an American talking. He happens to play football.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2019/04/29/baylor-womens-basketball-donald-trump-white-house/3571634002/", "title": "Trump White House: Baylor women visit in what used to be a tradition", "text": "Thirty-five years ago this month, President Ronald Reagan honored the Southern California women's basketball team at a ceremony in the Indian Treaty Room of the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House.\n\n\"There was a time when the only jumping that was done at an athletic contest by women was by the cheerleaders — and there's nothing wrong with that,\" Reagan told the 1984 NCAA champions. \"But you are proving that women can make their mark as well in the field of athletics, out there on the floor of the arena.\"\n\nThough the Trojans didn't technically visit the White House, their ceremony with Reagan was a historic moment — and the start of a longstanding tradition in women's basketball.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY Sports research, 31 of the next 32 NCAA women's champions went on to be honored by the president, either individually or as part of a broader ceremony. At least 16 WNBA champions have received White House invitations since the founding of the league in 1997.\n\nThose trends have changed with President Donald Trump in office.\n\nWhile championship visits have become more sporadic across all sports under Trump, they've become particularly rare for women's teams. When the Baylor women's basketball team is honored at the White House on Monday, it will be the first female team — in any sport — to receive its own championship ceremony during Trump's presidency.\n\n\"Why is that?\" Dr. Deborah Antoine, the CEO of the Women's Sports Foundation, said in a statement provided to USA TODAY Sports.\n\n\"Female athletes, coaches and teams all deserve equal opportunity to play, compete and thrive. And when that all adds up to a national championship, they too should have equal opportunity to be recognized with one of our country's highest honors.\"\n\nThe White House did not reply to an email seeking comment for this story.\n\nEllen Staurowsky, a professor of sports management at Drexel University, believes the entire idea of visiting the White House has changed under Trump. Multiple teams have not been invited or declined invitations, most recently the Virginia men's basketball team. The Cavaliers announced Friday that they would forgo a visit, just as the president's comments about a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville were back in the news.\n\nStaurowsky said these once non-partisan celebrations have become inherently political. And for women's teams, she said, that means taking into account some of Trump's past comments about women and the sexual harassment allegations that have been levied against him.\n\n\"On one hand, it leaves us with the question: Is it all that surprising that this administration would not invite as many women?\" Staurowsky said Saturday. \"And then it also presents the dilemma of what women are to make when these kinds of invitations are extended.\"\n\nThe lack of White House visits for female champions under Trump is a departure from nearly 30 years of precedent. According to presidential schedules, speech transcripts and photographs reviewed by USA TODAY Sports, each of the past five presidents — including three Republicans and two Democrats — generally honored women's basketball champions as frequently as men.\n\nFormer presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, for example, typically held joint celebrations for the men's and women's NCAA basketball champions. Former president George W. Bush followed suit, while also regularly inviting WNBA champions to visit the White House for the first time.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama took it one step further — celebrating every college and professional women's basketball champion individually during his eight-year term. He also held ceremonies for the U.S. women's national soccer team after its World Cup win in 2015 and Sky Blue FC, which won the inaugural league title in Women's Professional Soccer in 2009.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has hosted female athletes or women's teams at the White House twice since taking office: as part of a celebration of NCAA champions in non-revenue sports in 2017, and at a ceremony honoring Olympians and Paralympians in 2018. But he has yet to even extend an invitation to a WNBA champion, to the chagrin of some of the league's players and coaches.\n\n\"It's probably because we're a women's sport and it maybe is not on our president's radar,\" Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve told The Star Tribune after her team was not invited last year.\n\nIn a statement provided to USA TODAY Sports, WNBA chief operating officer Christy Hedgpeth described the situation as a \"missed opportunity\" for the White House: \"WNBA players are world-class athletes and multifaceted women whose accomplishments and interests extend far beyond basketball and serve as a source of inspiration to millions of people.\"\n\nBaylor declined to make women's basketball coach Kim Mulkey available for an interview ahead of Monday's visit, and spokesperson Kyle Robarts declined to release any additional information about the decision to accept Trump's invitation — including whether players were consulted.\n\n\"It's not a political issue for me. It's an honor to go to the White House,\" Mulkey told The Associated Press this month. \"I want everyone to say they went to the White House.

The team said in a release that “virtually the entire” traveling party had received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and general manager Rick Hahn put the number at “well in excess of 90%.”\n\n“We got to an extraordinarily high percentage of those eligible participating and we couldn’t be happier with that,” Hahn said.\n\nIn its release, the team thanked the city, the Chicago Department of Public Health and Rush University Medical Center for their help with the vaccinations.\n\nMajor League Baseball and the players’ association sent a memo to players and staff last month that said some of the sport's coronavirus-related restrictions would be eliminated once 85% of the team's major league players and primary field staff are vaccinated. The memo said players and staff are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the one-dose vaccine.\n\nWhile the White Sox got most of their traveling party vaccinated on Thursday, Hahn said they haven't met the 85% threshold because it also includes players and staff at the club's alternate site in Schaumburg. But he thinks the organization will reach 85% “in the coming weeks.”\n\nIn the meantime, under MLB protocols, there are individual benefits to the vaccine for players and staff. Fully vaccinated people who have close contact with someone with COVID-19 do not have to quarantine unless they exhibit symptoms.\n\n“I think it’s pretty cool to see that all the guys pretty much went in there and got the vaccine for everybody else,” said shortstop Danny Mendick, a vaccinated player. “You know what I mean? It helps for families, for road trips and different things like that. It shows that everyone has bought in.”\n\nFor Hahn, the team's vaccination program had at least one benefit very specific to his job.\n\n“When my phone rings and it’s (head athletic trainer) James Kruk on the other end, it’s more likely to be an actual baseball injury than it is something COVID-related, having dealt with all of last summer and spring this year with that risk,” Hahn said. “I would say that there’s actually a little bit of comfort in spending our time talking about hamstrings instead of the pandemic.”\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/11"}]}

Gone were Green’s iconic go-go boots, replaced by sneakers. Online, mayhem ensued.\n\nNow, M&M’S is making another, bigger change — this time, it’s adding a brand new character to the mix. Meet Purple: She’s peanut, she sings, and she doesn’t wear high heels (she sports lace-up boots).\n\nThe purple peanut M&M is the first new character in 10 years, according to the brand.\n\n“Purple has been in the works for a very long time, for years,” said Jane Hwang, Global Vice President of M&M’S. “This was about ensuring that the entire crew, the entire cast of spokescandies, were reflecting the world that we’re living in.”\n\nM&M'S\n\nPurple has a specific personality — quirky, confident and just a little awkward. Her debut comes with a song, “I’m Just Gonna Be Me,” which can be seen in a video online and streamed on platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that a purple M&M is coming to bags of Peanut M&M’S, however.\n\nThe new character will appear in stores, on the M&M’S website and on some limited edition packaging, said Hwang. And customers will be able to buy purple M&M’S online, an option that was already available. But when it comes to a regular bag of peanut M&M’S, purple fans are out of luck.\n\nThat could be a new source of outrage.\n\nIn the mid-90s, people voted for blue to replace tan in bags of the candy. In 2002, M&M’S once again asked people to vote, this time for a color that would be added for just a limited time. Purple won, but didn’t stick around for long.\n\nOnline, people frequently ask why there are no purple M&M’S. Some bemoan the missed opportunity in the 1990s to make purple a permanent addition to the lineup. Some even think the vote was rigged.\n\nStill, the new character, while not an actual new candy, is an acknowledgment from M&M’S that people are pining for purple.\n\n“We’ve heard for a long time that purple is certainly a consumer favorite,” said Hwang.\n\nBut the brand is really focusing on the characters, rather than the actual edible candies, she noted.\n\n‘Give green her boots back’\n\nWhen M&M’S made changes to its characters’ footwear early this year, the idea was to make them more current and relevant, with characters that, Mars hopes, will make people feel like they belong. The new footwear was supposed to help telegraph that message. Orange finally got a pair of shoes with tied laces, Brown got lower heels, and others also got subtle updates to their style.\n\nBut there was an outsized reaction to Green’s new kicks.\n\nAn opinion piece in the Washington Post declared “The M&M’S changes aren’t progressive. Give Green her boots back.” In a provocatively-headlined article, Rolling Stone described the change as “nothing more than tectonic.” Thousands have signed a petition to “keep the green M&M sexy.”\n\nPeople are known to have strong feelings about things online, particularly changes to beloved characters. When Lola Bunny got a new look for the new Space Jam movie, for example, fans were outraged.\n\nBut for M&M’S, reaction to the character makeover was “unprecedented,” said Hwang. “We were incredibly overwhelmed,” she noted. “Now we know for certain that M&M’S is a cultural icon.”\n\nSo when it came to the new purple character, Hwang said, M&M’S didn’t take the reaction to Green into account. Purple “had nothing to do … with the commentaries we saw about Green,” she said.\n\nAnd for now, at least, M&M’S has no plans to restore Green’s look.\n\n“The characters … are continuously evolving to reflect the times that we’re living in,” Hwang said, adding that the brand hopes consumers will “get to know our characters for much more than their footwear.”\n\nSo will the go-go boots ever make a comeback? Hwang answered slyly, “You never know.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/business/mms-characters-logo/index.html", "title": "M&Ms' beloved characters are getting a new look | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nM&M’s branding is getting a refresh.\n\nThe candy’s anthropomorphized chocolate characters are being made over, and the logo is also getting a tweak.\n\nBut the most noticeable change is to the six M&M characters: new shoes. Green has swapped her go-go boots for sneakers. Brown is sporting lower, more sensible heels. Red and Yellow’s shoes now have laces. Orange’s shoes laces are no longer untied. And Blue’s shoes, while little changed, resemble what Anton Vincent, president of Mars Wrigley North America, described as “a bad version of Uggs.”\n\nM&Ms old logo and characters are shown on the left, and the new versions on the right. Changes include new footwear for the six characters and a straightened-out logo emphasizing the ampersand. M&Ms\n\nMars Wrigley, which owns M&Ms, is trying to make the characters — particularly the female ones — more “current” and “representative of our consumer,” Vincent said. The revamped footwear is “a subtle cue, but it’s a cue people really pick up on,” he added, noting that Mars gets a lot of feedback on the characters’ shoes.\n\nThe logo adjustment is also slight: Instead of resting on its side, it’s set up straight. The new orientation is designed to emphasize the ampersand. The logo was last tweaked in 2019.\n\nThe changes are rolling out online this week and they’ll be incorporated into M&Ms’ packaging and other marketing materials this year.\n\nThe changes may be subtle, but even small shifts can help brands avoid falling out of fashion, said David Camp, co-founder and managing partner of Metaforce, a marketing company. “Every brand has to continuously reinvent itself to remain relevant.”\n\nM&Ms were introduced in 1941. M&Ms\n\nBetter gender representation\n\nM&Ms were first sold in 1941, and the characters arrived on the scene in 1954. Old M&Ms commercials starred Red and Yellow, representing regular and peanut M&Ms. In the late 1990s, new characters were added to the mix. Brown, the most recent addition, joined the crew in 2012.\n\nOver the years the brand has switched between highlighting its characters more heavily or less frequently, Vincent noted. Now, it’s putting them front and center.\n\nM&M's packaging circa 2004. Stephen Chernin/Getty Images\n\nCurrently, there are two female characters and four male ones. Adding another couple of female characters to balance out the ratio is possible, said Vincent, but there are “implications” for the product itself. Namely, M&Ms would have to add new permanent colors to its mix.\n\nThe solution, then, was to give the female Green and Brown a promotion. They’ll have more prominent placement in ads, with the aim of “a little bit more gender balance,” said Vincent.\n\nM&Ms is using these changes to try to signal its brand identity to customers, who are increasingly drawn to brands they feel align with their own values. “It gives us a good platform to talk about the whole idea around belonging,” Vincent said.\n\nThe company is also is placing more “focus on the characters as it relates to the total brand, and then building ourselves a platform to be able to advocate and talk about this idea,” he added.\n\nOther brands have made adjustments to their logos or mascots to keep them up-to-date. One example is Quaker, which in 2012 altered the face of its mascot like a discreet plastic surgeon. (Quaker is owned by Pepsico (PEP)). Changes included “remov[ing] his double chin and smooth[ing] the rolls and plumpness in his face and neck,” The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The new character’s shoulders are also more visible and his hair shorter, to make him seem more fit, and elongating his neck, the Journal noted.\n\nSome brands like Uncle Ben’s and Aunt Jemima recently have revised their logos, mascots or brand names because of problematic and racist origins.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/01/21/green-mm-candy-new-look-inclusive/6605612001/", "title": "M&Ms characters get new modern look to be more 'inclusive'", "text": "The colorful M&Ms characters that have become the face of the candy brand are getting a new look.\n\nMars Incorporated in a statement announced the makeover as part of a broader push toward inclusivity.

But I'll just continue to let the proceedings play out.”\n\nA huge development for Cleveland's defense:Myles Garrett happy Jadeveon Clowney is back with Browns: 'I told him to get his ass here'\n\nBrowns offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt said Watson has immersed himself in work. He has taken all of the first-team reps in OTAs open to media and even reps with the No. 2 unit. He refused to play for the Texans all last season after requesting a trade in January 2021.\n\n\"A whole year out, there's definitely going to be rust, and you can see it,\" Van Pelt said, \"but he's working through that.”\n\nMeanwhile, the NFL is investigating Watson under its personal conduct policy and could suspend him. Last week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he thought the investigatory period was nearing its end, but that was before the latest lawsuit and the mention of at least one more on the way.\n\nTony Buzbee, the lead attorney for all 23 plaintiffs, told the Associated Press on Tuesday night, “I will be filing a 24th case soon.”\n\nAs it stands, 25 women have accused Watson of sexual misconduct or sexual assault through the judicial system, and 23 of them have sued. Two Texas grand juries combined in March to decline to indict Watson on 10 criminal complaints.\n\n“It isn’t any of my business,\" Garrett said of Watson's legal situation. \"That’s all him and what I see in the media, where he’s pressed by y’all. I try to keep my nose out of it. I don’t try to put my eyes on it. The only thing that matters to me is if he’s playing every game and how we can overcome the … and what we need to do to step up as a defense if he isn’t.”\n\nGarrett left the word suspension unsaid, but he knows the Browns signed Jacoby Brissett this offseason to start in the event Watson is unavailable to play. Josh Dobbs is the No. 3 quarterback.\n\n“We will see how all of it plays out,\" Stefanski said when asked about depth behind Watson being a factor with a potential suspension looming. \"For us, we just try and take information as it comes.”\n\nBaker Mayfield staying away from Browns OTAs awaiting trade\n\nYes, the Browns have Baker Mayfield on the roster, but he's staying away from OTAs as he awaits a trade.\n\n“I think Baker's a very good quarterback and has a good future,” Van Pelt said.\n\nTo be clear, playing Mayfield is not in the organization's plans.\n\n\"I hope the best for [Mayfield], and I hope he moves on and he does well for himself,\" Garrett said. \"I'll never wish ill on anyone who I went up against or played with. He's going to land on his feet.\n\n\"[Watson] is a great playmaker. I think he has a little bit more depth in his game than Baker as far as his athleticism. But I think we can we can achieve a lot with working with each other.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, Watson and his attorneys met with NFL officials for three days in Houston, and Hardin has since said the league wants to interview Watson again. Hardin has also said he thinks the NFL wants to render a decision on whether it will suspend Watson sometime this summer.\n\nBuilding chemistry away from Berea:Browns All-Pro Myles Garrett taking his, teammates' talents 'to Miami to have a good time'\n\nA logical way to view the Browns is the fewer games Watson is suspended, the better chance they will have to make the playoffs and live up to their potential as a Super Bowl contender.\n\n“His physical ability certainly jumps out to you on the field,\" Stefanski said. \"... With how the ball comes out, how quickly it comes out and where his elbow and hand are in relation to that ball coming out, the velocity and all of those types of things, I think it has been impressive to watch this caliber of player be able to get the ball out of his hand quickly and really accurately. As we all know, that's so important.”\n\n\"Everything comes full circle\":David Njoku, Cleveland Browns happy to have future settled\n\nWatson had a pass intercepted Wednesday by safety John Johnson III in a seven-on-seven drill, but the QB's highlight plays in spring practices have been much more common than miscues.\n\n“He's very dynamic,\" Van Pelt said. \"The accuracy and the arm strength are two of the things that stand out the most. His football knowledge is vast. He's learning our system as we go, but you can tell he's got a lot of football experience in his body. He's fun to watch, and this is just in settings of controlled pockets. But going back and watching the tape, he's obviously a tremendous player outside the pocket as well when he extends plays.\n\n\"I do [think his game is comparable to that of Green Bay Packers star Aaron Rodgers]. His ability to escape is top notch, elite in the league, and his ability to make plays outside the pocket is up there, too. So there's some similarities.”\n\nThe Browns just need Watson on the field, and, well, that could be complicated.\n\nNate Ulrich can be reached at nulrich@thebeaconjournal.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/11/15/sesame-street-adds-new-character-asian-american-muppet-ji-young/8621812002/", "title": "'Sesame Street' adds new character: Asian American muppet Ji-Young", "text": "Terry Tang\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWhat's in a name? Well, for Ji-Young, the newest muppet resident of \"Sesame Street,\" her name is a sign she was meant to live there.\n\n\"So, in Korean traditionally the two syllables they each mean something different and Ji means, like, smart or wise. And Young means, like, brave or courageous and strong,\" Ji-Young explained during a recent interview. \"But we were looking it up and guess what? Ji also means sesame.\"\n\nAt only 7 years old, Ji-Young is making history as the first Asian American muppet in the \"Sesame Street\" canon. She is Korean American and has two passions: rocking out on her electric guitar and skateboarding. The children's TV program, which first aired 52 years ago this month, gave The Associated Press a first look at its adorable new occupant.\n\nJi-Young will formally be introduced in \"See Us Coming Together: A Sesame Street Special.\" Simu Liu, Padma Lakshmi and Naomi Osaka are among the celebrities appearing in the special, which will drop Thanksgiving Day on HBO Max, \"Sesame Street\" social media platforms and on local PBS stations.\n\nMore:Billie Eilish, Naomi Osaka, more celebs join 'Sesame Street' for star-studded 52nd season\n\nMore:'SNL' pokes fun at Ted Cruz vs. Big Bird feud in 'Sesame Street' cold open sketch\n\nSome of Ji-Young's personality comes from her puppeteer. Kathleen Kim, 41 and Korean American, got into puppetry in her 30s. In 2014, she was accepted into a \"Sesame Street\" workshop. That evolved into a mentorship and becoming part of the team the following year. Being a puppeteer on a show Kim watched growing up was a dream come true. But helping shape an original muppet is a whole other feat.\n\n\"I feel like I have a lot of weight that maybe I'm putting on myself to teach these lessons and to be this representative that I did not have as a kid,\" Kim said. But fellow puppeteer Leslie Carrara-Rudolph — who performs Abby Cadabby — reminded her, \"It's not about us ... It's about this message.\"\n\nJi-Young's existence is the culmination of a lot of discussions after the events of 2020 — George Floyd's death and anti-Asian hate incidents. Like a lot of companies, \"Sesame Street\" reflected on how it could \"meet the moment,\" said Kay Wilson Stallings, executive vice-president of Creative and Production for Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nSesame Workshop established two task forces — one to look at its content and another to look at its own diversity. What developed was Coming Together, a multi-year initiative addressing how to talk to children about race, ethnicity and culture.\n\nOne result was 8-year-old Tamir. While not the show's first Black muppet, he was one of the first used to talk about subjects like racism.\n\n\"When we knew we were going to be doing this work that was going to focus on the Asian and Pacific Islanders experience, we of course knew we needed to create an Asian muppet as well,\" Stallings said.\n\nThese newer muppets — their personalities and their looks — were remarkably constructed in a matter of a months. The process normally takes at least a couple of years. There are outside experts and a cross-section of employees known as the \"culture trust\" who weigh in on every aspect of a new muppet, Stallings said.\n\nFor Kim, it was crucial that Ji-Young not be \"generically pan-Asian.\n\n\"Because that's something that all Asian Americans have experienced. They kind of want to lump us into this monolithic 'Asian,'\" Kim said. \"So it was very important that she was specifically Korean American, not just like, generically Korean, but she was born here.\"\n\nOne thing Ji-Young will help teach children is how to be a good \"upstander.\" \"Sesame Street\" first used the term on its \"The Power of We\" TV special last year, which featured Tamir.\n\n\"Being an upstander means you point out things that are wrong or something that someone does or says that is based on their negative attitude towards the person because of the color of their skin or the language they speak or where they're from,\" Stallings said. \"We want our audience to understand they can be upstanders.\"\n\nIn \"See Us Coming Together,\" Sesame Street is preparing for Neighbor Day where everyone shares food, music or dance from their culture. Ji-Young becomes upset after a kid, off screen, tells her \"to go back home,\" an insult commonly flung at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. But she feels empowered after Sesame Street's other Asian American residents, guest stars and friends like Elmo assure her that she belongs as much as anyone else.\n\nThe fact that Ji-Young was created to counter anti-Asian sentiment makes her more special to Kim in some ways.\n\n\"I remember like the Atlanta shootings and how terrifying that was for me,\" Kim said. \"My one hope, obviously, is to actually help teach what racism is, help teach kids to be able to recognize it and then speak out against it. But then my other hope for Ji-Young is that she just normalizes seeing different kinds of looking kids on TV.\"\n\nMore:There's been a rise in anti-Asian attacks. Here's how to be an ally to the community.\n\nMore:‘Sesame Street’ to ‘Ridley Jones’: TV shows are teaching kids about LGBTQ issues, diversity\n\nVanessa Leung, co-executive director of Coalition for Asian American Children and Families, is excited about Ji-Young. The organization was not involved in Ji-Young's creation but previously consulted on anti-racism content for Sesame Workshop. It matters when Asian American families, especially with many of them being immigrant families, can see themselves reflected in an institution like \"Sesame Street,\" Leung said.\n\n\"It sparks curiosity and early understanding of the diversity of our community, the beauty in the diversity of our community,\" Leung said.\n\nJi-Young will be heavily present throughout the show's 53rd season next year, Stallings reassured. She also won't just be utilized for content related to racial justice. She will pop up in various digital programs, live-action and animated.\n\nAs the new kid on the street, Ji-Young is looking forward to showing her friends and neighbors aspects of Korean culture such as the food. She loves cooking dishes like tteokbokki (chewy rice cakes) with her halmoni (grandmother). And she already has one \"Sesame Street\" friend who wants a sample.\n\n\"I would love to try it,\" said Ernie, who joined Ji-Young's interview. \"You know, I've tried bulgogi. I really like bulgogi. I'm gonna guess that maybe old buddy Bert has not tried Korean food.\"\n\nHaving already made several famous friends on \"Sesame Street,\" is there anyone Ji-Young still really wants to meet?\n\n\"The Linda Lindas because they're so cool,\" Ji-Young said, referring to the teenage punk rock band. \"And they rock out and they're cool girls and most of them are Asian. They're my heroes. If we can get the Linda Lindas on 'Sesame Street,' I would show them around.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2014/07/31/anson-mount-season-wheels/13437549/", "title": "Anson Mount gears up for Season 4 of 'Hell on Wheels'", "text": "Cindy Watts\n\nciwatts@tennessean.com\n\nActor Anson Mount, who plays lead character Cullen Bohannon in AMC's hit series \"Hell on Wheels,\" is in the midst of what he calls \"crunch week.\"\n\nMount, who grew up in White Bluff, Tenn., near Dickson, is filming the series in Canada, and with the fourth season launching Saturday, he's also busy doing press.

The following post discusses plot points and the ending of “Eternals,” so beware if you haven’t seen it yet.\n\nMarvel’s new “Eternals” introduces 10 new characters into its expansive cinematic universe. But that's not all: It tosses out two more as the credits roll, one played by a pop superstar and the other a two-time Oscar winner.\n\nDirector Chloé Zhao’s “Eternals” (in theaters now) centers on a crew of superheroes – including Angelina Jolie’s goddess of war Thena, Gemma Chan’s matter-manipulator Sersi and Kumail Nanjiani’s energy-tossing Kingo – sent to Earth 7,000 years ago by an all-powerful Celestial named Arishem to protect mankind. The Eternals broke up after centuries together and have a reunion in present day only to find out why they’re really here: to prepare for the emergence of a Celestial seeded deep within Earth that will birth a new galaxy yet wipe out the entire planet.\n\n'Eternals':How the new film breaks the Marvel superhero mold as 'a love letter to Earth and humanity'\n\nAfter also finding out that they’ve been unknowingly doing this job throughout the universe for millions of years, our heroes – following the deaths of Ajak (Salma Hayek) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and betrayal by Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sprite (Lia McHugh) – work in unison to keep the Celestial from rising out of the ocean and save Earth in the process. A ticked-off Arishem absconds with Sersi, Kingo and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), telling the trio that he will examine their memories to determine if humanity should be saved and promises, “I will return in judgment.”\n\nIt's a pretty epic finale that's arguably outdone by two end-credits scenes, which call up a couple of characters from the comic books to add intrigue to the MCU’s future.\n\nReview:Marvel's overstuffed 'Eternals' is a star-studded exercise in superhero excess\n\nHarry Styles makes his Marvel debut as Eros\n\nThe first end-credits scene catches up with Thena, deaf speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and mind-control master Druig (Barry Keoghan), who are on the spaceship Domo headed to tell other Eternals how they’re being used by the Celestials. It’s been weeks since they heard from their friends, so Thena figures Arishem’s involved.\n\nAll of a sudden, a drunk gnome-like dude pops up in the hallway and introduces himself as Pip the Troll (Patton Oswalt). He then proclaims the entrance of the cool and smooth Eternal known as Eros, a royal prince and brother of Thanos from the planet Titan, played by Styles. “Your friends are in big trouble and I know where to find them,” Eros tells them after flirting with Thena a bit.\n\nZhao actually was the one who pitched Marvel on using Eros (aka Starfox in the comics) and Pip in a scene hinting at one direction where a sequel could go. “They remind me of Han and Chewbacca (from 'Star Wars'): space outlaws,” she says. “When we meet Eros, what effect did he have on Thanos and how did he get out of Arishem's grip? Clearly, he's flying free right now. That story interests me greatly.”\n\nThe director had seen Styles' acting debut in 2017's \"Dunkirk\" and “kept tabs on him,” thinking he was an “interesting” actor who could “bring a little bit of themselves into this character.”\n\nNanjiani wasn't in the scene with Styles but the British singer visited the set and hung out with “Eternals” actors at a holiday party thrown by Hayek. “Obviously, he's extremely charming and very, very handsome and that hair – I mean, that hair – but he's just like a normal, very regular guy,” Nanjiani says. “I was a little bit surprised that they picked a massive pop star to be a major part of the MCU going forward, but once I met him and then I saw him onscreen, I understood.”\n\nCome for Black Knight, stay for Blade\n\nSersi’s boyfriend Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) doesn’t get much screen time in \"Eternals\" but at the end, he’s about to tell Sersi something important about his lineage (“It turns out my family history is complicated”) when Arishem arrives and captures Sersi.\n\nThe truth bomb Dane was about to drop probably has something to do with his scene after the credits finish, where he's opening an ancient box with the Ebony Blade inside and a cryptic saying written on it: “Death is my reward.” In the comics, Dane wields the magical sword with a blood curse that turns him into the Avenger called Black Knight. In “Eternals,” though, he’s nervous about even touching it, as it hisses strangely in his office. “I’m sorry, I have to try,” Dane says, reaching out as another voice offscreen warns, “Sure you’re ready for that, Mr. Whitman?”\n\nBefore signing on to “Eternals,” Harington “read up on some of the stuff on the internet” about Black Knight and “that was part of my decision-making process in coming into this,” the “Game of Thrones” star says.\n\nZhao loved Black Knight's Arthurian vibe but also the blood curse aspect. “It's a very interesting aspect of a superhero, the addiction toward power and strength. We've seen that explored in the MCU before, but for Black Knight it's very physical,” she says. \"How do you deal with the responsibility that comes with addiction?”\n\nAnd that unseen figure? None other than Mahershala Ali making his first MCU appearance as Blade, the vampire hunter played by Wesley Snipes for three movies in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s. Marvel announced a new \"Blade\" movie starring Ali was in development at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nZhao points out that Blade’s story also deals with a blood curse – since he’s half-vampire and immortal. “I love Blade, he's one of my favorite superheroes so it's really exciting that the MCU is bringing him back.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/06/19/rita-moreno-west-side-story-remake-steven-spielberg/7727143002/", "title": "Rita Moreno talks 'West Side Story' redo, praises 'fabulous' new Anita", "text": "Rita Moreno almost said no to Steven Spielberg's \"West Side Story\" remake.\n\nThe EGOT winner starred in the original 1961 movie musical, which tells the story of star-crossed lovers caught between rival street gangs the Sharks, who are Puerto Rican, and the Jets, who are white. The film, which is considered one of the greatest movie musicals of all time, took home 10 Academy Awards including best picture.\n\nMoreno, 89, won the best supporting actress Oscar playing Anita, the dynamic and fiercely loyal girlfriend of Sharks leader Bernardo (George Chakiris) and a confidante to his younger sister, Maria (Natalie Wood). But the actress was hesitant when Spielberg called her up and asked her to appear in his new adaptation (in theaters Dec. 10), written by \"Angels in America\" playwright Tony Kushner.\n\n\"I almost wet my knickers. I couldn't believe this was Steven Spielberg on the phone, whom I so admired,\" Moreno told USA TODAY last month, speaking in support of her new documentary \"Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It\" (in theaters now).\n\n\"But then I had the courage to say, 'I don't think I could do a cameo. I think it would be a severe disservice to this movie – it'd be a distraction,' \" she adds. \"And he said, 'No, no, no. This is a real part. Tony Kushner wrote this part for you.' \"\n\nMoreno portrays a new character, Valentina, who is Doc's widow. (In the 1961 movie, Doc, played by Ned Glass, owns a candy store where the Sharks and the Jets hang out.) Valentina is a reworked and expanded version of the Doc character, and sings a rendition of the classic song \"Somewhere\" in the movie's first trailer.\n\nIn addition to the role, Spielberg also made Moreno an executive producer on the film.\n\n\"I felt I had things to tell him about the other production and about Latinos,\" Moreno says. \"He really went to such lengths to make sure he got that right,\" hosting a town hall at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan in late 2018, where he invited feedback from students, faculty and others before making the movie.\n\n\"He said, 'Tell us what you think about \"West Side Story,\" tell us what you think about us doing it again, tell us what you think about the original movie,' \" Moreno says. \"And there were some people who said they were offended by some of the things they saw in the film. First of all, the makeup was kind of one color for the Hispanics, whereas Puerto Ricans are a mélange of French, Spanish Spain, Dutch and Taíno Indian, which is a copper color.\"\n\n'Where is our \"Moonlight\"'?Rita Moreno talks dating Marlon Brando, Latinx representation\n\nMoreno, who was born in Humacao, Puerto Rico, and moved to New York when she was 5, resented producers' decision to darken her skin for the original \"West Side.\" The issue resurfaced on Twitter this past week, when Moreno defended Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose new film \"In the Heights\" has come under fire for its lack of Afro-Latino actors in lead and supporting roles. (Moreno has since apologized, saying, \"I was clearly dismissive of Black lives that matter in our Latin community.\")\n\n\"I remember saying to my makeup man once on the original 'West Side Story,' 'Why do I have to wear such dark makeup? I'm not that color,' \" Moreno says. \"And he literally said to me, 'What, are you a racist?' He really said that and I was so astonished that I shut up, because I didn't know what to say to that. If I said, 'No, I'm not a racist,' I feel he would not believe me, so I let it drop. But it was shocking.\"\n\nAs well as the use of brownface, the first \"West Side\" has been criticized for casting white actors in Hispanic roles and perpetuating stereotypes about Puerto Ricans. But Spielberg and Kushner \"corrected all that stuff,\" Moreno says. In the update, \"every Hispanic (character) is actually Hispanic.\"\n\nThat includes the new Anita, played by Ariana DeBose (Netflix's \"The Prom\"), whose mother is white and father is Afro-Puerto Rican.\n\n\"She was quite nervous to meet me,\" Moreno says of DeBose. \"I watched a lot of the dance rehearsals and she's a ferocious dancer. She's fabulous. And what I love about Steven choosing her is that she's Afro-Puerto Rican.\"\n\nThe stage and screen legend also lavishes praise on \"our beautiful Maria,\" Rachel Zegler. Unlike Wood, who was white, Zegler is of Colombian and Polish descent.\n\n\"Oh, she's lovely,\" Moreno says. \"She's Maria: She's young, she's sweet, she was 17 when we started this, the way Maria is supposed to be. A lot of this stuff is so true to what it was meant to be.

Night Shyamalan that he could take on the pivotal part – Gray serves as the tragic predecessor to Cole Sear (11-year-old Haley Joel Osment), who sees \"dead people.\"\n\nShyamalan's leap-of-faith casting compelled Wahlberg to take an all-consuming journey, losing 43 pounds, to enter Gray's disturbed mindset.\n\nAs \"The Sixth Sense\" turns 20 on Aug. 6, the three-minute Gray scene remains utterly unforgettable, more so in light of how perfecting it haunted Wahlberg.\n\n\"This was a game-changer for me. Every day for years people would say, 'Dude, I didn't know that was you,' \" says \"Blue Bloods\" star Wahlberg, now 49. \"At that time, I did exactly what I needed to do for the role. I had to look like I was going through hell. I went to a really dark place.\"\n\nHere's Wahlberg's story:\n\nMore M. Night Shyamalan: Best movies to watch\n\nHe cried when he read the 'Sixth Sense' script\n\nWahlberg, who starred as a kidnapper in 1996's \"Ransom,\" picked up the \"Sixth Sense\" script during a 1998 flight and was consumed as he turned the pages. \"I totally started crying on the plane,\" he says. But he was convinced there was not a part for him, especially not heroin-abusing, emaciated Gray.\n\n\"Nothing about me was right for the part, except for my total enthusiasm for the script,\" says Wahlberg, who was too old for the character and too physically fit. (\"I was really working out at the time.\") But he flew to New York City to meet with Shyamalan, even just to profess his script love.\n\nThe director calculated that conceivably Gray could be 20, a workable number. After another meeting six months later he offered Wahlberg the part. When his agent balked at the low pay offer for the day of filming, Wahlberg overruled him.\n\n\"I said, 'I don’t care, I’d do it for free,' \" says Wahlberg. \"So I took the part and I subsequently fired my manager for telling me to pass.\"\n\nWahlberg wanted to play Vincent nude\n\nDuring a film workshop with Willis and Olivia Williams (Malcolm's wife, Anna), Wahlberg proposed playing Gray nude rather than the goth clothing detailed in the script.\n\n\"If Vincent is coming to stop his suffering and end his own life, then why is he wearing anything? To me, he strips down and is in the bathroom fully naked, clothes on the floor,\" says Wahlberg. \"Bruce thought that was awesome and pitched the idea to M. Night, who was like, 'That's insane. I love it.' \"\n\nWahlberg now had to fully look the part. \"I had to become emaciated and change my physical appearance.\"\n\nThe actor went mad method preparing\n\nWahlberg left his then-wife, Kimberly Fey, and two kids, moving to a sparse New York City apartment to get into the Vincent Gray mindset, bringing no credit cards.\n\n\"I starved myself. I would fast for two days then only eat steamed cabbage and drink beet juice. I would chew gum all day and I would literally walk around the streets to burn thousands of calories. I didn’t shower for weeks,\" says Wahlberg. \"I just wasn’t taking care of myself and I was a loner. That was as close as I could come to this guy. I definitely had to suffer in the only way I could.\"\n\n\"I was so hungry. I was depressed,\" he says. \"I cut off my life to get ready for the role.\"\n\nFive weeks later, he showed up to \"The Sixth Sense\" set having dropped 43 pounds to a scary 139. \"I passed Night and he didn’t recognize me. He just walked right past,\" says Wahlberg.\n\nSent to wardrobe, the actor found out that the film would be rated PG-13, so that would require clothes after all.\n\n\"I was like 'Oh (expletive), I just lost 40 (expletive) pounds. And now I have to just wear clothes.' I was so conflicted,\" says Wahlberg. He struck a quick compromise: wearing Vincent's \"tidy whiti\" underwear.\n\n\"I asked to make (the underwear) look like I hadn’t changed them in, like, two years,\" he says. \"They soiled them up. That became the wardrobe.\"\n\nThe scene wowed Willis, Shyamalan\n\nShooting the first take where Vincent confronts his former doctor, Wahlberg was told to cut before Vincent's final act – putting the gun to his own head. But \"out of my mind\" in emotion, he pulled off the whole scene. To perfection.\n\n\"I fell on the floor, and I remember Bruce was like, 'Whoa!' and I was bawling my eyes out. M. Night came running over and was hugging me. He was like, 'That was so unbelievable.' I was thinking that I’m done. And M. Night was like, 'OK. Can you do it again?' I was like, 'What?' \"\n\nIn his consuming preparation, Wahlberg had forgotten the filmmaking process, which required a full day of specialty shots. \"I thought I had to nail it in one shot,\" says Wahlberg. \"But I had, like, eight hours of work ahead of me.\"\n\nHe pushed through and Willis gave a speech thanking him at the end of the day. Wahlberg still looks in awe at pictures from that time. (\"I looked like a crazy person.\")\n\nHe has never had to dig that deep for a part since. But Vincent Gray lives on with \"The Sixth Sense.\"\n\n\"The movie is such a great source of pride for me. Not just my work but to be part of that group,\" says Wahlberg of the film that would go on to earn six Academy Award nominations. \"Everyone brought it so hard for that movie.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/05"}]}

Arden S. Barnes/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe non-volley zone, or ‘kitchen’, is what gives pickleball much of its distinctiveness.\n\nIt minimizes running, allowing older players to be just as competitive as younger, fitter players and diminishes the role of power so that children can play alongside adults.\n\nPickleball’s popularity has skyrocketed in North America, partly driven by the Covid-19 pandemic as it offers a safe, socially distanced form of exercise.\n\nIt had originally found a solid base among retirement communities where it was beloved for its sociable aspect, moderate exercise, and for simply being fun.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2021, however, USA Pickleball membership nearly doubled and the organization estimates that 4.8 million Americans now play the sport.\n\nMuch of this expansion has been concentrated outside pickleball’s traditional demographic – the fastest rate of increase was among players under 24 from 2020 to 2021 driven by the height of lockdown when portable pickleball nets temporarily sold out as people set up the small courts in driveways and gardens.", "authors": ["Ben Morse Issy Ronald", "Ben Morse", "Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/penguins/2021/11/29/penguins-sale-red-sox-owners-reach-agreement-buy-nhl-team/8794681002/", "title": "Penguins sale: Red Sox owners reach agreement to buy NHL team", "text": "Associated Press\n\nPITTSBURGH – Fenway Sports Group has reached an agreement with the Pittsburgh Penguins that would give the conglomerate controlling interest in one of the NHL’s marquee franchises.\n\nThe Penguins announced Monday that the two sides have come to terms on a deal, which would need to be approved by the NHL’s Board of Governors.

CEO David Morehouse, general manager Ron Hextall, president of hockey operations Brian Burke and head coach Mike Sullivan will all remain in their current positions.\n\n“The Pittsburgh Penguins are a premier National Hockey League franchise with a very strong organization, a terrific history and a vibrant, passionate fan base,” FSG Chairman Tom Werner said in a statement. “We will work diligently to continue building on the remarkable Penguins’ tradition of championships and exciting play.”\n\nPittsburgh has reached the playoffs in 15 consecutive years, the longest active streak in major North American professional sports. The streak includes three championships and another trip to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\n\"As the Penguins enter a new chapter, I will continue to be as active and engaged with the team as I always have been and look forward to continuing to build on our success with our incoming partners at FSG,” Lemieux said. “They have an organizational philosophy that mirrors the approach that worked so well for Ron and me over the past 22 years.”\n\nThe Penguins have steadied themselves following a bumpy start to the 2021-22 season. Pittsburgh has won five of six heading into a four-game road trip that starts Monday in Calgary, Alberta.\n\nBurke and Hextall addressed the players about the sale being finalized before the team skated in Calgary on Monday morning.\n\nSullivan, a Massachusetts native who attended high school and college in Boston, had a brief conversation with the new ownership group and called the sale a “win-win\" for all involved.\n\n“These guys have a proven track record,” Sullivan said. “I think they’re fans first and foremost. They love sports and I think they’re in it for the long haul.”\n\nThe Penguins were on the brink of collapse when Lemieux — one of the greatest players in NHL history during a 17-year career — teamed up with Burkle to keep the franchise afloat. Their rebuild was helped greatly by selecting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury and centers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby in successive drafts from 2003-05, the core that helped Pittsburgh return to prominence and eventually a Stanley Cup in 2009.\n\nThe Penguins moved across the street from the Mellon (Civic) Arena to PPG Paints Arena in 2010 while becoming one of the most sought-after tickets in the NHL. Pittsburgh sold out 633 straight games from Feb. 14, 2007, to October 16, 2021. The streak ended on Oct. 19 when Dallas visited, with both Crosby and Malkin out of the lineup.\n\nFSG had been looking to add another major sports franchise to its portfolio. This spring, it brought on as an investor Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, who has said he ultimately wants to own an NBA team. FSG received a reported $750 million investment from RedBird Capital Partners in March that valued the sports conglomerate at $7.35 billion.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen in Boston contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2014/07/07/coro-star-free-agents-bledsoe-best-option/12324023/", "title": "After star free agents, Eric Bledsoe is Phoenix Suns' best option", "text": "Paul Coro\n\nPNI\n\nIf LeBron%2C Carmelo and Bosh sign elsewhere%2C the Suns have the next-best option under control.\n\nChanning Frye has agreed to a four-year contract with the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe Suns%27 NBA Summer League team begins two-a-day practices today.\n\nWith a week passing as the Suns painted a dreamscape of a LeBron James-and-friend desert landing, the fear is that the likeliness of missing James and the resulting lost time will cause the Suns to miss out on their second-best opportunity.\n\nEven if James' \"The Decision II\" turns into \"The Indecision\" by dragging into next week, the Suns' second-best opportunity would remain.\n\nIt won't be as sexy or franchise-changing as James in purple and orange, but it won't be frivolous or impulsive, either.\n\nStaying the course might just be the next-best option to adding the world's best player. If James picks Cleveland or Miami, Carmelo Anthony picks New York or the Los Angeles Lakers, and Chris Bosh picks Miami or Houston, the Suns will have control of arguably the next-best free agent, Eric Bledsoe.\n\nThey also can keep most of their massive salary-cap space to be the biggest player if a star goes on the trade block this summer or during the upcoming season (you might have heard a thing or two about Kevin Love's rumored availability). If not, they remain a major trade player at next year's draft with three first-round picks and cap space, which could even be saved for 2015 free agency for Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kawhi Leonard or, ahem, Goran Dragic.\n\nThe Suns had a successful season, with many players developing into major roles for the first time and projected to grow more. The Western Conference is loaded, even with quality lottery teams. Automatic progress is no guarantee, especially after losing a key piece such as Channing Frye. But Markieff Morris had starter-quality results, except from the 3-point line, last season to reduce that hit, and Archie Goodwin's promising flashes and Alex Len's first healthy offseason bode well for some rotation boost.\n\nFor those who often worry about attracting high-profile players to Phoenix through free agency, that problem is eliminated when the Suns trade for them (like with Bledsoe) or draft them (which General Manager Ryan McDonough says is the best way to build a team).\n\nSummer Suns start practice\n\nThe Suns' NBA Summer League team will go through two-a-day practices today through Thursday in Phoenix before playing games in Las Vegas on Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday. A 24-team tournament will follow.\n\nThe now-official roster includes Len, Goodwin, Miles Plumlee, Dionte Christmas, T.J. Warren, Tyler Ennis, Alec Brown, Alex Oriakhi, Seth Curry, Elias Harris, Taylor Braun and David Stockton. Plumlee, Len and Goodwin have guaranteed contracts. As first-round picks, Warren and Ennis will have guarantees once they sign; and Brown, a second-round pick, is expected to play in Europe. The rest are vying for spots with the Suns or auditioning for other teams.\n\nThe summer coaching staff is headed by Suns assistant Mike Longabardi with assistance from Suns player-development coaches Corey Gaines and Irv Roland and new D-League affiliate coach Nate Bjorkgren.\n\nReach Coro at paul.coro @arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-2470.

He will be entering his fifth year in the league.\n\nThe Blazers have the cap space to make the massive offer after losing All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nSuns, Teletovic reach 1-year deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says the Phoenix Suns have reached a one-year, $5.5 million contract with forward Mirza Teletovic.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract has yet to be signed.\n\nThe acquisition of Teletovic is the latest in a series of moves by the Suns to try to bolster their outside shooting. The 6-foot-9 power forward shot 39% from 3-point range for Brooklyn in 2013-14. It dropped to 32% last season, which was cut short by blood clots in his lungs.\n\nTeletovic tweeted a photo of himself in a Suns uniform Thursday, shortly after the Nets reportedly withdrew a qualifying offer of one year for $4.2 million.\n\nBrazilian point guard goes to Utah\n\nThe Utah Jazz have signed point guard Raul Neto to a multi-year contract.\n\nThe team announced the deal Thursday.\n\nThe Brazilian was selected in the second round of the 2013 draft by the Atlanta Hawks. The Jazz traded the Brooklyn Nets' 2015 second-round pick for Neto during that draft.\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 172-pounder averaged 8.9 points, 3.9 assists, 2.1 rebounds and 1.2 steals for Universidad Catolica De Murica of the Liga ACP in Spain last season. He was on the Brazil national team that played in the 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2012 Olympics.\n\nThe Jazz now have four point guards on the roster — Dante Exum, Trey Burke, Bryce Cotton and Neto. It's unlikely all four will be on the roster when the season begins.\n\nLeBron signs up for two more years with Cavs\n\nTwo people familiar with the negotiations say LeBron James has agreed to a one-year, $23 million contract with the Cavaliers for next season. The deal includes a player option for 2016-17.\n\nThe people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday because the contract has not been signed. James has informed the team he will return.\n\nThe agreement is not a surprise since James has said he intends to finish his career with Cleveland. He re-signed as a free agent with the Cavaliers last summer after four years in Miami.\n\nThe 30-year-old James led the Cavs to the NBA Finals in his first season back. Cleveland lost in six games to Golden State. James was forced to carry the load after All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving injured his knee in Game 1. Forward Kevin Love was injured earlier in the postseason and missed the finals.\n\nJordan spurns Mavericks for Clippers\n\nDeAndre Jordan has backed out of a verbal agreement to join the Dallas Mavericks and chosen to remain with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nJordan made the switch after a face-to-face meeting at his Houston home with a contingent of Clippers, including Blake Griffin and Paul Pierce, two people with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nThe Clippers announced Jordan's retention late Wednesday and also tweeted \"WE'RE OFFICIALLY CENTERED.\"\n\nIt was a surprising reversal for Jordan, the defensive pillar who agreed to a four-year, $80-million deal with the Mavericks last week. The Clippers can offer a fifth year on a max contract at more than $100 million.\n\nHornets sign free agent point guard Jeremy Lin\n\nCharlotte Hornets signed free agent point guard Jeremy Lin on Thursday in hopes of improving a sagging offense.\n\nTerms of the deal were not released.\n\nThe 6-foot-3 Lin has played in 291 NBA games for the Warriors, Knicks, Rockets and Lakers in five seasons, averaging 11.7 points, 4.8 assists, 2.6 rebounds and 1.3 steals in 26.9 minutes.\n\nThe 26-year-old Lin is expected to backup Kemba Walker in Charlotte and run the second-team offense.\n\nHe's the latest offseason addition as general manager Rich Cho looks to upgrade an offense that finished in the bottom five in the league in almost every major offensive statistical category last season. The team previously acquired Nicolas Batum, Jeremy Lamb and Spencer Hawes in trades and drafted Wisconsin's Frank Kaminsky.\n\nGerald Green agrees to 1-year deal with Heat\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations says shooting guard Gerald Green has agreed a one-year deal to join the Miami Heat.\n\nThe person says Green will sign for $1.4 million. The person spoke to The Associated Press Thursday on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized. It's not expected to be signed before Friday.\n\nGreen spent the past two seasons in Phoenix, and his move to Miami will reunite him with newly resigned Heat point guard Goran Dragic. Green has averaged 10.2 points in 428 regular-season games with the Suns, Boston, Minnesota, Houston, New Jersey and Indiana, mostly coming off the bench.\n\nGreen has made 341 shots from 3-point range over the last two seasons, the ninth-most in the NBA during that span.\n\nRaptors sign Carroll, Joseph, Scola\n\nToronto signed forward DeMarre Carroll on Thursday, a week after the forward originally announced his deal with the Raptors on Twitter.\n\nThe team held a news conference for the 28-year-old Carroll, who agreed to a four-year deal worth $60 million.\n\nCarroll, who averaged 12.6 points and 5.3 rebounds in 70 games for the Atlanta Hawks last season, was touted as one of the top players available at his position. Carroll had been a top free agent target of the Pistons.\n\nThe Raptors also signed Canadian guard Cory Joseph and Luis Scola and waived oft-traded guard Luke Ridnour on Thursday.\n\nJoseph, the Pickering, Ontario, native agreed to a four-year contract. The 23-year-old spent his first four NBA seasons with the San Antonio Spurs, helping them win the title in 2014.\n\nJoseph played in 79 games this past season with the Spurs, averaging 6.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists.\n\nSan Antonio selected Joseph 29th overall at the 2011 draft, out of Texas.\n\nLopez, Young stay with Nets, Robinson, Larkin join them\n\nBrook Lopez has been with the Nets his whole career and didn't want to look anywhere else. Thaddeus Young has been here just a few months and felt the same way.\n\nLopez and Young said Thursday they both quickly committed to re-sign with Brooklyn, wanting to stay together after they played well down the stretch in leading the Nets into the playoffs last season.\n\nLopez has been a Net for seven seasons, dating to their time in New Jersey. The 27-year-old center averaged 19.7 points and 9.2 rebounds after the All-Star break, which is about the time Young arrived in a trade from Minnesota.\n\nLopez and Young were joined at a Barclays Center news conference by newcomers Thomas Robinson and Shane Larkin. General manager Billy King said he called both players shortly after free agency opened on July 1 as he looked for youth and athleticism that the team sorely needs.\n\nLarkin played last season for the New York Knicks and could have a larger role if the Nets are able to trade either Deron Williams or Joe Johnson to trim their payroll. Robinson was nearly a Net last season, but the 76ers claimed him off waivers just before the Nets were able to sign him.\n\nClippers sign free agent forward Wes Johnson\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have signed free agent forward Wes Johnson, who played for the Lakers last season.\n\nHe averaged 9.9 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 76 games, including 59 starts for the other NBA team that plays in Staples Center.\n\nJohnson's five-year NBA career includes stints with Minnesota and Phoenix.\n\nThe Timberwolves drafted him with the fourth pick in the first round of the 2010 draft. He played two years at Iowa State before transferring to Syracuse, where he was the Big East player of the year in his lone season with the Orange.\n\nHawks finalize trade for Spurs' Splitter\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks have finalized their trade with San Antonio for Tiago Splitter to add depth to center and power forward.\n\nSplitter averaged 8.3 points, 5.3 rebounds in his first five NBA seasons with the Spurs.\n\nAtlanta sent the draft rights to Georgios Printezis and a future second-round pick to San Antonio.\n\nTo make room for Splitter, the Hawks requested waivers on former Pistons forward Austin Daye, who was signed to a multiyear contract in April.\n\nThe 6-foot-11, 245-pound Splitter is expected to back up center Al Horford (Grand Ledge) and forward Paul Millsap. He has two years remaining on his contract and will earn a total of $16.8 million.\n\nMagic sign Watson, send O'Quinn to Knicks in sign-and-trade\n\nOrlando Magic front office officials promised to be active in free agency this off-season and began the signing period Thursday by acquiring free agent veteran point guard C.J. Watson, and sending big man Kyle O'Quinn to the New York Knicks in a sign-and-trade\n\nTerms of the Watson deal were not released. But in the O'Quinn deal the Magic will receive cash and the option to swamp second-round draft picks with the Knicks in 2019.\n\nThe 31-year-old Watson, who will compete to serve as the primary backup to second-year guard Elfrid Payton, is entering his ninth NBA season. He spent the past two in Indiana and averaged 10 points and 3.6 assists in 57 appearances last season.\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press last week that restricted free agent forward Tobias Harris had agreed to sign a four-year, $64 million deal to remain in Orlando. In addition, free agent big man Jason Smith tweeted Wednesday that he had also agreed to a new contract with the Magic.\n\nSuns reach deals with SG Weems, point guard Price\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says the Phoenix Suns have reached contract agreements with shooting guard Sonny Weems and point guard Ronnie Price.\n\nWeems, an all-Euroleague first-team selection in 2013-14, gets a two-year, $5.8-million deal with the second year a team option. He will make just over $2.8 million this coming season.\n\nPrice agreed Wednesday to a one-year deal at the veteran's minimum of $1.5 million.\n\nVillanueva going back to Mavs\n\nCharlie Villanueva will return for a second season in Dallas after earning a reserve role as a 3-point threat and making the playoffs for the first time in his 10-year career.\n\nVillanueva announced his decision Tuesday on Twitter. He reportedly will get a one-year contract for the veteran minimum of $1.5 million after making the roster on a non-guaranteed deal out of training camp last season.\n\nThe 30-year-old Villanueva averaged 6.3 points and 2.3 rebounds in 64 games for the Mavericks, including one start. He was fourth on the team with 83 3-pointers.\n\nThe former top-10 pick started his career with a season in Toronto before spending three years with Milwaukee and five in Detroit. Villanueva's career averages are 10.9 points and 4.8 rebounds.\n\nFormer Spartan Anderson going to D.C.\n\nFree-agent shooting guard Alan Anderson has agreed to a $4 million, one-year contract with the Washington Wizards that should become official later this week.\n\nAnderson's agent, Mark Bartelstein, confirmed the terms of the deal on Tuesday.\n\nTeams cannot sign deals with free agents until Thursday.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Anderson played the past two years with the Brooklyn Nets, averaging 7.4 points and 2.8 rebounds last season.\n\nHe has spent a total of six seasons with three teams in the NBA, but also has played professionally overseas.\n\nAnderson, 32, represents the latest new face for a Wizards team that reached the second round of the playoffs last season. Washington also is adding Gary Neal via free agency, Jared Dudley via a trade, and Kelly Oubre Jr. via the draft.\n\nWarriors trade Lee to Boston for Wallace\n\nA person with knowledge of the deal says the Golden State Warriors have agreed to trade former All-Star forward David Lee to the Boston Celtics for Gerald Wallace.\n\nThe person spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the trade can't become official until the moratorium on NBA business ends Thursday. ESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nLee injured his left hamstring in the final preseason game and his role diminished with the emergence of Michigan State alumnus Draymond Green, the runner-up for defensive player of the year. The NBA champion Warriors have been looking to trade Lee this summer to limit the team's luxury tax hit next season.\n\nLee is due about $15.4 million in the final year of his contract.\n\n2 more years for Garnett with Timberwolves\n\nKevin Garnett is returning for season No. 21.\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the discussions tells The Associated Press that Garnett has agreed to terms on a two-year contract to remain in Minnesota. The person spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nGarnett starred in Minnesota for the first 12 years of his career before being traded to Boston in 2007. He returned last February in a trade deadline deal with the Brooklyn Nets and turned 39 in May.\n\nAfter an emotional homecoming, Garnett played in just five games the remainder of the season due to knee issues.\n\nNBA contracts cannot be signed until Thursday, per league rules.\n\nJazz agrees to terms with free agent Joe Ingles\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press the Utah Jazz have verbally agreed to a free agent deal with Joe Ingles. Details of the deal were not immediately available.\n\nThe 6-foot-8, 216-pound wing started 32 games as a rookie after Alec Burks was lost for the season with a shoulder injury. He averaged 5.0 points, 2.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 79 games. Many believed the Jazz signed Ingles, 27, last year to mentor fellow Australian rookie Dante Exum, but he proved to have value in the rotation.\n\nIngles is the first free agent to reach agreement with the Jazz this off-season.\n\nThe deal cannot be signed until Thursday, per league rules.\n\nMarc Gasol sticks with Grizzlies\n\nMarc Gasol is staying right at home in Memphis.\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the agreement tells The Associated Press that the All-Star center has agreed to terms on a five-year max deal worth more than $100 million to stay with the Grizzlies. The person spoke Monday on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nThe 7-foot-1 Spaniard is coming off the best season of his seven-year NBA career, earning a starting spot in the NBA All-Star game. He also became the first Grizzlies' player voted to the All-NBA first team .\n\nGasol averaged 17.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.62 blocks this past season.\n\nThe contract cannot be signed until Thursday.\n\nWest takes chance to win with Spurs over more money\n\nDavid West is sacrificing millions to chase that elusive championship.\n\nA person with knowledge of the deal tells The Associated Press that the veteran forward is taking a one-year, minimum salary contract worth $1.4 million to join the San Antonio Spurs. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nWest walked away from a $12 million pay day with the Indiana Pacers to chase a title with the Spurs in his 13th NBA season. He spent the previous four seasons in Indiana.\n\nHe joins a team that added All-Star power forward LaMarcus Aldridge and re-signed Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green to big-money deals to make a run at the franchise's sixth championship.\n\nThe deal cannot be signed until Thursday.\n\nWilliams back with Cavs\n\nMo Williams is heading back to Cleveland to team up with LeBron James again.\n\nWilliams tweeted on Monday night that he is going back to the Cavaliers, where he was an All-Star playing alongside James in 2009. Terms of the deal were not immediately available.\n\nWilliams started last season with the Minnesota Timberwolves and was traded to the Charlotte Hornets, where he averaged 17.2 points in 27 games.\n\nThe Cavaliers were in need of a quality backup point guard with the ability to score behind starter Kyrie Irving.\n\nWilliams spent two and a half seasons with the Cavaliers before being traded to the Clippers in 2011.\n\nThe contract cannot be signed until Thursday.\n\nBarbosa returning to champs\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says the Golden State Warriors and veteran guard Leandro Barbosa have agreed to a $2.5 million, one-year deal.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on Monday night on condition of anonymity because contracts can't be completed until the NBA's moratorium on free agency ends Thursday. ESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nThe 32-year-old combo guard is one of coach Steve Kerr's favorites from their time together in Phoenix, where Kerr was the general manager. Barbosa averaged 7.1 points and 1.5 assists in 14.9 minutes last season with the NBA champion Warriors.\n\nBarbosa also played for Toronto, Indiana, Boston and Phoenix again in 2013-14 before joining Golden State last summer. He served as a reserve behind MVP Stephen Curry and All-Star guard Klay Thompson.\n\nBarea still in Dallas\n\nJ.J. Barea, 31, is returning to Dallas after considering a move to Miami in free agency.\n\nA person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on Monday that Barea has agreed to terms with the Mavericks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because players can't sign contracts until Thursday.\n\nThe deal is reportedly for two years and $5.6 million. The 6-foot guard told a newspaper in his native Puerto Rico that he was rejoining Dallas.\n\nThe Mavericks brought back Barea early last season when Minnesota bought out the remainder of the four-year deal he signed after playing a key role in the Mavericks' run to the NBA championship in 2011.\n\nTimberwolves agree to terms with Euro MVP Bjelica\n\nAfter a quiet start to free agency, the Minnesota Timberwolves are on the board with some much-needed experience for their bench.\n\nThe Timberwolves agreed to terms with Euroleague MVP Nemanja Bjelica, adding their 27-year-old second-round draft pick from 2010 to a promising young roster.\n\nThe three-year contract is worth $11.7 million, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press, and cannot be signed until Thursday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nAfter adding a pair of 19-year-olds in the draft — No. 1 overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns and No. 24 pick Tyus Jones — to a team already overflowing with youngsters like 20-year-olds Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine, 22-year-old Shabazz Muhammad and 24-year-old Ricky Rubio, the Wolves were in need of more experience.\n\nHe averaged 11.9 points and 8.6 rebounds for Fenerbache in Turkey last season.\n\nCasspi sticks with Kings\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says the Sacramento Kings and swingman Omri Casspi have reached an agreement on a $6-million, two-year deal.\n\nThe person spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because contracts can't be completed until the moratorium on NBA free agency ends Thursday.\n\nCasspi has averaged 7.9 points, 3.9 rebounds and 20.8 minutes per game in six seasons. The Kings drafted the Israeli-born Casspi 23rd overall in 2009.\n\nHe spent his first two years with Sacramento before playing two seasons with Cleveland and one with Houston. The Kings signed Casspi again last summer after he was waived by New Orleans.\n\nCasspi had several big games after George Karl took over as coach in February.\n\nLakers plan to sign Williams, Bass\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers say they plan to sign guard Lou Williams, last season's Sixth Man of the Year, and forward Brandon Bass.\n\nWilliams averaged a career-high 15.5 points and helped Toronto win a franchise-record 49 games in 2014-15, his lone season there. The Lakers have upgraded their guard rotation by adding Williams after drafting Ohio State's D'Angelo Russell with the No. 2 pick.\n\nBass averaged 10.6 points while playing all 82 games for Boston.\n\nDeals can't be signed until Thursday, but general manager Mitch Kupchak says Sunday in a release that the Lakers are negotiating with both players and intend to sign them once the free agent moratorium ends.\n\nKings nab Koufos on 4-year deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the deal says the Sacramento Kings and center KostaKoufos have agreed to a $33 million, four-year contract.\n\nThe person, who spoke to The Associated Press on Saturday night on condition of anonymity because contracts can't be completed until next week, said the fourth year is a player option. ESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nKoufos played behind Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph in Memphis the past two seasons. In Sacramento, the 7-footer is another big man for a front court that includes All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins and sixth overall draft pick Willie Cauley-Stein.\n\nKoufos has averaged 5.2 points and 5.3 rebounds in seven seasons. He also has played for Utah, Minnesota and Denver — where he spent parts of three years under current Kings coach George Karl.\n\nHarris stays in Orlando\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says Tobias Harris has agreed to sign a new contract to remain with the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe person says the deal for Harris — a restricted free agent — is for four years and $64 million. The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because contract can't be officially signed until next week.\n\nThe 22-year-old forward completed his fourth NBA season and second full year in Orlando after coming over in a trade with Milwaukee in 2013. He averaged a career-high 17.1 points last season, while also shooting a career-best 36 percent from the 3-point line.\n\nThe move keeps intact a young Magic team that features eight players under age 25.\n\nAldridge picks Spurs\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge got the answers he needed from the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nAnd the Spurs apparently got the answer they wanted.\n\nEnding a frantic few days of courtship — and perhaps cementing the Spurs as the preseason favorites to win yet another NBA title — Aldridge announced Saturday that he will sign with San Antonio and align with Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard to form what would figure to be among the league's most formidable frontcourts.\n\n\"I'm happy to say I'm going home to Texas and will be a Spur!!\" Aldridge, a Dallas native, posted to his verified Twitter account. \"I'm excited to join the team and be close to my family and friends.\"\n\nAldridge, who spent his first nine seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, will be eligible to sign his new deal Thursday.\n\nAldridge met with several teams, all who were offering what the Spurs did: $80 million for four years.\n\nPelicans bring back Cunningham\n\nPeople familiar with the negotiations say the New Orleans Pelicans and forward Dante Cunningham have agreed on a three-year contract extension worth about $9 million.\n\nThe people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Saturday because the free-agent contract, which cannot officially be signed until July 9, has not been announced.\n\nThe Pelicans first signed the 6-foot-8 Cunningham as a free agent last December. He played in 66 regular season games, starting 27, and averaged 5.2 points and 3.9 rebounds in 25 minutes.\n\nThe 28-year-old Cunningham was relied upon mostly for his defense. His contract includes a third-year player option. His return gives the Pelicans nearly all of their regulars back for next season except guard Norris Cole, who remains a restricted free agent.\n\nRondo, Belinelli headed to Sacramento\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the deal says the Sacramento Kings and point guard Rajon Rondo have agreed to a one-year deal for $10 million.\n\nRondo's addition comes hours after the Kings and shooting guard Marco Belinelli agreed to a $19 million, three-year contract Friday, another person familiar with that deal said. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because contracts can't be completed until the moratorium on free agency ends Thursday.\n\nRondo is trying to recover from a brief but tumultuous tenure in Dallas. He was benched several times by Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle after coming over in a December trade from Boston, where he helped the Celtics win the 2008 title and return to the NBA Finals in 2010.\n\nBelinelli has played the past two seasons with San Antonio, helping the Spurs win the NBA championship in 2014.\n\nDerrick Williams goes to Knicks\n\nDerrick Williams is headed to New York looking for another chance to fulfill the promise he once showed.\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the deal tells The Associated Press that the former No. 2 overall draft pick has agreed to terms with the Knicks on a two-year deal worth $10 million. The person requested anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nWilliams was picked behind Kyrie Irving by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2011 draft. But he never gained a foothold in Minnesota and was traded to Sacramento in 2013.\n\nHe averaged 8.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in 74 games for the Kings last year.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement, which cannot be signed until July 9.\n\nMr. Neal goes to Washington\n\nFree-agent shooting guard Gary Neal has agreed to a $2.1 million, one-year contract with the Washington Wizards.\n\nAgent David Bauman says Neal wanted to join a playoff team after finishing last season with the league-worst Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe 30-year-old Neal is returning to his roots: He was born in Maryland and played college basketball at Towson.\n\nHe has averaged 9.9 points and 38.1-percent shooting on 3-point attempts during five NBA season with four franchises. He was traded to Minnesota by Charlotte in February.\n\nBy agreeing to a one-year deal with Washington, Neal gets a chance to increase his value with a strong season and return to the free-agent market.\n\nWade sticks with Heat\n\nAfter 12 years with the Miami Heat, Dwyane Wade needed a reminder of how much the franchise valued him.\n\nOnce he found out, any chance of him leaving vanished.\n\nWade accepted a $20-million, one-year deal on Thursday to stay with the Heat next season, ending his latest foray into free agency and wrapping up a weekslong saga that had him seriously wondering about leaving for the first time. A pair of conversations, first with Heat CEO Nick Arison and then another with managing general partner Micky Arison, reminded Wade of what he meant to the team and from there it was a matter of just making numbers work.\n\nPer NBA rules, the Heat could not comment other than saying that they intend to enter into a contract with Wade once the NBA moratorium period ends. Wade cannot sign his new deal until July 9.\n\nDuncan won't retire, still a Spur\n\nTim Duncan is returning to San Antonio for a 19th season.\n\nDuncan, 39, tells the San Antonio Express-News that \"I'll be on the court next year.\" Until Duncan made his announcement Thursday, there was speculation that he could call it a career after the Spurs lost to the Los Angeles Clippers in a thrilling seven-game series in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nMany expected him to return, particularly since he was coming off such a strong season. Duncan averaged 13.9 points, 3.0 assists and 2.0 blocks and earned third team All-NBA and second team All-Defense honors.\n\nDuncan turned 39 in April and accompanied the Spurs on a recruiting trip for star free agent LaMarcus Aldridge on Wednesday.\n\nThe Spurs are still waiting to hear if Manu Ginobili, another member of the franchise's Big Three with Duncan and Tony Parker, will return next season.\n\nInjured Wes Matthews agrees to sign with Dallas\n\nFree agent guard Wesley Matthews and the Mavericks have agreed on a four-year deal.\n\nA person with knowledge of the deal says Matthews and the Mavericks reached an agreement in principle late Thursday night and will wait on the decision from Jordan, who is apparently choosing between the Mavericks and his original team, the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nMatthews is coming off a ruptured left Achilles tendon sustained in a game against the Mavericks in March. It is unclear if he will be ready to start the season, but the Mavericks targeted him from the beginning of free agency as a potential replacement at shooting guard for Monta Ellis.\n\nMatthews turned down a $64-million, four-year offer from Sacramento.\n\nDudley to Wizards in trade\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations tells the Associated Press that the Washington Wizards are close to acquiring forward Jared Dudley from the Milwaukee Bucks for a future second-round draft pick.\n\nEarlier this week, Dudley decided to exercise his player option for a $4.25-million contract with Milwaukee next season, rather than become a free agent.\n\nThe veteran forward averaged 7.2 points and 3.1 rebounds and made 38.5% of his three-point attempts in 72 games with the Bucks last season.\n\nBlazers reach 5-year max extension with Lilliard\n\nWhen Damian Lillard agreed to a new maximum contract extension with the Trail Blazers on Thursday, it may have been the beginning of a changing of the guard in Portland.\n\nLillard agreed to terms on a five-year contract worth more than $120 million, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told the Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nThe full value of the contract could wind up ranging between $125 million and $129 million and won't be determined until the salary cap is established. That makes it the richest contract in league history for a guard.\n\nEx-Piston Afflalo goes to N.Y.\n\nArron Afflalo is about to team up with Carmelo Anthony again.\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations tells the Associated Press that Afflalo, a former Detroit Pistons guard, has accepted a two-year, $16-million offer from the New York Knicks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no NBA deals can be completed before July 9.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nA shooting guard, Afflalo spent parts of two seasons as Anthony's teammate in Denver. Afflalo also has spent time with Detroit, Orlando and Portland, averaging 11.4 points per game in his first eight NBA seasons.\n\nThe Knicks are coming off of a 17-65 season, the second-worst record in the NBA. Anthony played in only 40 games because of left knee problems.\n\nPelicans, Asik agree on 5-year contract\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations says the New Orleans Pelicans and center Omer Asik have agreed on a five-year contract worth a minimum of $44 million and rising up to $58 million if incentives and benchmarks are met.\n\nThe team will have the option of voiding the final year of the deal.\n\nThe 7-foot Asik, who turns 29 on Saturday, started 76 games and averaged 7.3 points and 9.8 rebounds this season, his first with New Orleans following a trade from Houston.\n\nAsik now returns to a Pelicans front court that feature's All-Star forward Anthony Davis (more below).\n\nThe Pistons were expected to have some interest in Asik.\n\nPacers give Monta Ellis 4 years, $44 million\n\nMonta Ellis has found a new home in Indiana.\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Ellis has agreed to terms with the Pacers on a four-year deal worth $44 million. The deal includes a player option for the final year. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced. The contract cannot be signed until July 9.\n\nEllis averaged 18.9 points and 4.1 assists in his second season with the Dallas Mavericks last year.\n\nEllis only shot 28.5% on three-pointers last year, but his ability to score will help the Pacers, who ranked 24th in scoring last season.\n\nPaul Pierce headed to Clippers\n\nPaul Pierce and Doc Rivers are reuniting.\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations tells The Associated Press that Pierce has agreed to a three-year, $10 million deal to join the Los Angeles Clippers. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because no contracts can be finalized until July 9.\n\nPierce spent this past season with the Washington Wizards, and they wanted him back for a second year. But the lure of going back to Southern California — he went to high school in a Los Angeles suburb — and playing for Rivers again was apparently too strong to ignore.\n\nNext season will be Pierce's 18th, the first 15 with Boston. Rivers coached him for nine of those Boston seasons, and they helped the Celtics win the 2008 NBA title.\n\nAgent: Ed Davis agrees to 3-year, $20M deal with Blazers\n\nEd Davis is leaving Los Angeles for the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nDavis' agent, David Bauman, says his client has agreed to a three-year, $20-million contract to join the Blazers. He averaged 8.3 points and 7.6 rebounds in his first season with the Lakers last year.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding free agent power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, the Blazers grabbed the athletic and versatile Davis to add to a roster in flux. If Aldridge does return, Davis would be a valuable role player off the bench.\n\nIf Aldridge chooses to move elsewhere, Davis could slide into the starting lineup for a role that he has been craving since breaking into the league with Toronto in 2010.\n\nDavis cannot sign his contract until July 9, per league rules.\n\nGrizzlies agree to terms with Brandan Wright\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have agreed to terms with free-agent forward Brandan Wright, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity Wednesday because the deal hasn't been formally announced. Yahoo Sports first reported the deal.\n\nWith teams across the NBA spending or offering huge sums of money on the opening day of free agency, the Grizzlies' deal with Wright looks like a potential bargain. The Grizzlies used their full mid-level exception - three years and about $18 million - to land the 6-foot-10 forward.\n\nThe 27-year-old averaged 7.3 points and 4.3 rebounds this season while spending time with the Dallas Mavericks, Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns. The former lottery pick from North Carolina also has played for the Golden State Warriors and New Jersey Nets since beginning his NBA career in 2007.\n\nCeltics, Amir Johnson agree to $24-million deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says the Boston Celtics have landed Amir Johnson with a two-year deal worth $24 million.\n\nThe veteran power forward and former Piston agreed to leave Toronto and stay within the Atlantic Division on Wednesday.\n\nJohnson averaged 9.3 points and 6.1 rebounds for the Atlantic champions last season, his sixth in Toronto. The 6-foot-9 Johnson began his career in Detroit, where he was a second-round pick in 2005.\n\nHe can now look for minutes in a Boston forward-center rotation that includes Brandon Bass, Jared Sullinger, Kelly Olynyk and Tyler Zeller.\n\nBucks give Middleton 5 years, $70 million\n\nKhris Middleton was a little-known second-round draft pick when he broke into the NBA with the Detroit Pistons in 2012.\n\nThree years later, the versatile forward has become an integral part of a Milwaukee Bucks team on the rise in the Eastern Conference.\n\nMiddleton has agreed to terms on a five-year contract worth $70 million, a person with direct knowledge of the agreement told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nMiddleton played in 27 games as a rookie with the Pistons in 2012-13 and was almost an afterthought when he was packaged with Brandon Knight and sent to the Bucks for point guard Brandon Jennings in Middleton's second season. His scoring average rose from 6.1 points as a rookie to 12.1 in his second year, but his breakout season came in Year 3.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Middleton emerged as an essential two-way forward, teaming with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Michael Carter-Williams and a herd of young Bucks that range from 6-6 to 6-11 and give coach Jason Kidd a versatile core capable of locking down on defense.\n\nMiddleton averaged 13.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and shot better than 40% from three-point range last year to cement himself as a major part of the team's plans. So with the salary cap set to skyrocket next season when the new television contracts kick in, the Bucks wasted little time in locking up a deal with one of their young building blocks.\n\nSuns keep Brandon Knight, nab Tyson Chandler\n\nThe Phoenix Suns took care of their top off-season priority by bringing back former Pistons guard Brandon Knight and added veteran frontcourt leadership in the form of Tyson Chandler.\n\nKnight agreed to a five-year, $70 million deal, people with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nChandler agreed to a three-year, $52-million deal, the people said on condition of anonymity because the deals can't be finalized until July 9.\n\nDunleavy, Butler staying with Bulls\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations told AP that Mike Dunleavy and the Chicago Bulls have agreed on a new three-year, $14 million contract.\n\nThe person confirmed the deal Wednesday to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no contracts can be signed until July 9. Yahoo Sports first reported the agreement, and Dunleavy later confirmed it to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nDunleavy was expected to get interest from several other clubs, including Cleveland.\n\nHe turns 35 in September, and averaged 9.4 points in 63 games — all starts — and shot 41 percent from 3-point range last season. In the playoffs, he averaged 10.9 points and shot 48 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nThe No. 3 pick in the 2002 draft has averaged 11.7 points in 902 career games.\n\nMeanwhile, a person familiar with the situation tells the Associated Press that All-Star guard Jimmy Butler and the Bulls have agreed to a five-year contract that could be worth about $90 million. Butler also holds an option for the fifth year.\n\nThe deal comes on the heels of a breakout season in which Butler made his first All-Star team and was selected the NBA's Most Improved Player.\n\nGreen stays with Warriors\n\nNo need to seek out an offer sheet in restricted free agency. Draymond Green is coming back to the Golden State Warriors on his own terms.\n\nThe Saginaw native and Michigan State alum announced on Bleacher Report's Uninterrupted website Wednesday night he has agreed to a five-year deal with the Warriors. A person with knowledge of the agreement told the Associated Press the contract is worth about $85 million.\n\nWarriors general manager Bob Myers confirmed in a statement that the team intends to re-sign Green when the NBA's moratorium on free agency ends July 9.\n\nGreen was a restricted free agent, meaning the NBA champion Warriors could match any offer he received. But Golden State always expected to pay whatever salary he commanded, even if that meant dipping into the league's luxury tax, which it will almost surely do now.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons had been interested in Green but didn't believe that the Warriors would let him go.\n\nSpurs keeping Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green\n\nKawhi Leonard is going to be a fixture for the San Antonio Spurs for years to come.\n\nLeonard agreed to the basic parameters of a five-year contract to stay with the Spurs early Wednesday, a deal that could be worth $90 million according to a person with direct knowledge of the agreement. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contract cannot be finalized until July 9, per NBA rules.\n\nKeeping Leonard, the 2014 NBA Finals MVP, is the first of many things the Spurs hope to accomplish in the coming days. Leonard will sit in when the Spurs meet with free agent LaMarcus Aldridge on Wednesday, part of the group that will make a sales pitch to one of the most coveted members in this year's class.\n\nLeonard averaged 16.5 points this past season for the Spurs, and followed that up by averaging 20.3 points in San Antonio's seven-game loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. His scoring average — and his role — has grown each year with the Spurs, who still hope to have their core of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili together for at least one more season.\n\nDanny Green isn't going anywhere, either.\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Green has agreed to terms with the San Antonio Spurs on a four-year contract worth $45 million. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been officially announced. Per league rules, it cannot be signed until July 9.\n\nGreen was one of the most coveted shooters on the market. And the Spurs' pursuit of free agent power forward LaMarcus Aldridge led some to believe that they would have to let Green leave for a big money deal with another team.\n\nBut after agreeing to a max contract extension with Kawhi Leonard, the Spurs locked down Green, who is also one of the best perimeter defenders in the league.\n\nGreen had been one of the top free agent targets of the Pistons.\n\nStauskas part of Kings-76ers trade\n\nThe Sacramento Kings have agreed to send Nik Stauskas (Michigan), Jason Thompson and Carl Landry to the Philadelphia 76ers as part of a salary-shedding move to pursue free agents, a person with knowledge of the trade told the Associated Press on Wednesday night.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear who the Kings were receiving in return or whether draft picks were involved.\n\nStauskas thanked the Kings and their fans on his Twitter page and wrote that he was excited to start a new chapter of his career in Philadelphia. He struggled after being drafted by the Kings eighth overall last year, but it was a difficult season for any rookie as the team fired two coaches and had a front-office shakeup.\n\nThompson just completed his seventh season and was Sacramento's longest-tenured player, having appeared in a franchise-record 541 games. Landry, an eight-year veteran, has battled injuries since coming to Sacramento two years ago.\n\nThe move clears more than $16 million in salary cap space for the Kings next season. Sacramento has been pursuing free agent guards Rajon Rondo, Wesley Matthews and Monta Ellis, among others, to join DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay. Now the Kings have space to add possibly two of those players.\n\nIman Shumpert staying in Cleveland\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Iman Shumpert has agreed to terms on a four-year, $40 million contract that will keep him in Cleveland.\n\nShumpert and the Cavaliers came to agreement on Wednesday evening. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced. A contract cannot be signed until July 9.\n\nShumpert came to the Cavaliers with J.R. Smith in a trade midseason with the New York Knicks. Shumpert's perimeter defense helped LeBron James take an injury plagued team to the NBA Finals.\n\nShumpert averaged 7.2 points and 3.8 rebounds in 38 games with the Cavaliers in the regular season.\n\nShumpert's signing comes after the Cavs gave Kevin Love a five-year, $110 million deal and Tristan Thompson a five-year, $80 million contract.\n\nKevin Love pens piece saying he's staying in Cleveland\n\nAfter all the speculation and intrigue surrounding Kevin Love's foray into the free agent market, the star power forward ended up right where he said he would all along — in Cleveland.\n\nLove announced in The Players Tribune on Wednesday that after his uneven first season ended with a serious shoulder injury, he is coming back to help LeBron James finish what they started together last season.\n\n\"We're all on the same page and we're all in,\" Love wrote. \"We have unfinished business and now it's time to get back to work.\"\n\nLove agreed to terms on a maximum contract of five years that could be worth more than $110 million, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details have not been released. No NBA contract can be signed until July 9.\n\nLove opted out of the final year of his existing contract to hit the open market, a financially motivated decision aimed at getting more security after suffering some significant injuries over the last few years.\n\nHawks reach agreement to re-sign Paul Millsap\n\nPaul Millsap became an All-Star in his first two years with Atlanta and helped lead the Hawks to their first Eastern Conference finals.\n\nHe's back for at least two more years on a new contract which doubles his annual pay.\n\nThe Hawks have reached an agreement to re-sign Millsap, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The person requested anonymity because the deal can't be finalized until July 9.\n\nThe person said the agreement is a two-year deal with a player option for a third year that makes the contract worth $58.9 million.\n\nMillsap, who came to Atlanta from Utah on a two-year, $19 million deal, will make $38 million in the first two years of his new contract.\n\nDragic, Heat agree on $90M deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations told the Associated Press that Goran Dragic has agreed to a five-year contract worth about $90 million with the Miami Heat.\n\nThe person says the deal includes a player option for Dragic to return to free agency a year earlier if he so chooses. The person spoke to The Associated Press Wednesday on condition of anonymity because the deal cannot be finalized until July 9 per NBA rules.\n\nIt was long assumed the Heat would keep the 29-year-old Dragic, especially after giving up two future first-round selections to land the point guard in a deal with Phoenix this past season.\n\nDragic averaged 16.6 points on 50 percent shooting in 26 games with the Heat. Between Miami and Phoenix, he averaged 16.3 points in 78 games.\n\nTrail Blazers agree with forward Aminu\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that the Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to terms with veteran forward Al-Farouq Aminu on a four-year, $30 million deal.\n\nThe Blazers and Aminu quickly reached accord on Tuesday night, shortly after free agency opened. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nAminu joins a revamped Blazers team that has already traded Nicolas Batum and is in a fight to retain star forward LaMarcus Aldridge.\n\nAminu averaged 5.6 points and 4.6 rebounds in 74 games for the Dallas Mavericks last season. He has never scored 20 points in a game in his five-year career. But he gives the Blazers a versatile defender to a team that ranked in the bottom third in points allowed and field goal percentage defense.\n\nAgent: Pelicans, center Alexis Ajinca agree on 4-year deal\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans and 7-foot center Alexis Ajinca have agreed on a four-year, $20.2-million extension.\n\nThe 27-year-old Ajinca's new contract was confirmed by his agent, Mark Bartelstein, in an email to the Associated Press.\n\nAjinca, who is French, was used last season primarily as a reserve. But when he received more minutes, he usually produced.\n\nHe reached double figures in scoring and rebounding on several occasions, pouring in as many as 24 points in a victory over Miami last season and grabbing as many as 14 rebounds in a loss at Philadelphia.\n\nAjinca has been in the NBA for parts of five seasons, including all of the past two with New Orleans. He appeared in 68 games last season, starting eight, and averaged 6.5 points and 4.6 rebounds.\n\nMeanwhile, a person with knowledge of the details says All-Star power forward Anthony Davis and the Pelicans have agreed on a five-year extension worth more than $140 million.\n\nDavis tweeted: \"NOLA, I am here to stay! Just getting started\" shortly after free agency opened late Tuesday night, and the person confirmed the agreement to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal cannot yet be signed.\n\nThe 22-year-old Davis is entering the final season of a four-year contract he signed after being drafted first overall out of Kentucky in 2012. He had until Oct. 31 to accept the offer or could have become a restricted free agent next off-season.\n\nDavis averaged 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds and 2.9 blocks this season. The exact value of his extension can't be determined until the salary cap has been set next week.\n\nMore deals to come as they take place.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2022/09/01/donovan-mitchell-shocking-trade-utah-jazz-cleveland-cavaliers/7963127001/", "title": "Donovan Mitchell: Cleveland Cavaliers acquire All-Star from Utah Jazz", "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers were not content just being a good team in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThey want to contend for the East title.\n\nIn a move that rocked the NBA, the Cavaliers acquired three-time All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell from the Utah Jazz for Collin Sexton, Lauri Markkanen, Ochai Agbaji, three first-round picks and rights to swap picks, two people with knowledge of the trade told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThey requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly until the trade is officially announced.\n\nThe Jazz made it clear they are in rebuild mode after a lack of playoff progress with Mitchell and Rudy Gobert and were amenable to moving Mitchell after they traded Gobert to Minnesota.\n\nNew York and Miami were obvious suitors for Mitchell, but the Knicks’ extension of RJ Barrett all but ended a trade between the Jazz and Knicks, and the Heat were not willing to trade certain players to accommodate the Jazz.\n\nWorking quietly without leaks, Cavavliers general manager Koby Altman – fresh off a Mediterranean vacation – went to work and pulled off a stunning deal.\n\nThe Cavs now have a roster that features Mitchell, 2022 All-Stars Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen, 2021-22 All-Rookie selection Evan Mobley and veterans Kevin Love, Ricky Rubio and Caris LeVert.\n\nDOCUMENTARY:Jeannie Buss reveals details inside power struggle for Lakers\n\n'DARKEST PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN':John Wall admits having suicidal thoughts\n\nOPINION:Why the Pacers should trade for Lakers' Russell Westbrook\n\nCleveland finished 44-38 last season and was 35-21 after beating Indiana on Feb. 11 – good for second place in the East and just one game behind Miami. Injuries derailed the Cavs in the final portion of the season but the potential was obvious.\n\nWith Mobley and Allen anchoring the defense, the Cavs allowed 108.9 points per 100 possessions, fifth best in the league.\n\nGarland came into his own offensively as a playmaker and scorer with Sexton missing most of the season, but the Cavs were still 20th offensively. The addition of Mitchell, who averaged 25.9 points last season, will help on that end, and the Cavs shouldn’t see too much negative impact defensively.\n\nAltman has done a fantastic job rebuilding the Cavaliers following LeBron James’ departure to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018, and this Mitchell deal will put in him the conversation for Executive of the Year. Mitchell has three years remaining on his five-year, $163 million contract, though the final season in 2025-26 is a player option. The deal got the attention of James who tweeted, “SO TOUGH!!!!! Super Dope.”\n\nAs part of the deal, Sexton has agreed to a four-year, $72 million extension with Utah, which has stockpiled draft picks. Including the Gobert deal with the Timberwolves, Utah has at least 13 first-round picks through 2029, not including Walker Kessler, acquired from Minnesota, and Agbaji, who were first-round picks in 2022.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/famu/2021/03/04/famu-nike-sign-deal-lebron-james-gear-all-sports-programs/6920494002/", "title": "FAMU, Nike sign deal with LeBron James gear for all sports programs", "text": "Florida A&M and Nike, Inc. announced on Wednesday a partnership that features a six-year deal for the shoe giant to be the official athletic footwear, apparel and equipment provider for the Rattlers.\n\nThis contract goes into effect on July 1.\n\nThere is an option for a two-year extension with the current format.

George, who was widely believed to be destined for Laker Land, is sticking it out with Russell Westbrook and the Thunder after his first season with the franchise ended in the first round of the playoffs. Kudos to Thunder general manager Sam Presti for this one.\n\n*4. Chris Paul - Agreed to four-year, $160 million deal to stay with Houston. Paul, who forced his way out of Los Angeles last summer after six seasons with the Clippers, is coming off a disappointing finish to a phenomenal season. As elite as Paul is, will the Rockets regret giving the 33-year-old a long-term deal?\n\n*5. DeMarcus Cousins - Agreed to one-year, $5.3 million deal with Golden State. In the biggest stunner of the summer, Cousins will become the fifth All-Star on the Warriors. He suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in January, but, contingent on his health, he offers a dominant, low-post presence that the Warriors haven’t had – though have rarely needed.\n\n*6. Nikola Jokic - Reportedly agreed to five-year, $146.5 million deal to stay with Denver. This was a done deal before free agency began. Jokic is one of the most talented young big men in the league and the Nuggets' franchise centerpiece. He wasn't going anywhere.\n\n7. Clint Capela - Rockets retain their restricted free-agent center with a five-year, $90 million deal that does not have a team or player option.\n\n*8. DeAndre Jordan - Reportedly agreed to one-year, approximately $24 million deal with Dallas. Jordan is headed to Dallas — again. We have a feeling this will be different than the summer of 2015, when Jordan changed his mind after agreeing to a deal with the Mavericks and returned to L.A.\n\n*9. Julius Randle - Agreed to two-year, $18 million deal with New Orleans. The fourth-year big man is coming off a career year (16.1 points, eight rebounds per game) and will be a welcome addition in New Orleans alongside Anthony Davis.\n\n*10. Aaron Gordon - Agreed to four-year, $82 million deal to stay with Orlando. Injuries limited Gordon to 58 games last season, but the 22-year-old still took a significant step forward in his development. He's one of the most promising young power forwards in the league.\n\n*11. Zach LaVine - Agreed to four-year, $80 million deal to stay with Chicago. The former lottery pick is just 23, and, when healthy, is one of the league's most explosive guards.\n\n*12. Tyreke Evans - Agreed to one-year, $12 million deal with Indiana. Evans had his best all-around season in 2017-18, averaging 19.4 points and shooting a career-best 39.9 percent on 3-pointers. He also averaged 5.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds. He's a nice addition to a Pacers backcourt with Most Improved Player Victor Oladipo.\n\n*13. Marcus Smart - Agreed to a four-year, $52 million deal to stay with Boston. The Celtics are bringing back their gritty, two-way guard who Boston fans have come to love. He infuses their defense with energy and typically puts clamps on opponents' best backcourt playmaker.\n\n*14. JJ Redick - Agreed to one-year deal to stay with Philadelphia. Keeping Redick is big for the Sixers, who again expect to be one of the top teams in the East. The 34-year-old sharpshooter averaged a career-high 17.1 points per game last season, his first in Philadelphia.\n\n*15. Jusuf Nurkic - Reportedly agreed to four-year, $48 million deal to stay with Portland. He's solid on both ends of the floor and is only 23 years old, but as a 7-footer who doesn't stretch the floor, what's Nurkic's ceiling?\n\n*16. Derrick Favors - Agreed to two-year, $36 million deal to stay with Utah. Favors fits at power forward in a big lineup and center in a small lineup and, though he's more of a traditional big man, he began to extend his range a bit last season, hitting 14 3-pointers.\n\n*17. Trevor Ariza - Agreed to one-year, $15 million deal with Phoenix. This is an interesting move for Ariza, who will go from key cog on a 65-win Houston team to a veteran presence on a rebuilding Suns squad.\n\n*18. Jabari Parker - Agreed to a two-year, $40 million deal with Chicago. The Bucks rescinded Parker's qualifying offer, allowing him to negotiate as an unrestricted free agent.\n\n*19. Avery Bradley - Agreed to two-year, $25 million deal to stay with Los Angeles Clippers. Bradley, who's coming off season-ending abdominal surgery, struggled to find the right role after being traded from Boston, but he provides value as a defender and improved scorer.\n\n*20. Isaiah Thomas - Agreed to one-year minimum deal with Denver. The Nuggets were already an explosive offensive team, but adding Thomas — assuming he can stay healthy — on such a small deal is a win for Denver.\n\n*21. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope - Agreed to one-year, $12 million deal to stay with Los Angeles Lakers. Caldwell-Pope, who averaged 13.4 points per game last season and shot a career-high 38.3 percent on 3-pointers, will be a nice fit alongside James.\n\n*22. Will Barton - Reportedly agreed to four-year, $54 million deal to stay with Denver. Barton has developed into one of the top sixth men in the league, and the Nuggets weren't ready to let him walk. Of players who came off the bench in more than 40 games last season, Barton was tied for third with 13.7 points per game.\n\n*23. Fred VanVleet - Agreed to two-year, $18 million deal to stay with Toronto. The Sixth Man of the Year finalist shot 41.4 percent from 3-point last year, his second NBA season.\n\n*24. Luc Mbah a Moute - Reportedly agreed to one-year, $4.3 million deal with Los Angeles Clippers. Many of his contributions don't show up in the box score, but make no mistake: Mbah a Moute was a big part of what made Houston so dangerous last season. The Rockets' defensive rating was 101.2 with him on the court, 105.4 with him off.\n\n*25. Rajon Rondo - Agreed to one-year, $9 million deal with Los Angeles Lakers. Another interesting addition for the Lakers, Rondo, 32, reinvigorated his career during his lone season in New Orleans. An interesting move for the Lakers and a big loss for the Pelicans.\n\n*26. Rudy Gay - Reportedly agreed to one-year, $10 million deal to stay with San Antonio. Gay, who signed with the Spurs last summer after suffering a ruptured Achilles in January 2017, opted out of the final year of his contract last week, turning down $8.8 million. He's not the 20 point per game scorer he once was, but he can still contribute.\n\n*27. Kyle Anderson - Agreed to four-year, $37.2 million deal with Memphis. Anderson took a significant step forward in his fourth NBA season, taking advantage of additional minutes due to Kawhi Leonard's absence.\n\n*28. Lance Stephenson - Agreed to one-year, $4.5 million deal with Los Angeles Lakers. Lance and LeBron in L.A.? This is just too good.\n\n*29. Brook Lopez - Agreed to one-year, $3.3 million deal with Milwaukee. Lopez is headed to Milwaukee on the Bucks' bi-annual exception. He should solidify the frontcourt and help stretch the floor for new coach Mike Budenholzer.\n\n*30. Wayne Ellington - Reportedly agreed to one-year, $6.3 million deal to stay with Miami. Ellington, who finished last season ranked sixth in the NBA with 227 3-pointers made, is the type of veteran floor spacer any team can benefit from having.\n\n31. Rodney Hood, Cleveland (Restricted)\n\n*32. Nerlens Noel - Agreed to two-year deal with Oklahoma City. Noel, the No. 6 overall pick in 2013, is coming off the worst season of his career, but this is a great opportunity for him to get back on track.\n\n*33. Seth Curry - Reportedly agreed to two-year deal with Portland. Curry didn’t play last season as a result of a stress fracture in his leg, but Steph’s younger brother had a stellar 2016-17 campaign with Dallas, especially after the All-Star break (averaged 16.2 points and made 45.3 percent of his 3-pointers).\n\n34. Joe Harris - Agreed to two-year, $16 million deal to stay with Brooklyn. The Nets clearly saw the value in the 26-year-old forward, who shot a career-high 49.1 percent from the field and 41.9 percent from beyond the arc last season.\n\n35. Greg Monroe, Boston (Unrestricted)\n\n36. Dwyane Wade, Miami (Unrestricted)\n\n*37. Dante Exum - Agreed to three-year, $33 million deal to stay with Utah. Injuries robbed Exum of much of his first four seasons, but he did have a promising end to his 2017-18 campaign. Exum was drafted fifth overall in 2014, and the Jazz still clearly have faith in his talent.\n\n38. Michael Beasley - Agreed to one-year deal with Los Angeles Lakers. Another addition for LeBron and Co., Beasley is coming off one of the best seasons of his 10-year career.\n\n39. Montrezl Harrell, Los Angeles Clippers - Agreed to two-year, $12 million contract with the Clippers.\n\n*40. Elfrid Payton - Reportedly agreed to one-year deal with New Orleans. Payton, the No. 10 overall pick in 2014, averaged 12.7 points, 6.2 assists and 4.3 rebounds with Orlando and Phoenix last season.\n\nOther notable free agent deals\n\n*Dwight Howard - Joined Washington on two-year, $11 million deal. This will be Howard's fifth team since being traded by Orlando in 2012. The eight-time All-Star averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds last season in Charlotte.\n\n* Vince Carter - Agrees to one-year deal with the Atlanta Hawks. It will be Carter's 21st NBA season.\n\n*JaVale McGee - Agreed to one-year, $2.4 million deal with Los Angeles Lakers. A surprising addition to the LeBron-led Lakers, McGee is coming off two solid years with Golden State, where he provided the Warriors with some much-needed rim protection.\n\n*Jonas Jerebko - Plans to sign with Golden State. The stretch-4 shot 41 percent from 3-point range with Utah last season.\n\n*Doug McDermott - Agreed to three-year, $22 million deal with Indiana. The Pacers were one of the NBA's biggest surprises last season, and adding McDermott will only make them better. He's a career 40.3 percent shooter from beyond the arc.\n\n*Ersan Ilyasova - Agreed to three-year, $21 million deal with Milwaukee. The 31-year-old journeyman will be a solid addition to Milwaukee, where he spent the first seven seasons of his career. He averaged 10.8 points and 6.7 rebounds after signing with Philadelphia in February.\n\nEd Davis - Reportedly agreed to one-year, $4.4 million deal with Brooklyn. Damian Lillard wasn't a fan of this, and we don't blame him. At this price, this is a steal for the Nets.\n\n*Aron Baynes - Agreed to two-year, $10.6 million deal to stay with Boston. Baynes may not be as high profile as the Celtics' stars or the members of their young core, but he still provides the team with some valuable energy and physicality.\n\n*Jerami Grant - Agreed to three-year, $27 million deal to stay with Oklahoma City. Athletic and young, Grant is coming off a solid season with the Thunder, who clearly view him as a part of their future.\n\n*Marco Belinelli - Agreed to two-year, $12 million deal with San Antonio. Belinelli, who won a championship with the Spurs in 2014, shot 37.7 percent from 3-point territory last season with Atlanta and Philadelphia.\n\n*Raul Neto - Agreed to two-year, $4.4 million deal to stay with Utah. The 26-year-old floor general only played 12.1 minutes per game last season, but he made 40.4 percent of his 3-pointers.\n\n*Derrick Rose - Agreed to one-year, $2.4 million deal to stay with Minnesota. He's not the player he once was, but Rose showed some promise with the T-Wolves in their first-round playoff loss to Houston, averaging 14.2 points in five games.\n\n*Jeff Green - Reportedly agreed to one-year minimum deal with Washington. Green had his moments for Cleveland in the playoffs (19 points and eight rebounds in Game 7 vs. Boston on the road), and he should be a nice complementary piece for a Wizards team in need of some frontcourt help.\n\n*Michael Carter-Williams - Reportedly agreed to one-year minimum deal with Houston. The 2014 Rookie of the Year will join his fifth NBA team. He spent last season in Charlotte, where he averaged a career-low 4.6 points per game.\n\n*Raymond Felton - Reportedly agreed to one-year, $2.4 million deal to stay with Oklahoma City. Felton's return pushes the Thunder into uncharted territory: They are currently projected to pay $150 million in luxury tax, according to ESPN, pushing total team spending to $300 million.\n\nNemanja Bjelica - Reportedly agreed to a three-year, $20.5 million deal with the Sacramento Kings. Bjelica has spent the last three years with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nJabari Bird - Agreed to two-year deal with the Boston Celtics.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/12/02/agency-lebron-james-inks-contract-extension-with-lakers/115089986/", "title": "Agent: LeBron inks 2-year, $85 million extension with Lakers"}]}

Glenn Youngkin's administration, require students to use restrooms, pronouns and names based on their official school records. It limits sports teams to gender assigned at birth, and it tightens parental notification requirements.\n\nWhat students are saying: \"Revoking (transgender protections) now would be like dialing back the clock. It'd be like telling students, 'we don't really care, you're not really who you believe yourself to be,'\" Andrea-Grace Mukuna, 16, told USA TODAY on Tuesday at John R. Lewis High School in Springfield, where more than 100 of her peers walked out for a protest on the football field.\n\nThe big picture: The walkouts are part of greater nationwide youth pushback to an uptick in anti-LGBTQ policies in schools, including what critics call Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” law and bans in 18 states against transgender athletes participating in sports that match their gender identity.\n\nMore coverage on LGBTQ youth:\n\nOver 1,000 students walk out\n\nPride Liberation Project, a youth-led LGBTQ advocacy nonprofit, helped organize the walkouts throughout the day at more than 100 schools and said over 1,000 students participated Tuesday. At some high schools in Northern Virginia, hundreds of students poured out of buildings in the morning, spending roughly half an hour chanting their opposition to the new guidance and listening to speakers.\n\nOne of Mukuna's main objectives was to raise awareness among her peers about their ability to have a say in what happens next by submitting comments during the policy's public comment period over the next month. She and her co-organizers handed out flyers at the walkout with QR codes that students can scan to go to the website for submitting comments.\n\n\"We're really having our own agency and taking control of our own lives in a way that many youths feel they can't at this age,\" she said, noting that Fairfax County schools have been \"progressive in allowing students to go by the name and pronouns of their choosing.\"\n\n\"Teachers have been really accommodating of that, and now a lot of students feel confident in their gender expression,\" she said.\n\nStudent activists at McLean High School encouraged the 100-plus teens who walked out at 10:30 a.m. to attend the district's next school board meeting. \"Trans rights are human rights,\" the organizers chanted into megaphones. \"D.O.E., leave us be!\"\n\nSome speakers recalled their own mental health struggles and how the new guidelines would cause more pain for already-vulnerable youth.\n\n\"I was just completely terrified – I cried,\" said Casey Calabia, a 17-year-old senior at McLean High School, when they heard about the new policy last week. \"It was a huge blow to myself and so many other students. The personal toll of these things – it's just monumental.\"\n\nWhat does Youngkin's education policy reverse?\n\nLast year, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's administration instituted model policies that protected transgender and other LGBTQ students at school. The guidelines released this month, The 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students in Virginia's Public School, revises those Department of Education guidelines.\n\nUnder the new policy:\n\nStudents should be referred to by the name and pronouns in their official records unless a parent approves the use of an alternative.\n\nSchools may separate sports teams on the basis of sex assigned at birth and are not required to allow students of one sex to participate in sports teams reserved for members of another sex.\n\nStudents must now file legal documents if they wish to be called by different pronouns.\n\nSchools may not encourage teachers to conceal information about a student's gender from their parents.\n\nThe policy acknowledges that \"every effort should be made to ensure that a transgender student wishing to change his or her means of address is treated with respect, compassion and dignity,\" but ultimately requires a guardian to sign off on the change, presenting challenges for students with non-LGBTQ-affirming parents.\n\nImpact on transgender students\n\nStudents and parents who've spoken out against the guidelines say the changes put LGBTQ youth in danger because it bans they/them pronouns and allows students to be deadnamed or misgendered.\n\nCalabia, the McLean High student, said their biggest concern was a change permitting schools to out students as transgender to their parents without their permission. Calabia is an organizer with Pride Liberation Project.\n\n\"I know people personally who are out at school but not out at home,\" Calabia told USA TODAY. \"If they got outed through this transgender model policy, it would absolutely ruin their lives. They do not have supportive households.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nA 30-day public comment period opened Monday and has already collected more than 16,000 responses. The state school board will not vote on the model policy but the Superintendent of Public Instruction may amend the final draft based on comments, state Department of Education spokesman Charles Pyle told Education Week.\n\nLegal precedent: Gavin Grimm\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Education Department pointed to the model policy's fine print, which stipulates compliance with federal law.\n\nThe federal courts have thus far ruled that the United States Constitution and Title IX \"protect transgender students from school bathroom policies that prohibit them from affirming their gender identity,\" the spokesperson said. A key case involved a transgender student in Virginia named Gavin Grimm who was denied access to the boy's restroom and forced to use a separate facility. Just last year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, allowing lower courts' rulings in favor of Grimm to stand.\n\n\"Virginia’s proposed policy does not, as it legally could not, direct Virginia schools to discriminate against transgender students where prohibited by federal law,\" the department spokesperson said. \"Virginia’s new proposed policy is designed to confuse and its most likely outcome will be to undermine (schools') focus on schooling.\"\n\nHow have people reacted?\n\nSchool response: Multiple school boards have suggested they may resist and push back on the policies, including Alexandria City Public Schools and Falls Church City Public Schools, The Washington Post reported.\n\nWhat Youngkin says: Youngkin spokesman Macaulay Porter said in a statement that the updated policy “delivers on the governor’s commitment to preserving parental rights and upholding the dignity and respect of all public school students.”\n\nYoungkin also joined several states in suing the Biden administration for requiring schools to update policies and signage as well as investigate discrimination allegations involving sexual orientation and gender identity in order to qualify for federal school lunch funding.\n\nNationwide: A look at other efforts\n\nThe Biden administration is currently reviewing comments to its proposed revisions to Title IX regulations, which include codifying protections for transgender and nonbinary students under nondiscrimination categories.\n\nBut LGBTQ and survivor advocate groups have also pushed back on the Department of Education for neglecting to address guidelines on transgender and nonbinary student participation in gender-specific sports teams in the revised regulations. Federal Education Department officials have said they plan to propose separate rules on the topic but have not yet released a timeline for doing so.\n\nFlorida's so-called Don't Say Gay bill, officially name the Parental Rights in Education Act, that passed in March was the most high-profile example of legislation restricting LGBTQ youth in the United States. It limited speech on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school classrooms. Bills in other states also restrict transgender student participation in gender-specific sports teams and require parental permission for student participation in LGBTQ extracurriculars activities.\n\nThis story was updated with comment from the U.S. Education Department.\n\nContributing: Kayla Jimenez and Chris Quintana, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/09/27/hurricane-ian-virginia-student-walkout-jan-6-hearing-puerto-rico-hockey-championship-tuesdays-news/8117031001/", "title": "Hurricane Ian, Virginia student walkout, Jan. 6 hearing postponed ...", "text": "Hurricane Ian is closing in on Florida.

Top European Union diplomat Josep Borell said Wednesday that “all available information indicates those leaks are the result of a deliberate act,” and such a move \"is utterly unacceptable and will be met with a robust and united response.” Read more\n\nJust for subscribers:\n\nThese articles are for USA TODAY subscribers.

Instead, more than 50,000 teachers headed to downtown Phoenix, intending to give some instruction to the governor and the state Legislature.\n\n\"It's not OK that my gut reaction is to tell kids who want to be teachers that they shouldn't,\" said Katherine Reddy, an American history teacher at Westwood High School in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa. She contends that state politicians need to prioritize education.\n\nOne supporter of Arizona's #RedForEd movement, William Robles of the Phoenix suburb of Guadalupe, dressed in a bull costume because he wants Gov. Doug Ducey and state lawmakers to stop bullying teachers, he said.\n\n► April 25:What worries parents most about the Arizona teachers walkout\n\n► April 25:Pot taxes across U.S. shore up school budgets, drug-prevention efforts\n\n► April 23:Arizona's governor puzzled on why teachers want to walk out\n\nIn Colorado, more than 10,000 teachers were demonstrating Thursday and Friday in Denver, using personal time to rally for more money for their classrooms. About half of the state's 900,000 students have shuttered schools as a result.\n\nSome sat on the marble floor in between the Colorado Senate and House chambers inside the Capitol, grading student papers to show how much work they do outside the classroom, work that ultimately benefits students.\n\n“Teachers being secure makes for a better environment\" for students, said Nancy Irvin, who teaches at Ranch View Middle School in the Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch. “If you can’t afford to live in the community where you teach, that’s a problem.”\n\n► April 20:Arizona educators vote to strike, a first for the state\n\n► April 13:Kentucky teachers rally for education money, fixes to their pensions\n\nAverage teacher pay in Colorado was $51,808 in 2017, which ranks 31st among states and the District of Columbia, according to a National Education Association report released earlier this month. The same report lists the average teacher's salary in Arizona as $47,403, ranking 44th.\n\nStarting salaries also are important to attract high quality teaching prospects, said Kerrie Dallman, president of the Colorado Education Association. In some school districts in the state, starting pay is as low as $29,000.\n\nTeachers' average starting pay in Colorado was $32,980 for the 2016-17 school year, according to NEA research. That ranks Colorado fourth from the bottom, lower than Arizona, where the average starting salary is $34,068.\n\nNo large scale strike is planned in Colorado as in Arizona, where the walkout is affecting more than 850,000 students and closing more than 1,000 public schools.\n\nSince Colorado lawmakers don’t have the power to raise taxes without asking voters, teachers there not expecting an immediate fix. The teachers’ union is backing a ballot initiative to raise taxes on people earning more than $150,000 a year and corporations.\n\nColorado teachers also are watching changes made to the state’s pension system, a rallying point for Kentucky teachers who had a series of protests earlier this month in their state capitol of Frankfort. Teachers also had strikes this year in Oklahoma, where per pupil spending last year ranked 45th in the country, and West Virginia.\n\nArizona's grassroots #RedForEd movement began with a peaceful demonstration in early March and spiraled into what could be a multi-day walkout intended to pressure Ducey and state lawmakers to restore a decade of cuts to education.\n\nEducators' demands include immediate 20% teacher pay raises, competitive pay for support staff such as bus drivers and paraprofessionals, and restoring the $1 billion in state money for education that has been cut since the recession.\n\n\"A lot of people think all the teachers are out here for their own pay, but we are out here for funding for classroom and kids,\" Candice Brownd said. She teaches second grade at Copper Trails School in Goodyear, Ariz., about 20 miles west of Phoenix.\n\n► April 12:Many state pension systems have huge funding problems, report claims\n\n► April 7:Arizona teacher doubled his salary by getting a teaching job in California\n\nDucey has proposed to give teachers 20% pay raises by 2020 without raising taxes. While the Republican governor has said he is committed to making his plan a reality, most legislators don't appear to support it.\n\nAs the rally was beginning, the Arizona Senate decided to adjourn until Monday, allowing those lawmakers to avoid contact with the protesters for the rest of the week. Teachers booed when walkout organizers told them about the adjournment.\n\nDozens of #RedForEd supporters did fill the state House gallery, cheering when Rep. Isela Blanc, a Tempe Democrat, said the state’s education financing crisis is the result of 17 years of corporate tax cuts that have sucked money from the public schools.\n\n“This is not a crisis made overnight,” she said. “It is a crisis of over close to two decades.”\n\nWhen the thermometer hit 95 degrees at about 1:30 p.m. MST, the teachers decided to end their rally three hours early. Some participants already were collapsing in the heat.\n\n► April 4:Oklahoma teachers share photos of broken chairs, outdated textbooks\n\n► April 4:When teachers protest, what happens to the kids?\n\nThey will gather again at 10 a.m. Friday; Colorado teachers will rally at 2 p.m. MDT.\n\nDucey said he has no plans to meet with striking Arizona teachers and isn’t planning to address their demands beyond his salary proposal.\n\nA prominent TV news anchor, Kari Lake at KSAZ-TV, Phoenix, created controversy Tuesday when she tweeted that Arizona's #RedForEd movement was a push to legalize marijuana. She deleted the tweet and apologized on the station's 9 p.m. broadcast the night before the walkout but kept a Facebook post up that raised similar questions.\n\n► April 2:All 120 county school districts close in Kentucky as teachers rally\n\n► March 8:West Virginia teachers' victory shows power of women\n\nTax revenue from legalizing pot is something that at least two Arizona representatives are trying to revive.

Refusing to leave art class after an argument with another student at their northeast Philadelphia elementary school.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident in 2017, Philadelphia schools issued a statement acknowledging it was not handled correctly. But a charged encounter with an officer in school is far from rare. Nationally, students were referred to law enforcement nearly 230,000 times during the 2017-18 school year, exemplifying why demands to restrict policing at schools are growing.\n\n“You’ve got some police officers that just can’t help themselves,” said the child’s father, Isaac Gardner. “You’re taking a little elementary school child in the bathroom. You ain’t supposed to be doing that.”\n\nA Center for Public Integrity analysis of U.S. Department of Education data found that school policing disproportionately affects students with disabilities, Black children and, in some states, Native American and Latino children. Nationwide, Black students, such as Gardner’s son, and students with disabilities were referred to law enforcement at nearly twice their share of the overall student population.\n\nSchools in some states are far more likely than others to refer students to law enforcement, regardless of their race and disability status. New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin schools did so at rates at least twice the national average. The repercussions ripple through communities in urban, suburban and rural areas alike.\n\nLancaster County Public Schools, a three-school district in remote eastern Virginia, had a referral rate 17 times the national average. In Philadelphia, one of the nation’s 20 largest school districts, the referral rate for all students was seven times the national average.\n\nThirty-one states, as well as the District of Columbia, referred Black students to law enforcement at more than twice the rate of white students, the Public Integrity analysis found.\n\nThese sharp disparities come despite years of mounting pressure on schools to stop policing kids.\n\n“They’re criminalizing some ordinary behavior of students, and they’re certainly disproportionately referring students of color to the juvenile justice system rather than disciplining them at school,” said Maura McInerney, legal director at the Education Law Center, a Pennsylvania legal advocacy group.\n\nIn 2017, a national study at the University of California, Irvine, found that on-campus arrest rates for children younger than 15 increased in areas where the federal government made grant money available in 1999 for school resource officers – a response to the mass shooting at Columbine High School. The funding was available whether a district struggled with crime or not, which helped researchers tease out the impact.\n\nNationwide, roughly a quarter of law enforcement referrals lead to arrests, federal data shows. Students may be issued citations that require them to appear before judges or other juvenile court system officials. The federal data doesn’t specify what the referral was for, nor the result.\n\nIn 2019, a Vermont student with a disability that causes bone pain was forcefully subdued by a school resource officer after educators suspected, erroneously, that the 17-year-old had a vape.\n\nThe officer demanded to search his backpack. The boy objected, using foul language, and the officer told him that he was “acting retarded.” The officer pushed the student to the floor, arresting and handcuffing him and leaving him with bloody knuckles and bruised wrists.\n\nShould we defund school police? Teacher is torn about how to keep kids safe.\n\nIn Vermont, students with disabilities accounted for 48% of students referred to law enforcement in 2017-18. That’s the highest among all states and more than twice their share of the overall student population.\n\n\"These are kids that school districts have traditionally not done a good job of helping,\" said Diane Smith Howard, managing attorney for criminal and juvenile justice for the National Disability Rights Network. \"They don't do a good job, the kids act out, and then instead of fixing the problem, they call the police.\"\n\nAfter the incident in 2019, the boy missed classes during a months-long battle in juvenile court over charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest – charges that were dropped after police released cellphone and bodycam videos of the incident.\n\nThe teen earned his diploma from an adult school. A settlement last year with the city and his school district, Maple Run Unified, required a $30,000 payment to the teen and training for the officer. A nondisclosure agreement restricts public discussion about the case.\n\nThis spring, civil rights attorneys sent a letter of protest to Vermont education officials after discovering that two school districts – one of them Maple Run – used Medicaid funding intended for students with disabilities to instead hire school resource officers, or SROs.\n\nDecades of policing students\n\nThe roots of school policing reach back to 1948, when Los Angeles formed a security unit that grew into a full-fledged school-based law enforcement agency. In the 1950s, Flint, Michigan, posted officers borrowed from city ranks in schools to serve as “liaisons” in an anti-crime strategy. School shootings led to an expansion of this policing. “Zero tolerance” for weapons morphed into crackdowns on kids’ behavior.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2018, the share of schools reporting the presence of at least one security officer on site at least once a week grew from 42% to 61%. The higher the enrollment and proportion of children eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches, the more likely schools are to have security, according to a report in 2020 from the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice.\n\nFederal funds remain available to schools that want to hire police. Because of the specter of school shootings, many parents, staff and children like to know an armed officer is on site. The University of California, Irvine, study found that principals in schools with more officers reported lower rates of criminal incidents. With that decline came an increased likelihood that children accused of disruptive behavior would come into contact with someone in the criminal justice system rather than a principal or dean of students.\n\nIncreasing outcry and concerns that children of color are targeted have prompted some districts to remove police from schools. The trend quickened after a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.\n\nSome states, Virginia most notably, have taken steps to slash referrals of children to law enforcement for minor incidents.\n\nA Center for Public Integrity investigation in 2015 identified Virginia as the top state for referrals in the 2011-12 school year. The commonwealth’s rate of about 16 referrals per 1,000 students was nearly three times the national rate. The investigation revealed that Virginia middle school students, some with disabilities, were arrested and charged with crimes such as felony assault on police and obstruction of justice.\n\nIn 2020, after years of adopting and rejecting multiple changes, legislators approved a bill making Virginia the first state to prohibit police from charging students with disorderly conduct at school or school-sponsored events. Legislators removed language from the state code that educators said contributed to driving up referrals because it obliged them to report any potential crime, including a possible misdemeanor.\n\nThe changes went into effect in July 2020. The Virginia-based Legal Aid Justice Center pressed lawmakers for years to enact the changes, producing reports that highlighted widespread disparities in referral rates and cataloging stories of children charged with crimes for minor rule offenses.\n\n“It’s a great step,” said Rachael Deane, legal director of the Youth Justice Program at the Legal Aid Justice Center. “But I still think that pieces of the puzzle that aren’t in place yet [will mean continued] high numbers of referrals from schools to law enforcement.”\n\nPublic Integrity’s analysis of the most recent data available found that in 2017-18, before these changes were approved, Virginia’s schools collectively reported students to law enforcement at three times the national rate, topping all other states.\n\nThe Lancaster County schools, serving about 1,160 students that year, had a rate higher than any other traditional Virginia district, behind only small alternative schools. Tracking both state and national trends, Black students and students with disabilities in the district made up a disproportionate share of referrals.\n\nAlso striking is the focus on younger children. Educators referred students 65 times from Lancaster’s middle school of 396 students and 19 times from the similarly sized elementary school, compared with 14 at Lancaster High School.\n\nLancaster County Public Schools Superintendent Dan Russell said he expects those numbers to fall now that Virginia law no longer requires educators to notify police of an incident. The process, he said, often went no further than a “simple conversation” about “two kids horseplaying.” If officers isolate children to speak to them about an incident, Russell said, an administrator must be present.\n\nRussell said only seven incidents in the 2017-18 school year led to more serious police involvement, but school records didn’t indicate why.\n\nLancaster County Sheriff’s Capt. Martin Shirilla said that if educators notified authorities about an incident, a school resource officer would keep a record “for statistical purposes.”\n\nResearch shows that those early interactions can have lasting effects. In 2020, a Tulane University and University of Washington study tracking Seattle Public Schools students found lingering effects from middle school interactions with police.\n\n\"Black respondents who experience contact with the police by eighth grade have 11 times greater odds of being arrested when they are 20 years old than their white counterparts,\" researchers found.\n\n‘Cops are trained to be cops’\n\nAfter the advent of cellphone video, the public has seen evidence that some officers injured or threatened students, including some as young as 5 years old. The Advancement Project, a civil rights organization, documented at least 62 cases from 2010 to 2018 in which police officers were accused of assaulting students.\n\nA video that went viral this year shows two police officers in Montgomery County, Maryland, haranguing a sobbing kindergartner they’d subdued and handcuffed in 2020 after he walked out of school. Officers screamed at length at the child, one declaring, “This is why people need to beat their kids.”\n\nGrainy cellphone video taken in March 2018 at a high school in suburban Minneapolis showed the tense moments before a police officer deployed a stun gun to subdue a then-14-year-old high school student, leaving him hospitalized, after the school resource officer called for backup. Burnsville Police Department records indicate that seven officers “responded to an incident of disorderly conduct.”\n\nNot all incidents are captured on camera – or even in federal records.\n\nHigh school students speak out:Students say police don't belong in schools. Here's how they forced them out.\n\nAccording to the federal data, the Pittsburgh district made 191 referrals to law enforcement and had zero arrests during the 2017-18 school year. The district acknowledges that’s inaccurate because of a data entry error.\n\nSchools and districts enter their own figures into the federal database. Among tens of thousands of such entities, some errors are inevitable. Nevertheless, the data is the only detailed information on discipline that covers nearly all public schools, and experts in the field said the stark disparities it shows are real.\n\nFor years, civil and disability rights advocates have pressed school boards and state lawmakers to get police officers off campuses, arguing that they often posed risks to students they were hired to serve.\n\n“Cops are trained to be cops,” said Marilyn Mahusky, staff attorney for the Disability Law Project at Vermont Legal Aid. “Consistent with their training, they demand that the behavior stop, and if it doesn’t, you’re charged, you’re arrested.”\n\nIn January 2018, two weeks after scuffling with Fair Haven, Vermont, police in a bathroom stall at her high school, a student in distress found herself in trouble again. She returned to school, in violation of her at-home suspension, and refused to leave the principal’s office. This time, officers restrained and arrested the girl, who later faced charges of assault on law enforcement, disorderly conduct, trespassing and resisting arrest.\n\n“While on the way to the hospital, the defendant stated she wanted all of us to die, and that she wanted to die as well,” a police department sergeant wrote in an affidavit about the case.\n\nMahusky was among the advocates backing state legislation that would prohibit schools from hiring school resource officers, called SROs for short. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott argued that school districts, not state lawmakers, should make that decision.\n\nThough the legislative push in Vermont failed, dozens of school districts across the country canceled their contracts with police departments or cut their policing budgets, some after identifying disparities in referrals and arrests.\n\nSchool systems in Minneapolis; Oakland, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle ended their agreements with law enforcement agencies. Two of the nation’s largest districts, Chicago and Los Angeles, slashed their budgets, the former by half and the latter by almost a third.\n\nChange also came to Des Moines, Iowa, where the school board ended an agreement of at least two decades with the city police department last winter.\n\nDuring the 2017-18 school year, federal data shows Black students represented 42% of all law enforcement referrals in the district, more than twice their share of the student population.\n\nDeborah VanVelzen, an officer with the Des Moines Police Department, patrolled the halls at district schools for 15 years before taking on a new role in late 2019 as youth services coordinator for the police department, overseeing youth mentoring and diversion programs.\n\n“We don’t want to send kids to court. That’s not our goal,” VanVelzen said.\n\nIn her current role, she has noticed racial disparities in court referrals.\n\n“It’s there, you can see it compared to what our city’s demographics are,” VanVelzen said. “People have said in the past that it exists. Then you see the stats, and you’re like, ‘OK, it does.’”\n\nThe Des Moines district acknowledges that school officials help create and sustain the disparities. That means solving the problem, there and elsewhere, will take far more effort than just canceling a contract with police.\n\n“In the community, it came off as SROs are the problem. If it was that easy, we probably would have identified that a long time ago,” said Jake Troja, the district’s director of school climate transformation. “The issue is, systematically, the overuse of law enforcement and underpreparedness of our school system to respond to safety violations and violations of law in an equitable manner.”\n\nThe pattern repeats across Iowa, where Black students were referred to law enforcement at five times the rate of white students. Students with disabilities were referred at twice the rate of the overall student population.\n\nIn incidents involving students with disabilities, often little consideration is given to the student’s individualized education programs and the behavior intervention plans outlined in those documents, said Nathan Kirstein, children’s and investigation staff attorney with Disability Rights Iowa, a federally funded legal assistance and advocacy nonprofit group. Kirstein has represented several families of children younger than 10 who were restrained or detained by police officers after classroom outbursts.\n\n“Were they in places where they were struggling behaviorally? Yes,” Kirstein said. “Did police need to be involved? No. That’s a huge failure on multiple levels.”\n\nSetting boundaries\n\nIn 2014, during the Obama administration, the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice issued joint guidance aimed at ensuring that Black and Latino students were not unfairly disciplined in school.\n\nThe Trump administration rescinded the guidance, arguing that it made schools reluctant to discipline students for unruly or violent behavior because they feared federal discrimination investigations.\n\nIn announcing the decision to roll it back in December 2018, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos cited concerns about “school environments where discipline decisions were based on a student’s race” and maintained that districts should make the final call on student discipline decisions.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, referral rates for students with disabilities and Black, Hispanic and white students all dropped, the Public Integrity analysis shows.\n\nIt’s too soon to know whether racial disparities in school discipline increased or decreased during the Trump administration because the 2017-18 data is the latest available.\n\nIn May, 23 state attorneys general wrote to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Attorney General Merrick Garland, asking them to reissue and strengthen the Obama-era guidance. Twelve Democratic U.S. senators signed a letter requesting similar action.\n\nCatherine Lhamon, who served as assistant secretary for civil rights during the Obama administration, is poised to return to the role. During her confirmation hearing in July, Lhamon said she would push to reinstate the discipline guidance.\n\nThe Department of Education would not make Suzanne Goldberg, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, available for an interview, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nIn June 2020, as other big-city districts cut back their commitment to school police, Philadelphia rebranded its police officers as safety officers and decided they would no longer patrol school hallways. The move was part of a years-long effort to transform the police force and improve interactions between officers and students.\n\nA diversion program launched six years ago has reduced the number of arrests in schools by 84%, according to the district. In 2014, the district directed school officers to stop responding to internal calls related to minor student offenses such as insubordination.\n\nThat should have prevented the incident at Solis-Cohen Elementary, when the officer removed the third grader from class in 2017. But it did not.\n\nAnd the changes in Philadelphia didn’t stop the racial disparities in law enforcement referrals, the 2017-18 data shows.\n\nAbout half of district students are Black. Yet Black students were nearly three-quarters of those referred to law enforcement in Philadelphia during that school year.\n\nThe Philadelphia school district declined to make an official available for an interview. Spokeswoman Monica Lewis sent a statement that said, “Our school safety officers work to provide a safe and secure learning environment for our students and staff.”\n\nIn 2017, as the Philadelphia schools sought to resolve the matter at Solis-Cohen, district leaders enlisted Isaac Gardner, the third grader’s father, to help with a review of school police officer practices. That invitation was the last Gardner heard of the effort.\n\n“They never had plans on doing anything like that,” Gardner said. “Because nothing ever happened.”\n\nCorey Mitchell, Joe Yerardi and Susan Ferriss are journalists at the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative news organization in Washington.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2019/11/18/teachers-stage-walkouts-across-country-protest-charter-schools/2519750001/", "title": "Teachers stage walkouts across the country to protest charter schools", "text": "Editor's note: This is the first in a multipart series that examines the growth of charter schools across the country and how the changing landscape of school choice could affect Arizona, the state with the largest percentage of kids in charter schools.\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. — On a sweltering Saturday in June, as state lawmakers prepared to convene in a special session, one of the state’s most powerful Republicans had payback on his mind.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/04/16/live-poudre-school-district-teachers-walk/520166002/", "title": "Poudre School District teachers stage 'walk-in' over pay, benefits", "text": "As many as 1,000 teachers across Poudre School District gathered before school started on Monday to stage a \"walk-in.\"\n\nWearing red shirts and waving signs, teachers gathered to bring community awareness to education funding at the state level. Their main concerns: teacher pay and retirement benefits.\n\nThey gathered outside various schools before class began. They waved to parents as they dropped off their kids. Many teachers held signs as students arrived in carpool lines, and then walked in to hold class for the day.\n\nTom List, president of the Poudre Teachers Association, estimated between 750 and 1,000 teachers participated across the district.\n\nCecilia Bonertz, a math teacher at Kinard Middle School, said her school has trouble retaining new teachers. She recently watched two good, young teachers leave the district because they couldn't afford to live in Fort Collins and make ends meet, she said.\n\n“We have several young teachers, who are good teachers, who have had to relocate because they can’t afford to live here,” Bonertz said. “Our community is not affordable, and they’re making $37,000 a year.”\n\nTeachers were joined by other supporters. Nick Hoyer regularly volunteers at Traut Core Knowledge Elementary School. That often means helping organize extra fundraisers for the school. One recent project helped update the playground.\n\nHoyer’s two daughters attend the school. He wants to do what he can to invest in their success. Fundraisers are a big part of that, Hoyer said, because schools don’t get the funding they need from the state.\n\nThat’s why Hoyer, a firefighter and paramedic at West Metro Fire Rescue, joined the Monday demonstration.\n\nThe \"walk-in\" comes on the heels of Oklahoma and West Virginia teacher strikes.\n\nIn 2016, Colorado’s average teacher salary — $46,155 — was No. 46 in the nation, according to the National Education Association. That was up from No. 49 the year before. In 2016, West Virginia was No. 48 in the nation and Oklahoma was No. 49.\n\nTraut Principal Alissa McEachern said PSD likely won’t strike.\n\nColorado’s situation is different from Oklahoma and West Virginia, McEachern said. It’s not just teacher pay, it’s the whole system.\n\n“A strike won’t fix TABOR or Gallagher,” McEachern said of two constitutional amendments that she believes have helped to create a broken education funding system. TABOR stands for the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which limits the growth of new taxes and triggers refunds when state tax revenue hits a cap.\n\n“In 2008, we understood why funding got cut,” Kinard teacher Bonertz said. “But in 2018, there’s no excuse.”\n\nShe said the district and the community have been supportive and understanding when it comes to school funding. She’s grateful for all the times the community has come together to pass mill levy overrides and bonds.\n\nPreston Middle School teacher Mary Barela said she participated in the walk-in in hopes of educating parents on the issues.\n\nAt Preston, class sizes are the biggest indicator of the struggle, Barela said. The school holds about 300 more kids than it was built to accommodate, she said.\n\nAnother Preston teacher, Dawn Dupriest, said it used to be unusual to have a class with 27 kids. Now, she said, it’s common to have classes with 35 kids.\n\n“We’ve been out of the recession for almost a decade,” Dupriest said. “It’s time to stop acting like we’re on a starvation diet.”\n\nKruse Elementary School teacher Alison Coatman went to the Capitol on Monday, along with hundreds of other Colorado teachers.\n\nThey called on state legislators to provide additional school funding and to protect teachers’ retirement benefits.\n\nThe House was set to hear Senate Bill 18-200, \"Modifications to PERA Public Employees’ Retirement Association to Eliminate Unfunded Liability,\" which would change teachers’ retirement benefits, ultimately requiring teachers to contribute more of their salary.\n\nBy 10:30 a.m. Monday, the Capitol was “filled with teachers and supporters of public education walking and chanting,” Coatman wrote in a text message. “The atmosphere is energized and filled with passion.”\n\nHoyer said last year, his daughters’ teacher had a heart attack. She’s back to teaching this year. That speaks to teachers’ dedication to a difficult job, he said.\n\n“As a taxpayer,” Hoyer said, “I want my money to go schools, police and fire departments.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2018/04/28/arizona-redfored-teacher-movement-organizers-53-days/560258002/", "title": "Arizona teacher strike: 53 days into the #RedforEd movement", "text": "Seven weeks before leading the largest teacher walkout in recent American history, Noah Karvelis and Dylan Wegela silently stood in amazement.\n\nIt was the night of March 7 and the two teachers, now among the most recognizable faces of the Arizona Educators United group, reflected on what happened earlier that Wednesday.\n\nThousands of Arizona’s teachers and school employees showed up to work wearing red, then posted pictures about it on social media. Karvelis and Wegela had helped coordinate the grassroots effort just days before.\n\n\"We both just looked at each other and said, 'Wow, this is incredible. We really have something here,'\" Karvelis said.\n\nThe simple demonstration, Karvelis and Wegela said, underscored the desire of Arizona's educators to mobilize in their fight to reverse $1 billion in cuts to Arizona public education following the recession and secure better pay.\n\nWhat started as an idea among nearly a dozen educators culminated this week in the closure of more than 1,000 schools impacting 850,000 students, and a sea of more than 50,000 protesters at the Arizona Capitol Thursday.\n\nRELATED: Governor announces budget deal with teacher pay raise\n\nTeachers are expected to hold a third day of walkouts Monday, as the Legislature possibly considers a budget that includes teacher raises and other education leaders introduce an income tax hike ballot proposal.\n\nIt has been 53 days of emotional protests and outcries — a rollercoaster of unprecedented and outspoken political activism among Arizona’s teachers documented on social media threads with one indexed keyword: #RedForEd.\n\n'We’re no longer ashamed'\n\nThe grassroots campaign was born out of years of quiet resentment over diminished school resources.\n\nThe median pay for Arizona elementary school teachers is $44,990, according data tracked by the education nonprofit Expect More Arizona. The organization ranks Arizona 49th in the nation for pay, when adjusted for cost of living.\n\nThe stigma of being a broke teacher has vaporized, melted away by a tide of frustrations and newfound empowerment that crosses political lines for most educators.\n\n\"People have come out of their shell and are no longer ashamed to share the uncomfortable parts of education,\" said Catherine Barrett, a master teacher in the Phoenix Union High School District and an Arizona Educators United organizer.\n\nRELATED: How much are Arizona teachers paid?\n\n\"We don't have to hide that we're making these low salaries that really diminish our profession,\" Barrett said. \"We're no longer ashamed because more people are coming out.\"\n\nIn the weeks that followed the March 7 demonstration, a Paradise Valley teacher went viral after posting her $35,490 salary on Facebook, questioning in a long post to her friends why she even needed her college degree.\n\nA Pendergast school district special-education teacher broke into tears while protesting at the Capitol, telling reporters that, at age 37, she had to move back home with her parents and couldn't afford to send her daughter to college.\n\nThousands of others have commented and posted on Facebook and Twitter their tales of outdated textbooks and dilapidated buildings, ballooning classroom sizes, second and third jobs, and the postponement of starting families because they can't afford it.\n\nNow, those tales are the common thread holding together what Wegela calls \"an education revolution\" that spans across Arizona and into other states such as Colorado, West Virginia and Oklahoma.\n\nFinding their way to Arizona\n\nSeveral of the teachers leading the Arizona Educators United group are outsiders to Arizona's education landscape.\n\nRebecca Garelli, 30, and a teacher in the Alhambra Elementary School District who introduced the idea of \"walk-in\" demonstrations, came here in July from Chicago, where she participated in the 2012 teachers' union strike.\n\nWegela, 25, a Michigan transplant, is in his second year teaching in the Cartwright School District.\n\nKarvelis, 23, is a second-year teacher in the Littleton Elementary School District from Pecatonica, Illinois — population 2,195. While at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, he applied to teach at schools in Alaska, Colorado, Montana, Wisconsin, New York, Maine and Utah.\n\nRELATED: Voters could have say on education funding, teacher pay\n\nKarvelis wanted to leave home for \"an adventure.\" In early 2016, a few months before his graduation, a professor suggested Arizona, where schools were years into a persistent shortage of qualified teachers.\n\nKarvelis said he knew \"literally nothing\" about Arizona's education landscape. He'd soon find out.\n\nThe art teacher at his school, Tres Rios Service Academy in Tolleson, quit early into the year and was never replaced. Her students for much of the year were split into other classes, including his.\n\nA first-year teacher, he lived paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" Karvelis said of his first year. \"Everyone's first year is difficult, and my experience was as well. It was a tough year.\"\n\nKarvelis and the art teacher both were singular data points that helped tell the severity of the state's teacher landscape — one rife with with educators who are young and still learning how to be effective, and teachers who quit abruptly.\n\nMore than one-fifth of 46,000 Arizona teachers in 2016-17 were either in their first three years of teaching or lacked the basic qualifications, such as formal training.\n\nA survey by the Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association found 465 teachers abandoned or resigned their positions within the first four weeks of that school year. The following year, that figure would nearly double.\n\nWegela, also unaware of Arizona's ongoing funding issues, came to Arizona for \"a new experience\" and because his brother lives here.\n\n\"The second that I got here, I could tell there was a lot of frustration and animosity among teachers,\" Wegela said.\n\nA movement started on Facebook\n\nIf years of internal frustration is the fire fueling the #RedForEd movement, then the creation of the Arizona Educators United private Facebook group — now with nearly 52,000 members — was the match that lit that fire.\n\nAs educators in West Virginia were on their fifth day of their statewide walkout, Karvelis replied to a tweet about the walkout by Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association.\n\nKarvelis said in his reply that \"most of my colleagues that I have spoken with are supportive of a strike -- especially with the current momentum and WV's success. Several have been talking about it for months (even years) now, as well. What are your thoughts?\"\n\nThomas advised them to coordinate \"local actions\" that might help gauge whether educators in Arizona could mobilize the way they did in West Virginia.\n\nBarrett, the Phoenix Union teacher, had been monitoring the discussion and sent Karvelis a direct message. An educator for 16 years, she was frustrated by the six reading teachers she's seen leave over the years. She told Karvelis in their private Twitter chat that the schools in her district could get on board with a demonstration.\n\nThey spent time editing a flyer on Google docs. That weekend, a group of them created the Arizona Educators United Facebook page.\n\nDays later, the first #RedForEd event was underway.\n\nKarvelis said the moment \"was just me in the place at the right time. The messenger could’ve been anybody because there has been that much energy\" among educators,\n\nHe said his involvement in the educator movement stems from his mother, a school librarian who supported their family during the recession when his father lost his job and helped pay for his college.\n\nRELATED: Dated textbooks, soiled carpet: Teachers share classroom images\n\n'A misstep could set us back'\n\nAmong the organizers, there is a constant recognition that the momentum of public support they've gathered — the support that helped give them the confidence to set a walkout date — could be lost with any potential misstep.\n\nThat recognition is \"certainly on the minds of the organizers in the group,\" Karvelis said.\n\n\"A misstep could set us back for maybe a year, maybe 10 years. Who knows? It could derail the entire movement,\" he said. \"We remain confident because we know we are fighting a good fight.\"\n\nThe teacher-organizers plan many of their strategies in hours-long meetings and conference calls at the end of school days.\n\nThe group has mostly relied on a strategy dependent on gathering input from the group of educators on the Facebook page. They've posted polls, studied comments and organized a statewide in-person walkout vote.\n\nIt's a method that has drawn both praise and criticism among members along the way.\n\nMany have said or commented that the strategies have been important for getting a clear understanding on where most people lie on issues, such as what educators wanted to demand from state leaders and a poll asking educators whether they supported walking out.\n\nOthers, including several educators who from the start of the movement have expressed enthusiasm in walking out, have commented that strategies such as internal polling waste precious time and momentum for action.\n\nKarvelis said the method has helped organizers when they've felt \"lost.\"\n\nAn example that Karvelis offered was when organizers first began discussing the logistics of a walkout, such as how would school districts handle the disruption, and how would organizers \"authorize\" the walkout.\n\nNot all educators have been eager to walk out.\n\nTwenty-two percent of 57,000 educators and school employees voted against walking out in a poll that helped influence organizers to set a walkout date.\n\nThe main goal for the organizers has always been clear: getting Arizona education funding levels back to 2008, when the state spent $924 more per student than it does in 2018. But the path toward getting there, not so much.\n\nThe process has moved fast. The organizers, most with little to no experience in political organization, have learned on the go.\n\nWithin four weeks of the March 7 demonstration, thousands of educators and their supporters gathered at the Capitol after school hours, and AEU organizers announced their list of five demands of Gov. Doug Ducey and the Legislature.\n\nRELATED: What are Arizona teachers' 5 demands?\n\nLess than a month after that rally, tens of thousands of educators and school employees walked out, closing 1,000-plus schools in nearly 110 districts and charters, impacting 850,000 Arizona students.\n\n\"That's been one of the challenges with this moving so quickly. You just want to put one foot in front of the other, but at the same time you’ve got to look three moves down the road,\" Karvelis said.\n\nEducators with the #RedForEd movement want to restore a decade of cuts to education funding. They want immediate 20 percent teacher raises, which would still put them below the national median. They want competitive pay for support staff such as teachers' aides and cafeteria workers. They want guaranteed annual salary increases. And they want no tax cuts until Arizona reaches the national average in education spending.\n\nThe total price of educators' demands would likely cost the state billions.\n\nOrganizers under the microscope\n\nAs the #RedForEd movement has grown, so has the public scrutiny of some of its members.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers and critics of Arizona Educators United have accused some of its leaders of having partisan intentions.\n\nRep. Maria Syms, R-Paradise Valley, in an op-ed column published in The Arizona Republic's editorial pages, called Karvelis a political operative who moved to Arizona to carry out a socialist movement.\n\nDuring a speech on the floor of the Arizona House, Syms said she wrote the column to show the political leanings and methods of Karvelis.\n\nAn article on the conservative website Breitbart.com and The Broomhead Show mined past social media posts from Karvelis and Derek Hall, a Tucson teacher and AEU organizer, apparently to emphasize their left political leanings.\n\nRep. Noel Campbell, a Republican lawmaker who has proposed a temporary education sales-tax measure, said this week he believed the educator movement was \"partisan, to a point.\"\n\n“I think they (organizers) want the Republican majority out of the House and the Senate and they'll use this strike to influence the public opinion,\" Campbell told The Republic when he discussed his proposal, \"and we're trying to solve the ... problem.”\n\nGov. Doug Ducey in a radio interview days before he announced his #20by2020 teacher pay raise proposal referred to the #RedForEd movement as a \"political circus\" being coordinated by a political operative, seemingly in reference to Karvelis.\n\nKarvelis is the campaign manager for Kathy Hoffman, an educator and Democratic candidate for Superintendent of Public Instruction. Hoffman has never held public office.\n\nAn online resume shows Karvelis volunteered on the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign while in college. He also canvassed in 2017 for Knock Every Door, which describes itself on its website as \"a volunteer-led organization created in the wake of the disastrous 2016 election.\"\n\nRELATED: Soon-to-be teachers say outcome of #RedForEd will determine their futures\n\nOn the same of March 7 #RedForEd demonstration, Thomas, the Arizona Education Association president, held a news conference endorsing David Garcia, who is running as a Democrat for governor.\n\nThe timing of the announcement came under criticism from many Republican political observers who've associated the endorsement with the #RedForEd movement.\n\nArizona Educators United is nonpartisan and leaders have said it will not endorse any political candidates.\n\nThe AEU group has been allied with Arizona's teachers' union. Karvelis said the AEA has provided the group of organizers with, guidance, infrastructure and resources.\n\n\"They're threatened by the power that educators have right now,\" Karvelis said of his critics.\n\n\"It's an attempt to kill the messenger and destroy this movement. But the movement's far too strong for that. That's been one of the most encouraging things. Educators have had enough.\"\n\nLeading the way\n\nA group of Arizona Educators United organizers led Thursday's march of 30,000 people to the Arizona State Capitol on the first day of the walkout.\n\nGarelli, Wegela, Barrett and Tucson teacher Derek Harris held a large #RedForEd banner as they led marchers on a two-mile walk to the Capitol.\n\nThe crowd stretched about a mile-and-a-half. At every block and corner, it seemed, supporters clad in red stood near sidewalks and intersections with smartphones in hand and their children next to them. They wanted to document the moment.\n\nOnce at the Capitol, organizers took turns delivering speeches about the collective power of the movement, repeatedly telling the crowd of educators and supporter that it would be up to them to bring the investment in public education that they're seeking.\n\n\"If we don't stand up and bring a change, the people sitting in those chairs right there will not do it,\" #RedForEd organizer Noah Karvelis said from the rally's stage, pointing in the direction of the Arizona House and Senate and Governor's Tower.\n\nAfter Karvelis delivered his speech, he, Wegela and Garelli embraced in a group hug.\n\nThe rally program would be cut short by about five speakers. Temperatures nearly hit 100 degrees. Officials said they'd responded to five heat-related calls. The sheer density of the crowd of more than 50,000 made it difficult for emergency response crews to maneuver.\n\nNear the stage, Harris was helping a woman struggling with the heat. He carried her over the stage's barricade, where a crew of people tried to cool her down. Harris tried to shade the woman.\n\nThe organizers decided right then to send everyone home early.\n\nAbout 6:30 a.m. the next morning, organizers hauled truckloads of bottled water for a second hot day at the Capitol. More than 4,000, according to the Department of Public Safety, would participate in that second rally.\n\nRELATED: 4,000 protesters return to Capitol for second day of teacher walkout\n\nRachel Johnson, 45 and a teacher at Mansfeld Magnet Middle School in Tucson, walked through the near empty Capitol courtyard.\n\nJohnson said she felt \"energized\" by the sea of red that swarmed the Capitol on the first day of the walkout.\n\nHer story is similar to those of her colleagues. Johnson has taught in Arizona for eight years. She makes less than $40,000 annually and can't afford to pay for her son's health insurance.\n\nTwo weeks ago, she had her water shut off from her home.\n\n\"I get paid on a Friday, and by the following Tuesday, I'm having to borrow money from my father-in-law. It's awful,\" Johnson said. \"I made two and a half times more money when I was a server and a bartender.\"\n\nJohnson wanted to go back to school Monday. Her students needed her. She told them Wednesday they were the reason she was walking out.\n\nThomas on Friday announced the walkout would continue at least through Monday.\n\nJohnson Friday morning was unsure how much longer the walkout would last. She expressed confidence when she said she felt its impact on educators would endure.\n\n\"I feel like this movement picks up speed every minute,\" Johnson said.\n\nRepublic reporters Richard Ruelas and Dustin Gardiner contributed to this article.\n\nReach the reporter at Ricardo.Cano@gannett.com and 602-444-8236.

Did it help?", "text": "DELBARTON, W.Va. – The coal miner’s son had studied his county’s rough-and-tumble labor history, written his dissertation on it, taught his high school students about it.\n\nNow Eric Starr, who knew history never repeats itself, felt history doing just that. And he was part of it.\n\nStanding at a secret meeting like those held by striking miners a century ago, dressed in black except for a red bandana like the ones those miners wore, he exhorted his fellow public school teachers to defy the governor and their own unions and stay out on strike.\n\n“I’m not going back,’’ he said. “We’ve been sold out!’’\n\nThat was last winter. Mingo County teachers – with no legal right to strike, no encouragement from their union and little prospect of victory – became the first in West Virginia to vote to walk out over their health plan and their pay.\n\nThe one-day walkout spread.\n\nOn Feb. 22, 2018, teachers across West Virginia went on strike, sparking a movement that spread to other red states, including Oklahoma and Arizona, and then, this year, to Los Angeles and Denver. On Thursday, teachers plan to strike in Oakland, California.\n\nBut the 2018 West Virginia teacher strike, which changed so much nationally, didn’t change that much back where it started. And on Tuesday, West Virginia teachers again staged a walkout – just to maintain the status quo.\n\nStarr sees the irony.\n\n“I love seeing what’s going on elsewhere,’’ he says. He’s 28, in his fourth year of teaching. “But West Virginia can be a slow place to change.’’\n\nWhen the 2018 West Virginia strike ended March 7, it seemed like a great victory for public school teachers, who for years had been blamed widely for the failures of American schools, and for West Virginia schools in particular.\n\nBut history, even when it repeats itself, isn’t that simple. The 2018 strike’s legacy is still in doubt.\n\nThe state’s promise of a dedicated funding source for public employees’ health insurance – the main issue in the strike – remains unfulfilled.\n\nDespite a 5 percent raise, teacher pay remains far behind neighboring states’, a disparity that explains why the year began with 700 classroom vacancies, or 4 percent of the state teacher force.\n\nThe settlement did not increase the number of school specialists, like counselors and nurses, to help students from families scarred by the state’s opioid epidemic.\n\nThe teachers’ vow during the strike to “remember in November’’ produced only mixed results. Republicans, most of whom opposed teacher demands, kept control of both houses in the Legislature. This year they revived proposals that helped prompt the 2018 strike. Teachers and service personnel went on strike again.\n\nThe walkout on Tuesday closed schools in nearly every West Virginia county, and lawmakers sidelined the education legislation teachers were protesting. That's a victory for teachers.\n\nBut, teachers say, they are still waiting for the kinds of policies that would show them respect. Suspicious of the state's GOP leaders, teachers are striking again Wednesday, to ensure lawmakers don't revive the bill in question. Nearly all schools are closed.\n\nTeachers in America:No matter where they work, they feel disrespect\n\n'Any talks of striking'?\n\nIf last year's strike wasn’t revolutionary, it was remarkable.\n\nAt a time when organized labor seems in terminal decline, a national public school teachers’ movement emerged from the coalfields of southern West Virginia, one of the most isolated and conservative corners of America.\n\nAt a time when political partisanship is peaking – and despite the Democratic slant of teachers’ unions – the strike united Clinton and Trump voters. It was a political unicorn: a “liberal” cause advocated by conservatives.\n\nBut it was no anomaly. Children here are raised on stories of battles between miners and mine companies in what came to be known as “Bloody Mingo.’’ Many of the teachers who walked out were first on picket lines when they were in diapers.\n\nYet these old passions might not have been revived without a weapon the miners never enjoyed – social media.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2018, a teacher posted an innocent query on a Facebook page: “Just curious if there are any talks of striking.’’\n\nSoon, there was talk of little else.\n\nPoll:Even when teachers strike, Americans give them high grades. Unions fare worse.\n\nWelcome to the Mountain State\n\nJay O’Neal is a middle school social studies teacher who moved to West Virginia in 2015. After his first year, he realized that because of increasing health insurance costs, he’d take home $450 less than the previous year.\n\nTeachers across the nation lost ground economically during and after the Great Recession, as states slashed education spending. West Virginia, whose signature coal industry has collapsed, ranked 48th in teacher pay before the strike, according to the National Education Association.\n\nYet teaching in West Virginia has gotten harder as students have gotten needier, partly because of the opioid crisis. Many are in a household with neither biological parent, and teachers sometimes must find ways to keep kids fed over the weekend, or get their electricity turned back on. One of O’Neal’s students found his father with a needle sticking out of his arm, dead of an overdose.\n\nO’Neal wasn’t born into West Virginia’s “strike culture.’’ But in October 2017 he started a Facebook group page to unite members of the state’s two main teacher unions, the West Virginia Education Association and the rival West Virginia Federation of Teachers.\n\nHis timing was propitious. The state’s public employee health insurance agency had announced a new round of cost-saving measures. One based premiums for family coverage on the household’s total income, rather than just the teacher’s. Another was a wellness program that would effectively penalize those who didn’t do things like provide personal biometric data, go to the gym or wear an activity tracker like a Fitbit.\n\nThe program was anathema to famously independent-minded West Virginians. What business is it of some bean-counter what my spouse makes? Or what I weigh?\n\nO’Neal heard plenty of grumbling in the teachers’ lounge, but little or nothing in public or on Facebook. His teachers' page had only about 1,000 members. “I don’t get it,’’ he told a friend. “Nothing’s happening.’’\n\nIt was as if \"strike\" was a dirty word. “Everyone was thinking about it,’’ recalls Eric Starr. “Then someone worked up the guts to say it.’’\n\nStrike fever\n\nThat someone was Rachel Kittle, a 32-year-old special education teacher from – no surprise – the coalfields. She didn’t feel gutsy, however. Striking was just what she and her colleagues were already talking about.\n\nShortly after her Jan. 6 post – “any talks of striking?’’ – O’Neal got a message from a friend: “Have you looked at Facebook?’’\n\nTEACHERS' VICTORY: Showed 'power of women'\n\nThere was Kittle’s query, followed by an explosion of comments. The first was dismissive: “The unions are terrified and the teachers are unwilling.’’ But there were other voices:\n\n“Not all teachers.’’\n\n“There will not be an end to the cuts until a line is drawn.’’\n\n“As long as you take it without protesting, they will keep giving it to you.’’\n\n“Teachers went on strike in 1990. How did that get organized?’’\n\nSoon, O’Neal couldn’t keep up with requests to join the group.\n\nStrike fever spiked after Gov. Jim Justice, who’d been elected as a Democrat with union support before becoming a Republican to back Trump, proposed a mere 1 percent raise in his State of the State address.\n\nDale Lee, president of the WVEA union, felt compelled to address the topic at a rally on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Teachers expecting a call to the barricades were disappointed.\n\n“I've heard a lot of people talk about, \"It's time for a walkout; it's time for a strike,' \" Lee said. “It's not the first step in what we should do to achieve our goals.’’\n\nBut this was a battle in which union leaders would be followers.\n\nIt started in the coalfields\n\nOn Jan. 23, Mingo County teachers became the first in the state to decide to skip school for a day to go to the state capital to protest. They called it “Fed Up Friday.’’ Several other southern coalfield counties quickly followed suit.\n\nWithout a right to strike or bargain collectively, the teacher unions had become more practiced at lobbying the state officials who set their members’ compensation than at confronting them. Now, they struggled to catch up with the rank and file. A WVFT official told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that the union didn’t know how many counties had decided to walk out, but was sending staffers to county meetings “to find out what’s going on.’’\n\nOn Fed Up Friday, teachers from the coalfields gathered in the capitol rotunda in Charleston to protest. As they chanted, colleagues around the state watched.\n\nA month later, on Feb. 22, after another one-day walkout and a statewide strike authorization vote, 20,000 teachers went out.\n\nTimeline:How the 2018 West Virginia teacher strike evolved\n\nSchool was closed in all 55 counties. Superintendents, already facing a teacher shortage, didn’t have nearly enough subs to hold classes. The teachers would never lose a day’s pay.\n\nPublic opinion seemed with the teachers. When the attorney general said the strike was illegal and offered to go to court on behalf of county school boards, he got no takers.\n\nFive days into the strike, the governor and the union leaders, who’d been negotiating, announced a settlement, including a 5 percent raise. They told teachers to go back to work two days later, on March 1.\n\nBut the Senate’s Republican leaders had not signed off; the rank and file had not been consulted; and the governor, some teachers pointed out, was a coal-company owner. “We weren’t gonna fall for his word,’’ Kittle recalls. Teachers outside the capitol chanted: “Back to the table!’’ and “We got sold out!’’\n\nAt county meetings like the one in Mingo where Eric Starr spoke up, the rank and file agreed. They weren’t going back – they were going wildcat.\n\nThe strikes spread\n\nMeanwhile, in Arizona, a teacher named Noah Karvelis had started a Facebook page like the one in West Virginia. Most of his colleagues supported a strike in their state, he tweeted, “especially with … WV’s success.’’\n\nHe created a Facebook event that called on Arizona teachers to wear red: “West Virginia is showing the entire nation what happens when teachers stand in solidarity.’’\n\nFinally, West Virginia’s Republican Senate agreed to a 5 percent raise for all state employees. And the governor promised to freeze health insurance premiums for 18 months; to create a task force to find a dedicated source of health insurance funding; and to waive higher costs for workers who didn’t comply with the wellness plan.\n\nOn March 7, after nine canceled school days, the teachers went back to class.\n\nBut teachers in other states started to walk out. On April 2, Oklahoma and some counties in Kentucky; April 26, Arizona; April 27, Colorado. On May 16, North Carolina teachers staged a one-day walkout and rally.\n\nA glass half empty?\n\nA year later, it’s easy to emphasize what the West Virginia teacher strike didn’t do.\n\nThe raise, which averaged about $2,000 per teacher, was hardly life-changing. It let teachers pay off some bills or pay down some loans, or maybe buy a car. But their colleagues continue to flee to higher-paying districts in other states. Mingo High School, for instance, has been trying since May to replace its choir director, who left for a similar job in Ohio that paid $10,000 more. No one has even applied for the vacancy.\n\nAs for health insurance, the governor has proposed $150 million in the state budget to stabilize employees’ costs. But there still has been no agreement on how to insulate such funding from the yearly budget process.\n\nThe strike’s political legacy is also unclear. Some fault teachers for not mobilizing enough relatives and friends to vote; some say teachers themselves didn’t turn out in enough numbers, reviving memories of the pre-strike complacency that frustrated activists like O’Neal.\n\nWhatever its cause, the teachers’ failure in November to elect more supporters in the Legislature came back to haunt them this year.\n\nThe broad education bill that prompted Tuesday’s walkout would have given teachers another 5 percent raise, but also allowed the state to establish its first charter schools. It would have let parents take taxpayer money for their child's education in public school and spend it on options such as private school. Those were the sorts of issues behind the 2018 strike.\n\nTo kill legislation that hadn't even been passed, teachers had to strike again. They won a victory in ensuring their situation didn't get worse. But it also didn't get better.\n\nThe old-time miners went on strike against mine owners. Today, public teachers ultimately strike against taxpayers, personal or commercial. Taxpayers are voters, and voters say they’re for higher teacher salaries. They also say they’re against higher taxes.\n\nTalk of the nation\n\nIn one way, the strike didn’t so much revive history as reverse it.\n\nWith the fall of coal, a region once famed for sometimes-cussed independence became synonymous instead with a fatalistic acceptance of the status quo and a dependence on welfare, from food stamps to disability pay.\n\nThe strike, however, put West Virginia suddenly in the vanguard of the middle working class.\n\nNo one personifies that reversal more than Robin Ellis, a Mingo High English teacher who is also a grandmother, a social conservative, a Republican and one of the 69 percent of West Virginians (and 83 percent of Mingo residents) who voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nShe’s also the daughter of an 83-year-old retired union miner who went on strike several times.\n\nDuring last year's strike, Ellis stood on her town’s main street to flag down motorists and, as traffic backed up, make the teachers’ case. And, like young Eric Starr, she rose at a meeting after the tentative settlement to urge her colleagues to stay out.\n\nShe says the strike was about more than money or respect. It was about an obligation to the generations past. “The word ‘strike’ prompts something in us here,’’ she says.\n\n“I don’t think my daddy has ever been prouder of me.’’", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/19/us/american-classes-teaching-russia-ukraine-invasion/index.html", "title": "How kids in an American military town are responding to Russia's ...", "text": "Watertown, New York CNN —\n\nIt was not quite 8 a.m. and Ambur Misercola’s first-period history class was still shaking off slumber as she told them of a woman detained in Moscow’s Pushkin Square – not unlike the historic Public Square a short drive north that anchors this American military town.\n\nYulia Zhivtsova’s crime, as it were, was taking two Harry Potter books to the square on the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – one from the Ravenclaw House edition and one from the Hufflepuff version. As most young people know, the color for Ravenclaw is blue and for Hufflepuff, yellow. The book covers correlate. Thus, as Zhivtsova sat beneath a lamppost reading, the green patina likeness of poet Alexander Pushkin watching over her, she appeared to hold a Ukrainian flag.\n\n“But she’s just reading Harry Potter, right?” Misercola asked her students. “Those are kind of interesting forms of protest that they can still get in trouble for.”\n\nOver the next two days, Misercola would continue to challenge her students to think critically about the crisis, assigning projects centered on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with world history students examining media influence and economics pupils looking at the effects on markets.\n\nFor some, it’s a straight line from the war zone 4,500 miles away to their classroom. While about 50 of the more than 1,000 students at Watertown High School have a parent in the armed forces, most of them stationed at nearby Fort Drum, others have friends and relatives in the Army. That’s not counting the children of veterans and military contractors.\n\nFears of loved ones being deployed had been largely allayed by the time Russia’s incursion entered its third week in mid-March, but concern lingered. Familiar with the former USSR and NATO expansion, students worried about Vladimir Putin’s unpredictable nature and World War III.\n\nThe Pobletes (from left, Inee, Jennizor, Jeric and Grace) are among dozens of Fort Drum families at Watertown High. Heather Ainsworth for CNN\n\nFor sophomore Mason Dimmick, the anxiety is personal. The 16-year-old wore a sweatshirt from a joint military drill at South Korea’s Rodriguez Live Fire Complex, an American flag on its sleeve. A US Army lanyard was tucked into his hood. His mother gave him the hoodie. It was too big for her. His stepdad is in the military, too. Though unlikely, he’s pondered moving to Texas to live with relatives if they were deployed, he said, but it isn’t his only worry.\n\n“She’s my mom,” he said. “I don’t want to lose her or anything.”\n\nDepending on the class, Misercola’s students chose assignments from among several options, including fact-checking social media, studying the flow of aid or sanctions, writing a letter to a TV station, comparing political slants in reporting, sketching a political cartoon or tracking oil prices.\n\nWhat they picked offers a glimpse into today’s teenage mind. Tech was a popular theme. Weaponry, namely Javelin missiles, and nuclear power plants were regularly raised, as were Westerners supporting Ukrainians by renting Airbnbs they didn’t intend to visit. Sophomore Aydin Amell compared the plummeting Russian ruble to a V-Buck, a currency used in Fortnite. Elon Musk – with his Starlink satellites and evacuees relying on their Teslas’ “camp mode” – was regularly brought up.\n\n“Even though he’s not a country, he has a lot of money to help,” senior Makena Babcock, 18, explained during her econ presentation.\n\nSeniors Habib Bencomo and Genesis Smith, 18, focused on oil, canceled flights and Russian banks. Misercola pulled Habib aside, offering praise for the context he included – all the more impressive, she said, considering English is his second language; he moved last year to Watertown from Culiacán, Mexico, to be with his mother and brother, who is stationed at Fort Drum.\n\nHabib’s interest in gas costs spiked when the 17-year-old gym rat noticed prices rising each time he drove to his workouts. “I asked myself why it’s increasing very fast, so I did an investigation,” he said.\n\nAmbur Misercola, right, helps Habib Bencomo, 17, with a supply-and-demand exercise during econ class. Heather Ainsworth for CNN\n\nRefugees were another recurring topic. Mason presented a project on evacuation routes. The fighting seems senseless to Mason, but it made less sense that, at the time, most of the proposed escape routes led to Russia or Belarus, he told his classmates, pointing to the massive monitor supplanting the chalkboard behind it.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg and a 3D-printed “dissent collar” hanging on the wall above him, Mason told the class, “They have no choice but to go to their enemy nations … to survive from the war and they don’t have a place to live.”\n\nLater, he confided to CNN, “I don’t want to imagine what’s going to happen to them.”\n\nWaning fears of World War III\n\nThe kids were on break when Russia invaded. Misercola and Jo-Ann Webb-Bennett, an educator of 27 years, were teaching the Cold War before students left. Misercola had been delivering lessons on the Warsaw Pact and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, while Webb-Bennett’s charges had been studying NATO. Both were ideal transitions.\n\n“The majority of the kids came back on (February 28) with snippets of information and that we were going to be starting World War III, so there was a real need to talk about the historical background rather than just what was on the news on a day-to-day flash because kids don’t watch the news,” Webb-Bennett said.\n\n“They watch TikTok,” Misercola chimed.\n\n“Yes,” Webb-Bennett continued, “and so the pieces of information that they were getting were tearing at their heartstrings and they were scared at the same time, so they needed some historical background.”\n\nA 2005 graduate, Ambur Misercola has taught at Watertown High for 10 years. Her half brother attends classes today. Heather Ainsworth for CNN\n\nMisercola handled queries about war and the draft in a straightforward manner, she said. Yes, the young men would have to register with the Selective Service, but the United States hasn’t conscripted soldiers since the Vietnam War, she’d explain.\n\n“It’s too early to claim it’s World War III,” she said. “We’re doing economic sanctions to try and prevent further war from escalating and that they don’t need to worry about being drafted at this point. We have one of the largest already standing militaries, and if it happens, we’ll deal with it then.”\n\nKellie Ortiz and Clayton Day, both 18, aren’t terribly rattled. Clayton’s dad is a retired Marine who works in a civilian role at Fort Drum. Clayton would like to join the Corps himself. The specter of world war is concerning, but the draft isn’t.\n\n“I’m not too worried about it because I would go first, personally,” the senior said.\n\nKellie has cousins in the Army and plans on joining himself in August. His predilection for ammo and gear is steering him toward logistics, he said. He isn’t worried about war, he said, adding Russia would’ve stood down if Donald Trump were still in charge.\n\nThe sentiment is shared by classmate Robert Carbray. Even if war had erupted under the last administration, he said, “Trump would’ve done something about it.” The 16-year-old wants to be a US Air Force pilot, he said, and while Watertown’s proximity to Fort Drum worried him initially – as does Putin’s distaste for President Joe Biden – he has faith the international community can stave off broader conflict.\n\n“Everyone’s just smarter,” Robert said. “It would be putting the whole world at risk.”\n\nSophomore Cameron Baird walks past a classmate's political cartoon skewering Russia's stance on a free press. Heather Ainsworth for CNN\n\nNot everyone is sold on military service. Jeric Poblete’s dad is a sergeant first class at Fort Drum. The 16-year-old history buff just finished a book on the Korean War his father recommended. He, too, wants to pursue a career in aviation, but the negatives of the military route – post-traumatic stress disorder and other possible ailments atop the list – outweigh the positives, he said.\n\nJeric was mildly worried by the prospect of his dad’s deployment, but his fears have subsided. He’s also certain the conflict won’t reach American shores.\n\n“I personally have no concern over what’s going to happen here at home,” the sophomore said. “As for World War III, I highly doubt it will escalate into a global conflict.”\n\nFor all those confident everything will be fine, there are classmates who remain unsettled, especially when it comes to Putin.\n\n“It’s not stopping, so we don’t know where it will go,” said Micaiah Saint-Val, 16, whose dad is a retired Fort Drum serviceman. “People don’t really know what (Putin’s) doing.”\n\nCameron Baird is the son of an Air Force retiree. Though he’s “not super concerned” about war spreading, he remains uneasy about the Russian leader.\n\n“Basically, no one should fire any nukes, but we don’t know about the stability of Putin – so that’s a little concerning.” the 15-year-old said.\n\nAsked why he focused on free speech for his history project, Cameron Baird, 15, replied, \"Well, it's a basic human right.\" Heather Ainsworth for CNN\n\nFrom industrial hub to Army town\n\nThe wind whipped outside while students worked. Spells of sideways snow are common in March. The 12-foot piles of white stuff plowed into every edge of the high school parking lot stand as testament, emboldened by the toe-numbing nip in the air.\n\nThe city of 25,000 sits in North Country, tucked between the Adirondacks and Lake Ontario, both exacerbating the chill. The Thousand Islands Bridge into Ontario, Canada, is a 40-minute drive up Interstate 81.\n\nA mile and a half from Watertown High sits the Public Square that Misercola cited in her lesson on protests. Established in 1805, it’s on the National Register of Historic Places. Its former epicenter, Hotel Woodruff – which boasted Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony and Ulysses Grant among its VIPs – was razed long before students were born, but the square still hosts dozens of multistory masonry rows dating back a century or more.\n\nTroops were in the area long before Fort Drum. Infantry soldiers were stationed at nearby Sackets Harbor to enforce an 1807 trade embargo and later to fight in the War of 1812.\n\nFarms, mills and factories soon dotted the periphery of the Black River, which runs fast through town en route to Lake Ontario. Pine Camp (now Fort Drum) was built at the outset of the city’s heyday in 1908. Watertown began morphing from an industrial hub to a military town during World War II, hastened as industry was lured outside the state. The terrain and climate made it an excellent training ground during the Korean conflict, and the abundant forest allowed the military to test Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.\n\nJefferson County, where Watertown serves as seat, takes pride in providing troops for every major war since its 1805 inception – as evidenced in the 50-foot-tall Soldier and Sailor Monument and the obelisk honoring 20th-century war veterans on the Public Square.\n\nAn American flag waves in the bed of a pickup truck passing through Watertown's historic Public Square. Heather Ainsworth for CNN\n\nIn Thompson Park – designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who created New York’s Central Park – stands a monument to the 10th Mountain Division, one of the most deployed units in the US military. Division troops have called Fort Drum home since 1984. With 15,000 soldiers and almost 5,000 civilian and contracted employees, it’s the county’s largest employer, contributing almost $1.5 billion to the area in 2020.\n\nYet it isn’t all industry and military. Watertown has numerous illustrious daughters and sons, including former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother, ex-CIA Director Allen Dulles, who’ve lent their surname to the 11-story state building near downtown. The city also inspired a Harry Chapin song, and for Frank Sinatra, a whole damned album.\n\nA portrait of one of Watertown High’s most famous alumni hangs in a second-floor hallway: actor Viggo Mortensen, of “The Lord of the Rings” fame. Misercola – who graduated in 2005 with her twin, Brittany, now an Air Force surgeon – recalls “fangirling too hard” when the 1976 grad visited the supermarket where she worked as a teen. The movie star’s question about tomatoes left her speechless and pointing like a mime, she said, her customary smile spreading beneath blushed cheeks.\n\nThe tools to untangle a modern conflict\n\nIn 2019, a writer for The Atlantic dubbed Watertown “the least politically prejudiced place in America,” a title embraced and debated by locals, and the projects from Misercola’s students wielded a variety of leanings.\n\nWhile the majority of students’ sympathies fall with Ukraine, one young scholar compared NATO’s expansion to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Another called out the hypocrisy of the United States rebuking Russia, considering its own warmongering.\n\nFrom left, sophomores Zander Gray, Jack Rathbun, Trent Smith and Mason Rumble listen to a presentation. Heather Ainsworth for CNN\n\nPerhaps it’s a product of Misercola’s neutrality in class. She wants students to consider all sides and contemplate how multiple variables drive outcomes.\n\n“We talk relatively frequently in (class) about how history is told from the viewpoint of the victor, so by having that discussion we get to look at this as it’s happening in real time and say, ‘OK, so what would the story be if Ukraine wins? And what will the story be if Putin wins, or Russia?’” she said.\n\nHence, several students opting to don fact-checker hats for their projects. Kimberlie DiLeonardo, 15, identified three images on social media purportedly from Ukraine – a troop standoff, an explosion and a crying child – that actually had nothing to do with the invasion.\n\n“It can get out of control when it comes to fake news,” the sophomore told the class. “It can cause more conflicts and make small situations grow larger.”\n\nConner Cantwell, 16, his bangs swooping out from the hood of his Green Bay Packers sweatshirt, said he used CBS, CNN, Fox and The New York Times to determine the veracity of reports on a ceasefire. He showed video of a reporter sparring with a State Department flak over evidence of Russian “false flag” operations.\n\nFellow sophomore Andrea Doan presented 12 methods for detecting fake news. One of the steps: “Check your own biases automatically.” The 15-year-old conceded she had trouble doing that when she first learned of the invasion via TikTok. What she knows of past wars worries her, but nothing like the TikTok of Ukrainian siblings recounting how their parents left home on an errand and never came back.\n\n“That’s just so messed up and so sad,” she said. “I cried about it, of course.”\n\nHer friend, Jillian Jones, 17, who also learned of the invasion on TikTok, added, “All these innocent people are being attacked for no reason. They’re shooting hospitals with children inside. It’s so sad. …. Being in the house hearing bombs, I’d probably start crying.”\n\nA sign adorns a hallway at Watertown High School, where about 5% of students have military parents. Heather Ainsworth for CNN\n\nMisercola – who signs emails, “The most dangerous phrase is ‘It’s always been done this way’” – provided a stream of correction and encouragement. “I love all of you, but I can still shake my head at you just like your parents do,” she said one morning.\n\nShe corrected pronunciations – Belarus and President Alexander Lukashenko among the most butchered. “Dictator” is a less charged word than “evil,” she instructed one student. She reminded others to remain quiet during presentations and put their earbuds, phones and Chromebooks away. “Wrangling monkeys,” she quipped.\n\nWhen sophomore Adorie Jones presented her project as an investigative journalist, Misercola praised the presentation and layout of Adorie’s mock newspaper, but asked, “Would an investigative journalist write, ‘Putin’s acting like a child that has had his favorite toy taken away from him’?” The class, in unison, said no.\n\nLater, the 15-year-old told her teacher, “It was 2 o’clock in the morning, and I was angry.”\n\nMisercola’s retort: “That’s a dangerous time to write.”\n\nEarlier, senior Jacob Sanders said Russian leaders were being “sourpusses” over NATO. Standing beside him at the head of the class, Josh Marra, 17, apologized for his classmate’s language.\n\nMisercola informed the students that in a morning class one presenter had read from a right-wing publication that reported, “Biden has no balls.”\n\n“So, your language is fine,” she said, chuckling. “Sourpuss.”\n\nThe next day, the projects wrapped. Misercola hopes she accomplished her two-pronged mission of educating them about the Russia-Ukraine conflict while bringing them some personal peace.\n\n“The goal of the project was to teach them how to find the information they need to feel more confident and aware of what’s happening in the world, which does in fact ease your state of mind. We could have done that just through discussion, and I want them to learn skills to help them later in life when other big events occur,” she texted a week later.\n\nBy then, of course, the toll of Russia’s war on Ukraine had multiplied. Watertown High School’s teens had moved on to the next lesson: for the econ students, graphing a supply-and-demand chart, and for those studying history, scripting Netflix-style shows on the Chinese or Russian revolutions, or World War II.", "authors": ["Eliott C.

He was dubbed by 60 Minutes as \"the Mozart of Chess\" in a 2011 segment, which showed him playing 10 opponents simultaneously with his back turned, unable to see any of the pieces on the boards.\n\nHe's been ranked No. 1 in the world for more than a decade and won each of the past five chess world championships.\n\nNiemann, meanwhile, is ranked No. 49 in the world but is in the midst of a meteoric rise. His Elo rating, which measures the strength of a chess player relative to his peers, has increased by 350 points in a span of four years – raising eyebrows among some of his competitors.\n\nWhat sparked this feud?\n\nLess than 24 hours after losing to Niemann at the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis, Carlsen abruptly announced on Twitter that he had withdrawn from the tournament – a first in his career.\n\nThough he did not explain his reasoning for the move, Carlsen posted a video clip of soccer manager José Mourinho saying, \"If I speak, I am in big trouble.\"\n\nNiemann's victory was shocking – and, from Carlsen's standpoint, suspicious – in part because the 19-year-old was playing with the black pieces, which is a distinct disadvantage especially at the upper echelons of competitive chess.\n\nCarlsen had also played an unusual sequence of moves in the match in an attempt to catch Niemann off guard. Niemann said afterwards that, in a coincidence, he had researched that odd sequence of moves – and figured out the best way to reply to them – earlier in the day.\n\nTwo weeks later, when Carlsen and Niemann met again in competition at a separate online tournament, Carlsen played just one move before resigning in protest.\n\nWhat has Niemann said?\n\nThough not directly accused of cheating at first, Niemann nevertheless came forward and admitted to cheating on two separate occasions earlier in his career.\n\nNiemann said in an interview with the St. Louis Chess Club that when he was 12, he played in an online tournament on Chess.com for prize money and his friend used a chess computer, more commonly referred to as an engine, to feed him the best moves.\n\nThen, when he was 16, Niemann said he cheated in lower-level games to improve his rating, because he wanted to play tougher opponents. (In general play, Chess.com matches opponents with comparable ratings.)\n\nNiemann also said, \"I have never cheated in an over-the-board game,\" referring to in-person chess matches like the one he played against Carlsen in St. Louis.\n\nIs cheating possible in chess?\n\nYes – and some grandmasters have said it's not particularly difficult.\n\nIn online events, a player could do what Niemann admitted to previously doing – running a chess engine on a phone or other device that will spit out the best moves. \"Over-the-board\" cheating is more complicated, but American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky is among those who say it's been happening \"for decades\" with the help of technology.\n\n\"If you put your mind to it, it is possible to set up a cheating mechanism – even in very high-profile tournaments,\" he said on his Twitch stream.\n\nIn separate incidents in 2015 and 2019, for example, top players were caught hiding phones in the bathroom, then checking moves during bathroom breaks.\n\nOther potential methods include buzzer or signaling systems that could essentially nudge a top player in one direction or another at critical junctures. For top players, simply knowing whether to move one piece versus another might be enough to change the tenor of an entire match.\n\n\"I believe that cheating in chess is a big deal and an existential threat to the game,\" Carlsen said in his statement Monday. \"I also believe that chess organizers and those who care about the sanctity of the game we love should seriously consider increasing security measures and methods of cheat detection for over-the-board chess.\"\n\nWhat have those organizers said?\n\nThe day that Carlsen withdrew from the St. Louis tournament, organizers implemented additional security measures and touted their \"fair play rules\" as among the most comprehensive in chess.\n\nThe International Chess Federation (FIDE) also released a statement late last week. The organization's president, Arkady Dvorkovich, said he did not support Carlsen's decision to resign against Niemann but agrees that cheating is an important issue.\n\n\"Whether it is online or 'over the board,' cheating remains cheating,\" Dvorkovich said. \"We are strongly committed to this fight, and we have invested in forming a group of specialists to devise sophisticated preventive measures that already apply at top FIDE events.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nSome grandmasters and others in the chess community have supported Carlsen but stressed that he should release evidence or a detailed explanation to support his actions. While Carlsen has now directly accused Niemann of cheating, he has not provided concrete evidence to support his claim.\n\n\"Unfortunately, at this time I am limited in what I can say without explicit permission from Niemann to speak openly,\" he said Monday.\n\nNiemann had not publicly responded to Carlsen's statement as of Tuesday morning, and his representatives did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/sport/chess-how-to-cheating-explainer-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "How do you even cheat in chess? Artificial intelligence and Morse ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s the story that has rocked chess and shown no sign of abating.\n\nThe cheating scandal which has engulfed the sport, involving five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen, is all anyone is talking about.\n\nOn Monday, Carlsen explicitly accused fellow grandmaster and rival Hans Niemann of cheating for the first time in a lengthy statement on Twitter.\n\nThe accusation comes weeks after the Norwegian withdrew from the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis, Missouri, on September 19 following his surprise defeat to the American.\n\n“When Niemann was invited last minute to the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, I strongly considered withdrawing prior to the event. I ultimately chose to play,” Carlsen wrote.\n\n“I believe that Niemann has cheated more – and more recently – than he has publicly admitted. His over the board progress has been unusual, and throughout our game in the Sinquefield Cup I had the impression that he wasn’t tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as black in a way I think only a handful of players can do.\n\n“This game contributed to changing my perspective.”\n\nNiemann, for his part, admitted to cheating at the ages of 12 and 16 and said that he had been banned from competing on Chess.com, but said in an interview with the St. Louis Chess Club that he had never cheated in over-the-board games.\n\nBut for a game that seems so simple in its structure – one chess board, two players, 32 pieces in total and, theoretically, a lot of creativity – the question a lot of people are asking is: “How does someone even cheat in chess?”\n\nNiemann thinks over a move during the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. Lennart Ootes/Grand Chess Tour\n\nThe rise of technology\n\nDespite it being an ancient sport, chess has been dragged into the modern age in recent years.\n\nComputers and the internet have made competition more accessible and connected players around the world, and artificial intelligence now gives players the tools to plot out their moves before the match even begins.\n\nIt all really began in 1996 when grandmaster Garry Kasparov, widely recognized as one of the best players ever, faced off against an IBM supercomputer called ‘Deep Blue’ in a series of matches.\n\nAlthough Kasparov won the first match, ‘Deep Blue’ won two games, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in a classical game under tournament regulations.\n\nA year later, the two faced off in a rematch with ‘Deep Blue’ defeating Kasparov, in doing so, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in a full match.\n\nAlthough Kasparov’s performances against ‘Deep Blue’ have been reevaluated over time, the significance of the results can’t be overstated. It was a totemic moment in the progression of technology’s ability to play the “perfect” chess match and signaled the rise of artificial intelligence’s effect on chess.\n\nKasparov looks at the chessboard before his next move in the early part of the fifth game against the IBM 'Deep Blue' computer. Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince then, with improvements to computer hardware and software, chess engines have helped shape the sport into a 21st century game.\n\nAs defined by Chess.com, a chess engine is a program which “analyzes chess positions and returns what it calculates to be the best move options.”\n\nChess engines have become much stronger than humans in recent years, with many exceeding a 3,000 Elo rating – the Elo rating system measures the strength of a chess player relative to their opponents. For context, Carlsen holds the record for the highest Elo rating ever achieved by a human player when he reached 2,882 in 2014.\n\nStockfish is one of the most advanced chess engines with a rating of more than 3,500, which means it has a 98% probability of beating Carlsen in a match – and a 2% chance of drawing the five-time world champion, essentially rendering a Carlsen victory impossible.\n\nAlthough chess engines have helped players hone their craft – training against the perfect moves to prepare themselves for every eventuality – they’ve also allowed some players to cheat more easily.\n\nAs a result, online chess sites, like Chess.com, have developed anti-cheating technology to detect when players are using outside computer software during games in an attempt to curb foul play.\n\nEven though the anti-cheating technology has improved, Emil Sutovsky – director general of chess’ governing body FIDE – says chess needs to develop a “social contract” with online players to stop cheating.\n\n“Now, what has happened in the past was that the culture of cheating online has been seen as much less of a crime compared to if you were trying to cheat over the board,” Sutovsky – who says cheating in online chess is a “massive problem” – told CNN Sport. “It was like you are playing a computer game, online game, online chess, so it was not taken as seriously.\n\n“And many players suspected that other players are cheating and then they were naturally more driven to try themselves. That’s something that’s not happening in over the board chess. Now, this culture or heritage actually must change and people should realize that be it online cheating or over the board cheating, it is cheating.\n\n“Especially now when the situation changed as there are serious prizes at stake, hosts tours like Magnus [Carlsen who] conducted his own tour, so this whole perception naturally must be replaced by understanding that online cheating is a very serious sin and the punishment should be also very serious for that.”\n\nWhile FIDE is battling to combat online cheating, there has been a level of purity to over-the-board chess with cheating proving to be much more difficult.\n\nAndy Howie, arbiter and a member of FIDE’s anti-cheating Fair Play Commission, outlined some of the measures in place to prevent over-the-board cheating such as metal detectors, signal scanners, non-linear scanners and thermal imaging.\n\nBut safety measures haven’t stopped people from attempting to cheat and the history of the game is rife with scandal.\n\nCarlsen mulls over a move during his round 8 game against the Slovakia team at the 44th Chess Olympiad. ARUN SANKAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSubterfuge\n\nAccusations of cheating and foul play flew back and forth during the 1978 World Chess Championship Final, which one grandmaster who was there described as “the most bewildering and dirty world championship match in the history of chess.”\n\nAt one point, the young Soviet champion Anatoly Karpov claimed Russian exile Viktor Korchnoi was trying to blind him with his mirrored sunglasses, reports El País.\n\nLater, waiters served Karpov a blueberry yogurt and Korchnoi suggested it could be used for coded communications from his opponent’s analysts.\n\nKarpov ultimately won the match, which is recreated in a 2021 Russian film called “The World Champion.”\n\nMore recently, FIDE stripped Georgia’s Gaioz Nigalidze of his grandmaster title and banned him from competitive chess for three years in 2015 for repeatedly visiting the bathroom in the middle of a game to check his phone to find the best move to make.\n\nAlso in 2015, an arbiter caught Italian amateur Arcangelo Riccicardi using Morse code and a camera to cheat in a competition.\n\nRicciardi was reportedly hiding a video camera inside a pendant around his neck, wires attached to his body and a small box under his armpit.\n\n“I kept on looking at him. He was always sitting down, never got up,” chief arbiter Jean Coqueraut told La Stampa. “Very strange, we are talking about hours and hours of play. Above all, he always had his arms folded with his thumb under his armpit. He never took it out.\n\n“And he blinked in an unnatural way, as if it was concentrated on the board, but lost in some other thought. Then I realized: he was deciphering the signals in Morse code. Point line point line. That was it.”\n\nRiccicardi denied cheating.\n\nIt is uncertain whether or not Niemann did in fact cheat against Carlsen – the American vehemently denies the accusations.\n\nIn any case, theoretically, if someone were to input Carlsen’s moves into a chess engine like Stockfish, for example, they would be able to either beat or draw Carlsen with an almost 100% probability.\n\nThere has been no conclusive evidence either way, yet the five-time world champion seems convinced that there was foul play involved at the Sinquefield Cup.\n\nIt’s much tougher to cheat when you’re sitting directly across the board from your opponent, with them staring into your eyes and with an official over your shoulder, but that hasn’t stopped players trying throughout history.\n\nHowie says top players who rely on their chess careers are less likely to cheat with more to lose on the line.\n\nCarlsen competes during his Round 10 game against Moldova's team at the 44th Chess Olympiad, in Mahabalipuram on August 8. Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“You have someone like Hikaru Nakamura or Magnus Carlsen or Levon Aronian or Ian Nepomniatchtchi. If they were to be caught cheating, it would be devastating for them, for the careers,” he told CNN Sport. “This is their careers. They cannot afford to do that because it would be utterly devastating for them.\n\n“They would lose all credibility, all sponsorship. They just have too much to lose. Now, that doesn’t mean we treat it as if they’re never going to cheat, far from it. When we’re dealing with their tournaments, we’re actually very, very strict, just to make sure that there’s no… I never expect to find any of these cheating.\n\n“I would be really be shocked if I did find one of these guys cheating. But as you come down to the lower ranks, that’s when you’re more likely to find people cheating, your weaker players. People who see it as, it’s not important for them, they get banned for a couple of years. ‘So what? I’ll come and play in a couple of years’ time. I’m not too fussed about it.’ It doesn’t have the impact on them as it does on the top players. It’s not their livelihood.”\n\nAnd as the Carlsen-Niemann controversy continues to dominate the sport, who knows what truth the events will bring forth.", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/sport/fide-chess-cheating-investigation-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Chess organization will investigate cheating allegations made by ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn investigation is set to be launched in the wake of cheating allegations made by world chess champion Magnus Carlsen, FIDE – the sport’s global governing body – announced on Thursday.\n\nOn Monday, Carlsen accused fellow grandmaster Hans Niemann of cheating, saying that his rival’s “over the board progress has been unusual.”\n\nThis was after Carlsen withdrew from the Sinquefield Cup earlier this month after a loss to Niemann, then withdrew from his next game against the American after making just one move at the Julius Baer Generation Cup.\n\n“He wasn’t tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as black in a way I think only a handful of players can do,” Carlsen said about his defeat against Niemann at the Sinquefield Cup.\n\nNiemann has admitted to cheating in online chess at the ages of 12 and 16 but insists he has never cheated in over-the-board games.\n\nFIDE’s Fair Play Commission (FPL) has launched a three-member investigatory panel to examine Carlsen’s allegations and Niemann’s statement about cheating online.\n\n“In the best interest of the chess community, we would kindly ask the public to refrain from speculations on the outcomes and potential sanctions until all available facts are well considered, and a proper investigation is finalized,” said Salomeja Zaksaite, chairperson of the FPL.\n\nAccording to FIDE, the panel has the possibility to call for consultations with external experts if required.\n\n“The FPL is ready to examine the circumstances, compile and analyze all the data and evidence available, and ascertain the facts and allegations that have been made public,” said a statement from the federation.\n\n“The panel will ensure a fair ruling, protecting the rights of both parties during the investigation.”\n\nCNN has previously contacted both Niemann and Carlsen about the cheating allegations.\n\nSpeaking to CNN earlier this week, Emil Sutovsky, director general of FIDE, called cheating a “massive problem” in online chess, but added that over-the-board games have long had measures in place to detect cheating.\n\n“It started with all sorts of scanners and checkups – and it’s not like metal scanners you use in airports,” Sutovsky said.\n\n“We use those as well, but these are only part of a global picture.

Russia does not control any of the four in their entirety.\n\nThe expected referendums, which run counter to international law upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, have been announced as world leaders have descended on New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where the war and it impacts were already poised to loom large.\n\nUkraine has dismissed the announcement of referendums in the occupied regions as a “sham” stemming from the “fear of defeat,” while the the country’s Western supporters signaled they would not alter their support for Ukraine.\n\nUS Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A. Brink wrote on Twitter Wednesday that “sham referenda and mobilization are signs of weakness, of Russian failure. The United States will never recognize Russia’s claim to purportedly annexed Ukrainian territory, and we will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\n\nPutin on Wednesday said Russia has been asked for support from the two “people’s republics” and the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia for the referendums and had pledged to do “everything to ensure the safe conditions for people to express their will.”\n\nPotential for escalation\n\nThe announcements had already received swift support from Russian politicians. Former Russian President and vice-chairman of Russia’s National Security Council Dmitry Medvedev has publicly endorsed referendums in the self-declared Donbas republics, saying this would have “huge significance” for “systemic protection” of the residents.\n\n“Encroachment on Russian territory is a crime which allows you to use all the forces of self-defense,” Medvedev said on his Telegram channel, in an apparent allusion to the potential for the military escalation.\n\nBut social media video geolocated by CNN showed protests in several Russian cities on Wednesday, each involving what appear to have been a few dozen people. The independent monitoring group OVD-Info said that more than 100 people had been detained at anti-mobilization demonstrations in total.\n\nIt’s unclear what form an escalation could take, but concerns have been raised throughout the conflict over whether Russia would resort to using its nuclear stockpile in the Ukraine.\n\nA billboard promoting contract army service, with the slogan \"Serving Russia is a real job,\" in St. Petersburg.

Western leaders have slammed the polls, saying that they fail to meet internationally recognized standards of free and fair elections.\n\nThe annexation announcement was met with a similar outcry. Members of the G7 – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – and the European Union have vowed to never recognize Russian sovereignty over the regions and to impose sanctions on Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would place visa restrictions on 910 individuals in Russia and Belarus, while a Biden administration official said the White House would impose “swift and severe costs” on Russia. The British government said it would implement services sanctions and an export ban that target “Russian economic vulnerabilities.”\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called the move a “farce” in a pre-recorded video statement released shortly after Putin’s speech and vowed that “the entire territory of our country will be liberated.” Zelensky also said his country would apply for NATO membership “under an accelerated procedure,” but it’s unclear how long such a process would take. New NATO members must meet a series of criteria for membership and be unanimously approved by current alliance members.\n\n“We see who threatens us,” Zelensky said. “It is in Ukraine that the fate of democracy in the confrontation with tyranny is being decided.\n\nDespite the widespread condemnation, Russia appears committed to forging ahead with its plans to fly its flag over some 100,000 square kilometers (38,600 square miles) of Ukrainian territory – the largest forcible annexation of land in Europe since 1945.\n\nIn his speech, Putin framed the annexation as an attempt to fix what he sees as a great historical mistake: Russia’s demise following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and continued Western efforts to keep the country weak.\n\nHe repeated his unfounded allegation that genocide was being committed against Russian speakers – one of the false pretenses Russia used to invade Ukraine in February.\n\nThe address, on the whole, was a commitment by the Russian leader to continue pursuing his major foreign policy aim: restoring Russia as a major global power charged with protecting the Russian speaking world from the continued threat posed by Western forces.\n\n“We remember the horrible and hungry 1990s, but Russia has survived and became stronger. And it has its place in the world,” Putin said. “But the West is still trying to make us weaker, to split us into parts.”\n\nA new phase of the conflict\n\nThe annexations could lay the groundwork for a dangerous new phase in Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have, in recent weeks, successfully expelled Russian forces from parts of Donetsk thanks in part to the advanced weaponry sent by the US and other allies. Kyiv now controls about 40% of Donetsk, though many towns and cities bear scars of war that will take years to heal.\n\nNow that Russia formally recognizes Donetsk as its own territory, the Kremlin is likely to push forward to recapture it using some of the 300,000 Russian citizens who will be conscripted as part of a “partial mobilization” Putin announced last week.\n\n“It will have to be liberated,” said Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, shortly before the speech.\n\nPutin said Friday that while he was willing to negotiate with Ukraine, the sovereignty of those four regions would not be on the table.\n\n“I want the Kyiv authorities and their real masters in the West to hear me. For everyone to remember. People living in Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens. Forever,” the Russian president said during the annexation ceremony.\n\nPutin has previously vowed to defend Russian territory “with all the means at our disposal,” including nuclear weapons. US officials have said that they don’t believe Putin would resort to tactical nuclear weapons – a type of bomb designed for use on the battlefield that is less powerful than traditional “strategic” nuclear weapons – though they cannot discount the possibility.\n\n“We are looking very carefully to see if Russia is actually doing anything that suggests that they are contemplating the use of nuclear weapons. To date, we’ve not seen them take these actions,” US Secretary of State Blinken said Friday.\n\nAnalysts believe that Putin hopes the annexations will help shift public opinion in Russia in favor of what the Kremlin euphemistically calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian leader enjoyed stratospheric approval ratings after Crimea was annexed after a similar so-called referendum in 2014, but that was done in a largely bloodless manner using “little green men” – Russian special operations troops who poured over the border into the peninsula ahead of the annexation.\n\nThis invasion of Ukraine has proven to be a bloody, seemingly intractable conflict that has cost the Russian military countless lives. Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilization” last week led many Russians who do not support the war to fear that they will be drawn into the conflict.\n\nMore than 200,000 people – many of them young men of fighting age – have fled Russia since the partial mobilization began. Several who spoke with CNN voiced fears that the government could impose a draft at a later date.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:06 - Source: CNN 'We can't trust our government': Man joins tens of thousands fleeing Russia's draft\n\nInside Russia, the renewed war effort – and its apparent botched rollout – has been met in some corners with anger. Reports emerged of men being improperly conscripted, which Putin appeared to acknowledge on Thursday when he demanded that “mistakes” related to the order be rectified.\n\nActivist groups have said ethnic minorities in Russia are being disproportionately mobilized. Heated protests broke out in several regions with significant ethnic minority populations, including the predominately Muslim region of Dagestan.\n\nMeanwhile, small demonstrations were reported last week in 38 Russian cities – including Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to independent monitoring group OVD-Info. A spokeswoman for the organization told CNN some of the protesters arrested by riot police were being drafted directly into Russia’s military.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger Anna Chernova Tim Lister", "Joshua Berlinger", "Anna Chernova", "Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/05/12/ukraine-succession-referendums/8988155/", "title": "Ukraine separatists ask Russia to annex 'sovereign' area", "text": "Portia Walker and Anna Arutunyan\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nDONETSK, Ukraine — The self-styled Donetsk People's Republic declared eastern Ukraine a \"sovereign state\" Monday and called on Russia to annex the territory following controversial referendums, RT.com reports.\n\nThe referendums Sunday in the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces have been denounced by the U.S., European Union and Kiev government.\n\n\"We, the people of Donetsk, based on results of the May 11 referendum and the declaration of sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic, declare that from now on DPR is now a sovereign state,\" said Denis Pushilin, co-chairman of the separatist group, the Russian-owned news agency reports.\n\n\"We will try to cope with it on our own; we don't want this confrontation to increase, especially on our territory,\" he said. \"If the situation deteriorates, we reserve the right to ask for a peacekeeping contingent.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia called Monday for dialogue and a \"civilized\" implementation of the results of the balloting in Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nIn Brussels, the European Union council on Monday refused to recognize the referendums in eastern Ukraine and broadened its sanctions list against Russia to include 13 more people and two businesses, officials said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said Monday before the meeting of 28 foreign ministers that it is essential to show Moscow that the bloc is ready to step up measures \"depending on Russia's attitude toward the elections\" in Ukraine.\n\nHe joined other ministers in dismissing Sunday's referendums as shams of democracy, saying \"they are illegal by anybody's standards.\" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry called the voting a \"criminal farce.''\n\nAbout 90% of voters in Ukraine's sprawling industrial heartland reportedly backed their regions' sovereignty in the controversial referendums on Sunday.\n\nMoscow said the results of the vote should now be implemented without resorting to violence, and that it should be done in a \"civilized way.\" The Kremlin's brief remarks were carried by Russia's Interfax news agency. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin had called on the separatist forces to postpone the referendum.\n\nOn Monday, Russia suggested that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe could be brought in to help mediate the dialogue between Ukraine's government and representatives of the east.\n\nHowever, acting Ukrainian President Oleksander Turchinov said in a statement: \"These processes are inspired by the leadership of the Russian Federation and are destructive to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions' economies and threaten the lives and welfare of citizens and have the aim of destabilizing the situation in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe EU visa bans and asset freeze now cover 61 people and for the first time it includes businesses, according to two officials who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the measure had yet to be officially announced.\n\nThe purported decision to broaden the list follows a preliminary approval by EU officials last week to allow sanctions against companies, as the Obama administration has done in a separate U.S. sanctions list that targets several close associates of Putin and their assets.\n\nUkraine is scheduled to hold presidential and parliamentary elections May 25 under terms of an agreement that ended intense protests by pro-Western demonstrators against the Kiev government in February. The political unrest also drove President Viktor Yankovych, a Putin ally, from office. Pro-Russia elements in the east have likened the downfall of the Kiev government as a coup by pro-Western forces.\n\nLocals in Donetsk — where streets had remained calm Sunday — were split on whether to vote for secession or remain part of Ukraine, with a number intimidated by the armed militants occupying the regional council building in the center of the city. Many of those who said they were against independence were opting not to vote at all.\n\n\"There is no third way anymore. You have to be either for or against. But why should I hate my own country? So they proclaim independence, but then what?\" said Vyacheslav Fomenko, an entrepreneur in Donetsk.\n\nThe pro-Russia insurgents who organized the vote said the ultimate status of the regions would be discussed later and could include the possibility of secession or annexation by Russia.\n\nUkraine's central government and the West have condemned the balloting as a sham and a violation of international law, and accused Moscow of fomenting the unrest in a possible attempt to grab more land weeks after the annexation of Crimea.\n\nWalker also reported from Makiivka.

Depends on where they live.\n\nAlthough research shows more high-quality instructional time is key to catching kids up from COVID-19-era learning disruptions, relatively few districts in the U.S. are doing it. Some districts are actually doing the opposite, adopting four-day weeks to make themselves more attractive to teachers and other staff. And according to new research provided exclusively to USA TODAY, that’s on top of huge variations in how much learning time kids get to begin with. Students’ learning time can differ by nearly 200 hours a year depending on where they live.

USA TODAY Sports analyzed demographic information for all on-field coaches in the NFL at the start of this season. The analysis reveals that there are still stark racial disparities among coaches of different position groups – evidence of subconscious stereotypes that helped funnel white assistants to coordinator and head coaching positions while stunting the progress of their Black counterparts.

With an unmatched audience and a legacy of iconic performances, scoring the halftime show slot has always been an elite achievement for artists like Beyonce, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga in recent years. It’s akin to winning the Grammy for album of the year, once a sign for artists that they’re as beloved an institution as the Super Bowl itself.\n\nAs the messy lead-up to 2019’s Super Bowl LIII halftime show has shown us, things are quite different this time around, with the confirmed performers dealing with waves of bad press in the weeks leading up to what’s supposed to be one of the most exciting gigs of their careers – proof of just how far the halftime show has fallen as one of music’s so-called biggest nights.\n\nAfter months of reports that many of America’s biggest stars had turned down the halftime show slot, news broke that Maroon 5 would be performing at the game on Feb. 3. As fans wrote petitions urging the band not to play in the show, the NFL delayed officially announcing the halftime show lineup for months, waiting until mid-January – weeks before the game – to actually confirm Maroon 5 would be playing. And when the rapper Travis Scott recently announced he would be joining Maroon 5 on the stage, he affirmed that he only agreed to perform if the NFL made a donation to a social justice organization, and yet still received criticism for signing on to the show.\n\nMore:Petition asks Maroon 5 not to play Super Bowl halftime show to support Kaepernick\n\n2018:Super Bowl LII viewership dips overall, streaming audience sets record\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nColin Kaepernick at heart of halftime show aversion\n\nMonths-delayed announcements, angry fan petitions, hard-line charity stipulations – this is not how halftime shows rolled out a decade ago.\n\nIn the 10 years since Bruce Springsteen famously crotch-slid into a camera during his 2009 halftime show performance, the NFL became toxic to social-justice-minded artists and their fans – turning the once-coveted performance slot into guaranteed bad PR.\n\nColin Kaepernick’s kneeling controversy and subsequent absence from NFL rosters inspired many artists to speak out publicly in his favor and reportedly contributed to Rihanna’s decision to turn down the halftime show opportunity. Similarly, Cardi B’s representative told Page Six that she wasn’t interested “because of how she feels about Colin Kaepernick and the whole movement.\" And Jay-Z made his feelings about the NFL clear in the lyrics of his and Beyonce’s “Ape****” single last year, rapping, “I said no to the Super Bowl / You need me, I don’t need you.”\n\nAnd while the performance certainly won’t tank the careers of Maroon 5 or Travis Scott, it’s difficult to imagine artists wanting to sign on to next year’s halftime show after the press debacle of the past few months.\n\nSince the initial speculation about Maroon 5’s performance broke last fall, a widely publicized Change.org petition racked up over 100,000 signatures of people asking the band not to play the show. And when Scott tried to get ahead of the controversy by announcing that the NFL would donate $500,000 on his behalf to Dream Corps, an organization that backs social-justice efforts, he was publicly criticized for his decision to perform by peers including T.I. and Nick Cannon, with Kaepernick denying that Scott consulted with him about whether to perform.\n\nAtlanta music scene could have been perfect backdrop\n\nMost dismaying is the fact that 2019 should’ve been a landmark year for the halftime show, thanks to the Super Bowl’s host city of Atlanta – America’s nexus of hip-hop culture – whose native sons include Outkast, T.I., Migos, Future, Young Jeezy, Childish Gambino, 2 Chainz, Gucci Mane, Young Thug, 21 Savage and Killer Mike. How many of these names the NFL approached to appear at the halftime show is unclear, but only one said yes – Big Boi, the Atlanta rapper and Outkast member, who also confirmed that he will be joining Maroon 5 and Scott onstage, and has otherwise been near-radio silent in recent weeks about the appearance.\n\nMore:NFL's decision to ignore Atlanta music scene for Super Bowl halftime show is a missed opportunity\n\nFor all the halftime show’s perils this year, that one may be the most depressing. What should’ve been a celebration of the embarrassment of riches Atlanta has to offer will instead be headlined by Maroon 5, a band whose faceless pop hits are as far from the city’s vibrant musical culture as seemingly possible. And the one Atlanta native the NFL could snag to perform, Big Boi, is seemingly attempting to keep his appearance as low-profile as possible, probably because of the toxic reception that greeted the halftime show's headliners.\n\nThe halftime show will almost certainly get its tens of millions of viewers on Feb. 3, as it does every year. And afterward, the NFL will need to find a way to adapt to the halftime show's newly diminished reputation, perhaps reverting to booking legacy acts instead of the younger stars they've chased for the last few years' of performances – stars who , if this year is any indication, might not return their calls. As long as the Super Bowl survives, it will likely still have a halftime show. The question is whether that show will be any good after the near-fatal blow its reputation was dealt this year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/02/04/deaf-rapper-sean-forbes-eminem-dre-snoop-super-bowl-halftime/6671091001/", "title": "Deaf rappers to join Eminem, Dre, Snoop at Super Bowl halftime", "text": "Sean Forbes had expected to experience this year’s Super Bowl like usual — in front of a television.\n\nThen the deaf Detroit rapper got the electrifying phone call that promised a career milestone: The NFL wanted him for its upcoming Super Bowl LVI halftime show, performing alongside Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J. Blige in the 56-year-old game’s first-ever hip-hop extravaganza.\n\nAnd so there Forbes will be Feb. 13 at L.A.’s SoFi Stadium, where he and fellow deaf rapper Warren (WaWa) Snipe will perform sign-language interpretations of the headliners’ music.\n\nIt’s the first time the NFL has incorporated sign-language performances as part of the halftime program.

He has a long connection to the Detroit hip-hop star — a link that began with his father, who was close to some of the folks inside Em’s business and studio circles. Forbes was a regular at Ferndale's 54 Sound studio, where Eminem cut much of his early work.\n\nRock & Roll Hall of Fame 2022 nominees:Dolly Parton, Duran Duran, Eminem top varied lineup\n\n“So this is very much a full-circle moment, being from Detroit, being part of the Eminem camp — or even going back to being 12 and listening to N.W.A., Dre and Snoop on my Walkman,” Forbes said.\n\nAt 54 Sound in 2005, he got the chance to show Eminem a video of his intense ASL interpretation of “Lose Yourself” — drawing a response Forbes often gets from hearing folks: “Deaf people like music?”\n\nThey do indeed, as Forbes has learned to explain, feeling the rhythm through bass vibrations and drawn to the lyricism of the words.\n\n“That was purely Sean Forbes trying to find an opportunity in the music industry,” Forbes said. “I just wasn’t sure what that was yet.”\n\nHe went on to help launch the Deaf Performing Arts Network (DPAN), which made a specialty out of ASL interpretations of pop music hits and eventually made its way into news and information programming for the deaf.\n\nAs a solo artist, Forbes carved out a name as one of the most significant figures in the world of ASL performing, as he toured and collaborated with people such as actress Marlee Matlin. His 2020 album “Little Victories” topped the Amazon sales charts the week of release.\n\nSince getting the call-up from the NFL at the top of the year, Forbes was sworn to secrecy ahead of the NFL's pending announcement.\n\nMore:Adele confirms Brit Awards performance, her first since postponing entire Vegas residency\n\nHe chuckled to himself as friends texted the viral meme that sprang up when Matthew Stafford’s Los Angeles Rams secured their spot in the big game. With the ex-Lions quarterback on the field and Eminem playing halftime, the meme went, “this is the closest Detroit has ever been to actually being in a (Super Bowl).”\n\nForbes knew there was one more Detroiter who’d be in the mix.\n\nHe thinks back to being that 12-year-old rap fan, realizing that never in his wildest dreams could he imagine he’d be performing in the Super Bowl’s first hip-hop halftime show.\n\n“My goal is to get out there, show what we can do, and have fun,” Forbes said. “And I want to open the door for other deaf performers.”\n\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}]}

Gavin Newsom's office.\n\nNewsom has signed the budget proposal for a $100 billion California Comeback Plan into law, his office said Friday.\n\nThe checks are part of an extension of the Golden State Stimulus program, which originally distributed $3.8 billion to low-income residents in the form of one-time payments of $600, according to the nonprofit newsroom CalMatters. This second set of stimulus checks will provide a one-time payment of $600 to middle-class residents earning up to $75,000, as well as a $500 check to qualifying residents with dependents.\n\nThe California Franchise Tax Board, a state tax collection agency, anticipates payments from the second installment of Golden State Stimulus checks will begin in September, according to the agency's official website.\n\nThe FTB has released a tool for residents to estimate their payment.\n\n\"The stimulus payment is issued per tax return, not by household/residence,\" the agency says. \"Two individuals in the same residence could receive a stimulus payment (as long as they both qualify).\"\n\nThe checks will arrive either via mail or direct deposit, the agency says: \"Typically, you'll receive this payment using the refund option you selected on your tax return. If you received an advanced refund through your tax service provider, or paid your tax preparation fees using your refund, you'll receive your payment by check in the mail.\"\n\nThe program’s extension comes from Newsom’s California Comeback Plan – the largest economic recovery package in the state’s history, according to the governor’s official website. Newsom said the state’s budget surplus of $75.7 billion would go toward expediting the Golden State’s pandemic recovery – bringing “California roaring back” – by addressing core issues such as economic relief, homelessness and housing affordability, infrastructure and public education.\n\n'A day to celebrate':California, once epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic, marks its reopening\n\n\"$600 checks are coming to 2/3 of Californians.

Mitchell, an economics expert and professor from the University of California Los Angeles, said pandemic-aid programs put a logistical strain on the state system that can create delay in doling out other government benefits, such as the Golden State Stimulus checks.\n\n“California is good at creating policies, but sometimes not so good at managing [and/or] administering them,” Mitchell wrote in an email to USA TODAY. “Policymakers often don't have a lot of experience in management and may not always understand the complexities of actually delivering services.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/29/climate-change-art-year-cat-reunion-spanking-ban-news-around-states/50156353/", "title": "Climate change art, 16-year cat reunion: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Officials have signed a contract to build a new state prison – part of a $1.3 billion construction plan partly using pandemic relief funds – but have not released many of the details. A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey confirmed the state signed a contract with Caddell Construction Co., effective April 15, for construction of a specialized men’s prison facility in Elmore County “that will provide enhanced medical and mental health services.” “The new facility will create a safer security environment for inmates and security personnel. Our construction timeline continues to remain on schedule,” Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Ivey, wrote in an email. The Alabama Department of Corrections on Wednesday declined to release a copy of the contract. A spokeswoman said it needed to be redacted, and that would take some time because it is a lengthy contract. The department did not immediately respond to an email seeking information about the cost or the size of the prison. Ivey’s office indicated the prison system should be be able to provide a copy of the “publicly available contract documents in the coming days.” Lawmakers and the governor approved a construction plan that also includes another prison with at least 4,000 beds in Escambia County, a new women’s prison, and renovations to existing facilities.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Some local officials have raised concerns about militarization of the police force after learning of the police department’s plans to buy an armored security vehicle that can seat 12 officers. Some have referred to the vehicle as a tank and said they worry it could harm a transparent relationship between police and the community. Police counter that the vehicle is a way to help protect officers, especially when dealing with people firing weapons, the Juneau Empire reports. “There’s a policy question here about militarizing our police force, and I don’t agree with that,” City and Borough of Juneau Assembly member Carole Triem said. “I think we’ve heard from the community that they really desire transparency when it comes to operations.” Triem raised the issue late at Monday’s assembly meeting, where she also objected to the police department’s ability to buy the vehicle with a grant that doesn’t require assembly approval. The Lenco Armored Vehicle BearCat G3 will cost more than $300,000 when custom-built to Juneau police department specifications, Lt. Krag Campbell said. Campbell said that despite some in the community describing the vehicle as a “tank,” it’s not a military vehicle. “Generally, it’s for our emergency response teams and our fire department,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Electric companies won’t have to worry about competing for customers after Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill Tuesday that repeals laws allowing for that. His action ends more than 20 years of the state flirting with the idea of customers choosing their power company but never really offering people that choice. Utilities in Arizona supported the legislation because they said allowing competitors to enter the market would threaten the reliability of the power grid as various companies tried to forecast how much power their customers needed. Ducey said competition is a “critically important policy goal” but echoed those concerns about power-grid reliability in his signing letter. “Arizona will not follow the path of California, Texas and other states that have mismanaged their grids and continually experience rolling brownouts and blackouts,” Ducey said in a statement on the bill. Officials at Green Mountain Energy, a company whose move to compete with Arizona utilities appears to have prompted the legislation, said they were disappointed in the governor’s actions. “It is unfortunate that Arizona’s law that would have created competition in the electricity industry, which has been on its books for two decades, has never been implemented,” Green Mountain Vice President Mark Parsons said in a statement.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state is suing Family Dollar over the discovery of more than 1,000 rodents in a distribution facility that prompted the discount retail chain to recall items purchased from hundreds of stores in the South. The lawsuit, filed Thursday by Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in state court, accuses the chain and parent company Dollar General of deceiving consumers, negligence and engaging in a conspiracy that allowed the infestation at the West Memphis facility to occur. “This misconduct by Family Dollar Stores and Dollar Tree allowed them to maximize profits, while causing Arkansas citizens to purchase hazardous, adulterated and contaminated products,” the lawsuit said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced in February that it had inspected the distribution facility following a consumer complaint. Inside the building, inspectors said they found live rodents, dead rodents in “various states of decay,” rodent feces, dead birds and bird droppings. A Dollar Tree spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment Thursday. According to the lawsuit, state and federal inspections show Family Dollar had known of the rodent infestation at its facility since at least January 2020.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: People who get hurt because of a doctor’s negligence could soon get a lot more money in malpractice lawsuits under an agreement reached Wednesday that – if approved by the Legislature – would avoid a costly fight at the ballot box this November while resolving one of the state’s longest-running political battles. California does not limit how much money patients can win in malpractice cases for economic damages, which include things that can be counted such as medical expenses and lost wages. But since 1975, state law has limited how much money patients can win for what can’t be counted – such as pain and suffering – to $250,000. Trial attorneys and patients’ rights groups have tried and failed for decades to raise that limit, noting it sometimes costs more than that to take one of these complex lawsuits to trial. Doctors have usually opposed raising the limits, saying it would result in soaring malpractice insurance premiums that could put some community health clinics out of business. With neither side budging, California voters were set to settle the issue in November. But supporters of raising the limit agreed to withdraw the measure from the November ballot Wednesday, instead supporting a new bill in the Legislature that would gradually increase the limit over the next 10 years. The bill has the support of the California Medical Association, the Consumer Attorneys of California, Californians Allied for Patient Protection, state legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nColorado\n\nCanon City: An outbreak of an undetermined and highly contagious disease has killed dozens of wild horses at a federal holding facility in southern Colorado. Bureau of Land Management officials say 67 horses have died since the outbreak began Saturday at the agency’s holding pen in Canon City, about 150 miles southwest of Denver. “We are working with local, state and federal officials to determine what is impacting horses in the facility and how we can respond as effectively as possible,” said Stephen Leonard, the manager of the BLM Colorado Wild Horse and Burro Program. The facility, which is under voluntary quarantine, currently holds 2,550 horses. BLM officials say the horses that have been most affected by the disease were gathered from the West Douglas area last fall. No other information has been released.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Broad agreement has been reached on a revised one-year state budget proposal, Gov. Ned Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly announced Wednesday. The $24.2 billion plan, set to take effect July 1 in the midst of the election season, would see nearly $500 million in tax reductions including the continuation of the 25-cent-per-gallon gas tax cut until Dec. 1, lawmakers said. It also includes substantial new spending for mental health programs for children and early childhood programs, which have struggled to pay workers competitive wages while ensuring services are affordable to families. And the proposal makes $2 billion in payments to help reduce state pension debt, according to the legislators, who have yet to release any documents. Lamont and the Democrats haven’t settled how much of the state’s share of federal COVID-19 funds will be spent in this budget, including how much of that money will be set aside for pandemic pay for essential workers and to reduce the $493 million debt in the state’s unemployment trust fund. But they expressed confidence the budget will be approved before the legislative session ends May 4. Democrats said they were hopeful that at least some Republicans, the minority in the Assembly, will support the proposal.\n\nDelaware\n\nBear: Sixteen years ago after Jason McKenry’s 2-year-old gray tabby escaped from his apartment, he got a text: Ritz had been taken to a veterinarian and was about to be put down when someone found a microchip. Little is known of the cat’s whereabouts after that day in Bear, though McKenry did learn that Ritz had hitched a ride in a neighbor’s pickup truck after charging out of the apartment. For the past couple of years, Ritz has been surviving thanks to the kindness of strangers near Lums Pond. One of those strangers took the cat to the vet and started the chain of events that led to McKenry and Ritz being reunited. But everything in between is a mystery. “I wish he could talk,” McKenry said this week. “I’d love to hear his story.” Everyone connected to the cat, from those who were feeding him to the makers of the microchip, is stunned by the story. “Sixteen years? That’s a new record as far as I know,” said Tom Sharp, president of AKC Reunite, a national database for microchipped pets. “That’s amazing.” Sharp said he expects shelters and veterinarians to check for microchips on animals when they are taken in or before they are adopted out. These microchips, known as radio frequency identification, are not able to locate or trace a pet’s whereabouts because they don’t have GPS.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents in the Southeast neighborhood are being warned after a turkey was seen disrupting bike riders and hikers on a nearby trail, WUSA-TV reports. Late last week, the Department of Energy and Environment, National Park Service, Humane Rescue Alliance and Maryland Department of National Resources were first alerted to an aggressive turkey attacking residents on the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail. Wildlife officials said they had received multiple reports of turkeys attacking people in the district. According to DOEE, it’s turkey breeding season, and the rise in attacks is related to territorial behavior. One of the latest encounters was caught on video by local go-go musician DeDe Folarin of Rare Essence, who was riding his bike on the trail April 12. “All of a sudden, I was coming around the bend, and this big wild turkey just jumps up and almost claws me in the face,” he said. Folarin said he dismounted his bike while the turkey continued to harass him for nearly five minutes. The large bird then turned its attention to another passing cyclist as Folarian captured video of the encounter. “After the lady asked if I could help, I picked up a stick, and I kind of whacked the turkey, and he kind of ran back into the brush, and that was it,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A judge on Wednesday vacated the life sentence of a 55-year-old Black man who prosecutors said was wrongfully convicted because of mistaken identity in 1991. “I feel good. Real good,” Thomas “Jay” Raynard James said Wednesday as he left a Miami courtroom with his attorneys and family members. James was convicted of the 1990 death of Francis McKinnon, largely on identification by an eyewitness who told jurors she watched him gun down her stepfather during a robbery in his Coconut Grove apartment. Earlier Wednesday, James, wearing his red prison uniform and shackles, stood behind his mother, Doris Strong, as Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle detailed a 90-page motion her office filed asking for the conviction to be vacated. “Mom, hopefully the court will grant you the freedom you’ve been looking for for so many years,” Fernandez Rundle told Strong, who sobbed quietly throughout the news conference. James was 23 when he was convicted. Over the past year, Fernandez Rundle said, members of her office’s Justice Project poured over 20,000 pages of documents, reinterviewed witnesses, resubmitted fingerprints and retested DNA samples. In a 90-page motion to vacate the conviction, prosecutors said that “what appears to be a chance coincidence that the defendant, Thomas Raynard James, had the same name as a suspect named by witnesses and anonymous tipsters … led to the defendant’s photograph being included in a lineup, and set in motion a mistaken identity.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morris Brown College has regained full accreditation after a 20-year journey that its leaders hope will ultimately prompt higher enrollment. The Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools voted Tuesday to grant the liberal arts college full accreditation status, meaning its students can apply for federal loans and Pell grants, the association confirmed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools revoked Morris Brown’s accreditation in 2002 after a former college president and financial aid director were found to be misappropriating federal funds and rising debt. “Morris Brown College just made history,” President Kevin James told the newspaper. “We’re excited about it. A lot of people had written us off. But due to a lot of hard work and dedication, we were able to regain our accreditation.” Morris Brown sought accreditation from TRACS, which also approved reaccreditation to another HBCU in Georgia: Paine College in Augusta. James, Morris Brown’s leader since 2019, called the process “the hard reset.” The historically Black college planned to formally announce the reaccreditation Thursday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s top public health officials said Wednesday that the COVID-19 pandemic is still active but is moving into a new phase of the disease, in which people can test themselves at home and ideally avoid serious illness thanks to vaccination and the use of therapeutic treatments. Gov. David Ige described the change as a transition from “emergency response” to “public health management.” He said at a news conference that state officials would be handling COVID-19 more similarly to other diseases. The adjustment has been underway for a few months, said Dr. Libby Char, the director of the state Department of Health. One example is how the state uses contact tracers. “We’ve seen a shift from trying to track down every single case and all of their contacts to instead getting the message out so that we all have our own personal COVID-19 preparedness plan,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the state’s epidemiologist. Part of that change is possible because home test kits are now widely available. But another reason is that universal contact tracing isn’t the best method to control an airborne disease like COVID-19, she said. People can follow self-isolation guidelines and notify those with whom they’ve been in contact about their exposure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Jurors have begun deliberating in the rape trial of a former state lawmaker accused of sexually assaulting a legislative intern last year. Prosecutors and the defense attorney for Aaron von Ehlinger made their final arguments to the jury late Thursday morning, moments after von Ehlinger gave his own recounting of the events. Von Ehlinger, 39, has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of rape and sexual penetration with a foreign object – both charges carry a maximum penalty of up to life in prison – and maintains he had consensual sex with the 19-year-old intern. The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted and has referred to the woman in this case as “Jane Doe” at her request. Doe told her supervisors that von Ehlinger, then a Republican representative from Lewiston, raped her in March 2021 at his Boise apartment after the two had dinner at a restaurant. Von Ehlinger resigned from the House of Representatives last year after a legislative ethics committee recommended he be banned from the Statehouse because of his conduct with Doe. Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Katelyn Farley told jurors the case was about “power in the wrong hands” used to the “great devastation” of Doe. Von Ehlinger had social, political and physical power over the petite intern, Farley said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed four pieces of legislation into law Wednesday aimed at easing a shortage of teachers and classroom aides in public schools. The new laws lower the fee to reinstate a lapsed teaching certificate, allow student teaching by college seniors, lower the minimum age for classroom aides, and extend the number of days in a row a short-term substitute can spend in one classroom if a disaster is declared. Pritzker signed the bills during a ceremony at Springfield High School, just two blocks from the Capitol. The Illinois State Board of Education estimates there will be about 4,120 openings in public schools this fall. That includes 1,700 teachers and 1,240 paraprofessionals, who are qualified but unlicensed educators who help teachers. It’s not a new situation and predates the COVID-19 pandemic. But the coronavirus, which forced schools into a roller coaster of openings and closings, scheduling and staffing, worsened matters. Several lawmakers have been focused on getting classrooms staffed with qualified people. Rep. Sue Scherer, a Decatur Democrat and former teacher, said a retired teacher who is a constituent wanted to help out because of the crisis before learning it would cost him $500 to reinstate his license. Scherer’s legislation, run through the Senate by Meg Loughran Cappel, D-Shorewood, lowers that fee to $50 immediately.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafeyette: Purdue University and Duke Energy plan to jointly explore the feasibility of using advanced nuclear energy to meet the campus’s long-term energy needs and reduce its carbon footprint, they announced Wednesday. Purdue and Duke intend to study power produced through small modular reactors, which are significantly smaller than traditional nuclear power plants. An SMR could meet current and future needs for the West Lafayette campus and provide excess power to the state’s electric grid. SMRs can be prefabricated off site, saving money and time in construction. “No other option holds as much potential to provide reliable, adequate electric power with zero carbon emissions,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said. However, nuclear power plants use large amounts of water for steam production and cooling. They also produce spent uranium fuel, which is stored in pools or steel-lined concrete vaults for decades. Purdue provided no time line on when its first SMR might arrive on campus. Duke said it is the largest regulated nuclear plant operator in the nation, with 11 nuclear units at six plant sites in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Bureau of Refugee Services says it is seeking families to become official sponsors of Ukrainian refugees who may be coming to Iowa under a new federal program. In a news release, the bureau said it plans to assist families with webinars and training sessions to help sponsors understand what resettlement entails, what their duties and responsibilities will be, and the resources available to help them. The news release did not say how many Ukrainians are likely to come to Iowa or what plans are being made to deal with those Ukrainians after Afghan refugees who began arriving in the Des Moines metro late last year told reporters they’ve struggled without sufficient long-term housing, food and other assistance. While the bureau said it stands ready to help prospective sponsors, they also can apply directly through the federal program at welcome.us. But Des Moines Refugee Support, a nonprofit that has been working closely with Afghan refugees, said in a statement Wednesday that volunteers would love to welcome Ukrainians, but Des Moines is not ready to take them. “We are worried about the logistics, as we have many Afghan families still in hotels, Afghans still needing food assistance, Afghan babies without diapers,” the statement said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw a 4.1% increase in the number of abortions performed in 2021 compared with 2020, with more Missouri residents but fewer Oklahoma and Texas residents coming into Kansas to terminate pregnancies. A preliminary report Tuesday from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment showed that 7,849 abortions were performed in the state last year. That’s 303 more than the 7,546 performed in Kansas in 2020. The state saw an increase of more than 9% in the number of abortions performed in 2020 over 2019, due to an influx of patients from Oklahoma and Texas, where Republican governors shut down providers early in the coronavirus pandemic, while Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, kept them open. But the number of abortions performed in Kansas for women from Oklahoma and Texas dropped to a total of 370 in 2021 from 566 in 2020, a decline of nearly 35%. Meanwhile, the number of abortions for women from Missouri was 3,458 last year, up 8% or 257 from 2020. And 8% more Kansas residents had abortions in the state in 2021 than in 2020. The increase was 292, making the total 3,937.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A long-controversial proposal for a pipeline that would snake through Bullitt County and a beloved arboretum is being sent back to the drawing board after a vital permit for the project was suspended. After several conservation groups threatened to sue to prevent Louisville Gas & Electric from building the natural gas pipeline, which would cut through some property owned by Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to review how the project could affect three bat species protected by the Endangered Species Act that live in the region. Construction on the 12-mile pipeline has not yet started and, under the new ruling, will not be able to begin until the two agencies ensure the species – Indiana bats, gray bats and northern long-eared bats – are not put at risk. The contested project has been in the works for years, sparking outcry from environmental advocates and others in the community since it was first proposed in 2015. “Save Bernheim Forest” yard signs are a common sight around Louisville among homeowners concerned about the proposed pipeline’s potential impact on the popular 16,000-acre wildlife sanctuary just south of the city.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A bill to outlaw spanking and all other forms of corporal punishment in the state’s public schools cleared its first hurdle Wednesday as lawmakers determine whether hitting children in schools is an appropriate form of discipline or abuse. The Louisiana House Education Committee advanced Metairie Republican Rep. Stephanie Hilferty’s House Bill 649 without objection. “We don’t allow juveniles in our detention centers or (inmates) in our prisons to be hit; I’m asking for the same treatment for our children while they’re in school,” Hilferty said while testifying for her bill. An identical bill in 2021 by Hilferty made it to the House floor, where it was defeated on a 48-49 vote. Louisiana is one of 19 states that still allows corporal punishment in public schools. Among the others are neighbors Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas. Fellow Metairie Republican Rep. Laurie Schlegel made the motion to approve Hilferty’s legislation. “I was shocked that this is still a thing,” Schlegel said. Louisiana Partnership for Children and Families executive director Susan East Nelson, who has previously described corporal punishment as “state-sponsored child abuse,” testified again in favor of banning the practice. “This has been a priority for us for 10 years,” Nelson said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A hunting group is suing the state to overturn its long-standing ban on Sunday hunting. Hunting bear, moose, wild turkey and deer is popular in Maine, but the state has barred Sunday hunting for generations. Opponents of the ban filed their lawsuit Wednesday with a claim that the law violates the state’s new “Right to Food” amendment. Maine voters passed the nation’s first such constitutional amendment last year. The amendment states that individuals have a right to harvest food of their own choosing. The opponents of the Sunday hunting ban said in a statement that Maine’s long-standing ban “was created based on the religious and social beliefs at the time, not biology or science.” But the ban has withstood challenges in the past. The Legislature’s Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife voted against a proposal to end the ban in March. The Maine Professional Guides Association, which represents guides who assist hunters, was among the groups that opposed the change. The only other state that bans Sunday hunting is Massachusetts.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints U.S. currency, is moving forward with plans to build its new facility in Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday. The bureau is expecting to house at least 850 workers on site, with 600 additional employees working remotely, the governor’s office said. The 104-acre site, located at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Prince George’s County, has been officially transferred to the Department of the Treasury. It will house a new state-of-the-art and environmentally conscious production facility to print U.S. paper currency and other federal security products. “Over the past three years, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the state of Maryland have worked closely on evaluating the potential for this Beltsville facility and determining how we can best work together to make this project successful,” Hogan said in a statement. The bureau is in the design stage of the project and plans to wrap up design development by summer 2023. Construction of the new facility, which is being managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Baltimore District, is anticipated to be completed by early 2027, with currency production starting midyear.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former transit police officer has pleaded guilty to assaulting and violating the civil rights of a 63-year-old man who refused to get off a bus last year but has avoided jail and could eventually have the charges dismissed. Prosecutors on Wednesday asked a Superior Court judge to sentence Nicholas Morrissey to a one-year suspended sentence with three years of probation, according to a statement Thursday from the Suffolk district attorney’s office. The judge, citing Morrissey’s military service and the fact he resigned, continued the case for an 18-month probationary period. That means charges could be dismissed if Morrissey complies with the terms of probation. He is also not allowed to seek another job in law enforcement. “The actions of one officer can sow seeds of distrust in our entire system,” Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the Transit Police Department for their immediate actions to hold a member of their own ranks accountable and to ensure the wellbeing of the public they serve.” Morrissey’s attorney said his client is a Marine Corps veteran who had no prior disciplinary problems. “I think it was a fair disposition,” Robert Jubinville said. “This fellow had been on the job for 13 years and had never had any issues.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man in prison for 15 years for kidnapping and sexual assault was cleared of the crimes Wednesday after authorities discovered many mistakes, including a failure to disclose DNA results proving his innocence. “There were so many things missed along the way,” said Valerie Newman of the Wayne County prosecutor’s office, who reviews Detroit-area cases that can turn out to be wrongful convictions. Judge Kelly Ramsey approved a request to erase Terance Calhoun’s convictions in two cases from 2006 and immediately release him from prison. His earliest parole date would have been November 2023. Calhoun, 35, declined to speak during the court hearing, which was held by video conference, but wore a big smile when lawyers Tabitha Harris and Michael Mittlestat congratulated him. “Good luck to you,” the judge said. In 2007, Calhoun pleaded no contest to kidnapping and other charges and was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison. He was accused of targeting two teen girls in Detroit in 2006. But a few months after Calhoun was sent to prison, tests revealed a condom linked to an assault on the second victim had ruled him out as the perpetrator. There is no indication the DNA results were given to his lawyer, Newman said. She also noted that a description of the attacker as a man with braids and a puzzle tattoo didn’t fit Calhoun.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Legislative leaders announced a deal Thursday to refill the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund and to pay bonuses to front-line workers, resolving a months­long impasse. The tentative agreement includes $2.7 billion to replenish the trust fund and pay back a debt to the federal government for jobless aid, as well as $500 million in bonuses for workers who took risks during the pandemic. House Democrats came down from their $1 billion proposal for bonus checks, cutting the amount per worker in half to $750 but keeping eligibility at about 667,000 workers. The proposal – which would spend all of Minnesota’s remaining federal pandemic relief funds of more than $1 billion – also includes $190 million for a pandemic response account to support efforts that are already ongoing, like the state’s testing apparatus. A House provision making hourly school employees eligible for unemployment insurance during the summer months was cut in the compromise. “We tried to get it done earlier,” said Senate Majority Leader Jeremy Miller, R-Winona, citing the Senate passage of its unemployment insurance bill in February on a bipartisan 55-11 vote. “It took a little bit longer than we’d hoped, but the final deal is a good deal for the people of Minnesota, and we’re happy to get it done.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves has vetoed part of a budget bill for the University of Mississippi Medical Center, saying he objects to spending $50 million for improvements to the adult hospital in Jackson. The Republican governor issued the partial veto of Senate Bill 3010 on Tuesday. Legislators specified the $50 million would come from Mississippi’s pandemic recovery money from the federal government. UMMC declined to comment on the partial veto, spokesperson Marc Rolph said Wednesday. Reeves wrote on Twitter that UMMC’s academic functions – teaching physicians, nurses and other health care professionals – are largely funded by the state, but the hospital is not. “They are responsible for their own operational budget – just like other hospitals,” Reeves wrote. The governor wrote that UMMC receives “competitive advantages” over other hospitals and physician groups because it does not need the Health Department’s approval for new facilities or large equipment. However, UMMC does need approval from the state college board. “There is little reason that Mississippi taxpayers should radically increase the commitment to further subsidize the operations of UMMC to the detriment of competitors,” Reeves wrote. “Furthermore, they currently have enough money to willingly turn away patients on private insurance, clearly indicating that they have no need for the state to underwrite their ambitious building/spending goals.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A divided state Senate narrowly passed legislation Thursday that could allow thousands of elderly, disabled and homeless residents to spend government food stamp benefits at restaurants – something currently allowed in only a handful of states. The bill revealed deep divisions within the Republican-led chamber, where most GOP members voted against what they described as an “expansion of the welfare state” even as Republican leaders joined with Democrats to support it. The measure passed 18-15, receiving the bare minimum to advance to the House with just two weeks remaining in the legislative session. Low-income residents receiving aid from the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program generally must get food at retail locations, such as grocery and convenience stores. But the federal government allows states to enact policies authorizing elderly, disabled and homeless residents to buy food at restaurants that agree to sell meals at lower prices. Some in the conservative caucus claimed their party leaders were violating a core GOP campaign pledge by supporting the legislation and encouraging low-income residents to squander their benefits. Others pushed back, noting the bill doesn’t increase the overall cost of the program but rather offers options for hot meals for people in need. Those who are disabled or elderly might not be able to cook, and people who are homeless don’t have refrigerators to store food or kitchens to prepare it, said Sen. Tony Luetkemeyer, the Republican whip responsible for rallying votes.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A new law that requires the state’s attorney general to warn voters if a proposed ballot initiative would hurt businesses does not apply to ballot measures that would amend the state constitution, a state judge has ruled. Wednesday’s decision by District Court Judge Chris Abbott of Helena allows signature gathering to continue for a constitutional initiative that seeks to cap residential property taxes at 1% of the assessed value and limit annual changes in valuations, thus limiting changes in residential property taxes. Market value assessments would be performed when property is sold or significantly improved, under the proposed initiative. The Montana Federation of Public Employees, the Montana Farmers Union, Realtor Jeff Barber, farmer Ron Ostberg and rancher Dennis McDonald argued in a complaint filed in January that Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen and Attorney General Austin Knudsen did not meet the requirements of the new law before allowing signatures to be gathered to put Constitutional Initiative 121 on the November 2022 ballot. The state argued and Abbott agreed that the law passed in 2021 applies only to initiatives that seek to change the law, not to change the state constitution. The plaintiffs oppose the ballot initiative because putting a limit on residential property taxes could shift the tax burden to agricultural land and other property and lead to reductions in state services.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Another large case of bird flu at a farm has been confirmed, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday. The highly contagious avian influenza was found on a farm in Knox County in northeast Nebraska along the South Dakota border. It is the seventh confirmed case of the disease in the state this year, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture said in a news release. More than 2.1 million laying hens will be euthanized, agriculture officials said. The farm will also be quarantined, and a 6.2-mile control zone will be established. The department also announced that an order prohibiting any type of birds from events such as fairs, expositions, swap meets, exotic sales and live bird auctions has been extended to May 15. It was scheduled to expire Saturday.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A wild coyote howls at the glow of a lamp post in a snowy parking lot. A mustard-yellow recliner is beached in a flooded grove of trees. These images depicting interactions between the human and natural world are part of the Nevada Museum of Art’s Altered Landscape collection and the inspiration behind a new classical composition, “Altered Landscape,” which the Reno Philharmonic will perform May 7-8 at the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts. In the upcoming performance, the Reno Phil plans to present a composition that will tackle the complexity of climate change and how the pandemic reflected that complexity. “This is a project that sheds both light and hope on one of the most urgent issues of our time: climate change,” said Reno Phil Music Director Laura Jackson. “There is no question that we are in an era where human impact has reached every corner of the earth, and we can no longer take for granted the health and abundance of the natural resources we hold dear.” In 2019, Jackson commissioned Peruvian-born composer Jimmy López Bellido to create a piece of music that would tell a story about climate change. The Reno Phil is approaching orchestras worldwide to perform the symphony in their respective communities. Rather than paying a consortium fee to the Reno group, other orchestras will donate a minimum of $1,000 directly to The Nature Conservancy.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has blocked an attempt to eliminate a registration system put in place years ago to prevent widespread hepatitis C outbreaks. New Hampshire created the Board of Registration for Medical Technicians in response to David Kwiatkowski, who is serving 39 years in prison for replacing painkillers with saline-filled syringes tainted with his blood. Despite being fired numerous times over drug allegations, Kwiatkowski had worked in 18 hospitals in seven states before being hired in at Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire. After his arrest in 2012, 46 people in four states were diagnosed with the same strain of the hepatitis C virus he carries, including one who died in Kansas. The New Hampshire House recently passed a bill that would eliminate the board, with supporters saying it creates unnecessary bureaucracy at a time when health care facilities are struggling to hire workers. But the Senate killed it Thursday, citing the importance of patient safety.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Orsted, the Danish wind power developer, signed an agreement Thursday with New Jersey officials to use a state-financed manufacturing port to build the components of the state’s first offshore wind farm. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the agreement during an international wind energy conference in Atlantic City, from whose coast the project’s turbines should be visible on the distant horizon. Orsted, which is partnering with Newark-based PSEG to build the project, will lease the New Jersey Wind Port in Salem County for two years starting in April 2024. Murphy did not reveal how much the developers will pay for the lease. The parties signed the letter of intent Thursday, but binding agreements are to be submitted to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority by June. The pact marks the first return on the state’s investment of up to $500 million in the wind port, designed to help the state attract companies interested in building wind power projects as New Jersey seeks to become the East Coast hub of the offshore wind industry. “This is a huge moment: Today is a vision turning into reality,” Murphy said at the conference, sponsored by the Business Network for Offshore Wind. “This is truly New Jersey’s ‘if you build it, they will come’ moment.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s K-12 schools should cut staff and think about downsizing the district’s footprint amid dwindling enrollment while spending more for the education of low-income students who fell further behind their peers during this school year, according to a report from the Legislature made public Wednesday. The report from the powerful Legislative Finance Committee recommended Albuquerque Public Schools let go of 400 of the district’s 12,000 employees but didn’t specify how many of the district’s increasingly empty schools it should shutter. The system has 144 schools and 73,000 students, down from 85,000 six years ago. Public schools in New Mexico have not recovered from the exodus of students that accelerated during the pandemic, with enrollment across the state and in Albuquerque still down about 4%, more than the average of 2.6% for 41 U.S. states. Thousands of families in New Mexico amid the pandemic tried home-schooling or charter schools for the first time and didn’t send their kids back to traditional classrooms this year. Despite getting financing federal pandemic relief funds, most school districts across the U.S. now have fewer students and less funding than before the pandemic, forcing educators to consider cutting spending.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s highest court on Wednesday rejected new congressional maps that had widely been seen as favoring Democrats, largely agreeing with Republican voters who argued the district boundaries were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. The decision may delay New York’s primary elections by as much as two months and is likely a hammer-blow to Democrats’ national redistricting hopes, which leaned heavily on their ability to gerrymander New York state to maximize the number of seats they could win in the U.S. House of Representatives. The state’s Court of Appeals said the Democratic-led Legislature lacked the authority to redraw congressional and state Senate maps after an independent redistricting commission charged with crafting new maps failed to reach a consensus. The judges also said lawmakers gerrymandered the congressional maps to Democrats’ favor, in violation of a 2014 constitutional amendment designed to rout out political gamesmanship in redistricting. The Appeals Court handed authority to draw new district maps to an expert, known as a special court master, instead of the Legislature. “Prompt judicial intervention is both necessary and appropriate to guarantee the People’s right to a free and fair election,” said the court’s opinion, written by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State residents can now cast ballots in person for the May 17 primary elections. Election boards in all 100 counties opened early voting sites Thursday morning. People who are registered to vote or who apply at a site can cast ballots. Party nominations for the U.S. Senate and House, the Legislature, judicial positions and county offices are at stake. There are also municipal races – many of them officially nonpartisan – in towns and cities where 2021 elections were delayed. The early-voting period continues through the afternoon of May 14. Some counties will have early voting on preceding weekends. An unaffiliated voter can choose to cast ballots in the Democratic or Republican primary but not both. Registered Democrats and Republicans must vote in their party’s primary. People who are already registered have other voting options. They can request a mail-in absentee ballot by May 10, or they can vote in person May 17.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The planned Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in western North Dakota won’t get all the money initially promised from a Walmart heir, but officials say they surpassed its $100 million private fundraising goal anyway. Rob and Melani Walton had pledged $50 million to the project near Medora but wound up committing to $15 million instead, as first reported by KFGO radio. Melani Walton, a Williston native, had been a member of the library’s board but resigned last month. Rob Walton is the eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Both library officials and the Waltons downplayed the diminished donation. “When the history of this remarkable institution is told years from now, Melani and Rob will occupy a significant place in that story,” library foundation CEO Ed O’Keefe told The Bismarck Tribune. “We wish them nothing but the best.” A statement from the Rob and Melani Walton Foundation said the couple “is so pleased to have supported this project from its inception.” Library organizers set the fundraising bar at $100 million in order to access an additional $50 million in state money. O’Keefe declined to say how much money has been raised, citing “the quiet phase of the capital campaign,” but said that “I can assure you it is in excess of $100 million.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Frustrated Democrats took the unusual step Thursday of calling their own political mapmaking hearing of sorts, inviting public testimonials and streaming the proceeding on Facebook. State Sen. Vernon Sykes and House Democratic Leader Allison Russo are both members of the bipartisan Ohio Redistricting Commission, a seven-member panel controlled by Republicans. The commission has not yet reconvened despite facing a May 6 deadline set by the Ohio Supreme Court for fixing its fourth set of invalidated Statehouse maps – though it has set a meeting for May 4, the day after the primary election. Sykes and Russo said their decision to schedule the forum followed their repeated attempts to get the other commissioners to the table, or to convene the panel themselves. Neither strategy worked, they said. The GOP’s casual approach to the deadline follows a key decision last week by a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which indicated in a separate federal lawsuit that it plans to impose the commission’s third set of legislative maps May 28 if no alternative is passed by then. The state Supreme Court has ruled the third set of maps – like the first, second and fourth – an unconstitutional gerrymander unduly favoring Republicans. “Too bad so sad,” influential Republican state Rep. Bill Seitz, of Cincinnati, said in a Twitter spat with former Ohio Democratic Chair David Pepper over the ruling. “We win again.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state House gave final approval Thursday to a Texas-style abortion ban that prohibits the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The bill approved by the GOP-led House on a 68-12 vote without discussion or debate now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who is expected to sign it within days. House members also voted Thursday to adopt new language prohibiting transgender students from using school restrooms that match their current gender identity and requiring parental notification to parents ahead of any classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity. “They’re all concerned about their elections coming up and making sure they have something they can put on a postcard to talk about,” said Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Midwest City. The abortion bill, dubbed the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act, prohibits abortions once cardiac activity can be detected in the fetus, which experts say is roughly six weeks into a pregnancy. A similar bill approved in Texas last year led to a dramatic reduction in the number of abortions performed in that state, sending many women seeking the procedure to Oklahoma and other surrounding states. Although Stitt already signed a bill this year to make performing an abortion a felony crime, it’s not set to take effect until later in the summer and might not withstand a legal challenge.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Court of Appeals on Wednesday overturned a $1.1 billion verdict against the state over its forest management practices, the latest development in a decades­long dispute over the best use of vast tracts of forestland that cover much of the state’s rural areas. A Linn County jury found in 2019 that Oregon breached its contract with 13 rural counties and 151 local taxing districts by failing to maximize timber harvests on state forests over the past two decades. The counties have said Oregon must manage more than 700,000 acres of state forestland for maximum timber revenue, while the state Department of Forestry believes it has the discretion to manage the land for wildlife and recreation. Gov. Kate Brown applauded the reversal and said in a statement that Oregon manages its forests sustainably “not only for the benefit and prosperity of this generation but those to come.” “Today’s decision by the Oregon Court of Appeals is a validation of the fact that a balanced, science-based approach to public forest management will produce the greatest long-term outcomes for all Oregonians, including the counties and taxing districts that receive revenue from state forests,” she said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHonesdale: A candidate in next month’s Republican primary for lieutenant governor was ordered this week to stay away from his home after his wife made claims of physical and mental abuse in obtaining a protective order. Teddy Daniels was accused of making threats, saying he would kill the family dog and grabbing his wife by the shirt. The woman also told a judge Daniels stalked her at work, “screaming at me, making me cry,” and continually cursed at her and threatened to throw her out of the home if he loses his campaign. He has hurled verbal abuse toward their son, she said in a handwritten, three-page petition. He also prevents her from seeing her family and told her she couldn’t attend a family funeral, she wrote. Daniels, 47, is one of nine candidates seeking the GOP nomination in the state’s May 17 primary, running with the endorsement of a leading candidate for governor, state Sen. Doug Mastriano. Both are vocal supporters of ex-President Donald Trump. Daniels has said he, like Mastriano, was outside the U.S. Capitol during the insurrectionist riot Jan. 6, 2021. Responding to his wife’s accusations, Daniels vowed to stay in the race and claimed without evidence that he was the target of “political terrorism” meant to damage his campaign. A Wayne County judge granted a temporary protection from abuse order to Daniels’ wife Tuesday. Daniels was removed from his home in a gated community in the Poconos. The judge gave Daniels’ wife temporary custody of their child and ordered Daniels to turn over his guns.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee on Thursday pulled out of a planned gubernatorial debate next week as a new online poll showed his popularity has fallen dramatically since last year. McKee was slated to participate in the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council candidate forum May 5 but said Thursday that he won’t do any debates until the election ballot is set at the end of June. “I’ll engage in these debates and forums once everybody signs their name on the line that they are running, and I am going to have to do that as well,” McKee told reporters at a general news briefing Thursday without elaborating on the decision. McKee skipped the first gubernatorial debate in February hosted by the Rhode Island Democratic Women’s Caucus. McKee’s office told RIPEC he is not doing debates last week after twice confirming he would attend, the business-backed fiscal watchdog group said Thursday. The announcement that McKee will not debate his rivals until the summer coincided with the release of an online poll from Morning Consult that found 42% of Rhode Island voters approve of the job he is doing, and 40% disapprove. It’s a big drop in popularity from last year, when Morning Consult found 59% of voters surveyed from July to October approved of the job McKee was doing, and only 25% disapproved.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: People who want the state to become the 49th to pass a hate crimes law have explained, bargained and begged Republicans in the state Senate just to hold a debate on the bill. On Wednesday, with just days left before the measure dies, they turned to one of the survivors of one of the most heinous racist attacks in modern America seeking to persuade senators to at least take a vote on the bill. They showed a two-minute video of Polly Sheppard to the Senate chamber, where the bill has been stuck for months, with eight Republicans senators objecting and only eight more legislative days to take action. The racist gunman who killed nine of Sheppard’s church friends in 2015 pointed his gun at the woman but said he would spare her life so she could let the world know he was killing Black people because he hated them. One of the dead from the attack was Sheppard’s pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, whose portrait hangs in a place of honor in the Senate chamber. “Eight members of the South Carolina Senate are giving a safe haven to hate. Every time you look at senator Pinckney’s photograph, you should be reminded that hate killed him,” Sheppard said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWatertown: In the wake of a high school teacher handing out a letter that refuted the gender identities of transgender students, some local organizations and businesses are working to provide a safe, supportive community for LGBTQ+ kids. Watertown Love held an event Tuesday night during which students, friends and family could converse in a safe environment. The gathering also provided an opportunity for community members to show their support for those affected by Monday’s incident at Watertown High School, which the school district is investigating. Students received a letter from German teacher Calvin Hillesland saying that when they asked him to call their friends by masculine names, he felt it was “wrong” and “a lie.” First Congregational United Church of Christ in Watertown was one of the community entities that offered support. Pastor Dustin Bartlett provided a letter of his own to the students and all LGBTQ+ individuals who might be struggling with their understanding of God and how religion fits with their sexuality and gender. “I have read the Bible. I have read much of it, including the so-called ‘clobber passages’ that have been used to attack LGBTQ+ people, in the original Hebrew and Greek languages,” he wrote. “I am something of an expert on this question, certainly more so than that of a high school German teacher. And I want to set the record straight. ... You are loved and worthy of love, just as you are. God loves you, just as you are.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republicans advanced legislation Wednesday that would place more scrutiny over what books are placed in public schools’ libraries, moments after the bill’s sponsor in the state House said any inappropriate book should be burned. The measure is just one of several proposals introduced in Tennessee this year designed to impose more scrutiny and transparency in school libraries amid a national spike in book challenges and bans. School librarians have become the target of scorn from GOP lawmakers pushing for more oversight on materials provided to children, particularly those that touch on racism and LGBTQ issues. Rep. Jerry Sexton, R-Bean Station, introduced a last-minute amendment this week to a school bill that would give the state’s textbook commission – made up of politically appointed members – veto power over what books end up on school library shelves. Schools would have to provide the commission a list of their library materials. Rep. John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, asked Sexton what he would do with books deemed to be inappropriate. “You going to put them in the street? Light them on fire? Where are they going?” Clemmons asked. “I don’t have a clue, but I would burn them,” Sexton said on the House floor. Later, he amended what he had said on the floor to note that he wasn’t a member of the textbook commission and didn’t think any book-burning was likely to occur.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas officials are warning students to stay away from raccoons on campus after three students were bitten and received rabies vaccinations as a precaution. The UT Office of Campus Safety tweeted Wednesday that the university has seen “an increase of incidents involving raccoons and the UT student population where raccoons may be made bolder due to being fed by humans.” The raccoon in question is believed to be located around the outside of the McCombs School of Business and the Perry-Castañeda Library, and it might feel threatened by close contact, especially if it has offspring nearby, according to the UT Office of Campus Safety. The school said people should be aware of their surroundings in the area and seek medical attention immediately if they are scratched or bitten by a raccoon or any other wildlife. The university also is urging people to not approach raccoons with the intent to feed, pet or take pictures with the animals.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Canyon Overlook Trail, one of the oldest hikes in Zion National Park, is getting a facelift this summer, the park announced. With upgrades like improved trail tread, rehabilitated masonry, and handrails, the more than 5 million annual visitors to the nation’s second-most-popular national park will have an upgraded sight to see. “The (National Park Service) planned this work to protect the trail’s historic, rustic appearance and enhance safety for hikers,” officials said in a press release. The trail will be closed Monday to Thursday each week while work is underway until early June, and though it will be open most Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, there might be intermittent closures on weekends. The Pine Creek canyoneering route and lower Pine Creek Drainage, with sections below the Canyon Overlook Trail, may be closed for short periods to “ensure safety,” the release said. “Canyoneers traveling this route need to be mindful of their surroundings, watch for signs showing closed areas, and be aware that work may be happening above them,” it said. The Canyon Overlook Trail is outside the east end of the Mount Carmel Tunnel and was originally built in the 1930s, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A foundation is working with the state community college system to provide a free, two-year college degree over the next five years. The J. Warren & Lois McClure Foundation announced the “Free Degree Promise through the Early College Program at CCV” on Tuesday for Vermont students in the high school classes of 2022-2026. In addition to providing tuition and fees after any federal and state financial aid, the foundation will provide career and education counseling and stipends to help pay for books, transportation and other college costs. The McClure foundation’s plan builds upon the Community College of Vermont’s Early College program that allows high school seniors to complete their last year of high school and first year of college at the same time. “Young people deserve a degree they can count on and afford,” McClure Foundation President Barbara Benedict said in a statement. “By guaranteeing this pathway through Early College to a free degree at CCV, we are telling Vermont’s young people we believe in them and we believe in their futures.” Vermont officials have been working for years to help alleviate what has become an acute labor shortage caused by declines in the number of working-age adults and the lack of trained workers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats in the House of Delegates voted Wednesday to remove their caucus leader, months after an unsuccessful election cycle that saw the party lose full control of the state government. The 48-member caucus voted by secret ballot to remove Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn, who previously served as Virginia’s first female House speaker, according to lawmakers and staffers who spoke with reporters shortly after the vote. The membership voted against removing caucus chair Charniele Herring, lawmakers said. No immediate vote was held on who would fill Filler-Corn’s role. The vote on whether to remove the two women came after a campaign led in part by Del. Don Scott, an attorney and two-term House member from Portsmouth. Scott resigned a caucus leadership post, vice-chair for outreach, on Sunday and called for the election to remove Herring and Filler-Corn. He nominated himself to take over Filler-Corn’s role and nominated two young, progressive members to serve along with him. Filler-Corn, who served as the first female and first Jewish speaker of the House of Delegates for two years after Democrats flipped the chamber in 2019, conceded her role immediately. She called leading the caucus “the honor of my life.”\n\nWashington\n\nIssaquah: An invasive species is consuming and competing with native species in western Washington, including salmon. Scientists have spotted African clawed frogs in Issaquah, Lacey and Bothell, KING5 reports. The frogs were initially brought into the United States to be used in pregnancy tests and later became pets, said state wildlife scientist Max Lambert. Although Washington made it illegal to own them, some still do. Others who decided not to keep the frogs ultimately released them into ponds and streams. As officials began looking into the issue, they discovered hundreds of frogs. “These are considered one of the worst invasive species on earth,” Lambert said. “They’ll eat a lot of native insects, which are good forage food for our fishes and our amphibians, they will eat tadpoles of our native salamanders, and they’ll eat fish. We looked at some of their stomach contents – and they’re full of baby fish.” People working to restore salmon populations fear the frogs will infringe on that progress. Since Trout Unlimited began trapping in January, the organization has caught about 300 frogs, Rebecca Lavier said. About half of those have been found in the past few weeks. They believe it’s just a fraction of the population.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: An investigation of conditions at a jail has found no evidence of inhumane treatment of inmates, Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday. The Republican governor ordered the investigation last month after a TV station reported allegations of water deprivation, failure to provide toilet paper, and inmates having to sleep on hard floors without a mattress at the Southern Regional Jail in Beaver. “Our investigators talked with a bunch of people and pulled a bunch of records and, at the end of the day, they determined that the allegations were simply not true,” Justice said in a statement. The investigation by the state Department of Homeland Security determined inmates have continuous access to water at sinks in their cells and an industrial water fountain in each section of the jail. Every inmate is provided tumblers for water consumption, and the jail maintains a minimum three-day supply of bottled water for emergencies. In addition, inmates receive three drinks each day for breakfast, lunch and dinner, including those in segregation and quarantine units. There was no history of medical cases of dehydration, and no inmates have filed grievances for being deprived of water, according to jail records. In addition, ample toilet paper is provided to inmates, while the jail buys new mattresses for inmates regularly, according to the investigation.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Most of the respondents to the Wisconsin Conservation Congress’ spring survey say they support limiting the state’s wolf population to 350 animals. The congress, an influential group of sportspeople who advise the state Department of Natural Resources on policy, holds a survey each spring gauging respondents’ support for a wide range of outdoor and environmental proposals. This year’s survey was conducted online earlier this month. One question asked if the respondent supports limiting the wolf population to 350 animals. Of the Wisconsin residents who responded, 12,978 said they supported that number, 6,410 said they did not, and 2,277 had no opinion. Overall, 13,136 respondents said they supported the limit, 6,633 said they did not, and 2,326 had no opinion. The results are advisory only. The question comes as the DNR is revising its wolf management plan. A draft is expected to be released by June. The DNR’s current wolf management plan dates back to 1999 and lays out a goal of 350 animals. Wolf hunt supporters have held up the number as justification for higher quotas. The DNR’s latest population estimates, compiled over the winter of 2020-21, put the number of wolves roaming the state at 1,126.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The virtual emergency room visits that a hospital began allowing early in the COVID-19 pandemic have been suspended, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Cheyenne Regional Medical Center’s telehealth visits began as a way to screen patients from home so that some could avoid visiting the hospital and risking the spread of the coronavirus, but as the virus’s spread “has cooled down,” CRMC is pausing the program and considering changes, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/09/river-troll-cob-cornstalk-batman-escort-news-around-states/40100855/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A memorial is being dedicated to two black men who were killed in what are described as racist lynchings near the city in the 1890s. The Jefferson County Memorial Project says it will dedicate a marker to Tom Redmond and Jake McKenzie at Sloss Furnaces on Monday night. An announcement says both men worked at mines owned by Sloss-Sheffield Iron and Steel, and both were killed in the old mining town of Brookside during confrontations with police. Redmond was killed during a shootout near a company store in 1890. McKenzie was fatally shot seven years later when a city marshal attempted to arrest a black man for abusive language. A statement by Mayor Randall Woodfin describes both men as victims of “unspeakable hate.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s hot, dry summer has led to severe drought conditions in some communities, which are struggling to meet their water needs. The arid conditions are widespread but acutely felt in a handful of small communities that rely on snow melt and rain to fill their reserves. Among the worst hit have been the Alutiiq communities of Nanwalek and Seldovia in the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. Their plight prompted regional officials to issue a disaster declaration. Nanwalek is shutting off the public water supply 12 hours each day and barging in jugs of water to deal with water shortages. In the Alutiiq community of Seldovia, automatic flush toilets have been switched to manual flushing, and restaurants are serving meals on paper plates.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Inmates have asked a federal judge to take over health care operations in all state-run prisons and appoint an official to run medical and mental health services due to Arizona’s repeated failure to improve the care. Attorneys representing 34,000 inmates said in a filing Friday that the state has failed to fulfill many of the improvements to inmate care that it promised nearly five years ago when the case was settled. The takeover request marks an escalation in the litigation in which the state has repeatedly been accused of dragging its feet. Previously, the state has been fined for failing to follow through on its promises. In the latest request, the inmates requested a receivership be ordered to run health care operations in prisons and asked the judge to follow through on her earlier threat to impose a second contempt-of-court fine against the state for noncompliance.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: A newspaper that was expected to shut down Friday has a new owner. GateHouse Media said it has entered an agreement to sell the Helena-West Helena World to a pair of local entrepreneurs. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but new owners Andrew Bagley and Chuck Davis said they intend to publish the newspaper weekly. Last week, GateHouse announced that the Helena-West Helena paper would shut down along with the Stuttgart Daily Leader. The Stuttgart newspaper reports that negotiations are underway for a new buyer there, but nothing has been finalized. GateHouse publishes 154 daily newspapers, most in small- and mid-sized towns. In August, GateHouse announced it was merging with fellow newspaper giant Gannett, USA TODAY’s parent company.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Homeowners forced to rebuild because of a wildfire won’t have to install solar panels under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. New rules taking effect Jan. 1 make California the first state in the country to require solar panels on new homes. But thousands of homes across the Golden State have been damaged or destroyed in recent years because of wildfires and other natural disasters. Newsom signed a bill Friday that temporarily exempts homes from the rules in areas where the governor has declared a state of emergency prior to Jan. 1, 2020. The exemption would expire in 2023. Newsom said he supports efforts to rebuild communities as fast as possible. But he urged all Californians to consider installing solar panels.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has taken the unusual step of inviting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to downgrade the air quality rating of its biggest population center, and not everyone thinks that was a good idea. The EPA held a hearing Friday on whether to lower the ozone status of Denver and eight other northern Colorado counties from “moderate” to “serious.” That would force the state to work harder to reduce harmful pollution but also bring tougher and costly regulations for businesses. The agency expects to decide by the end of the year. The EPA acted after Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in March that Colorado would no longer ask for an exemption from EPA standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting into the state from elsewhere. It’s time to stop “sugar-coating” Colorado’s air problems, he said last month.\n\nConnecticut\n\nLedyard: The state’s hemp industry is beginning to take off. Gov. Ned Lamont announced last week that the state has licensed 82 hemp growers, two processors and 21 manufacturers under a pilot program the Democrat signed into law earlier this year. The law allows for the cultivation, harvesting, processing, and manufacturing of hemp plants and by-products in the state. In total, 294 acres of land are being used to grow hemp in Connecticut. Under the law, which created a new industrial hemp research project, anyone who plans to manufacture hemp products that are consumed in any way by people – such as food products, lotions or oils – must obtain a license from the state Department of Consumer Protection. Lamont said the program is creating more opportunities in the agricultural industry.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The first woman to lead Delaware State University as president has announced her retirement after a little more than a year in the role. News outlets report Wilma Mishoe announced Thursday that she’ll retire at the end of December. Tony Allen, the current executive vice president and provost of the university, will take over as president. Mishoe officially assumed her role in July 2018, having served as interim president since January 2018. She became the first woman to lead the state’s only historically black university. Mishoe had previously left retirement to lead Delaware State. Allen says it was Mishoe’s expectation that she’d help “stabilize” the school, then enter retirement again.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two D.C. councilmembers have asked government officials to examine a local company that has no employees and yet was given the largest workload and payout from a $215 million no-bid sports gambling contract. The Washington Post reports Robert C. White Jr. and Elissa Silverman want an investigation into Veterans Services Corp., which is contracted by Intralot for sports betting and city lottery work. Their votes were crucial in awarding Intralot the sole-source contract, despite concerns about subcontractors, some of whom are connected to local officials. The newspaper says Veterans Services has no employees and lists executives on its website who don’t actually work there.\n\nFlorida\n\nCrystal River: It wasn’t Gotham City, but Batman descended on a local preschool to help a 3-year-old girl who was being bullied. When Erica Calculli’s daughter Lydia came home from school with bruises on her face, she chalked it up to regular kids’ play. But then Lydia came home with a swollen black eye last month. The little girl told her mother that her classmates hit her and threw a shoe at her. Calculli says she reported the incident to her daughter’s school, but nothing came of it. She turned to social media, where Batman impersonator Jack Asbury saw the post and offered to walk the little girl to school. Calculli posted an adorable photo of the shy girl holding the black-caped superhero’s hand in the classroom. WTSP reports the toddler has since been moved to an advanced learning class.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: Many Cobb County voters will cast hand-marked paper ballots in Nov. 5 municipal elections as a backup plan for the state’s election equipment ordered by a federal judge. News outlets report paper ballots will be trialed in Austell, Kennesaw, Powder Springs and Smyrna. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ordered a contingency plan be developed in case Georgia’s newly purchased touchscreen voting machines aren’t fully implemented by 2020. The new machines print a paper record of a voter’s selections. They’ll replace the state’s current outdated machines that don’t produce an auditable paper trail. Cobb County elections director Janine Eveler says she expects Cobb voters to be using the new machines by March, but the paper ballot test is a “fail safe” against any issues.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A federal agency has approved a rail recovery plan submitted by the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, officials said. U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz said the Federal Transit Administration approved the proposal submitted earlier this year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The recovery plan was submitted by the city transportation authority to demonstrate Honolulu has a workable proposal for completing the 20-mile rail line. The line was originally estimated at $5.2 billion and was supposed to be completed next year, but the transit administration now projects completion in 2026 at a cost of $9.2 billion. The approval recognizes efforts by the city and state to improve accountability and control costs, Schatz said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: BNSF Railway’s plan to build two bridges as part of a second railroad line in northern Idaho to accommodate increased train traffic and future growth meets environmental requirements, federal officials said Thursday. The U.S. Coast Guard issued a final environmental assessment for the bridges across Lake Pend Oreille and Sand Creek at Sandpoint, finding no significant impact. An environmental group said it was disappointed the Coast Guard didn’t do a much lengthier environmental review called an environmental impact statement, saying an increase in crude oil and other hazardous materials crossing bridges could put the lake and residents at risk. The Coast Guard is involved because the structures are over navigable waters. Idaho officials, who have authority over the lake bottom, have already approved the bridges.\n\nIllinois\n\nDowners Grove: This year’s Illinois Tollway high school art contest will honor the Illinois State Police. Tollway officials announced last week that the winning design will appear on the cover of the 2020 tollway map. The art contest is presented with Blick Art Materials and MB Real Estate. Several Illinois State Police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year. Two died while working on the 294-mile tollway system. Officials say students who enter the contest should “illustrate the service and sacrifice” of state troopers. Artwork could focus on how the state police helps motorists through its principles of integrity, service and pride; how it promotes traffic safety; or how it serves the tollway with motorcycle, K-9 and detective units.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Ball State University will lead archaeological surveys at three state parks to locate possible prehistoric sites and homesteads from the early 1800s. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says those surveys are among 15 projects around the state sharing in about $450,000 in federal grants for historic preservation and archaeology. The archaeology surveys are planned at Summit Lake State Park, the Wilbur Wright Fish and Wildlife Area, and Versailles State Park. About $150,000 was awarded toward the surveys. A variety of other projects received grants, including roof replacement at the former Peru High School gymnasium, which is now the Miami Nation’s tribal headquarters, and repairing the century-old entrance gate at St. Mary of the Woods College near Terre Haute.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Madison: Officials say the Sheaffer Pen Museum has reopened. The museum closed in May last year amid financial concerns and worries about the fate of company archives. The Fort Madison Daily Democrat reports the archives had been on loan from A.T. Cross, Sheaffer’s owner. The museum board president, Tim Gobble, says Cross has agreed to donate virtually all of the company archives to the museum. Grants and other financial pledges of support since have allowed the museum to reopen. Plans are being made for new and refreshed exhibits, as well as video from the company archives. The museum’s regular hours are 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday or by appointment for larger groups.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The local zoo is beginning a 25-year process of rebuilding and expansion. The Wichita Eagle reports the next few weeks will bring moving day for animals large and small at the Sedgwick County Zoo. The first noticeable change will be the demolition of the second-oldest building at the zoo, a 47-year-old Asian-themed barn with a corrugated steel roof. It will be torn down to make way for a temporary entrance while the main entrance is rebuilt at twice its current size. During the process, a 1,400-pound Zebu bull named Milkdud that’s native to south Asia will be moved in with the Watusi cattle at the African Barn. Plans also are in the works for a new home for the Amur leopards, new office space and a solar-powered train.\n\nKentucky\n\nPikeville: Grants totaling $34.4 million have been announced in an effort to spur economic development and job creation in eastern Kentucky – a region hard-hit by the coal sector’s downturn. Officials say the grants will support projects affecting 14 counties. The support includes nearly $4.8 million for Pikeville Medical Center to develop a children’s hospital and pediatric clinic expected to provide health care services for more than 100,000 children. Leslie County will receive more than $2 million to develop a program expanding internet connectivity and providing job training. U.S. Rep. Harold “Hal” Rogers says grants will help advance health care, enhance tourism, improve infrastructure and create jobs.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The city is closing a historic cemetery in the Garden District for maintenance and repairs. Tours and public visits won’t be allowed until the work is complete at Lafayette Cemetery No. 1. Appointments will be needed for funerals or visits to family tombs. The work starts Monday. A news release says tomb owners can call the property management department for appointments. The area was a separate city, Lafayette, when the cemetery was founded in 1833. Novelist Anne Rice used the cemetery as the setting for her fictional Mayfair witches’ family tomb. Planned work includes fixing a water line, improving drainage, removing and repaving paths, fixing a brick wall and abandoned tombs, removing magnolia trees, and thoroughly cleaning up debris.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state moved ahead Friday with plans to become the first to allow voters to rank candidates in a general presidential election. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said she’ll allow a bill to become law in January without her signature. The legislation requires ranked choice voting in presidential elections and primaries. Ranked voting won’t be used in a planned presidential primary in March 2020, Mills’ office said. The bill won’t go into effect until 90 days after the Legislature is set to adjourn in April. But future presidential primaries would use ranked choice voting, according to the governor’s office. Maine voters in 2016 approved ranked voting, but the system was limited to federal races and primaries.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A two-year project to rehabilitate the westbound span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge that’s expected to cause major delays will be getting underway this month. The Capital Gazette reports some work on the $27 million project was scheduled to start after Labor Day but was delayed. The westbound right lane will now be closed on weekdays starting Sept. 24. Then, starting in October, the right lane will be closed 24/7 through April 16, with restrictions lifted during Thanksgiving. From April 16 through May 20, the westbound right lane will be closed continuously during weekdays. All lanes are expected to be open during next summer’s travel season. The lane closures resume beginning in fall 2020 into spring 2021. The project, fully funded by tolls, is expected to be complete in August 2021.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State transportation officials are restoring 21 historic road markers installed nearly 80 years ago to mark the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony because they’ve grown weather-beaten over the decades. The cast iron markers, originally installed in 1930, feature black lettering and trim, plus the state’s coat of arms in blue and gold. They describe historic events and figures and provide facts and stories about their communities. All of the markers are 36 inches wide, between 35 and 45 inches high, and 165 to 200 pounds. The state Transportation Department says the markers being restored are in Bernardston, Brimfield, Deerfield, Greenfield, Hadley, Hatfield, New Braintree, Northfield, West Brookfield and Worcester. The project is expected to be completed this winter.\n\nMichigan\n\nIsle Royale: The second year of the National Park Service’s wolf relocation project has kicked off with a capture of a wolf on the state’s mainland and a flight to Isle Royale in Lake Superior. Mlive reports the 70-pound male that’s believed to be about 3 years old was captured last week. The wolf that was flown by seaplane joins 14 others already on Isle Royale, and officials hope to ultimately bring as many as 30 new wolves to the island that’s been overrun by more than 2,000 moose. Officials hope the new predators will be able to reduce the number of the leaf-eating moose before the latter eat their way through the island located about 60 miles northwest of the Upper Peninsula.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz has finally made good on a long-held campaign promise. After “eight months of negotiations and dealmaking,” he signed off on adopting a new dog for the family. Scout is a 3-month-old black lab mix the Walzes adopted from Midwest Animal Rescue in the metro area. The governor said he had in March 2017 promised son Gus a dog if he won the 2018 election. Walz said his promise wasn’t brought up during the campaign trail, but Gus reminded Walz about the dog on election night once it became clear Walz would prevail. Scout comes as a bit of a surprise, as it wasn’t certain whether the Walzes would get a dog. Walz’s wife, Gwen, said Walz made that promise to Gus without consulting her first. And some of Walz’s family are allergic to certain dog breeds, to say nothing of how other pets would view a dog. “Afton the cat has not been happy,” Walz said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is considering new rules that let companies continue to use food-labeling terms such as “veggie burger” and “vegan bacon,” as long as the terms are prominently displayed so consumers understand the products are not meat. The state agriculture department on Thursday proposed new regulations for plant-based products that are sold as alternatives to meat. The regulations came in response to a lawsuit filed by a nonprofit organization advocating plant-based foods and an Illinois food company. The lawsuit was filed July 1, the same day the state enacted a law saying that “a plant-based or insect-based food product shall not be labeled as meat or a meat food product.” Meat producers have been trying to protect meat terminology by pushing for state laws that restrict labeling of products such as meatless meatballs.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Critics say a loophole in a new law meant to ensure the safety of children in unlicensed child care homes has caused some children to be pushed out of licensed facilities. Before the law took effect Aug. 28, unlicensed, in-home child care providers could care for four or fewer unrelated children and an unlimited number of their own children. Under the new law, unlicensed providers may care for only six children, and no more than three under age 2. Day care operators’ children over age 5 are excluded in the count. The Columbia Missourian reports lawmakers inadvertently required licensed day care providers to count all their own children, regardless of age. That discrepancy has forced some licensed day care providers to refuse spots for unrelated children. A waiver process for licensed providers for their children over 5 is being used on a case-by-case basis to fix the loophole.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State health officials are proposing new rules to regulate medical marijuana testing laboratories. A notice issued Friday by the state Department of Public Health and Human Services says a hearing will be held on the proposed rules Sept. 26 at its offices in Helena. The health department drafted the regulations after state lawmakers earlier this year put the agency’s state laboratory in charge of licensing and inspecting the marijuana testing labs. The proposal would set new rules by which the labs are licensed and accredited and how they operate. Existing licensing and accreditation regulations would be repealed. State law requires medical marijuana providers to test their products in a licensed lab for quality assurance before they can be sold.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials have unveiled a blue, 300-pound bronze statue of a troll that now sits below the popular Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge spanning the Missouri River from Omaha to Council Bluffs, Iowa. Omar the Troll – short for Omaha Metro Area River – was introduced during a news conference Wednesday. The 4-foot troll with a toothy grin now greets visitors from atop a concrete cottage set up on a mulched area by one of the bridge’s pillars. The sculpture is the brainchild of tourism group Visit Omaha and has been in the works for three years. The idea behind his creation is to keep visitors excited about the riverfront bridge. Deborah Ward with Visit Omaha tells the Omaha World-Herald that “every bridge needs a troll.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A preservation group plans to use a grant to redevelop and preserve a historically black community. The Westside neighborhood, virtually the only area of the city where African Americans were permitted to live in the 1940s, saw hundreds of homes razed and thousands of people displaced, with residents not compensated for their destroyed dwellings, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Some vacant lots in the neighborhood just blocks northwest of downtown still date to that ugly period, says Heidi Swank, executive director of the Nevada Preservation Foundation. The foundation plans to use a $50,000 grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to identify and highlight Westside stories of triumph, innovation and success. Frank Woodbeck, a foundation board member, says that unlike in traditional redevelopment, the foundation aims to keep people in the neighborhood or even bring back former residents.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: This year’s New Hampshire Highland Games is hosting the World Championship in Heavy Athletics, where athletes from seven countries will compete in traditional Scottish events to test strength and agility. The competition will feature the stone throw, hammer throw and caber toss. The games are scheduled for Sept. 20-22 at the Loon Mountain Resort in Lincoln. Chuck Kasson, the reigning world champion and winner of the 2018 New Hampshire Highland Games, is among those scheduled to compete. Also featured will be a performance of the bagpipe band The Red Hot Chili Pipers on Sept. 21.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDeptford: A cornstalk that was planted by accident has now shattered a Guinness world record. The record belongs to Matt Jacovelli, a Deptford retiree who noticed the unusually abundant cornstalk over the summer. “I started counting and got up to 12, 13 and 14 cobs and couldn’t believe it,” he said. The final tally was 29 cobs, verified by Rutgers agricultural agent Michelle Infante-Casella on Aug. 30. Jacovelli submitted the official count to Guinness and received a quick ruling. On Thursday, he learned he now holds the Guinness record for “most corn cobs on a single plant.” The previous world record was held by another place known for corn: Iowa. But Jacovelli nearly doubled that 2009 record, which was for 16 cobs. A typical cornstalk yields two cobs.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nWhite Sands Missile Range: White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico has scheduled an Oct. 5 open house at Trinity Site, the second of two such events planned this year. Trinity Site is where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated July 16, 1945. Range officials said the open house is free, and no reservations are required. Entry will be allowed from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Visitors can walk to ground zero, where a small obelisk marks the spot where the bomb was detonated. Historical photos are mounted on the fence surrounding the area. Visitors can also ride a shuttle bus to travel the 2 miles from ground zero to ranch houses where scientists assembled the bomb’s plutonium core.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The state has a new license plate that features several famous landmarks. The Department of Motor Vehicles announced the design Friday based on the results of a statewide survey. The winning plate showcases iconic settings like the Statue of Liberty, Niagara Falls and the Montauk Lighthouse. It also features the state motto “Excelsior,” a Latin word meaning “ever upward,” and a blue-and-yellow color scheme on a white background. DMV Commissioner Mark Schroeder says some 325,000 New Yorkers participated in the survey. About half of them selected the winning design over four other options. He said the design represents “what the Empire State is all about– our diversity, our unparalleled architecture and natural beauty.” The new license plate costs $25 and will be available to motorists in April.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s Historic Preservation Office has set up an online form so local governments and residents can report damage to historic properties caused by Hurricane Dorian. The office wants information about wind and flooding to historic structures, cemeteries and state highway historical markers. With that information in hand, the office can offer aid, technical expertise, and consultation with federal and state entities. The Historic Preservation Office offers technical advice and consultation for the restoration of damaged historic properties at no charge. A building must be at least 45 years old, but it doesn’t have to have any special historic designation. In addition, the office’s website offers tips for drying out flooded buildings, documenting damage for insurance purposes and other technical advice.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities relying on DNA collected from a cigarette butt have charged a man with engaging in a riot for his involvement in a Dakota Access pipeline protest three years ago. The Bismarck Tribune reports Morton County prosecutors also charged 23-year-old Lawrence Malcolm Jr. with felony conspiracy to commit criminal mischief. An arrest warrant was issued Thursday. The charges relate to a Sept. 6, 2016, protest on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. An affidavit says more than 100 demonstrators, many with their faces covered, halted construction and vandalized equipment. North Dakota crime lab officials notified investigators last month that DNA from a cigarette butt found at the scene was a match for Malcolm, whose DNA profile was on file from an earlier arrest.\n\nOhio\n\nSharonville: A man confused about state drug laws has called a police department demanding that officers return the small amount of marijuana they “stole” from him. WXIX-TV reports the man told a Sharonville police dispatcher in an expletive-laced call Tuesday that it’s legal to possess 100 grams of marijuana, and the amount officers seized was just 4 grams. Sharonville police posted a recording of the call on their Facebook page. The suburban Cincinnati department wryly noted: “People may be a bit in the weeds, so we would like to take this opportunity to clear the haze.” While some Ohio cities have decriminalized pot possession, it remains illegal in the state. Sharonville police said they “don’t make the rules” but must uphold them.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPerry: Hundreds of strangers have honored a 97-year-old World War II veteran who funeral home officials say died with no known surviving family. Motorcycles carrying U.S. flags were part of Wednesday’s service for Herman White, who died Aug. 11. White was buried next to his wife and son in Perry, 60 miles north of Oklahoma City. Funeral director Rebecca Raines, with Brown-Dugger Funeral Home, reached out to the community after learning White had no known surviving relatives. White married in 1941, joined the Navy in 1945 and served aboard the USS Muliphen in the Pacific. After the military, White returned to Oklahoma and worked in the oil and gas fields. The couple had a son in 1951. White’s wife died in 1998. Their son died in 1999.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities being attacked and locked up in isolation – this is what some kids from Oregon were subjected to after being sent to out-of-state facilities because of a lack of services in their home state. After investigations revealed deplorable conditions, Oregon is now bringing them back. A state senator at the forefront in the effort says it is critically important for Oregon to provide mental health services. Sen. Sara Gelser, a Democrat from Corvallis, says the Oregon Department of Human Services planned to have 120 children in out-of-state placements by the end of June. Instead, 37 children are in out-of-state facilities, down from as many as 88. Gelser said she wants the number at zero and for strong programs to be built in Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will receive another $75 million in federal aid to fight the opioid-addiction crisis, money that Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration says will help with treatment, prevention and education. Wolf’s administration said Friday that about $56 million will go to the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs. The money will also help extend programs designed to help people in addiction treatment find stable housing and to attract treatment professionals by helping repay their education loans. The state Department of Health received $8.4 million, a grant that is expected to repeat each of the next two years, while Philadelphia received $5.9 million, and Allegheny County received $5.2 million.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The organization that oversees high school sports in the state is asking overzealous parents to settle down because they are driving away qualified game officials. The executive director of the Rhode Island Interscholastic League tells WJAR-TV the primary reason the state has a shortage of referees and umpires is that officials don’t want to put up with obnoxious parents. In a letter to parents of high school athletes, Tom Mezzanotte wrote: “Yelling, screaming and berating the officials humiliates your child, annoys those sitting around you” and “embarrasses your child’s school.” He says the shortage of officials results in games being rescheduled, postponed or canceled. Softball umpire Susan Johnson says an angry parent drove toward a colleague’s car after a game before swerving away at the last second.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An upstate school district has started work on a new $15 million building at its science center. WSPA-TV reports the Greenville County school district is constructing a building that will house exhibits on the water cycle and sustainable living, plus a cafeteria and several classrooms. The building is supposed to be complete in fall 2020 and replaces an unused outdoor amphitheater. The science center is owned by the school district, which is providing $12 million in funding. The Roper Mountain Science Center Association has raised the other $3 million privately. Exhibits were designed in collaboration with the Shi Center for Sustainability. The science center already has an observatory, planetarium, living history farm and other exhibit buildings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPine Ridge: The Oglala Sioux Tribe has passed legislation aimed at hate crimes on the Pine Ridge reservation. The Rapid City Journal reports the law passed by the tribal council Wednesday makes hate crimes punishable with up to one year in jail, which is the maximum allowed under tribal law. The law defines a hate crime as one where the defendant intentionally targets a victim or property because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability of any person. The law comes two months after the tribe legalized same-sex marriage on the reservation.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A priest who banned Harry Potter books from a Catholic school’s library was accused by parents of causing their children psychological and spiritual harm. A 2017 letter from 14 St. Edward Catholic School parents urged the Nashville diocese to remove the Rev. Dan Reehil. The letter, with 50 bullet points, said Reehil is a toxic narcissist who hates Pope Francis and views himself as “a soldier of God.” It said: “Our school, however, consists of children, not soldiers.” Diocesan spokesman Rick Musacchio said Reehil’s views, like that of the retired, more liberal pastor he replaced, both have homes in the church. Reehil didn’t respond to the Tennessean’s interview requests. In an email, he said he removed J.K. Rowling’s books because they contain “actual spells and curses.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A federal judge is expressing frustration that officials don’t seem to be honoring a settlement of a lawsuit over oppressive heat at some state prison facilities. During a court hearing Friday in Houston, U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison debated whether officials should be sanctioned by having them experience the same temperatures as inmates. Ellison delayed a ruling on possible sanctions until he’s heard from officials, including prison wardens, at a hearing Tuesday. Last year’s settlement resolved a lawsuit filed in 2014 over temperatures at the Wallace Pack Unit, about 95 miles northwest of Houston. Attorneys for the inmates say prison officials are not adhering to the settlement. A lawyer with the Texas Attorney General’s Office told Ellison officials are working to fix problems affecting the prisoners.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Conservative groups in the state have addressed school officials to disapprove of a new teacher instructional guide for sex education. The Deseret News reports Utah Eagle Forum was one of many groups that addressed the state Board of Education on Thursday criticizing the changes. Board officials say instructional guides were created addressing specific topics including sex education after new K-12 health standards were passed in April. Officials say teachers are now allowed to respond to student questions to provide medically accurate data and clarify or correct misinformation. Officials say the guide does not allow teachers to answer technique or how-to questions. Some parents say teachers should be encouraging students to speak to their parents, nurses or counselors and not expose other students to these types of questions or their answers.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A river poisoned by a mine that dates to the United States’ early days is looking good two decades after cleanup began. Contractors working for the Environmental Protection Agency as part of the federal Superfund program are doing final work on the Elizabeth Mine in Strafford before turning it over to the state for long-term monitoring. The mine was once important enough to the economy of the young country that President James Monroe visited in 1817. It stayed in business for decades, feeding industrial, electrification and war efforts before closing in 1958. For decades, acid- and metal-contaminated water from the waste piles near the abandoned mine left local waterways almost dead. Now after the estimated $90 million cleanup, the state has changed the designation of the Ompompanoosuc River. It now supports aquatic life.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: Three couples planning to get married have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state requirement that they disclose their race on their marriage application. Lawyer Victor Glasberg says that the requirement is a vestige of Jim Crow laws and that Virginia is one of only eight states requiring marriage applicants to disclose their race. According to the lawsuit, one Virginia county provided a list of more than 200 potential races to a couple who questioned the requirement. It included “American,” “Aryan,” “Moor” and “Mulatto.” A spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the office will examine the complaint closely and determine how to proceed. Glasberg says he does not think Herring should defend the law.\n\nWashington\n\nColfax: The work of plowing, planting and harvesting is still done the old-fashioned way with teams of draft horses and mules on a parcel of farmland in eastern Washington. On Labor Day, several hundred spectators watched an annual, public demonstration of those methods near Colfax. A combine header pushed by a team of six Percheron draft mules fed cut grain into vintage wagons, each pulled by a pair of horses, as several acres of barley were harvested. Volunteers with the Palouse Empire Threshing Bee Association, a group dedicated to preserving the way land was farmed decades ago, took time away from their own harvest work to bring in the barley. Stan Riebold, a longtime member of the group, said it plans to continue preserving the old way of doing things.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: The city has approved an ordinance that would regulate a needle exchange run by the local health department. News outlets report the Clarksburg City Council voted Thursday to approve the final reading of the proposal, which would require those receiving needles to meet requirements that include submitting to blood tests and showing photo identification. Health department administrator Chad Bundy had expressed concerns with some of the ordinance’s provisions, including the photo ID requirement and limiting the program to Harrison County residents. City Attorney James Cann said prior to the meeting that he had reviewed the ordinance and found no legal problems. Clarksburg Mayor Ryan Kennedy has said the needle exchange program is “creating some negatives,” and officials want to eliminate those “while still retaining some positives.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Organizers say a campaign to encourage Midwestern millennials to move to the Badger State will continue despite a lack of funding from this year’s state budget. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers declined to grant the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.’s request for $10 million over the next two years. The campaign that began in early 2018 was the brainchild of Evers’ Republican predecessor, Scott Walker. Wisconsin Public Radio reports WEDC officials say the organization has identified $4 million within its budget to fund the program this year and expects to do the same in 2020-21. Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, says he is focused on developing infrastructure and communities to attract and retain a talented workforce. The campaign aims to attract workers ages 21 to 35 in science, technology, health care and financial services.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has announced plans to honor the Black 14 after they were cut from the school’s football team for wanting to protest during the civil rights movement. The Casper Star-Tribune reports 14 student-athletes were dismissed for wanting to wear black armbands during a 1969 game against BYU in protest of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ then-policy barring black men from the priesthood. Athletic officials say nine of the living 11 members are expected back this week for the scheduled tribute. Officials say the weeklong commemoration includes a plaque presentation, football halftime recognition and a free public panel discussion. It could be the largest known contingent of the Black 14 on campus since they were dismissed 50 years ago.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/12/turtle-power-ditching-dixie-phd-age-news-around-states/49365831/", "title": "Turtle power, ditching Dixie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabamians can now get limited quantities of beer, wine and spirits delivered to their homes after the first companies have gotten licensed. Lawmakers this year approved separate bills to allow alcohol deliveries from retailers to a person’s home and to allow wineries to ship directly to consumers in the state. Several companies have gotten licensed to deliver the alcoholic beverages or to ship wine, according to the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The ABC Licensing Division has several other pending applications for both alcohol delivery and wine shipment, spokesman Daniel Dye wrote in an email. As of Monday, four companies have so far been licensed to deliver alcoholic beverages: Shipt, Dippi, Pick Up My Things and Deerfoot Spirits. Five companies have gotten licensed to ship wine directly to consumers in Alabama: Penrose Hill Winery, James Cole Winery, Winecub, Truth Teller and Robert Young. Alcohol delivery may not yet be available everywhere as companies ramp up operations. Shipt announced last week that it is doing same-day delivery of beer and wine from Target. The company said it is working to expand delivery from additional retailers.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest airport saw a big jump in summer passengers compared to the 2020 season, when the pandemic kept many people at home. More than 877,000 passengers traveled through the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport between May and September this year compared to the same time last year, Anchorage television station KTUU reports. “The terminal was very busy this summer, so we knew it was going to be a good summer,” said Jim Szczesniak, the airport manager. Airport officials said those passengers injected more than $1 billion into Alaska’s economy. The travel group Visit Anchorage said hotel demand was up 47% over the same time period in 2020. “So we made some really encouraging gains, but we’re not back to where we were pre-pandemic,” Visit Anchorage Community Engagement Director Jack Bonney said. Both are cautiously optimistic for 2022. “I think as long as we stay on a positive course, we have a lot of really encouraging indicators for next year, but so much of this is tied up in national and global developments around the pandemic,” Bonney said. Szczesniak said he is hopeful the increase in passenger numbers will continue to climb with expanded cruises and international travel expected next year.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A conservation group says an additional 1,850 acres of a cattle ranch that is part of an important wildlife corridor in western Cochise County are now protected as open space. With the additional acreage, a total of 3,800 acres of the Rain Valley Ranch are now protected through conservation easements, the Arizona Land and Water Trust announced Wednesday. The ranch along State Route 82 east of Sonoita includes part of a wildlife corridor that links the Whetstone, Mustang, and Huachuca mountains. “With large properties in the Sonoita/Elgin area continuing to be purchased for single-family homes or ‘ranchettes,’ the threat of development increases for locations like Rain Valley Ranch, making its conservation critical,” the trust said in a statement. The additional protected landscape also benefits nearby Fort Huachuca by ensuring that potential electromagnetic interference with military training activities associated with the Army base remains low, the trust said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A man who died in prison more than two decades ago is now being investigated as a person of interest in the disappearance of a girl who went missing in 1995, according to the FBI. The agency is asking the public for more information about Billy Jack Lincks, 75, who died in prison in 2000 and had been arrested for attempting to abduct a girl months after 6-year-old Morgan Nick went missing. Lincks was serving a sentence for a 1996 conviction for sexual indecency with a child at the time of his death. “Today, law enforcement may be closer than ever to identifying” Nick’s abductor, the FBI said in a news release. FBI spokesman Connor Hagan said this is the first time the bureau has publicly identified someone as a person of interest in Morgan’s disappearance. Arkansas’ missing child-alert system is named for Morgan. Hagan declined to say if investigators have any evidence connecting him to Nicks’ disappearance. Lincks was raised in Crawford County and returned to Van Buren in the 1970s after serving in the Army during World War II and working at Braniff Airlines in Dallas from 1962 to 1974, the FBI said. Lincks attempted to abduct a young girl in Van Buren at a location 8 miles from the baseball field where Morgan was taken, the FBI said, asking anyone with any information about Lincks to contact 1-800-CALL-FBI.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state has begun positioning equipment and locking in contracts with temporary health care workers in preparation for another possible winter surge of coronavirus cases, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. The most populous state in the country still is doing comparatively well with the rest of the U.S. in terms of cases and hospitalizations. But Newsom warned Californians should prepare for another harsh pandemic winter even though the state is among the nation’s leaders on COVID-19 shots, with about 74% of eligible people having received at least one dose of a vaccine. While statewide hospitalizations have fallen by about half since a summer peak at the end of August, they have started creeping up in some areas, particularly the Central Valley and portions of Southern California including Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. “We’ve seen some signs that suggest concerns,” Newsom said. California earlier this fall had the nation’s lowest case rate but is now 16th, he said, while the positivity rate for those tested for the virus is 2.3% after falling below 1% in June. Beyond the upward trend in certain parts of the state, state health officials said they are generally apprehensive because colder weather will keep people inside. There will be more holiday mingling as immunity acquired months ago begins to wane without booster shots.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An appeals court panel on Wednesday reinstated a lawsuit filed by Republican lawmakers and a Colorado gun rights group challenging a “red flag” law that allows courts to order firearms taken away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others. The lawsuit, filed in 2019, argues that majority Democrats in the state House denied Republican lawmakers their constitutional right to have the red flag legislation be read in its entirety during debate. The bill was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis and took effect in 2020. When one GOP lawmaker requested a reading, multiple clerks read sections of the bill simultaneously, the plaintiffs said. A second representative’s request that the bill be read was denied, they said. Democrats countered that the bill was being read on the floor at the subsequent request of a Republican lawmaker until he withdrew that request. Colorado Politics reports that a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned a Denver district court judge’s ruling that the judiciary should not intrude on the prerogatives of the Legislature or other branches of government. The panel cited a Supreme Court ruling in an unrelated case that the courts can consider whether the Legislature has complied with the constitutional mandate for the reading of bills.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Mayor Justin Elicker appointed Renee Dominguez as the city’s police chief Wednesday, which would make her the first woman to permanently lead the force. Dominguez has served as acting chief since March, after the retirement of Otoniel Reyes. Her appointment must be approved by the city’s Board of Alders. City and state officials believe Dominguez also would be the first female permanent police chief in any of the state’s largest cities. Several women have led police departments in smaller cities and towns in Connecticut. In the state’s largest city, Bridgeport, Rebeca Garcia is currently the acting police chief. “I am very excited,” Dominguez said at a news conference Wednesday. “My entire adult life has been dedicated to serving the community.” Dominguez became a police officer in Newtown in 2000 and moved to the New Haven police force in 2002. She is married with two daughters, ages 3 and 6. “To be the chief and have little girls is a challenge,” she said. “But what better role model than your mother. You can do whatever you want, and you can be whoever you want to be.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Mourners shared laughter, memories and tears Wednesday as they paid their last respects to former Gov. Ruth Ann Minner. Minner, a sharecropper’s daughter, high school dropout and widow, was the only woman to serve as Delaware’s governor, holding office from 2001 to 2009. She died Thursday at the age of 86. Friends, family and fellow politicians, including President Joe Biden, paid tribute to her during a funeral at Milford Church of the Nazarene. They recalled her as a woman who was driven by steely determination but never forgot her humble upbringing and maintained a sense of empathy for fellow citizens. “Each time she climbed up the political ladder, she always stayed grounded in the lives of everyday people,” said Biden, who represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for decades. During her decades of public service as a state lawmaker, lieutenant governor and governor, Minner served as a mentor and role model for many of those who attended her funeral. “Like many of you in this church, I would not be here today as your governor were it not for Ruth Ann Minner. It’s just that simple,” said Gov. John Carney, who served two terms as Minner’s lieutenant governor. “She set the standard for all of us.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s government has struck a deal with the U.S. Marshals Service to improve the situation at the city’s main jail after it came under criticism and the Justice Department announced that 400 federal prisoners would be transferred out because of substandard conditions. Conditions at the jail had long been a point of criticism for local activists. The issue took on a national political dimension in recent months because many defendants from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection were being held there. Wednesday’s announcement said the city Department of Corrections and the federal Marshals Service “will collaboratively assess conditions at the (Central Detention Facility) and develop a plan to address concerns.” Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a statement that she welcomed the attention and resources to “address any deficiencies” at D.C. facilities. “We all agree: everyone who is in our jail or under our supervised care should be treated humanely and have safe conditions,” Bowser said. Supporters of several Jan. 6 defendants filed suit, alleging the defendants’ civil rights were being abused at the jail. One of those cases led to a surprise Marshals Service inspection last month, which found unsanitary and abusive conditions, according to a damning report by Lamont J. Ruffin, the acting marshal for U.S. District Court in Washington.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Biologists were taken by surprise by a record number of leatherback turtle nests found along some South Florida beaches this year. The 79 nests laid by endangered turtles along beaches in Broward County in the 2021 season is nearly double the previous record, the South Florida SunSentinel reports. The previous record was 46 in 2012, and the record low for leatherback nests was 12 in 2017. “It’s difficult to say why Broward County saw such an increase in leatherback nesting this season,” Stephanie Kedzuf, a biologist for Broward County who specializes in sea turtles, told the newspaper. Kedzuf said she will be curious to see whether other areas in the state saw a similar increase. Leatherbacks, named for their tough, rubbery skin, typically crawl onto beaches at night and dig holes to deposit their eggs in the sand. They are among the largest of sea turtles. The nesting season runs from March 1 to Oct. 31. During that time, coastal buildings must shield or lower their lights to prevent them from disturbing the hatchlings. When the turtles hatch, they race toward the sea to avoid crabs, birds and other predators. The lights can draw them inland, where they could be run over or trapped in storm drains. The leatherback population has declined by 40% worldwide, the National Marine Fisheries Service said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gun maker Remington Firearms will move its headquarters from the Empire State to the Peach State. The company announced Monday that it would invest $100 million in the factory and research operation in LaGrange, southwest of Atlanta, hiring 856 people over five years. It wasn’t clear what effect the transfer would have on Remington’s operations in New York and Tennessee. The company owns the parts of the former Remington Outdoor Co. that make rifles, shotguns and some handguns after the former parent auctioned its assets in pieces last year in a bankruptcy proceeding. Remington, the country’s oldest gun maker, began making flintlock rifles in 1816. It swelled into a firearms conglomerate but faced slumping sales, complaints about quality, and legal pressure over the Sandy Hook school massacre. The current company no longer makes the Bushmaster AR-15 rifles used to kill 20 first graders and six educators in the shooting in Connecticut in 2012. “We are very excited to come to Georgia, a state that not only welcomes business but enthusiastically supports and welcomes companies in the firearms industry,” Remington CEO Ken D’Arcy said in a statement. Gov. Brian Kemp famously pointed a shotgun at another person in a campaign commercial when the Republican was seeking his current office in 2018.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Nearly 2,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers in the state plan to strike later this month over wages and staffing concerns. UNITE HERE Local 5 said the strike due to begin Nov. 22 would affect 20 facilities across Hawaii. Thousands of Kaiser health care workers in California have already said they will strike starting Monday. Local 5 spokesperson Bryant de Venecia said Wednesday that negotiations were continuing. Kaiser and the Alliance of Health Care Unions began national bargaining in April. Local 5 has been negotiating some Hawaii-specific issues with Kaiser as well. Local 5 said in a news release that Kaiser’s latest proposal was for an “insulting” 2% wage increase contingent on the union’s agreement to a two-tier wage system under which new hires would receive lower pay. The union said Kaiser also failed to address concerns about short staffing, while workers report being stressed and overworked during the coronavirus pandemic. Arlene Peasnall, Kaiser’s senior vice president of human resources, said in a statement that Hawaii union-represented employees earn about 26% above the average market wage. She said Kaiser offered up to 4% yearly pay raises – 2% pay increases plus a 2% cash payout each year of a four-year contract. “The challenge we are trying to address in partnership with our unions is the increasingly unaffordable cost of healthcare. … Wages and benefits account for half of Kaiser Permanente’s operational costs,” she said, Hawaii News Now reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A northern Idaho mayor has announced he’s running for governor. Sandpoint Mayor Shelby Rognstad said Monday in Lewiston that he’s running as a Democrat to defeat first-term Republican Gov. Brad Little. The 47-year-old Rognstad said he’s running to break the lock Republicans have had on the state for 30 years. “For the better part of a generation, Idaho has effectively been a one-party state,” Rongstad said, the Lewiston Tribune reports. “There are no checks and balances, no compromise, no accountability. This is dangerous. The most extreme voices now go unopposed. Commonsense leadership has been replaced by authoritarianism and culture wars.” Democrats have not held the governor’s office since 1995 or statewide elected office since 2007. Only 12 of the 70 House members and seven of 35 senators are Democrats. The Idaho secretary of state’s website lists Rognstad as the second Democrat to join the race, after Melissa Sue Robinson, 70, a transgender woman who owned a construction company before shifting to a career in telecommunications. She lists adequately funding education as a top goal. The race also includes eight Republicans. Little hasn’t yet announced his reelection plans but is expected to run and has been fundraising. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin over Little.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A police oversight agency recommended suspension and in some cases potential termination for more than half a dozen officers following a botched 2019 raid on the home of a Black woman who wasn’t allowed to put on clothes before being handcuffed, according to a report released Wednesday. Earlier this year, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigated the wrongful raid on social worker Anjanette Young’s home, noted nearly 100 allegations of misconduct by about a dozen officers. The agency’s report recommended between one day and one year of suspension for multiple officers and “up to and including separation” from the department for some officers. Police Superintendent David Brown has already moved to terminate one sergeant. The raid “reveals problems far more pervasive than any individual incident of officer misconduct,” the report said. It also noted “other concerns, including lack of adequate training and supervision surrounding the Department’s use of search warrants and the disproportionate impact of police actions on people of color.” The botched raid, first reported by WBBM-TV, and the city’s handling of it prompted anger from clergy, lawmakers and civil rights activists who decried it as racist and an affront to a Black woman’s dignity.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Public schools should treat the Black Lives Matter movement as a political group, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said Thursday, potentially limiting the ability of schools and teachers to promote the BLM message in classrooms. “Black Lives Matter is unequivocally a political organization,” Rokita said in a news release Thursday morning. “Promoting or displaying some politically based materials while prohibiting the promotion or display of others could create a liability for schools and could violate the First Amendment.” Rokita issued an advisory opinion on how schools should treat BLM at the request of two state lawmakers amid concerns about the politicization of students’ education and what Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, called the “controversial ideology” of BLM. Rokita’s opinion comes after months of debate around the country about how and what schools should and should not be teaching, particularly with regard to race and racism in America’s history. Conservative groups have decried the teaching of critical race theory in the nation’s K-12 schools, which do not teach the academic framework used by legal scholars to examine the intersection of race and law in America. Still, activists and parents have latched onto the term.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A former Iowa State Patrol officer with a history of excessive force allegations has been indicted on a federal charge over a 2017 traffic stop in which dashcam video captured him roughing up a motorcyclist. A federal grand jury charged Robert James Smith last week with violating the motorcyclist’s civil rights by using unreasonable force during the stop near West Liberty, roughly 15 miles southeast of Iowa City. The indictment notes that the victim suffered “bodily injury” during the encounter, which means the charge could carry a maximum of 10 years in prison. Smith is set to make his initial appearance Tuesday at the federal courthouse in Cedar Rapids. Dashcam video shows Smith pulling over Bryce Yakish for speeding. The routine stop escalated immediately when Smith ran from his car with his gun drawn and pointed at Yakish, then 20 years old. Smith used his left hand to strike the face shield of Yakish’s helmet, knocking him backward onto his motorcycle and to the ground. Smith briefly put his knee on Yakish’s neck while handcuffing him. Yakish can be repeatedly heard in the video complaining of neck pain. Smith falsely accused Yakish of trying to flee and charged him with eluding law enforcement, even though he stopped immediately after Smith activated his lights and siren. That charge was dropped after a prosecutor reviewed the video and concluded it was baseless. Yakish lost his license because of the arrest, his motorcycle was impounded, and he spent the night in jail.\n\nKansas\n\nPeck: A 19-year-old is getting ready to graduate from Washburn University’s School of Law in Topeka. Braxton Moral’s parents have long known he was gifted. He skipped fourth grade and took his first undergraduate class at Harvard University while still in sixth grade. As he got older, he spent his summers at Cambridge. But when the school year started, he switched to online classes so he wouldn’t miss out on experiences like prom and homecoming at Ulysses High School. “He just wants to be like everybody else,” said his mother, Julie Moral. “He’s a blessing from God.” At Harvard, Braxton developed a love for government and realized he wanted to go to law school. But what should have taken three years he completed in two and a half. Next month, Braxton Moral will receive his juris doctor degree. In February, he will take the bar exam. “When I started out, it was more about just something fun to do,” Moral said. “And then you start off, you’re like, ‘Well, I just kind of want to get better now.’ So once you get a little bit of experience, it transfers from just fine to an actual goal.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge has approved a request from Kentucky regulators to force West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice to pay $2.9 million in fines for cleanup violations at some eastern Kentucky coal mines. The Tuesday order from Franklin County Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate requires that the Justice companies finish reclamation work at the mines, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. The order also allows the state to take posted bonds to cover the work. Kentucky officials called the violations at the Justice-owned mines “among the most egregious we have seen in nearly a decade” when the original agreement with Justice was struck back in 2014. Most of the sites are surface mines. The work includes cleaning out ponds, stabilizing land, improving drainage and reshaping the land to its original, pre-mining contours. Under the agreement with Kentucky, the West Virginia governor and his son, Jay Justice, are personally, jointly liable for the $2.9 million penalty. Jay Justice runs the company’s coal, timber and agriculture businesses. The Justices have argued that they have not been able to meet the deadlines because of the economic downturn and safety concerns caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State government agencies lost more than 17% of their civil service employees in the last financial year. Byron Decoteau, director of Louisiana’s State Civil Service, said the turnover rate was nearly 2 percentage points higher in the 2020-21 budget year that ended June 30 than in the previous year. More than 6,000 civil service workers left state government in the latest year, including 21% who retired. Other employees were laid off, died, moved, left to go to school, got private-sector jobs or had other personal reasons, according to the report Decoteau presented to the commission that oversees the state workers who have civil service protection, called classified employees. The highest turnover rates were among prison guards at adult and youth prison facilities, the report showed – a consistent problem year after year. Decoteau noted that 10% of classified state employees currently are eligible to retire across agencies, while nearly 15% will be eligible to retire within five years. The data doesn’t cover political appointees across agencies or workers who transferred to other state government jobs.\n\nMaine\n\nSaco: State park campers set another record this year. Maine is home to 48 state parks and historic sites, and attendance and camping at the parks have soared during the coronavirus pandemic. Preliminary state figures showed Maine state campground attendance set a record for the second straight year, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state’s 12 state park campgrounds experienced an 8% increase in visitors from 2019 to 2020, when campers set a record of more than 270,000. This year, the number grew to about 315,000. The state parks were heavily used before the pandemic, and the onset of the pandemic led to even more use as residents and visitors sought more outdoor forms of recreation. This year’s attendance was especially high even though July, in the heart of camping season, was full of rain. State officials said they expected 2022 to be another big year for the campgrounds.\n\nMaryland\n\nManchester: Five bald eagles were found acting strangely and seemingly sick in northern Maryland, prompting an investigation by state wildlife officials. William Fauntleroy found the birds Sunday in the Manchester area of Carroll County near the Pennsylvania border, The Washington Post reports. He said he saw an eagle near his mailbox that was acting weirdly and appeared to be unable to fly. The group of birds was feeding on a deer carcass, according to Fauntleroy. One died after flying into a power line. “I saw some were flying poorly,” Fauntleroy told the newspaper. “One seemed like it couldn’t get off the ground and couldn’t fly. It was acting like it was drunk.” Wildlife rescuers took the four other eagles to the Phoenix Wildlife Center in Baltimore County. Maryland Natural Resources Police spokesperson Lauren Moses said her department is “actively investigating” to figure out what happened to the birds, a federally protected species. The deer carcass the eagles ate was buried so no other wildlife would feed on it, according to Moses. She told the Post that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials were expected to take samples from the remains for analysis. “Was it poison? Was it an algae bloom? Was it something else?” the wildlife center said in a Facebook post Wednesday. “We don’t have answers yet.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Marine researchers in New England said Tuesday that they have collected data from tags that were surgically implanted in sea turtles for the first time. Scientists with the New England Aquarium who performed the work said it could lead to improvements in the way researchers monitor threatened species of turtles. The loggerheads were rehabilitated at the Boston-based aquarium’s turtle hospital and released earlier this year with the acoustic tags implanted in their bodies. Acoustic receivers in Nantucket Sound off Massachusetts showed multiple detections earlier this month, the researchers said. Scientists have long used turtle tagging to monitor the animals, but the tags have previously been placed on their shells using an epoxy. Kara Dodge, a research scientist with the aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, said the new tagging method will make it easier to monitor injured turtles that are released back into the wild after rehab. The tags allow scientists to “assess rehabilitated turtles’ survivorship over time and resumption of normal behaviors in the wild,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Wednesday approved a $626 million deal to settle lawsuits filed by Flint residents who found their tap water contaminated by lead following disastrous decisions to switch the city’s water source and a failure to swiftly acknowledge the problem. Most of the money – $600 million – is coming from the state of Michigan, which was accused of repeatedly overlooking the risks of using the Flint River without properly treating the water. “The settlement reached here is a remarkable achievement for many reasons, not the least of which is that it sets forth a comprehensive compensation program and timeline that is consistent for every qualifying participant,” U.S. District Judge Judith Levy said in a 178-page opinion. Attorneys are seeking as much as $200 million in legal fees from the overall settlement. Levy left that issue for another day. The deal makes money available to Flint children who were exposed to the water, adults who can show an injury, certain business owners and anyone who paid water bills. About 80% of what’s left after legal fees is earmarked for children. “This is a historic and momentous day for the residents of Flint, who will finally begin to see justice served,” said Ted Leopold, one of the lead attorneys in the litigation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 hospitalizations have reached their highest level of the year in the state, and hospital capacity continues to tighten amid an alarming surge in cases, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Wednesday. The Minnesota Department of Health on Wednesday reported 5,277 new coronavirus cases and 43 new deaths, raising the state’s pandemic totals to 831,669 confirmed cases and 8,925 deaths. Minnesota hospitals were caring for 1,159 COVID-19 patients, including 257 in intensive care units. Malcolm called the new case and death numbers “extraordinarily high and concerning” and said that “right now we find ourselves in a really truly alarming spike” in new cases. “Every day now we’re seeing dozens of Minnesotans dying from an illness that they didn’t have to get, and that is beyond heartbreaking for all of us doing this work,” Malcolm said. “The tragedy of this current spike in cases is that more than ever, we have the tools and the knowledge to minimize the impact of this virus.” Those tools include vaccinations, masking in public and staying home when sick, she said. Most Minnesotans are vaccinated, but too many still aren’t, she said. And Kris Ehresmann, the department’s infectious disease director, said the problem of “waning immunity,” which appears to show up around six months after vaccination, seems to be a factor in the rise of breakthrough cases.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has finished repairing section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, and the road reopened Wednesday. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged, one after another, into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital Sept. 11. The Mississippi Department of Transportation awarded a $1.8 million repair contract in October. A construction company met the department’s goal of getting the highway back open safely and quickly, southern district Transportation Commissioner Tom King said in a news release Wednesday. “I know how important Highway 26 is for the region, and I appreciate all the work that went into getting it open ahead of schedule,” King said. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislators in September that the area had already received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than one day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed. King said work will continue until early 2022 as crews repave routes that had been used as detours amid the closure.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Security camera footage, shell casings, and a small but distinctive tattoo played pivotal roles in the arrest of a man suspected in at least six killings over the past two months in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s office on Tuesday charged Perez Deshay Reed in the shooting deaths of two people in the city in September. Reed was charged Saturday in two other fatal shootings in September in St. Louis County. He is also suspected of killing two people in Kansas City, Kansas, and the FBI has labeled him a suspected serial killer. Reed, who turned 26 on Wednesday, remained jailed on $2 million bond Tuesday. Surveillance video in Kansas helped lead to Reed’s arrest. Images captured by the cameras showed the distinctive crescent moon-shaped tattoo on Reed’s forehead. Another key factor was evidence left behind at each of the St. Louis-area shootings. “The commonality among them were handgun casings,” said Rich Quinn, special agent in charge of the FBI office in St. Louis. “We knew they came from the same handgun.” Reed is charged in the St. Louis County killings of 16-year-old Marnay Haynes on Sept. 13 and 40-year-old Lester Robinson on Sept. 26. In the city of St. Louis, he is suspected in the killings of 49-year-old Pamela Abercrombie on Sept. 16 and a 24-year-old man, Carey Ross, on Sept. 19. All four victims were shot in the head.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Tribes and conservation groups sued state environmental regulators Wednesday after Gov. Greg Gianforte’s administration dropped a legal claim against a mining executive over decades of pollution from several mines. The lawsuit was filed in state district court in Lewis and Clark County by attorneys for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, the Montana Environmental Information Center and other groups. Under Gianforte, the Department of Environmental Quality in July quit a legal action that sought to block Idaho-based Hecla Mining Co. and its president, Phillips Baker Jr., from involvement in two proposed silver and copper mines. Baker was an executive with Pegasus Gold, which went bankrupt in 1998, leaving state and federal agencies with more than $50 million in cleanup costs at several mines, including the Zortman and Landusky mines near the Fort Belknap reservation. A state “bad actor” law enacted in the wake of the Pegasus bankruptcy punishes companies and their executives who don’t clean up mining pollution. Under the law, companies and their senior leaders can’t receive new mining permits until they’ve reimbursed the state for past cleanup costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A coalition that includes labor unions and civil rights groups has launched a website and social media pages in its drive to get a measure to raise Nebraska’s minimum wage to $15 an hour on the ballot next year. Raise the Wage Nebraska says it wants to highlight the stories of the 195,000 Nebraska residents who’d see higher pay, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The coalition needs to collect 87,000 signatures on petitions by July 2022 to get its proposal on the ballot in November 2022. The measure would increase the minimum wage by $1.50 annually until it reached $15 in 2026. After that, there’d be an annual cost-of-living increase. Nebraska voters widely supported raising the minimum wage in 2014. Nearly 60% backed an initiative that increased it from $7.25 an hour to its current $9 an hour. Business groups oppose the measure, saying it could hurt small-business owners who already are having difficulty filling jobs as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts also is opposed. But supporters said raising the wage will help people living in poverty and working multiple jobs to make ends meet.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Legislature is finally set to start redrawing the state’s political maps. Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Thursday that lawmakers would convene for a long-delayed special session focused on redistricting at 1 p.m. Friday. Sisolak said in a statement that he was looking forward to “an efficient and productive session” that will fulfill the Silver State’s constitutional duty to revise every federal, state and local voting district after each census. The redistricting process is controlled by whichever political party holds the Legislature, often resulting in districts that favor one party over the other, a process known as gerrymandering. Bitter battles over this practice happen often in Carson City, where a court-appointed panel had to finish drawing boundaries on which politicians couldn’t agree in 2011. The undertaking was almost equally toxic in 2001, when there were also legal challenges, then a special session called after remapping efforts repeatedly stalled in a split partisan Legislature. Draft maps debuted Tuesday point to the possibility of a more harmonious redistricting session in 2021, though Republicans are likely to take issue with proposed changes that could make the state’s two battleground congressional districts more Democratic-leaning over the next decade.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: After rejecting millions of dollars to help increase the state’s vaccination rate, the Executive Council on Wednesday reversed course and approved $22 million for the effort, along with a nonbinding resolution that condemns vaccine mandates. Last month, the Republican-led council, a five-member panel that approves state contracts, rejected $27 million in federal vaccination funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over concerns that language in the grants would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. The language the Republicans opposed has appeared in other contracts they approved, and both Republican Gov. Chris Sununu and Attorney General John Formella said it does not in any way impede the state’s sovereignty. Later in October, the council voted to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding to help community health centers and regional public health networks set up school-based and community vaccination clinics. With the approval of Wednesday’s funds, that money will now be repurposed. “We are moving full steam ahead,” Sununu said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Garden State businesses owned by people of color were more likely to lose money during the early months of the pandemic and less likely have access to the credit they needed to make up for it, according to a study released Wednesday. The report showed Black- and Latino-owned business were at a particular disadvantage when it came to the government’s main emergency finance plan, the Paycheck Protection Program, forcing them to rely on their own savings to survive. “It was a bit of a worry; it was a bit of a panic attack,” said Tashianna Gayle, 34, owner of Hair Haven, a salon in Asbury Park. She was told she didn’t qualify for a PPP loan because she had only been open for a month before the pandemic hit. The report by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority was designed to look at how racial disparities during the pandemic’s economic crisis played out among small businesses in the state. “It’s discouraging and, sadly, not surprising that the pandemic hit Black- and Latino- owned businesses especially hard,” said Tim Sullivan, the New Jersey EDA’s chief executive officer. The agency rolled out a low-interest micro-loan program Wednesday that aims to address the disparity.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Two of the state’s largest hospitals announced Thursday that they would be focusing on patients who need care the most, meaning procedures that aren’t medically necessary will likely have to be delayed. While most patients are not dealing with coronavirus infections, officials at Presbyterian Healthcare Services and University of New Mexico Health say the ability to grow the capacity that was built over the past year due to the pandemic is now limited by space and the availability of health care workers. The two hospitals announced they were activating crisis standards of care, noting that it’s not really a shift in policy but rather a continuation of how they have been managing the crush of patients since last winter. “It’s really important to recognize we are not deallocating care. That is not part of this. We are not triaging and denying care,” said Dr. Jason Mitchell, Presbyterian’s chief medical officer. “At this point we are trying to make sure that every patient has care in a bed across our state and even in surrounding states.” He saud the decision will not be to take a patient off a ventilator, for example, but rather to find other hospitals within New Mexico or in neighboring states that can take patients or directing patients with less severe issues to urgent care clinics or other providers.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Six state correctional facilities will close next March in a cost-saving move amid declining inmate populations, officials announced Monday. More than 1,700 people work at the six upstate New York facilities, which house more than 1,400 inmates. The inmates will be sent to other locations, and no layoffs are expected from the closures, which are projected to save $142 million, according to the release from the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. The corrections agency said it will work with unions to provide staffers with transfer opportunities to other facilities or to other state agencies. The facilities set for closure March 10 are Ogdensburg Correctional Facility, Moriah Shock Incarceration Correctional Facility, Willard Drug Treatment Campus, Southport Correctional Facility, Downstate Correctional Facility and Rochester Correctional Facility. The governor was authorized by the Legislature this year to close state prisons amid a long-term drop in inmates. There are currently 31,469 inmates in state correctional facilities, down from a systemwide high of 72,773 in 1999. The agency said officials looked at multiple factors before making the decision, including physical infrastructure, program offerings, facility security level, proximity to other facilities and health services.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A trial judge on Wednesday ordered the state to pay out $1.75 billion to help narrow public education inequities, angering Republicans who said the directive usurps lawmakers’ constitutional authority over state coffers. Superior Court Judge David Lee, who is charged with overseeing corrective responses related to school funding litigation that began over a quarter-century ago, said the legislative and executive branches have been afforded every courtesy over the years to act decisively. But “this court’s deference is at an end at this point,” he said. The judge’s action likely will set up a constitutional showdown among the three government branches. Lee said his order wouldn’t take effect for 30 days, giving GOP leaders at the Legislature or others time for a legal challenge, which is likely. Republicans say that only the General Assembly can appropriate funds in state accounts and that Lee is violating the state constitution if he acts contrary to that. The state Supreme Court ruled in 2004 in the Leandro lawsuit – named after an early student plaintiff – that while North Carolina’s children have a fundamental right to the “opportunity to receive a sound basic education” under the constitution, the state had not lived up to that mandate.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A storm system that is expected to bring snow to the state late this week could help improve persistent long-term drought conditions. Forecasters are expecting 2 inches to 4 inches of snow in the eastern half of the state, with up to 6 inches in the northeastern corner of North Dakota. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph are expected along with the snow, potentially making travel difficult, according to forecasters. Drought conditions that brought hardships for ranchers and farmers this summer have made marked improvement. In eastern North Dakota in recent weeks, much of the region is no longer listed in any of the four drought categories, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Much of the central and west regions remain in severe or extreme drought, but even those areas have improved dramatically from last summer. There is no change in this week’s U.S. Drought Monitor map, which is updated every Thursday. “In the Dakotas, where long-term drought is still ongoing, livestock water quality and (mule deer) fawn production were both reported to be suffering as a result of the drought,” wrote National Drought Mitigation Center Climatologist Curtis Riganti. Harvest is mostly wrapped up in North Dakota, though about one-fifth of the corn crop and one-third of the sunflowers remain in fields.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A polar bear who was a fixture at the Toledo Zoo for more than two decades has died due to kidney disease. Michael Frushour, the zoo’s curator of mammals, told The Toledo Blade that the bear named Marty was euthanized Nov. 4, less than a month shy of his 25th birthday, Marty had been diagnosed a couple of years ago with what Frushour described as “age-related kidney disease.” Zoo officials had recently noticed that Marty wasn’t eating as much as usual and had become less active. An examination determined his kidneys were functioning very poorly, so they decided to have him euthanized. Marty was born in late 1996 and came to the Toledo Zoo from Chicago in 1999. In 2007, he went to the Pittsburgh Zoo for a year before he returned to Toledo. Marty and the Toledo Zoo’s female polar bear, Crystal, had several cubs together, and zoo officials believe Crystal – who turns 23 this week – may be pregnant again. The zoo hopes to replace Marty with another male polar bear, though it’s not yet clear when that might happen.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday directed the State Department of Health to stop issuing birth certificates listing a nonbinary option instead of designating a gender, despite a settlement agreement in a civil case in which the agency agreed to do so. The first-term Republican said in his order that his administration never reviewed or approved the settlement agreement, which requires the Oklahoma State Department of Health to amend birth certificates in a manner not permitted under Oklahoma law. The order directs the department to cease amending birth certificates in any way not specifically authorized under state law and to remove from its website any reference to amending birth certificates for nonbinary people. People who are nonbinary do not identify with traditional male or female gender assignments. Stitt also directed the Legislature to pass legislation when it returns next year to specifically prohibit the issuance of birth certificates with nonbinary designations. Freedom Oklahoma, which advocates for nonbinary and LGBTQ people, said in a statement that while the state is facing scrutiny over how it carries out executions, “it felt easy for the governor to try and refocus media narratives and partisan pressure by attacking some of the most marginalized and historically excluded residents of our state.” Nichole McAfee, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, said the governor does not have the authority to overturn an agreement entered into in a court of law.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A school board that recently banned teachers from displaying symbols including those supporting gay pride and Black Lives Matter has abruptly fired the superintendent, deeply upsetting members who opposed the move. The escalating disputes in the Newberg School Board come as schools nationwide have become battlegrounds, with arguments over vaccine and mask mandates, how racism is addressed in teaching, instruction related to sexuality and gender-neutral bathrooms. After Superintendent Joe Morelock was fired in a Zoom meeting late Tuesday night, board member Brandy Penner said Wednesday she believes the conservative board members fired Morelock because he didn’t aggressively implement their ban on controversial symbols, adding that the policy didn’t define what symbols would be unacceptable. Rebecca Piros – one of three who opposed his firing – told Morelock she was sorry. Morelock replied: “Just remember that from the darkest dark comes the brightest light, so everything will work out eventually.” Piros broke down in tears when she heard those words. On Wednesday, some residents of Newberg, a town of 23,000 about 25 miles southwest of Portland, erected signs quoting Morelock’s reply to Piros. Newberg Equity in Education, a group composed mostly of parents who oppose the school board’s recent rightward tilt, planned a demonstration Thursday at the school district office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Justice was not blind when a lawyer dropped his pants after repeatedly setting off a metal detector at a courthouse. Jeffrey Pollock, 59, was trying to pass through security outside family court Wednesday, but the machine kept sounding an alarm, authorities said. The lawyer told guards his suspenders were causing the alerts, and he could not remove them. The guards asked him to keep trying until the alerts stopped. “After a heated discussion with the guards, Pollock unhooked his suspenders, dropped his drawers, took them off, and placed them in the bin to go through the metal detector,” the Allegheny Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. Authorities said Pollock stood in his shirt and underwear. He was charged with disorderly conduct. “I used poor judgment,” Pollock told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “I was trying to make a point.” The sheriff’s office noted “that visible underwear is not part of the dress code.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: An 89-year-old has achieved a goal he spent two decades working toward and nearly a lifetime thinking about: earning his Ph.D. and becoming a physicist. Manfred Steiner recently defended his dissertation successfully at Brown University. Steiner said he cherishes this degree because it’s what he always wanted – and because he overcame health problems that could have derailed his studies. “But I made it, and this was the most gratifying point in my life, to finish it,” he said Wednesday at his home in East Providence. As a teenager in Vienna, Steiner was inspired to become a physicist after reading about Albert Einstein and Max Planck. He admired the precision of physics. But after World War II, his mother and uncle advised him that studying medicine would be a better choice in turbulent times. He earned his medical degree from the University of Vienna in 1955 and moved just a few weeks later to the United States, where he had a successful career studying blood and blood disorders. Steiner studied hematology at Tufts University and biochemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before becoming a hematologist at Brown University. He became a full professor and led the hematology section of the medical school at Brown from 1985 to 1994.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The amount of money in state bank accounts continues to grow thanks to a quick recovery from the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and people spending money much faster than experts predicted. The latest estimate released Wednesday said South Carolina lawmakers will have nearly $1 billion more to spend this budget year, according to the state Board of Economic Advisers. That boosts the money over which the General Assembly has control to nearly $11 billion and doesn’t count the roughly $3 billion in federal COVID-19 relief money coming to South Carolina. It also doesn’t count about a $1 billion surplus after the state closed the books on the fiscal year that ended June 30. Predictions that economic growth would slow because of supply chain issues, consumers slowing their spending or dwindling federal stimulus money didn’t come true. The 13.2% growth in the 2020-21 fiscal year budget was the largest in at least 40 years, the board said. South Carolina sales tax collections continue to soar, growing by $500 million to $3.8 billion in the past fiscal year. Corporate tax revenues have also risen sharply thanks to retailers benefiting from all that extra money being spent. The state’s economic experts still think the rapid rise in revenue can’t continue.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Only 45% of educators are teaching required standards on Oceti Sakowin Essential Understandings, according to a new survey by the South Dakota Department of Education. OSEUs are basic understandings of Lakota, Dakota and Nakota culture and history. The standards were approved by the Board of Education Standards in 2018, which should make them required for all K-12 students, but DOE officials have said in the past that they were unsure how broadly OSEUs were used and that they weren’t required. Lawmakers have drafted bills to make sure OSEUs were required, but such a bill was shot down in the 2021 session. News of survey results comes months after it was revealed the DOE removed more than a dozen explicit references to the Oceti Sakowin from a draft of social studies standards before they were released to the public. That issue caused state-level protests and outcries from residents and educators. Weeks later, Gov. Kristi Noem ordered the DOE to restart the standards revision process to include more input from stakeholders, including Native Americans. But educators and Indigenous education advocates are still calling on Noem and other top education officials to resign after their mishandling of the social studies standards process.\n\nTennessee\n\nLynchburg: The distillery producing Jack Daniel’s whiskey is teaming with a military support group to help service members and their families get home for the holidays. More than 1,700 service members and relatives will head home through “Operation Ride Home,” organizers said. That’s the most participants in program history. In its 11th year, the program provides financial assistance to active-duty, junior-enlisted military members and their families to travel to loved ones’ homes nationwide. The Jack Daniel Distillery teams with the Armed Services YMCA to offer the assistance. Service members from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard have been assisted with travel to every state. “We are absolutely thrilled they’ll get to reunite with their loved ones this year,” said Chris Fletcher, Jack Daniel’s master distiller. “Providing some financial assistance to see that they make it home is the least we can do.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: An 18-year-old man has been arrested and charged with arson for a fire at a synagogue, officials said. Franklin Barrett Sechriest was held on a $100,000 bond for the Oct. 31 fire at Congregation Beth Israel, KVUE-TV in Austin reports. According to the Austin Fire Department, the fire was a “small exterior fire” that caused no injuries but resulted in an estimated $25,000 damage, including the synagogue’s wooden doors. Arson investigators said broken glass indicated an item might have been thrown at the building, and a flammable liquid accelerated the fire. An arrest affidavit describes surveillance videos from multiple cameras on the property showing a suspect resembling Sechriest driving a black sport utility vehicle registered to a woman living at the same address as Sechriest. The fire at the synagogue came a week after a string of antisemitic incidents, including an antisemitic banner displayed from an overpass on a heavily traveled boulevard. It was not immediately clear if the fire was connected to those incidents.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Southern Utah’s Dixie State University is poised to change a name often associated with the Deep South and slavery after the Legislature approved a new name Wednesday over local backlash. The Republican-controlled Legislature voted to change the name to Utah Tech University after multiple executives from the burgeoning tech sector said the Dixie name is often met with confusion and distaste as the institution grows. GOP Gov. Spencer Cox is expected to sign the bill. The term got new scrutiny following a national outcry against racial injustice after the death of George Floyd. “This process is not about cancel culture. No one is trying to erase the great history of this beloved institution,” said Republican Rep. Kelly Miles, who sponsored the name-change bill. “We as Utahns pride ourselves in our forward thinking … it just makes sense that our students in this great state will be better served by the name Utah Tech University.” A compromise provision will keep the name Dixie on the main campus in St. George, a city near the Arizona border that’s among the fastest-growing in the country.\n\nVermont\n\nLyndon: A federal grant will go toward helping the state to educate more nurses. Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College announced Wednesday that the $240,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce would be used to expand Vermont Technical College’s existing nursing program at Northern Vermont’s University’s Lyndon campus. Vail Hall on the Lyndon campus will be transformed into the Clinical Nursing Education Center, complete with a nursing instruction classroom and skills and simulation lab spaces. “Addressing Vermont’s nursing workforce challenge requires increasing opportunities for Vermonters to pursue careers in nursing,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy said in a statement. Officials say the number of new registered nurses in Vermont declined 69% from 2007 to 2014. It’s estimated that Vermont needs 900 skilled nurses per year. In 2019, 421 completed licensed practical nurse or RN programs.\n\nVirginia\n\nArlington: President Joe Biden saluted the nation’s military veterans as “the spine of America” on Thursday as he marked his first Veterans Day as president in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. “There’s nothing low-risk or low-cost about war for the women and men who fight it,” said Biden, whose administration earlier in the day announced a federal effort to better understand, identify and treat medical conditions suffered by troops deployed to toxic environments. Earlier in the week, members of the Chief Plenty Coups Honor Guard from Pryor, Montana, placed flowers in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and saluted the unknowns. Dozens more Crow Nation representatives, including students from Plenty Coups High School, followed suit Tuesday morning – the first time in 96 years the public and visitors had been allowed to approach the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It’s a privilege typically reserved for the sentinels of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, “The Old Guard,” according to the Arlington Cemetery. The flower ceremony kicked off a two-day centennial commemoration event. The dedication of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier took place Nov. 11, 1921, according to the National Archives.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak Cascades will resume service Nov. 18 on the Point Defiance bypass between Tacoma and Olympia, nearly four years after a deadly derailment there. The first train to use the bypass is scheduled to leave Seattle at 7:22 a.m. and arrive at the new Tacoma Dome station at 8:08 a.m., according to an Amtrak statement. The first northbound train will leave Eugene, Oregon, at 5:30 a.m., stop in Portland and arrive in Tacoma at 10:54 a.m., The Seattle Times reports. Amtrak said eight trains – including Amtrak Cascades and Coast Starlight – will use the bypass daily, with additional trains added as COVID-19 restrictions ease. Additional safety measures and most of the National Transportation Safety Board’s recommendations have been implemented following the 2017 derailment, Amtrak said. The other recommendations are being pursued, the statement said. Key among the improvements is the installment of activated positive train control, which uses GPS technology to stop or slow a train before a collision or derailment occurs. The NTSB first called for widespread use of the crash-preventing technology in 1990, and in 2008 Congress mandated that it be installed on every passenger route and high hazardous material route across the U.S. within seven years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Health care coverage has been stopped for striking maintenance and service workers at a hospital, according to a union. About 1,000 members of the the Service Employees International Union District 1999 went on strike last week at Cabell Huntington Hospital after their contract expired. Union organizing director Sherri McKinney said in a statement that the coverage was cut off without notification to striking employees and union retirees, The Herald-Dispatch reports. Hospital human resources director Molly Frick said in a statement that “union leadership was well aware that a strike would result in the cessation of pay and benefits. Any employee who wishes to return to work will have all benefits restored, including healthcare insurance.” A Cabell County judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday that was sought by the hospital prohibiting the union from certain activities outside the hospital. Frick said the activities include loud noises, such as the use of bullhorns and loud music, that have disturbed hospital patients. The injunction also prohibits strikers from honking horns and encouraging drivers to honk, blocking hospital entrances, interfering with traffic at the hospital, or making threatening statements to anyone trying to enter or leave the hospital’s campus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: People who receive a COVID-19 vaccine at a Saturday clinic at Fiserv Forum will get to have their picture taken with the Milwaukee Bucks’ championship trophy, according to a Milwaukee Health Department news release. The health department and the Bucks are teaming up for a vaccine clinic from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday in the atrium of Fiserv Forum. “Everyone vaccinated at this clinic will have the opportunity to take a photo with the Larry O’Brien Championship Trophy,” a news release said. The focus of the clinic is on children ages 5 to 11, and the clinic’s offerings will include pediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. “Vaccination is the best tool to keep ourselves and our children safe from COVID-19,” Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson said in a news release. “We hope the opportunity to ‘take a shot’ in the home of the 2021 World Champion Milwaukee Bucks will encourage Milwaukee children and families to get vaccinated.” The clinic will also offer first, second and booster doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for eligible individuals, the news release said. Flu shots will be available as well. Those under the age of 18 will need permission from a parent or guardian to receive a vaccine.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A grizzly bear and her four cubs who are already well-known to wildlife watchers got even more attention by taking a nighttime stroll through the city. Security video showed the bears wandering around downtown Jackson on Tuesday night, according to local police. Police and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials shooed the five bears into a less populated area near town, the Jackson Police Department said in a statement Wednesday. Grizzly No. 399, so named for an ear tag she received after being trapped for study, has been familiar to wildlife watchers for years. She’s had a reputation for lingering with her cubs near roadways in Grand Teton National Park, making her arguably the Yellowstone region’s most well-known grizzly. Biologists speculate that hanging around people helps keep away male grizzlies, which are known to kill cubs. Charming as it may seem for a mother bear and four yearling cubs to roam a tourist town, the bears’ behavior has worried wildlife managers. The bears have been raiding garbage, bee apiaries and animal feed in the Jackson area, raising the risk of a dangerous encounter with people. On Saturday, biologists trapped three of the four cubs. They put tracking collars on two in the hope that knowing the bears’ whereabouts will help prevent problems.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/12"}]}

The report examined a range of positions at MLB's headquarters and within franchises using data for the 2022 season.\n\nThe gender grade improved from a C last year, while the racial score slid from a B-plus. The overall grade was up slightly from last year’s C-plus based on the gains in gender (75.3 score, up from 70.7) being larger than the decline for racial (83.0, down from 86.8).\n\nTIDES director and lead report author Richard Lapchick pointed to 33 women holding some level of coaching role at either the major or minor league levels, as well as 13 women holding on-field coaching or player development positions.\n\nSpecifically, he noted some of the groundbreaking nature of those roles, including Rachel Balkovec becoming the first woman to manage the affiliate of an MLB team as she leads the New York Yankees’ Class A Tampa Tarpons and San Francisco Giants assistant Alyssa Nakken becoming the first female on-field coach in a regular-season game.\n\nThat follows the milestone November 2020 hiring of the Miami Marlins’ Kim Ng as the first woman to serve as MLB general manager.\n\n“I think the fact the overall grade went up as substantially in gender as it had was important,” Lapchick said in an interview with The Associated Press. “It’s still not a great grade. … But now they’re making dramatic hires.”\n\nOf concern to Lapchick was the finding that Black players represented 7.2% of opening day rosters. That was down from 7.6% last year and is the lowest percentage since the study data began being collected in 1991, when 18% of MLB players were Black.\n\nLapchick said the decline, a long-running concern, came “in spite of\" programs MLB has created to enhance participation for Black players at the youth level.\n\n“I’m always impressed by how many programs I see that they’re developing in so many communities,” Lapchick said. “But I think part of it is it’s a chicken-or-the-egg equation.\n\n“If you’re a young Black kid who dreams of being a professional athlete … and you say, ‘What sport am I going to have the best shot at?’ And you look and see superstars in the NFL and the NBA … and they happen to be Black and look like you, that’s probably going to be the first step you make.\"\n\nIn a statement, MLB senior vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion Billy Bean said the league is committed to “improving representation and diversity” throughout the sport.\n\n“We are proud of the various levels of progress we have seen throughout our game, especially women taking on more coaching and baseball operations roles than ever before,” said Bean, also a special assistant to Commissioner Rob Manfred. “We will continue to push for more results through effective programs, key partnerships and investments in our people.”\n\nLapchick also credited MLB for its 10-year partnership with the nonprofit Players Alliance that is set to generate $150 million, beginning in 2023. The alliance’s goal is to increase Black representation in the sport from youth levels to the front office.\n\n“While we would like the number of Black players on opening day rosters to be higher, there are signs of optimism,” Bean said, adding: “We will continue to support partnerships like the Players Alliance, and invest in these effective programs, as we look to build a sustainable pipeline of Black players at all levels of our game.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/04/diahann-carroll-oscar-nominated-actress-dies/3864892002/", "title": "Diahann Carroll, Oscar-nominated, pioneering actress, dies at 84", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series as \"Julia,\" has died.

Her story is quintessentially American. And as with so many great American stories, it didn’t start in this country. It started in India.\n\nShyamala was born in the city of Madras (now Chennai). She was passionate about an area of work considered path breaking for women in the 1950s: scientific research. In 1958, Shyamala enrolled at the University of California-Berkeley to study nutrition and endocrinology. She had never set foot in the United States before.\n\nShe went on to become a pioneer in breast cancer research, making some groundbreaking advancements in the field, and served as a great supporter of Breast Cancer Action. She was also a tireless advocate for civil rights, perhaps in part because, as a single mother of two Black daughters after her divorce from a Jamaican immigrant, she knew the cost of discrimination.\n\nPower and strength of US diversity\n\nHer two daughters have since blazed their own paths as lawyers, as civil rights advocates and as leaders in this country. On Aug. 11, Shyamala’s older daughter — Sen. Kamala Harris — reached a historic milestone. She is the first South Asian American and the first Black woman to run as a major party's vice presidential candidate. She will officially become the Democratic nominee Wednesday at the party convention.\n\nSen. Harris’ extraordinary achievement is a testament to the power and strength of diversity in this country. For many people of color, her nomination has caused us to reflect on our own journeys. I have found myself doing the same.\n\nMy mother is also an Indian immigrant. She, too, became a single mother of two children. For a time, she had to go on welfare and we were on food stamps, and lived in subsidized Section 8 housing. Eventually, my mother got a job as a travel agent and then as a contracts administrator at Raytheon. She made sacrifices and gradually climbed into the middle class, working hard and earning her own home.\n\nAnd it didn’t come without its personal challenges, either. Harris has described how her mother was often “treated as though she were dumb because of her accent,” and my mother certainly had similar experiences.\n\nFor so many South Asian Americans, the details might be different, but the broad strokes are the same. Each of us can trace our experience back to an immigrant who traveled the longest of distances for a better life. The truth is that Shyamala Gopalan’s story is the immigrant story, and the immigrant’s story is a quintessential part of America.\n\nCenturies of wasted talent:Celebrate the VP nominee, not Biden's decision to pick a woman. It's the least he can do.\n\nBut there are those who, right now, are questioning that truth. Under President Donald Trump, our immigration policies have been changed to favor whites. His actions and his rhetoric have shown that he would like to define America as a white country.\n\nThe president has described some immigrants as “animals” and white nationalists as “very fine people” and, just last week, he talked of protecting the “suburban housewife” from minorities in the suburbs. White supremacy has been on the rise, often supported by a president who dog whistles and sometimes outright cheers its existence. The question of whether America is for all Americans — Black, brown, Asian, immigrant as well as native born and white — is at the heart of this election.\n\nA nation defined by principles, not race\n\nThat is why the selection of Kamala Harris is so important, and so crucial, in this moment. It says to Asian Americans that we are not just Americans, too, but part of the civic life, with the ability to reach the highest of offices.\n\nThe president’s racist vision of America couldn’t be further from the truth. America is not a country defined by race. It is defined by shared principles and common goals. It is defined by women like Shyamala Gopalan and my mother who are willing to work hard and take on sacrifices in the hope that those who come after them can have it better, and even go on to institute change themselves.\n\nA profound message:Joe Biden's VP choice of Kamala Harris signals return to American values and competence\n\nThat creed is more important than color. We are bound together by ideals, not by where we came from or what we look like.\n\nIn America, the daughters of immigrant women from India have a place anywhere and everywhere in our country. This is a moment where many South Asians and Asians can feel not just welcomed by this country, but truly embraced by it.\n\nNeera Tanden is president of the Center for American Progress.

'Darling Nikki': 'I knew a girl named Nikki/Guess (you) could say she was a sex fiend/I met her in a hotel lobby/Masturbating with a magazine',\" she recounted. \"The vulgar lyrics embarrassed both of us. At first, I was stunned, but then I got mad! Millions of Americans were buying Purple Rain with no idea what to expect. Thousands of parents were giving the album to their children — many even younger than my daughter.”\n\nThat outrage led to the formation of the Parents Music Resource Center, a group organized by Tipper Gore and other prominent women in Washington, D.C. In their bid to raise awareness about sexual content in pop songs, the PMRC issued a list of the “Filthy Fifteen” songs they found most objectionable, with Prince’s Darling Nikki topping the list.\n\nOthers on the list included Madonna’s Dress You Up, Black Sabbath’s Trashed and AC/DC’s Let me Put My Love Into You. In addition to these Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, the list included artists like Cyndi Lauper, Sheena Easton and the Mary Jane Girls.\n\nCensorship of rock ‘n’ roll is as old as the art form. Elvis Presley’s second single Good Rockin’ Tonight was banned in Houston in 1954 because certain lyrics were seen as too suggestive. The Everly Brothers’ Wake up Little Susie was literally banned in Boston.\n\nVoices: For me an easy choice between Prince and Michael Jackson\n\nBut this was different. This was the wife of an influential senator leaning on the music industry to label albums as being inappropriate for minors. And when you have the political connections of a Tipper Gore, you can back up your activism with a Senate hearing.\n\nWe’d seen it all before in other media. Industries fearful of government regulation quickly rally to impose self-regulation. That’s why movies are rated and why the comic books you read as a kid bore the legend of the Comics Code Authority.\n\nPredictably enough, the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group, was quick to propose its own labeling system, but the show — a September 1985 hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee — went on.\n\nThis was the most entertaining Commerce Committee meeting in history. John Denver spoke out against censorship, pointing out that his song Rocky Mountain High was largely mistaken for a drug song. Twisted Sister front man Dee Snider earnestly explained that their song Under the Blade was actually about surgery anxiety, and Frank Zappa, well, was Frank Zappa.\n\n“The $8.98 purchase price does not entitle you to a kiss on the foot from the composer or performer in exchange for a spin in the family Victrola,” Zappa testified. “Taken as a whole, the complete list of PMRC demands reads like an instruction manual for some sinister kind of ‘toilet training program’ to house-break all composers and performers because of the lyrics of a few. Ladies, how dare you?”\n\nIn the end, most of the recording industry “voluntarily” agreed to label CDs that included explicit language and sexual content.\n\nSo what’s wrong with that? Don’t parents deserve to know what their kids are listening to?\n\nLess name-calling, more truth in LGBT battle: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nFirst of all, this wasn’t so voluntary. This wasn’t a consumer-friendly gesture by civic-minded record companies. This was the U.S. government regulating media through the threat of legislation, despite the First Amendment’s prohibition against government control of content.\n\nThe bigger problem, though, is what came next. Rather than embracing the labeling system and rewarding “responsible” record companies, major retailers like Walmart refused to stock CDs with advisory stickers. That meant that in order to get those albums into stores, record companies had to censor lyrics, producing “clean” versions that were often a far cry from the artists’ intent.\n\nEmboldened, Walmart even demanded change in artwork, including an album cover by John Mellencamp that depicted Mellencamp with Christ and the devil standing by his side. So long Satan. Goodbye Jesus.\n\nOf course, 31 years later, this all seems quaint. There’s no need to label CDs when no one is buying them. And in an era of teen sexting, suggestive lyrics are the least of parents’ concerns.\n\nThe man who topped the “Filthy Fifteen” is now being celebrated as an artist of vision and integrity. Clearly America has changed. What never changes, though, is the threat of government trying to control ideas it finds offensive.\n\nKen Paulson is the president of the Newseum Institute’s First Amendment Center, dean of the College of Media and Entertainment at Middle Tennessee State University and a member of USA TODAY’s Board of Contributors.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

Harmony, in turn, was a bit bigger than the first two Oasis Class vessels, Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas.\n\nMORE: Peek inside the giant suites on Symphony of the Seas\n\nDesigned for vacationers who love big, bustling mega-resorts, the Oasis Class vessels have made waves in the cruise industry since they began debuting in 2009. All of the Oasis Class ships currently at sea are in excess of 225,000 tons — more than 30% larger than the next largest cruise vessels.\n\nBayley noted Royal Caribbean never set out to build the biggest cruise ships in the world. But the line's focus on building vessels with an ever-growing array of attractions and activities for vacationers inevitably resulted in ever-bigger ships, he said.\n\n\"I know it sounds a little disingenuous, but we say size doesn't matter,\" Bayley said. \"When we design these ships, we design for maximum fun and entertainment and vacation experience, and we (then) end up with big ships.\"\n\nSymphony eclipses sister Harmony by more than 1,000 tons and offers several new features including a revamped Boardwalk amusement area, a new laser tag attraction and a new-for-Royal Caribbean seafood restaurant. The ship also has a first-of-its-kind, two-deck-high family suite with a slide between floors.\n\nSymphony has been under construction since early 2015 at the giant STX France shipyard in St. Nazaire, France — the same shipyard that built Harmony. Delivered to Royal Caribbean on Friday, it's currently is on its way to Barcelona, where its first voyage with passengers is scheduled for Saturday.\n\nSymphony will spend its first few months sailing in the Mediterranean out of Barcelona before moving to Miami to operate cruises to the Caribbean.\n\nFIRST LOOK: The Boardwalk fun zone on Symphony of the Seas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/09/22/rolling-stone-new-500-greatest-albums-marvin-gaye-beach-boys/3495555001/", "title": "Rolling Stone's new 500 Greatest Albums list: Marvin Gaye, Beach ...", "text": "Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list has been revamped.\n\nThe pop culture magazine's original list was published in 2003 and despite the fact that almost two decades have passed, the list remains wildly popular and polarizing, with nearly 63 million readers last year alone, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nBut times have changed, the music industry has evolved and some of today's emerging musicians were just children in 2003.

He was 86.\n\nHatcher died Friday night at a Chicago hospital, said his daughter, Indiana state Rep. Ragen Hatcher, a Gary Democrat. She did not provide a cause of her father’s death.\n\nThe Hatcher family said in a statement that “in the last days of his life, he was surrounded by his family and loved ones.”\n\n“While deeply saddened by his passing, his family is very proud of the life he lived, including his many contributions to the cause of racial and economic justice and the more than 20 years of service he devoted to the city of Gary,” the family added.\n\nHatcher had to overcome opposition from the local Democratic machine to become mayor of what was then Indiana’s second-largest city in a surprise victory in 1967. He went on to serve five terms.\n\nHatcher became the political face of Gary and a political force for blacks after his ground-breaking election. He organized the 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary and served as chairman of Jesse Jackson’s Democratic presidential campaign in 1984 and vice chairman four years later.\n\nJackson told The Associated Press on Saturday that Hatcher was a “transformational figure” who helped people see that African Americans could run for some of the highest offices, and win.\n\n“Mayor Richard Hatcher was not just a historical figure, he was a transformational figure. We thank him, and we miss him,” Jackson said, adding that he has been asked to speak at services for Hatcher next Saturday.\n\nHatcher’s mayorship was marred by the steel city’s deterioration.\n\nThe election of Hatcher, then a 34-year-old activist, lawyer and City Council president, sparked high emotions in Gary. He defeated incumbent A. Martin Katz in the primary by more than 2,300 votes, prompting a celebration that forced police to shut down a six-block section of Broadway for four hours.\n\nThe celebration was short-lived.\n\nWhen Hatcher said he wasn’t going to allow Lake County Democratic leaders to pick the city’s police chief, city attorney and other major positions, the party refused to support him in the general election. It even went so far as to work for his Republican opponent, Joseph Radigan.\n\nAlthough Gary hadn’t had a Republican mayor since 1938, it was a challenge for a campaign that had spent most of its money on the primary. Hatcher managed to raise $8,000 to run ads in The New York Times and the Post-Tribune in Gary that read, “Richard Hatcher is battling bigotry and ignorance. And he needs your help.”\n\nThose ads brought in more than $250,000, drew invitations to appear on TV and radio shows, and attracted the attention of Sen. Robert Kennedy, Vice President Hubert Humphrey and others.\n\n“It was unbelievable,” Hatcher, who kept a framed copy of the ad on his office wall, said in a 2011 interview with The Associated Press. “We ended up having enough money to run a decent campaign.”\n\nHe gave credit for his election to the city’s black residents, who made up slightly more than half of Gary’s population of about 175,000 residents in 1967 but trailed whites in the number of registered voters.\n\n“There was a tremendous spirit in the city and the black community was very united,” he said. “I think I received about 7% of the white vote. The other white candidates divided up the white vote, they really split it, which made it possible for me to win.”\n\nDuring his inauguration speech, Hatcher said his primary goal was to make the city a decent place to live for his “brothers and sisters.”\n\n“Gary is a rising sun. Together, we shall beat a way; together, we shall turn darkness into light, despair into hope and promise into progress,” he said.\n\nHatcher attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in federal money to Gary in his 20 years in office, some of which was used to build low-cost housing and the first public housing units in the city in nearly two decades. He also got federal funds for jobs training; repaved deteriorating streets; and put many inner-city neighborhoods on regular garbage collection for the first time.\n\nThe changes extended to City Hall. When he was elected, only two of the city’s department heads were black. A decade later, 25 of the city’s 40 department heads, including the police and fire chiefs, were black.\n\nEven before he became mayor, Hatcher was making changes. As a member of the City Council, he helped pass an open housing law to end restrictive property covenants that forced blacks to live primarily in Gary’s midtown section.\n\nBut Hatcher couldn’t stop Gary’s decline, which coincided with that of the U.S. steel industry.\n\nThe company town, founded in 1906 by U.S. Steel Chairman Elbert H. Gary, had flourished as the industry did. But U.S. Steel cut its workforce from 35,000 in the early 1970s to 25,000 by the early 1980s.\n\nBusinesses were shuttered, banks and shops moved to the suburbs, and crime increased. In 1984, Gary had the nation’s highest per-capita homicide rate.\n\nBy the time Hatcher left office in 1987, the city’s population had fallen to about 125,000. When Hatcher lost the primary, police again shut down Broadway so people could celebrate.\n\nThe city’s population now is just 76,000.\n\nDespite the city’s struggles, Hatcher told the AP in 2011 that he was proud of his accomplishments in office. “Maybe for some people in Gary it may not be better. But for others it may seem very much better,” he said.\n\nRichard Gordon Hatcher was born July 10, 1933, in Michigan City, Indiana. He was one of 13 children whose father molded railroad car wheels and whose mother was a factory worker. He graduated from Indiana University, earned a law degree from Valparaiso University and moved to Gary after becoming a deputy prosecutor.\n\nHe married his wife, Ruthellyn, in 1976.

An interstellar meteor is a space rock that originates from outside our solar system – a rare occurrence.\n\nThis one is known as CNEOS 2014-01-08, and it crash-landed along the northeast coast of Papua New Guinea on January 8, 2014.\n\nThe finding came as a surprise to Amir Siraj, who identified the object as an interstellar meteor in a 2019 study he coauthored while an undergraduate at Harvard University.\n\nSiraj was investigating ʻOumuamua, the first known interstellar object in our solar system that was found in 2017, with Abraham Loeb, professor of science at Harvard University.\n\nSiraj decided to go through NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies database to find other interstellar objects and found what he believed to be an interstellar meteor within days.\n\nA need for speed\n\nThe meteor’s high velocity is what initially caught Siraj’s eye.\n\nThe meteor was moving at a high speed of about 28 miles per second (45 kilometers per second) relative to Earth, which is moving at around 18.6 miles per second (30 kilometers per second) around the sun. Because researchers measured how fast the meteor was moving while on a moving planet, the 45 kilometers per second was not actually how fast it was going.\n\nThe heliocentric speed is defined as the meteor’s speed relative to the sun, which is a more accurate way to determine an object’s orbit. It’s calculated based on the angle at which a meteor hits the Earth. The planet moves in one direction around the sun, so the meteor could have hit Earth head-on, meaning opposite the direction the planet is moving, or from behind, in the same direction the Earth is moving.\n\nSince the meteor hit the Earth from behind, Siraj’s calculations said the meteor was actually traveling at about 37.3 miles per second (60 kilometers per second) relative to the sun.\n\nHe then mapped out the trajectory of the meteor and found it was in an unbound orbit, unlike the closed orbit of other meteors. This means that rather than circling around the sun like other meteors, it came from outside the solar system.\n\n“Presumably, it was produced by another star, got kicked out of that star’s planetary system and just so happened to make its way to our solar system and collide with Earth,” Siraj said.\n\nDifficulty getting published\n\nLoeb and Siraj have been unable to get their findings published in a journal because their data came from NASA’s CNEOS database, which doesn’t divulge information such as how accurate the readings are.\n\nAfter years of trying to obtain the additional information needed, they received official confirmation that it was, in fact, an interstellar meteor, from John Shaw, deputy commander of the US Space Command. The command is a part of the US Department of Defense and is responsible for military operations in outer space.\n\n“Dr. Joel Mozer, the Chief Scientist of Space Operations Command, the United States Space Force service component of U.S. Space Command, reviewed analysis of additional data available to the Department of Defense related to this finding. Dr. Mozer confirmed that the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory,” wrote Shaw in the letter.\n\nSiraj had moved onto other research and almost forgotten about his discovery, so the document came as a shock.\n\n“I thought that we would never learn the true nature of this meteor, that it was just blocked somewhere in the government after our many tries, and so actually seeing that letter from the Department of Defense with my eyes was a really incredible moment,” Siraj said.\n\nA second chance\n\nSince receiving the confirmation, Siraj said his team is working to resubmit their findings for publication in a scientific journal.\n\nSiraj would also like to put a team together to try and retrieve part of the meteor that landed in the Pacific Ocean but admitted it would be an unlikely possibility due to the sheer size of the project.\n\nIf researchers were able to get their hands on the “holy grail of interstellar objects,” Siraj said it would be scientifically groundbreaking in helping scientists discover more about the world beyond our solar system.\n\nNASA and US Space Command did not initially respond for comment.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}]}

But by 2053, 13 times that many people – 107 million – will experience that extremely dangerous heat, according to the study by the climate research group First Street Foundation.\n\n“The results indicate that the incidence of extreme heat is growing across the country, both in absolute and relative terms,” the study states.\n\nTemperatures in some areas will increase more than in others, including a so-called “extreme heat belt,” stretching from Texas all the way to the Great Lakes, the nonprofit’s study found.\n\nMore than 100 million Americans in this region will experience temperatures above 125 degrees (52 degrees Celsius) during their hottest stretches of the year, more than 10 times the number expected currently.\n\nUsing a peer-reviewed extreme heat model, First Street Foundation used property-level data to find the hottest seven days of the year currently and compared that to the equivalent in 30 years. On average, the seven hottest days will increase to 18 by 2053, the researchers found.\n\n\"Extreme Danger Days\" projected for 2023 and 2053 in a graphic from the First Street Foundation study. First Street Foundation\n\nBut in the southern half of the country, the number of hottest days will grow to around 30 – meaning what was once the hottest week of the year will become the hottest month by the 2050s, according to the study.\n\nFlorida’s Miami-Dade County will see the largest shift in extreme temperatures, where the hottest seven days of the year in 2023 (heat index of 103 degrees) will occur on 34 days in 2053. Other locations in Florida and along the Gulf Coast are likely to experience more than 30 additional days of heat indices above 100 degrees by 2053, the study found.\n\nNationwide, the number of counties expected to reach a heat index of 125 degrees at least once a year will jump more than 20-fold from 50 in 2023 to 1,023 in 2053, according to the study.\n\nThe probability of local heat waves – defined as temperatures well-above normal for three consecutive days – will also increase across the country, but is highest along the West Coast, according to the study.\n\n“Interestingly, exposure to Consecutive Local Hot Days is most likely to occur in West Coast states, while states in the Midwest, Southeast, and East Coast are most at risk of exposure to extremely dangerous temperatures, meaning virtually the entire country is subject to increasing perils associated with heat exposure,” the study finds.\n\nThe study also determined a projection of change for each of the US states.", "authors": ["Brandon Miller Theresa Waldrop", "Brandon Miller", "Theresa Waldrop"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/health/monkeypox-questions-update/index.html", "title": "What is monkeypox, and how can you stay safe while it spreads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs a global outbreak of monkeypox continues to grow, public health officials are stressing the importance of education in fighting the virus.\n\n“This is an outbreak that can be stopped if countries, communities and individuals informed themselves, take the risk seriously and take the steps needed to stop transmission and protect vulnerable groups,” World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.\n\nWHO has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but the Biden administration has not issued its own public health emergency declaration.\n\nMonkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox and cowpox. It generally causes pimple- or blister-like lesions and flu-like symptoms such as fever, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe lesions typically concentrate on the arms and legs, but in the latest outbreak, they’re showing up more frequently on the genital and perianal area, which has raised some concerns that monkeypox lesions may be confused with STDs.\n\n“Classically, it presents like many other viral illnesses with what’s called a viral prodrome, and symptoms like fevers, chills, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue and muscle aches are common. Within five days of the prodrome starting, patients develop a rash that can look like pimples or blisters,” said Dr. Jason Zucker, an infectious diseases specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\nHow is monkeypox spread?\n\nMonkeypox spreads through close contact, according to the CDC. That includes direct physical contact with lesions as well as “respiratory secretions” shared through face-to-face interaction, and touching objects that have been contaminated by monkeypox lesions or fluids. The virus may also pass to a fetus through the placenta.\n\nMany of the cases in the latest outbreak appear to be connected to sexual contact, but monkeypox is not an STD.\n\nWho is at risk of monkeypox?\n\nAnyone who has had contact with someone with a monkeypox-like rash, or who has had contact with someone who has a probable or confirmed case of monkeypox, is at high risk for infection.\n\nHowever, a large number of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts in this group. The virus is not unique to this community, but the nature of its close-contact spread has led to a disproportionate impact.\n\n“The vast majority of those who have been diagnosed to date with human monkeypox virus are self-identifying men who have sex with men,” Zucker said.\n\n“This is likely due to shared sexual networks. So what we’re seeing is, they’re seeing it first and experiencing the majority of cases. Just like other diseases, there’s no reason it can’t spread to other communities via sexual or other close contact,” he said.\n\nAccording to the CDC, those at higher risk during this outbreak include people who “had skin-to-skin contact with someone in a social network experiencing monkeypox activity,” including men who have sex with men who meet partners online, through an app or at a social event.\n\nPeople with conditions involving a weakened immune system like HIV and eczema, and children under 8 may also be at higher risk of severe illness if infected, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat should I do if I have monkeypox symptoms?\n\nIf you notice a new rash or other monkeypox symptoms, avoid any close contact with other people until you have seen a doctor and gotten tested.\n\n“When you see a healthcare provider, wear a mask, and remind them that the virus is circulating in the area,” the CDC says.\n\nIf you’re diagnosed with monkeypox, the agency recommends isolation at home and away from family members until the rash or lesions are gone.\n\nWhat’s the treatment for monkeypox?\n\nAccording to the CDC, there is no approved treatment specific for monkeypox. But because it’s genetically similar to smallpox, doctors can use similar treatments, such as antiviral medications.\n\nThe CDC is making doses of tecovirimat, an antiviral medication, available for monkeypox patients at risk of severe disease. This may include those whose infection has advanced into the severe stage and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nTreatment for monkeypox should also include efforts to manage symptoms and complications, WHO says.\n\nIs there a monkeypox vaccine?\n\nTwo vaccines are available in the US to prevent monkeypox, but not everyone is eligible to get one.\n\nThe US has “ample supply” of the smallpox vaccine ACAM2000, which can also be used to prevent monkeypox. However, it shouldn’t be used in people with certain health conditions, according to the CDC.\n\n“We have 100 million doses of ACAM2000,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in late June, but its side effects mean that it “in my mind as a public health person, would not be worth giving it widely throughout the general population.”\n\nAnother vaccine, Jynneos, is specifically intended for monkeypox, but it’s in short supply. Federal stock is being distributed to municipalities based on the number of cases and the population at risk in a given area.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Health and Human Services, more than 300,000 doses of Jynneos have been distributed from the strategic national stockpile.\n\nThe federal government has proposed changing how vaccines are physically given, which may mean the current supply could stretch further.\n\nJynneos is a two-dose vaccine, with a four-week gap between doses. But in light of the shortages, some experts have called for a single-dose regimen until supply improves.\n\nMonkeypox vaccination can be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and outbreak response PEP (PEP++), according to the CDC.\n\nPrEP refers to vaccinations given to members of high-risk communities, such as lab or health care workers, before they may come into contact with the virus.\n\nPEP means vaccinating people after a known exposure to prevent disease or help ease symptoms. For prevention, the CDC recommends that the vaccine be given up to four days after exposure. PEP given four to 14 days after exposure may result in milder disease.\n\nPEP++ is the CDC approach for people with unconfirmed exposure to the virus but with risk factors that may make them more likely to get it.\n\n“When coupled with self-isolation and other prevention measures when symptoms first occur, PEP++ may help slow the spread of the disease in areas with large numbers of monkeypox cases,” the CDC says.\n\nCan I get a vaccine?\n\nMonkeypox vaccine demand is high, but supply shortages and eligibility restrictions mean it can be difficult to find at this point.\n\nEligibility for the vaccines remains somewhat strict.\n\nPeople who are known, confirmed contacts of people with monkeypox are eligible to be vaccinated. Also eligible are presumed contacts who had a sex partner in the past 14 days diagnosed with monkeypox, those who had multiple sex partners in the past 14 days in an area where monkeypox is spreading, and those whose jobs may expose them to monkeypox, according to the CDC.\n\nIf you think you meet one of these criteria and want to find out about your eligibility, contact your doctor or your local health department.\n\nHow do I keep myself safe?\n\nThe CDC recommends avoiding close contact or shared objects with someone with monkeypox. Frequent hand-washing is also recommended.\n\nFor social gatherings including parties, raves, clubs and festivals, the CDC says to stick to events with more clothing, where skin-to-skin contact may be less frequent.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAvoid sex or close physical intimacy if any partner involved has monkeypox. If you do have sex and you or your partner have confirmed or suspected monkeypox, the CDC recommends keeping a physical distance of at least 6 feet between partners, washing toys and avoiding contact with the rash.\n\n“If rash is confined to the genitals or anus, condoms may help; however, condoms alone are likely not enough to prevent monkeypox,” the CDC says.", "authors": ["Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/politics/hurricane-natural-disaster-damage-costs-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Why hurricanes are getting more expensive | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

CNN wrote earlier this year about the growing cost of natural disasters – there were 20 disasters in 2021 alone that each cost $1 billion or more. The total for the year was $145 billion, according to a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAbout half of that total came from one disaster: Hurricane Ida, the slow-moving monster that caused damage from the Gulf Coast up to the Northeast. It was among the most expensive US hurricanes since 1980.\n\nWhile hurricanes are getting more expensive, they’re not necessarily getting more frequent. I talked to Philip Klotzbach, a senior research scientist in the atmospheric science department at Colorado State University, about what we know about the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and why they are getting more expensive. Our conversation, lightly edited for length and flow, is below.\n\nWhat’s unique about Hurricane Ian?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What do you find most interesting about this current storm, Ian?\n\nKLOTZBACH: It’s certainly going to be a very impactful storm. It’s very quickly intensifying after its interaction with Cuba, and it looks poised to continue to intensify this afternoon, in the evening – so it’s gonna be a very serious storm for the west coast of Florida, or somewhere between Tampa all the way down to Fort Myers, Naples.\n\nThe hard part with this storm is because it’s going to be approaching at an oblique angle, very subtle changes in how the storm is steered are going to make huge differences on who gets the storm surge.\n\nThe west coast of Florida is extremely storm surge prone. But because it’s going kind of parallel to the coast, where it decides to actually come ashore makes a huge difference for how bad it is in Tampa Bay versus further south down the coast. You look at it now on satellite, and it looks like a buzzsaw. It is not looking good.\n\nA vintage car passes by debris caused by Hurricane Ian as it passed in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, on September 27. Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters\n\nWhy there are fewer hurricanes overall\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Your report from March says that there has actually been an overall decrease in worldwide storms in recent decades. Explain.\n\nKLOTZBACH: We wrote a paper looking at global cyclone data over the last 30 years. The reason we use 30 years is because in the Atlantic you could go back further in time than other basins.\n\nIn the Atlantic, we fly planes in hurricanes. There are three in the hurricane right now. But in other basins, it’s all based on satellite data.\n\nAnd if you go back prior to about 1990, the satellites just weren’t that great. And if you look over the last 30 years, the overall number of storms has actually gone down. And the number of hurricanes has actually gone down significantly – hurricanes being the catchall for hurricanes in the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific, typhoons in the western Pacific. In other places, they are called tropical cyclones or cyclones.\n\nWe attributed that decrease primarily to a trend globally toward La Nina conditions. La Nina is colder than normal water in the eastern and central Pacific. And typically what that does is it increases your Atlantic storms, but decreases your Pacific storms. Because the Pacific has a much larger ocean basin, that means overall you end up with fewer storms when you suppress Pacific activity versus Atlantic activity.\n\nIt does not feel like there are fewer hurricanes on the East Coast\n\nWHAT MATTERS: So while the Earth is seeing fewer storms, how come to those of us on the East Coast of the United States it feels like there are more?\n\nKLOTZBACH: If you look at landfall specifically, we don’t see any long-term trend in the number of landfalling hurricanes.\n\nFlorida, for example – it’s hard to remember this now, but from 2006 to 2015, we had 10 years in a row with not one landfalling hurricane in the state of Florida. Which was impressive given those seasons were actually pretty busy. But Florida just was really, really lucky.\n\nAnd then obviously 2017 was very impactful for Florida. Obviously 2018 with Michael. The last few years, despite them being very busy, Florida has generally dodged any significant impact, even in 2020 with all the storms that were out there.\n\nWhy storms are more destructive\n\nWHAT MATTERS: When storms do hit, they’re more destructive than they used to be, at least in terms of dollar figures. You had some interesting stuff in your report about that. Why are storms more expensive?\n\nKLOTZBACH: It’s mostly due to growth and exposure along the coastline. Basically, more people and more stuff in harm’s way. That’s the primary reason for the increase in the damage.\n\nNow, in the paper we didn’t say that climate change can’t cause storms to be more damaging in the future. Obviously with sea level rise – that in and of itself means the storm surge is going to move farther inland. Warmer atmosphere means more rain. More rain causes more flooding, which causes more damage, and then obviously, potentially, storms getting stronger in the future as well.\n\nWe were just saying overall so far most of the increase in damage is growth and exposure along the coastline. … Since the number of storms and the strength of the storms making landfall hasn’t gone up, we wouldn’t necessarily expect to see the damage going up for anything other than demographic changes and shifts which have occurred.\n\nPeople stand outside a flooded warehouse in Batabano, Cuba, on September 27, during the passage of Hurricane Ian. Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStorms are intensifying more quickly\n\nWHAT MATTERS: But we do have a story on CNN that because ocean temperatures have risen, the intensification of storms has risen. How does that compare with what you’ve found?\n\nKLOTZBACH: That was one of the many metrics we looked at in the paper. The garden variety, generic definition of rapid intensification is a storm intensifying by 35 miles per hour or more in 24 hours. If we use that definition, we haven’t seen an increasing trend in those storms.\n\nHowever, if you use a really rapid intensification definition of 60 miles per hour over 24 hours, we did see an increasing trend in that statistic globally. We attributed some of that is due to climate change. The challenge is when you’re looking at these thresholds, 30 years of data is not a ton.\n\nWhat you expect with climate change is when you talk about global temperature going up one degree. It’s like, well, who really cares if it’s 84 or 85? But it’s how that changes the extremes.\n\nAnd that’s what we saw in our study as well. The overall number of storms hasn’t necessarily changed. Hurricanes have actually gone down. But we are finding an increase in the percentage of hurricanes at these high intensities, or the storms that intensify quickly – really, really fast. It’s really high intensity thresholds that are going up, not just the general definition.\n\nWhat can we anticipate in the future?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: You’re very careful in your report to say you’re not predicting what’s going to happen in the future. So I’d like to do that right now and ask what you are looking for in the future. Given the trends that you’ve seen, and given what we know about climate change, what are you anticipating?\n\nKLOTZBACH: Sea level rise, in and of itself – we’re very confident that is occurring, and it’s likely to continue to occur.\n\nEven if storms don’t change at all in intensity, just the fact that the sea level is higher means that when you have that storm surge, it’s going to penetrate farther inland, which obviously increases damage.\n\nWarmer atmosphere holds more moisture, more rain. That obviously causes increases in damage. There’s a lot of debate about whether storms are moving slower, kind of like we’re seeing with Hurricane Ian. It’s going to be moving slowly with really, really heavy rain.\n\nWill storms get stronger?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Is there evidence that storms will get stronger?\n\nKLOTZBACH: The general public always asks if storms are going to get stronger. I think that, unfortunately, from a scientific perspective, is a harder one to answer. Hurricane intensity is a function of water temperatures, which we know are going up, but it’s also a function of temperatures higher up in the atmosphere, which climate change will also increase. That tends to stabilize the atmosphere.\n\nWhen we said overall storms and hurricanes are actually coming down, a lot of that trend was due to overall the environment trending more toward La Nina, which is colder than normal water in the eastern and central tropical Pacific. Normally that bumps up your Atlantic storms, knocks down your Pacific storms. … The million-dollar question that we don’t know: Is that trend toward La Nina going to continue? Because if that continues, we won’t necessarily see more really strong hurricanes, typhoons – just because overall, the number of storms is going to go down.\n\nBut if we trend more toward El Nino, the Atlantic may go down while the Pacific’s can go way, way up. And so you’re gonna see a lot more damage there and a lot more really strong storms.\n\nThat is, to me, one of the biggest scientific questions we need to address, because most climate models say that we should be trending more toward El Nino, whereas the real world says we’re trending more toward La Nina.\n\nThat is a huge scientific question that we need to get a handle on if we’re going to make any good assessments of how hurricane activity is going to change in the future.\n\nStorms will still get more damaging\n\nWHAT MATTERS: If sea levels are higher and the storms are slower moving and they’re dropping more rain, does that suggest that it will get even more expensive in the future?\n\nKLOTZBACH: What we’re finding is that a lot of the damage is from water, whether it be from storm surge or from rainfall.\n\nNot that wind isn’t a problem. If you didn’t have the wind, you wouldn’t have the surge to begin with. Just the background sea level being higher is going to exacerbate the surge, and then the warmer atmosphere is going to increase the rainfall – and then, if the storms do indeed move slower, that’s kind of a double rainfall whammy.\n\nAnother factor that has nothing to do with climate change but can also exacerbate flooding is land-use changes. We saw that a lot in Harvey, where people built in bayous, they built in swamps. These areas where normally the water would have runoff are now concrete. You have exacerbated the runoff.\n\nWe can modify the built environment to basically increase the damage from storms or decrease if we do things better. That has nothing to do with climate change but also due to a human cause.\n\nThere are certainly ways we can mitigate the damage in the future. Building better and building smarter is going to become even more important with climate change potentially amping these things up even more.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

And many of the nation’s grid operators are also not taking climate change into account in their planning, even as extreme weather becomes more frequent and more severe.\n\nAll of this suggests that more power outages are on the way, not only this summer but in the coming years as well.\n\nPower operators in the Central US, in their summer readiness report, have already predicted “insufficient firm resources to cover summer peak forecasts.” That assessment accounted for historical weather and the latest NOAA outlook that projects for more extreme weather this summer.\n\nBut energy experts tell CNN that some power grid operators are not considering how the climate crisis is changing our weather — including more frequent extreme events — and that is a problem if the intent is to build a reliable power grid.\n\n“The reality is the electricity system is old and a lot of the infrastructure was built before we started thinking about climate change,” said Romany Webb, a researcher at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “It’s not designed to withstand the impacts of climate change.”\n\nWebb says many power grid operators use historical weather to make investment decisions, rather than the more dire climate projections, simply because they want to avoid the possibility of financial loss for investing in what might happen versus what has already happened. She said it’s the wrong approach and it makes the grid vulnerable.\n\n“We have seen a reluctance on the part of many utilities to factor climate change into their planning processes because they say the science around climate change is too uncertain,” Webb said. “The reality is we know climate change is happening, we know the impact it has in terms of more severe heatwaves, hurricanes, drought, and we know that all of those things affect the electricity system so ignoring those impacts just makes the problems worse.”\n\nMatjaz Krivic\n\nAn early heatwave knocked six power plants offline in Texas earlier this month.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, in its seasonal reliability report, said the state’s power grid is prepared for the summer and has “sufficient” power for “normal” summer conditions, based on average weather from 2006 to 2020.\n\nBut NOAA’s recently released summer outlook forecasts above average temperatures for every county in the nation.\n\n“We are continuing to design and site facilities based on historical weather patterns that we know in the age of climate change are not a good proxy for future conditions,” Webb told CNN.\n\nWhen asked if the agency is creating a blind spot for itself by not accounting for extreme weather predictions, an ERCOT spokesperson told CNN the report “uses a scenario approach to illustrate a range of resource adequacy outcomes based on extreme system conditions, including some extreme weather scenarios.”\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — a regulating authority that oversees the health of the nation’s electrical infrastructure — has a less optimistic projection.\n\nIn a recent seasonal reliability report, NERC placed Texas at “elevated risk” for blackouts this summer. It also reported that while much of the nation will have adequate electricity this summer, several markets are at risk of energy emergencies.\n\nCalifornia grid operators in its summer reliability report also based its readiness analysis on “the most recent 20 years of historical weather data.” The report also notes the assessment “does not fully reflect more extreme climate induced load and supply uncertainties.”\n\nCompounding the US power grid’s supply and demand problem is drought: NERC tells CNN there’s been a 2% loss of reliable hydropower from the nation’s power-producing dams. Add to that the rapid retirement of many coal power plants — all while nearly everything from toothbrushes to cars are now electrified. Energy experts say adding more renewables into the mix will have the dual impact of cutting climate change inducing greenhouse gas emissions but also increasing the nation’s power supply.\n\nPlan B\n\nOne Chicago neighborhood is already making plans for how to keep the lights, air conditioning and heat on when the larger grid fails.\n\nIn the Bronzeville neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, solar panels dot the rooftop of a public housing complex. A short drive away, a a giant battery stores energy from the solar panels as well as natural gas generators, creating a micro grid. Ilinois-based energy company, Commonwealth Edison, is working with community members to make the neighborhood energy independent.\n\n“Without power we are talking about potential life-threatening situations, so this micro grid provides that backup to be able to deliver power even when the [main] grid isn’t there,” said Paul Pabst, an engineer for Commonwealth Edison.\n\nThe project is pending approval but once it’s operating, the micro grid can connect and share power with the main grid. In the event of a blackout, it can disconnect and operate independently, tapping its stored battery energy to power the homes, police station and hospital in the area for four hours.\n\nYami Newell is a Bronzeville resident and energy advocate. She has seen the cascading effects of an unreliable power grid in Chicago, a place that’s no stranger to weather-related outages from both extreme cold and extreme heat. Losing power in a heatwave can create a dangerous health situation, and for families on a fixed income, losing all of the food in their refrigerator can be financially devastating.\n\n“An energy crisis can become a public health crisis,” Newell told CNN. “It can become a food crisis.”\n\nAs communities look for innovative ways to build a more resilient grid, Bronzeville is one possible blueprint. Until states build a more resilient power grid, climate change will force energy companies to continue to take emergency actions, like asking people to limit electricity use or forced rolling blackouts to manage the grid when supply can’t meet demand.", "authors": ["René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/business/food-crisis-ukraine-russia/index.html", "title": "War has brought the world to the brink of a food crisis | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nSvein Tore Holsether says the world is careening toward a food crisis that could affect millions of people.\n\nRecord high natural gas prices have forced the company he runs, fertilizer producer Yara International, to curtail its production of ammonia and urea in Europe to 45% of capacity. With less of those two essential agricultural ingredients, he expects knock-on effects for global food supplies.\n\n“It’s not whether we are going to have a food crisis. It’s how large that crisis will be,” Holsether told CNN Business.\n\nTwo weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of key agricultural products produced in the region have skyrocketed. The biggest problem is wheat, a pantry staple. Supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for almost 30% of global wheat trade, are now at risk. Global wheat prices hit an all-time high earlier this week.\n\nAnother major problem is access to fertilizer. Essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, it’s never been more expensive, as exports from Russia grind to a halt. Output in Europe has also plunged thanks to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.\n\nThe situation is ringing alarm bells for global health experts. The cost of corn, soybeans and vegetable oils has been jumping, too.\n\nAgriculture ministers from the G7 countries said Friday they “remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to a food crisis.”\n\nBut fearing shortages, countries are already turning inward, which could ultimately leave less food for those in need.\n\nEgypt just banned the export of wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world’s most populous state. Indonesia has also tightened export restrictions on palm oil, which is a component in cooking oil as well as in cosmetics and some packaged goods like chocolate. It’s the world’s top producer of the product.\n\nThe G7 ministers called on countries to “keep their food and agricultural markets open and to guard against any unjustified restrictive measures on their exports.”\n\n“Any further increase in food price levels and volatility in international markets could threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among the most vulnerable living in environments of low food security,” they said in a statement.\n\nWestern countries with more access to agriculture will be hurt, too. Consumers there have already been stung by higher prices, and the situation is poised to deteriorate further.\n\nRussia, Ukraine and global food supplies\n\nEven before Russia launched a war in Ukraine, the global food system was strained. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.\n\nThe number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN’s World Food Programme said this month.\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which both play crucial roles in the carefully calibrated system of global food production, stands to make the situation worse.\n\nGlobal wheat prices have fallen from record highs in recent days, but remain elevated. They’re expected to stay that way for some time, according to Rabobank commodity analyst Carlos Mera.\n\nThe wheat planting season, which is about to begin in Ukraine, will be disrupted by fighting. It’s not clear there will be enough farmers to till the land, as people in the country take up arms — or whether they’ll be able to access machinery and other essential products that would typically arrive through Black Sea ports.\n\n“It’s anyone’s guess if Ukraine will be able to export anything for the rest of this year, or next year, or in the foreseeable future,” Mera said. The country also accounts for half of all exports of sunflower oil.\n\nGetting products from Russia onto the world market has also gotten more difficult, because businesses don’t want to risk running afoul of sanctions or deal with the logistics of traveling near a war zone.\n\nRussia and Ukraine serve as the breadbasket for countries in the Middle East and North Africa that depend on imports. Many will be hit hard as a result. The United States and Europe will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market.\n\n“Any serious disruption of production and exports from these suppliers will no doubt drive up prices further and erode food security for millions of people,” the Agricultural Market Information System said in a recent report.\n\nFertilizer costs soar\n\nThe brewing crisis goes beyond wheat and oils. Russia, along with its ally Belarus, is also a major exporter of the fertilizers needed to plant a wide range of crops. But right now, everyone is shunning their stock.\n\n“Nobody wants to touch a Russian product right now,” said Deepika Thapliyal, a fertilizer expert at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. “If you look at all of the traders, all of the buyers, they’re very scared.”\n\nThe price of natural gas is exacerbating the issue. Fertilizer producers outside of Russia and Belarus need gas to make nitrogen-based products like urea, which is used when sowing crops to boost yield and even promotes their deep-green color.\n\nBut Holsether, the CEO of Yara, said costs have gotten too high to keep operations running at scale. He’s not sure when European production will be at full capacity again.\n\n“There’s a large part of the industry that’s at risk of not being able to deliver products to the farmers, and that will have an impact on the crop yields quite rapidly,” he said.\n\nFarmers have the incentive right now to pay what they need to get fertilizer, since prices for their products are going up, too. Not everyone has this option, however. Urea has been trading near $1,000 per metric ton, about four times the price at the start of 2021, according to Chris Lawson, the head of fertilizers at CRU Group, a market intelligence firm.\n\nCountries without domestic fertilizer production may also struggle to access it, with huge consequences for the global food system.\n\n“You can’t grow massive fields of wheat, barley or soy without fertilizer,” said Johanna Mendelson Forman, a professor at American University who specializes in war and food. Farmers in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil are already worried about shortages, she added.\n\nThe consequences\n\nOn Monday, Russian fertilizer and coal billionaire Andrey Melnichenko broke with President Vladimir Putin and called for peace in Ukraine, noting that a global food crisis looms.\n\nThe war “has already led to soaring prices in fertilizers which are no longer affordable to farmers,” Melnichenko told Reuters. “Now it will lead to even higher food inflation in Europe and likely food shortages in the world’s poorest countries,” he added.\n\nThe G7 agriculture ministers said Friday that their countries would leverage humanitarian aid where they can to mitigate fallout from the war. But they may also be hamstrung by a dearth of supplies and rising prices.\n\n“If Ukrainian fields lie fallow this year, aid agencies such as ours will be forced to source new markets to compensate for the loss of some of the world’s best wheat,” David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, said in an op-ed published in the Washington Post this week. “Doing so will come at a vastly inflated cost.”\n\nBeasley noted that Ukrainian wheat has also been essential to feeding populations in other countries facing conflict, including Afghanistan, Sudan and Yemen.\n\n“The vast majority of wheat is used for human consumption, and that’s irreplaceable,” Rabobank’s Mera said.\n\nAnd it won’t just be countries grappling with famine or war that feel the effects.\n\nThe affordability of food is a problem for lower-income shoppers everywhere, Mendelson Forman emphasized. In April 2021, about one in seven American adults experienced food insecurity over the past 30 days, according to the Urban Institute.\n\n“We’re used to a globalized system of trade to get all kinds of varieties of food,” she said. “People will see it in their pocketbooks, and they’ll see it in the grocery stores.”\n\n— Mostafa Salem contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/economy/inflation-recession-economy-deutsche-bank/index.html", "title": "A major recession is coming, Deutsche Bank warns | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nDeutsche Bank raised eyebrows earlier this month by becoming the first major bank to forecast a US recession, albeit a “mild” one.\n\nNow, it’s warning of a deeper downturn caused by the Federal Reserve’s quest to knock down stubbornly high inflation.\n\n“We will get a major recession,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report to clients on Tuesday.\n\nThe problem, according to the bank, is that while inflation may be peaking, it will take a “long time” before it gets back down to the Fed’s goal of 2%. That suggests the central bank will raise interest rates so aggressively that it hurts the economy.\n\n“We regard it…as highly likely that the Fed will have to step on the brakes even more firmly, and a deep recession will be needed to bring inflation to heel,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote in its report with the ominous title, “Why the coming recession will be worse than expected.”\n\nBehind the curve\n\nConsumer prices spiked by 8.5% in March, the fastest pace in 40 years. The jobs market remains on fire, with Moody’s Analytics projecting that the unemployment rate will soon fall to the lowest level since the early 1950s.\n\nTo make its case, Deutsche Bank created an index that tracks the distance between inflation and unemployment over the past 60 years and the Fed’s stated goals for those metrics. That research, according to the bank, finds that the Fed today is “much further behind the curve” than it has been since the early 1980s, a period when extremely high inflation forced the central bank to raise interest rates to record highs, crushing the economy.\n\nHistory shows the Fed has “never been able to correct” even smaller overshoots of inflation and employment “without pushing the economy into a significant recession,” Deutsche Bank said.\n\nGiven that the job market has “over-tightened” by as much as two percentage points of unemployment, the bank said, “Something stronger than a mild recession will be needed to do the job.”\n\nThe good news is that Deutsche Bank sees the economy rebounding by mid-2024 as the Fed reverses course in its inflation fight.\n\nGoldman Sachs: Recession is not inevitable\n\nOf course, no one knows precisely how this will play out. Although Deutsche Bank is pessimistic – it’s the most bearish among major banks on Wall Street – others contend this gloom-and-doom is overdone.\n\nGoldman Sachs concedes it will be “very challenging” to bring down high inflation and wage growth, but stresses that a recession is “not inevitable.”\n\n“We do not need a recession but probably do need growth to slow to a somewhat below-potential pace, a path that raises recession risk,” Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a report Friday evening.\n\nUBS is similarly hopeful that the economic expansion will continue despite the Fed’s shift to inflation-fighting mode.\n\n“Inflation should ease from current levels, and we do not expect a recession from rising interest rates,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a report on Monday.\n\nWar and Covid lockdowns pressure inflation\n\nDeutsche Bank said the most important factor behind its more negative view is the likelihood that inflation will remain “persistently elevated for longer than generally anticipated.”\n\nThe bank said several developments will contribute to higher-than-feared inflation, including: the reversal of globalization, climate change, further supply-chain disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China and coming increases to inflation expectations that will support actual inflation.\n\n“The scourge of inflation has returned and is here to stay,” Deutsche Bank said.\n\nIf inflation does stay elevated, the Fed will be forced to consider more dramatic interest rate hikes. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-percentage point in March and Chairman Jerome Powell conceded last week that a half-point hike is “on the table” at next week’s meeting.\n\n“It is sorely tempting to take a go-slow approach hoping that the US economy can be landed softly on a sustainable path. This will not happen,” Deutsche Bank said. “Our view is that the only way to minimize the economic, financial and societal damage of prolonged inflation is to err on the side of doing too much.”", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/weather/artificial-snow-beijing-olympics-climate/index.html", "title": "Virtually all of the Beijing snow is fake -- a resource-intensive ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt would be hard to hold a conversation over the deafening sound of the snow machines preparing the Olympic venues northwest of Beijing. They are loud and they are everywhere, blowing snow across what will be this month’s most-watched slopes.\n\nIt is almost beautiful – except that the venues are surrounded by an endless brown, dry landscape completely devoid of snow.\n\nIn an Olympic first, though not an achievement to boast about, climate variability has forced the Winter Games to be virtually 100% reliant on artificial snow – part of a trend that is taking place across winter sports venues around the world.\n\nJust one of the 21 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics in the past 50 years will have a climate suitable for winter sports by the end of the century, a recent study found, if fossil fuel emissions remain unchecked.\n\nAs the planet warms and the weather becomes increasingly more erratic, natural snow is becoming less reliable for winter sports, which forces venues to lean more on artificial snow.\n\nBut it comes at a cost: human-made snow is incredibly resource-intensive, requiring massive amounts of energy and water to produce in a climate that’s getting warmer and warmer. Elite athletes also say that the sports themselves become trickier and less safe when human-made snow is involved.\n\nNo snow? Fake it\n\nThe region surrounding the outdoor Olympic venues is in an extreme drought this winter, but even in normal years, it isn’t particularly suitable for snow sports. The average annual snowfall in Yanqing (where the Alpine slopes are) and Zhangjiakou (where many of the other events are held, including the biathlon) is roughly 20 centimeters (7.8 inches), although higher snow years have been recorded.\n\nEnter the snow machines.\n\nSnowmaking machines during the FIS Snowboard World Cup 2022 in November, part of a 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games test event at the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou city. Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images\n\nItaly-based TechnoAlpin was tapped to manufacture the snow required to cover the four outdoor event spaces around Beijing – a monumental task considering the elite clientele that will zoom across its product.\n\n“We are very proud to say that we are the only company providing the snow-making systems for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,” Michael Mayr, TechnoAlpin Asia area manager, told CNN.\n\nMayr said it is the first time a single company has been tasked with providing all the snow for the Winter Games.\n\nBut there’s a critical component to making snow that some of the Beijing sites also lack: temperatures cold enough to freeze water.\n\nIn Beijing itself, which will host a few outdoor events, nearly all February days for the past 30 years have been above freezing, according to a recent Slippery Slopes report led by Loughborough University in London on how the climate crisis is affecting the Winter Olympics.\n\nA staff member drives a snow-grooming machine at Big Air Shougang on February 1. Chen Jianli/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nYanqing and Zhangjiakou, which are higher elevation venues, are cooler, with average high temperatures that peak above freezing and lows that fall to around -10 degrees Celsius at night.\n\n“There have been recent technological advances that allow for the generation of snow when it is above freezing,” explained Jordy Hendrikx, the director of the Snow and Avalanche Laboratory at Montana State University. “This is not your ‘light fluffy’ snow that you might think of – it is much denser and not very soft.”\n\nIce makers ‘on steroids’\n\nTraditionally, snow-making has relied heavily on snow guns and temperatures at or below freezing. To accommodate warmer temperatures and lower elevations, a different approach needs to be taken.\n\nTo work around Mother Nature, TechnoAlpin told CNN that it began shipping a full arsenal of snow guns, fan-driven snow generators and cooling towers to Beijing in 2018. Among those machines was a new piece of technology used at a training center for China’s athletes: the SnowFactory.\n\n“Think of it like a very sophisticated version of the ice maker in your refrigerator,” said Hendrikx. “But then on steroids.”\n\nArtificial snow machines go to work in January outside one of the athletes villages in Zhangjiakou. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nMaking snow demands significant resources, namely energy and water.\n\n“Obviously we need more energy the warmer it gets,” Mayr said.\n\nAnd with 1.2 million cubic meters of snow needed to cover roughly 800,000 square meters of competition area, according to the Slippery Slopes report, the water demand at this year’s Winter Olympics is massive.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee estimated that 49 million gallons of water will be needed to produce snow for The Games, which is a lot when you consider how rapidly the world is running out of freshwater. It’s enough to fill 3,600 average-sized backyard swimming pools, or – more to the point – it’s a day’s worth of drinking water for nearly 100 million people.\n\n‘This is dangerous’\n\nAthletes have also expressed concern about the hazards of competing at high levels on artificial snow.\n\nFrench cross-country skier Clement Parisse, the bronze medal winner at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, told CNN that while it’s not uncommon to have to compete on human-made snow, it tends to become very slick and icy, which presents added challenges.\n\nAnd Laura Donaldson, a freestyle skier from Scotland who competed in Salt Lake City in 2002, was extremely critical of artificial snow.\n\n“If freestyle super pipes are formed from snow-making machines in a poor season, the walls of the pipe are solid, vertical ice and the pipe floor is solid ice,” Donaldson told researchers for the Slippery Slopes report. “This is dangerous for athletes, some have died.”\n\nThe IOC does not face these challenges alone. Artificial snow is being used as a tool to extend ski seasons in competitions and at resorts across the globe, many of which are threatened by the warming temperatures of the climate crisis.\n\nThese challenges will continue to drive the snow sports industry toward artificial snow when Mother Nature doesn’t produce it.\n\nBut the question remains – just because we can, does that mean we should?", "authors": ["Derek Van Dam"], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/us/pittsburgh-bridge-collapse/index.html", "title": "Pittsburgh bridge collapses hours before Biden visit to discuss ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTen people were injured when a snow-covered bridge in Pittsburgh collapsed Friday morning, hours ahead of a previously scheduled visit to the city by President Joe Biden to discuss infrastructure.\n\nNo fatalities have been reported, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said in a news conference at the scene in the area of Forbes and Braddock avenues.\n\nFire Chief Darryl Jones characterized the injuries as “minor,” and said three people were transported from the scene.

There are some reports of people feeling ill in the area from natural gas, Downs said, and those individuals are being treated on the scene.\n\nPeoples Gas spokesperson Barry Kukovich confirmed the company had a gas distribution line on the bridge that collapsed. “It goes under the roadway and then it goes under the bridge,” he said.\n\nThere is no evidence at this time there was a gas explosion prior to the collapse, Kukovich said. He described the gas line as a distribution line but said it was not a high pressure gas line.\n\nPeoples Gas crews are on the scene assessing the situation, Kukovich said, and nearby customers are experiencing “minimal service interruptions.”\n\nVehicles that were on a Pittsburgh bridge when it collapsed are seen Friday morning. Gene J. Puskar/AP\n\nBridge is a ‘vital artery’ for the area, official says\n\nAccording to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller, a light snow was falling Friday morning in Pittsburgh, though only one to two inches had accumulated since it started around 2 a.m. ET. Light snow is expected to continue on and off through Friday afternoon, though not much more accumulation is anticipated.\n\nThe weather is not directly related to a strengthening nor’easter off the US East Coast, Miller said, but a separate system dropping in from the north.\n\nIn an interview on CNN’s “New Day,” Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman called the bridge a “vital artery” in the Pittsburgh area. The bridge crosses Frick Park, one of the city’s largest parks.\n\n“Thankfully, schools were on a two-hour delay for weather,” he said, “so the traffic was less than it would have been normally on a normal day, but it’s surreal to see this bridge.”\n\nAsked about the collapse coming the same day of the President’s visit, Fetterman, a Democrat, said, “This is a horrible way to underscore just how critical our infrastructure needs are in this country.”\n\nThe bridge collapse in Pittsburgh Friday is seen from the air.

He and other drivers were unable to stop in time after the bridge gave way, he said.\n\n“The scariest part was definitely going over the edge because there was a gap and my car left the ground,” he told CNN. His car and others are now sitting on top of what remains of the bridge.\n\nOnce things settled, Habowski checked on another driver, he said. Then he climbed up the hill to try and stop other drivers from driving into the debris.\n\n“It was a lot to take in,” he told CNN.\n\nVehicles are seen at the bottom of a bridge in Pittsburgh that gave way on January 28. courtesy Jeremy Habowski\n\nGreg Barnhisel lives about a quarter-mile from where the bridge collapse, so he and his wife went to see it on foot, he told CNN.\n\n“We didn’t hear it collapse,” he said. “When we got to the site of the collapse, the roaring sound and the smell of the broken gas line were overwhelming.”\n\nAnother nearby resident, Wendy Stroh, told CNN affiliate KDKA she heard the collapse, but thought it sounded like “a huge snowplow pushing along a raw tarmac surface with no snow.”\n\n“It’s very frightening,” she said. “My goodness, all these ambulances and fire trucks and what not. Just the thought of the bridge collapsing is a very scary prospect. I cross that bridge all the time.”\n\nAllegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said normally there are a lot of people walking or jogging on trails under the bridge, but no one was there because of the weather and time of day.\n\n“It’s incredible to think that nobody was more seriously injured and quite frankly killed,” Fitzgerald said. “We got to fix these things because one of these days our luck is going to run out.”\n\nBridge received overall ‘poor’ rating, per state DOT\n\nIn Friday morning’s news conference, Mayor Gainey said the bridge had last been inspected in September 2021.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Jones, the fire chief, said the bridge was not a concern to officials prior to the collapse. The city’s bridges are routinely inspected, he said, and “if there was any warning or concern, we would have been notified and we would have made sure that we didn’t use this route.”\n\n“So this one caught everybody by surprise this morning,” he said.\n\nHowever, while the fire chief said the bridge had not been a concern for city officials, it had received an “overall condition” rating of “poor,” according to the website for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, which tracks bridges across the state.\n\nThe 447-foot bridge was built in 1970 and composed of a steel rigid frame, according to the website.\n\nThe PennDOT website says the condition of the deck, or road surface, was rated “4 - Poor,” as was the superstructure condition. The substructure condition was rated “6 - Satisfactory.”\n\nAccording to PennDOT, a bridge’s condition “is determined by the lowest condition rating of the primary components of a bridge or culvert.”\n\n“If the lowest rating is greater than or equal to 7, the bridge is classified as Good; if it is less than or equal to 4, the classification is Poor. Bridges rated 5 or 6 are classified as Fair,” the website explains.\n\nJane Dudley was shoveling snow at her house, near the entrance of Pittsburgh's Frick Park, when she heard the bridge collapse Friday. She took this photo of the collapsed bridge. courtesy Jane Dudley\n\nO’Connor said some “rehab” had been done to the bridge a couple years ago, including repaving the surface.\n\n“But again, we are the City of Bridges. There are so many bridges in the city, in the county that we live in, and this infrastructure bill – you talk about irony, the President’s coming to talk about infrastructure – we need it,” the council member said.\n\nIn a statement, Fetterman, the lieutenant governor, called the collapse Friday “just the latest in a long line of preventable, man-made disasters that prove what so many of us in Pennsylvania have been saying for years: Our infrastructure is failing our people.”\n\n“In Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania, and across America,” the lieutenant governor said, “we cannot afford neglect any longer. It’s time to rebuild this nation.”\n\nIn the meantime, rebuilding the bridge could take “at least a year,” Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald told CNN, citing a best-case scenario estimate by state engineers from PennDOT. He called it a “major, major inconvenience” for the people who rely on the bridge.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Paradise Afshar", "Dakin Andone", "Paradise Afshar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/28"}]}

They’re the reason I’m here, the reason why I’m the person I am and getting to share this moment with my mom and also trying to give a little nod to Roger Maris Jr., it means a lot.”\n\nJudge is the sixth player in major league history to hit at least 60 home runs in a single season, but downplayed his record-setting season.\n\n“I haven’t really been thinking about numbers or stats and stuff like that,” he told reporters. “I’m going out there trying to help my team win.”\n\nAfter hitting his 394-foot home run, Judge received a standing ovation from the Toronto crowd and was greeted by teammates as he touched home plate.\n\nThe Yankees, crowned AL East champions on Tuesday, went on to defeat the Blue Jays 8-3. Judge’s next chance to break the record will come on Friday when the Yankees host the Baltimore Orioles.\n\n“I keep saying over and over, Aaron Judge; everyone should just watch and take notice,” Yankees head coach Aaron Boone said last week after Judge hit his 60th home run. “I can say this because I’ve lived this, and he’s shown this: he puts his focus on being a great teammate and winning. He knows everything else will take care of itself.”\n\nWith seven regular season games remaining, Judge is unlikely to reach the major league single-season record of 73 home runs.\n\nBut many have brushed the record aside because it’s currently held by Barry Bonds who – along with other players of that era – was embroiled in performance-enhancing drug scandals and allegedly used steroids. Bonds and Sammy Sosa have denied those allegations.\n\nJudge disagrees, telling Sports Illustrated recently that “73 is the record In my book.” But Maris’ son, Roger Maris Jr., said on Wednesday that Judge should be “revered for being the actual single-season home run champ. That’s really who he is if he hits 62.”\n\n“It means a lot not just for me, it means a lot for a lot of people that he’s clean, he’s a Yankee, he plays the game the right way … Baseball needs to look at the records and I think baseball should do something,” Maris Jr. told the YES Network.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jacob Lev", "Amir Vera", "Jacob Lev"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/09/28/aaron-judge-61-home-runs-american-league-record-yankees/8075138001/", "title": "Aaron Judge ties Roger Maris for American League, Yankee home ...", "text": "TORONTO – In his \"season for the ages,'' New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge reached a magical home run milestone indoors at the Rogers Centre.\n\nBatting in Wednesday night's seventh inning, Judge launched his 61st home run of the year, a two-run shot to left off Blue Jays' lefty reliever Tim Mayza.\n\nJudge's tie-breaking blast sent the Yankees toward an 8-3 victory before 37,008 fans.\n\nIn Game 155, Judge moved past Babe Ruth and into a tie with Roger Maris, who set the single-season franchise record with 61 home runs in 1961.\n\nWith Roger Maris Jr. in attendance, Judge joined the late Maris for a share of the all-time American League record for homers in a season.\n\nJudge belted a 3-2 sinker by Mayza, the eighth pitch of the at-bat, into the Blue Jays' bullpen where it was retrieved by a uniformed member of Toronto's staff.\n\n“I was hoping it would get over the fence. I didn’t know at first. I didn’t want to be standing at home plate when it hits the wall,” Judge said. “It’s an incredible honor. There’ was a lot of emotions. It took me a little longer than I wanted to.”\n\nBefore he reached home plate, Yankees players and personnel were outside the visiting dugout to congratulate Judge, first embraced by Aaron Hicks who singled and scored on the milestone home run.\n\n“That was pretty cool. I wasn’t expecting it,” Judge said.\n\nThe ball traveled an estimated 394 feet, with an exit velocity of 117.4 mph according to Statcast.\n\nBest season ever?:How Aaron Judge ranks with Yankees' all-time greatest performances\n\nMore:Fans in Toronto fail to catch Aaron Judge's 61st home run\n\nAnother single-season franchise record was tied Wednesday, as Gerrit Cole's four strikeouts gave him 248, matching Ron Guidry's club mark set in 1978.\n\nBetween home run No. 60 on Sept. 20, at Yankee Stadium, tying Ruth's mark in 1927, and No. 61, Judge made 34 plate appearances, going 5-for-21 (.238) with three doubles, 13 walks (one intentional), eight strikeouts and one 404-foot flyout to center.\n\n\"Definitely some relief, getting to 61,'' Judge said afterward. \"You try not to think about it, but it creeps into your head.\n\n\"When I hit it, I thought I got enough. But it’s been a couple games since I did that.''\n\nServing as the Yanks' designated hitter, Judge walked, flied out and grounded out in his first three plate appearances Wednesday night. He walked four times in Tuesday's 5-2 Yankees win, which clinched the AL East title.\n\nIn Monday's series opener, the Rogers Centre crowd initially greeted Judge with a healthy mix of cheers, and there has been a considerable amount of booing after each of his six walks this series – including one intentional pass.\n\nBut the atmosphere was nothing like the electric current that charged through Yankee Stadium last week.\n\nDuring every Judge at-bat in the Bronx, fans stood during his entire plate appearance, aiming cellphone cameras toward home plate and chanting \"M-V-P'' but going eerily silent just before each pitch.\n\n\"Everyone's on the edge of their seat (with) all their focus and energy'' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said then of the crowd's hush. \"And that’s shown up in silence (by) 40-plus thousand people. Because you don’t want to miss something.''\n\nWhat a season: Aaron Judge chases Triple Crown with 60+ home runs\n\nNewsletter: Get the latest sports news straight to your inbox\n\nIn 1961, Maris vaulted past Ruth for the Major League single-season record, which now belongs to Barry Bonds.\n\nDuring his pressure-packed run toward Ruth's mark, Maris was subjected to critics who pointed to Ruth having set the MLB mark of 60 homers in a 154-game season as opposed to the modern 162-game schedule.\n\nBonds, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were superstars during MLB's so-called Steroid Era, linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nNow, Judge and Maris rank seventh for the most homers in single season. The list:\n\nBonds: 73 (2001) McGwire: 70 (1998) Sosa: 66 (1998) McGwire: 65 (1999) Sosa: 64 (2001) Sosa: 63 (1999) Maris, Judge: 61 (1961, 2022)\n\n\"Getting a chance to sit at 60 for a while with the Babe was nice,'' Judge said. \"Now to sit at 61 with another right fielder who hit 61 home runs, and won MVPs and world championships, it’s pretty cool.''\n\nJudge was speaking solely about the Yankees clinching an AL East title with a win Tuesday night and advancing toward the club’s first pennant since 2009.\n\nThe 6-foot-7, 282-pound Judge is also in direct pursuit of an American League Triple Crown, last accomplished by Detroit's Miguel Cabrera in 2012 and achieved just twice in Yankees history, by Lou Gehrig in 1934 and Mantle in 1956.\n\nJudge finished Wednesday night's game fractionally leading the AL with a .313 batting average, just ahead of Minnesota's Luis Arraez, also at .313.\n\n\"It's his season,'' said Anthony Rizzo, among several Yankees who believe Judge is the clear-cut AL MVP choice over the Los Angeles Angels' Shohei Ohtani, having another incredible year as a two-way All-Star, but on a team hopelessly out of contention.\n\n\"(Judge) is just having a special season.''\n\nSince Aug. 5, Judge has played in every Yankees game, and he has batted leadoff in each of the last 17 games.\n\n\"It started out as a need,'' Boone said of placing Judge atop a compromised lineup, due to injuries. \"But as we've gotten whole here, it's continued to make sense.''\n\nBoone recently dubbed Judge as having \"a season for the ages,'' and the best offensive season the Yankees manager has personally witnessed.\n\n\"He's handled it perfectly,'' Boone said of the attention as Judge chased Maris' mark, in a free agent walk year that began with the slugger turning down a $213.5 million, seven-year contract extension.\n\n\"(Being) a great teammate'' and going \"out there and trying to win'' have been Judge's stated goals all year.\n\n\"When that's your sincere focus, it helps keep the game simple,'' Boone said. \"And he does a great job at that.''\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/09/28/yankees-star-judge-hits-61st-home-run-ties-maris-al-record/50784419/", "title": "Yankees star Judge hits 61st home run, ties Maris' AL record", "text": "AP\n\nTORONTO (AP) — Aaron Judge had gone seven games since his last home run, 34 plate appearances of fans quieting to a hush and snapping photos with every pitch.\n\nThen with the score tied in the seventh inning on Wednesday night, he drove a 94.5 mph belt-high sinker to left, a no doubt rocket. He had tied Roger Maris’ American League record of 61 home runs in a season, what many fans consider baseball’s “clean” standard for the sport.\n\nJudge’s two-run homer lifted the Yankees to an 8-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays and brought relief to the 6-foot-7 slugger, who admitted having to try to block out distraction.\n\n“Getting a chance to sit at 60 for a while there with the Babe was nice,” he said, “but getting a chance to now sit at 61 with another Yankee right fielder that hit 61 home runs and MVPs, world champions, this is pretty cool.”\n\nJudge has seven games to break the record, starting with a series opener against Baltimore at Yankee Stadium on Friday night.\n\nHis 117.4 mph drive off left-hander Tim Mayza (8-1) snapped a 3-3 tie and took just 3.8 seconds to land 394 feet from the plate. Judge watched the ball clank off the front of the stands, just below two fans who reached over a railing and tried for a catch. He pumped an arm just before reaching first and exchanged a slap with coach Travis Chapman.\n\n“Definitely some relief getting to 61. You try not to think about it, but it creeps into your head,” Judge said. “I was hoping it would get over the fence. I didn’t know at first. I didn’t want to be standing at home plate when it hits the wall.”\n\nThe ball dropped into Toronto’s bullpen and was picked up by Blue Jays bullpen coach Matt Buschmann. He and Toronto closer Jordan Romano held onto the ball before turning it over to Yankees reliever Zack Britton, who made sure it got to Judge.\n\n“We just wanted to get it in the right hands,” Romano said, prompting Judge to call it ”a classy move.”\n\nJudge’s mother Patty and Roger Maris Jr. rose and hugged from front-row seats. Judge appeared to point toward them after rounding second base.\n\n“She’s been with me through it all, that’s for sure,” Judge said. “From the Little League days, from getting me ready for school, taking me to my first couple of practices and games, being there for my first professional game, being there for my debut, and then now getting the chance to be here for this, this is so special. We’re not done yet.\"\n\nJudge was congratulated by the entire Yankees team, who gave him hugs after he crossed the plate.\n\n“He’s as beloved as they come,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “I think everyone is just so excited for him.”\n\nJudge moved past the 60 home runs Babe Ruth hit in 1927, which had stood as the major league mark until Maris broke it in 1961. All three stars reached those huge numbers playing for the Yankees.\n\nMaris hit No. 61 for the Yankees on Oct. 1, 1961, against Boston pitcher Tracy Stallard. Maris’ mark has been exceeded six times, but all have been tainted by the stench of steroids. Mark McGwire hit 70 home runs in 1998 and 65 the following year, and Bonds topped him with 73 in 2001. Sammy Sosa had 66, 65 and 63 during a four-season span starting in 1998.\n\nMcGwire admitted using banned steroids, while Bonds and Sosa denied knowingly using performing-enhancing drugs. Major League Baseball started testing with penalties for PEDs in 2004.\n\n“He should be revered for being the actual single-season home run champ. That’s really who he is if hits 62,” Maris Jr. said. “I think baseball needs to look at the records. And I think baseball should do something.”\n\nJudge is hitting .313 with 130 RBIs, also the top totals in the AL. He has a chance to become the first AL Triple Crown winner since Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera in 2012.\n\nFans fixated on him in the Bronx during the last homestand.\n\n“It’s tough at times at Yankee Stadium, for sure, when you got 45,000 standing on their feet for every pitch,” Judge said. “You hear the noise. You hear the buzz. But when I step out on that field, when I step in the box, all the hype, all the noise, it goes aside and you got to focus on competing.”\n\nHe became just the fifth player to hold a share of the AL season record. Nap Lajoie hit 14 in the AL’s first season as a major league in 1901, and Philadelphia Athletics teammate Socks Seabold had 16 the next year, a mark that stood until Babe Ruth hit 29 in 1919. Ruth set the record four times in all, with 54 in 1920, 59 in 1921 and 60 in 1927, a mark that stood until Maris’ 61 in 1961.\n\nMaris was at 35 in July 1961 during the first season each team’s schedule increased from 154 games to 162, and baseball Commissioner Ford Frick ruled if anyone topped Ruth in more than 154 games “there would have to be some distinctive mark in the record books to show that Babe Ruth’s record was set under a 154-game schedule.”\n\nThat “distinctive mark” became known as an “asterisk” and it remained until Sept. 4, 1991, when a committee on statistical accuracy chaired by Commissioner Fay Vincent voted unanimously to recognize Maris as the record holder.\n\nAfter the game, plate umpire Brian O'Nora presented Judge with the lineup card. Judge isn’t sure what he will give the Hall of Fame.\n\n“They took my home run bat from my first game and I went in a massive slump after that,\" he said, \"so I don’t know if I’ll be giving them anything just yet.”\n\nJudge and Maris Jr. met for the first time outside the Yankees clubhouse following the game. Maris Jr. has attended every game since Judge hit No. 60 on Sept. 20.\n\n“It’s the ninth day I’ve been here,” Maris Jr. said. “He wears 99. Dad wears 9. It’s just kind of weird the way it all kind of went together. So now I’m thinking, OK, we’re going to go to Yankee Stadium and he’ll probably hit 62 on Oct. 1, when dad hit his 61st.”\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/09/28/judge-ties-maris-al-mark-with-61st-hr-lifts-yanks-over-jays/50784601/", "title": "Judge ties Maris AL mark with 61st HR, lifts Yanks over Jays", "text": "AP\n\nTORONTO (AP) — When Tim Mayza made a mistake pitch, Aaron Judge made sure the Blue Jays left-hander wound up on the wrong end of history.\n\nJudge tied Roger Maris’ American League record of 61 home runs in a season with a tiebreaking, two-run drive in the seventh inning that lifted the New York Yankees over the Toronto Blue Jays 8-3 on Wednesday night.\n\nMayza said he was trying to attack Judge with sinkers in the hopes of inducing a ground ball, but missed his spot.\n\n“Just one too many good pitches over the plate to a really good hitter,” Mayza said.\n\nThe 30-year-old slugger drove a 94.5 mph belt-high sinker with a full-count from Mayza (8-1) over the left-field fence at Rogers Centre.

The New York Yankees slugger had just tied Roger Maris for the American League, and what some fans consider the “real,” single-season home run record.\n\nNo controversy. No debate. No questions. Right?\n\nNo way.\n\nAs anyone who follows the sport knows, baseball has a unique and sometimes infuriating habit of being unable to completely enjoy its biggest moments. Instead of running from that reality, MLB appears to be embracing the chaos of debate.\n\nJudge's chase for 61 this season and, to a lesser extent, Cardinals star Albert Pujols' quest for 700 career homers, have brought the game's prodigious record books and historical debates back to the forefront.\n\nEven if Judge hits No. 62 in the next seven games, MLB's records clearly state Barry Bonds is the record-holder with 73 in 2001. Mark McGwire hit 70 in 1998 and 65 a year later. Sammy Sosa topped 61 three times in a four-year span from 1998 to 2001.\n\nThose numbers came during baseball's performance-enhancing drug era.\n\nA sizable chunk of fans believe the numbers from that era are tainted. Roger Maris Jr. — who was in attendance in Toronto on Wednesday — is one of them, saying it's Judge who is the real home run king.\n\nThe 30-year-old Judge has an impeccable reputation in an era during which each player is tested for PEDs during spring training and is subject to random tests during the season and offseason.\n\n“He should be revered for being the actual single-season home run champ,” the younger Maris said after Judge matched his dad's record-setting total with the Yankees in 1961. “I mean, that’s really who he is if he hits 62, and I think that’s what needs to happen.\n\n\"I think baseball needs to look at the records and I think baseball should do something.”\n\nThat's probably not going to happen. MLB has tried to dance around the steroid debate by stating Judge is the American League record-holder, which is absolutely true. Bonds, McGwire and Sosa all played in the National League.\n\nBut since when has anyone really cared about AL records?\n\nThe answer is fans usually don't — unless it can be conveniently used as a euphemism for “real.”\n\nFor its part, MLB doesn't appear eager to embrace the use of asterisks. Neither does the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\n\nMLB has been down that road before. Maris' record had an asterisk attached to it for 30 years because he played a 162-game schedule instead of 154 like Babe Ruth did when he hit 60. It remained until Sept. 4, 1991, when a committee on statistical accuracy chaired by former commissioner Fay Vincent voted unanimously to recognize Maris as the record-holder.\n\nJosh Rawitch, the president of the Hall of Fame, said his organization's role is to stay as agnostic as possible.\n\n“What we just try to focus on is documenting history, regardless of the storylines that may be surrounding it,” Rawitch said \"We'll absolutely have artifacts from the current home run chases, whether it's Pujols or Judge or any others, but at the same time, we also tell the history of 1998 and we have areas of the museum that focus on the PED time period.\n\n“I'd say we don't tend to inject too many opinions into it.”\n\nFans, of course, will be happy to fill that void.\n\nBaseball's record book is the most expansive in the major American sports. Stats on baseball-reference.com go back to 1871 and have been recently updated to include stats from the Negro Leagues, which began to dissolve one year after Jackie Robinson became MLB’s first Black player with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.\n\nA lot of things in baseball have changed over 150 years. The historical arguments aren't going away anytime soon.\n\n“In general, baseball has always been about debates and comparing eras,\" Rawitch said. \"Whether it's Aaron Judge to Roger Maris or Shohei Ohtani to Babe Ruth, I think that's part of what makes the sport pretty special.”\n\n____\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York and freelancer Ian Harrison in Toronto contributed to this story.\n\n____\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/opinions/aaron-judge-roger-maris-major-league-baseball-pearlman/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Aaron Judge had a season for the ages.

The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nHistory was made Wednesday night, when Yankee slugger Aaron Judge hit his 61st home run.\n\nHow do I know history was made? Because Major League Baseball has devoted much of the season to reminding us that history was about to be made. It’s been everywhere – all over MLB.com, discussed by the MLB Network talking heads, thrown up and down, left and right by the myriad broadcast booths. History will be made! History should be made! The history that is destined to be made will be amazing history, because, eh, it’s historic.\n\nJeff Pearlman Courtesy Paul Olkowski\n\nThe words themselves (“history” and “historic”) have served as masks for the reality that – by allowing rampant steroid and human growth hormone usage throughout the 1990s and early 2000s – Major League Baseball ruined and disgraced its own record book, and Judge’s shot merely (yawn) tied the American League home run mark.\n\nAnd, if there’s one thing we’ve learned from former President Donald Trump, repeating a line pays dividends. The words somehow embed themselves into our psyches until – after enough exposure – we consider the thought both original and irrefutable.\n\nOr, put a different way: Major League Baseball desperately wants you to believe Judge’s 61st homer is historic.\n\nAnd the unfortunate truth is: it is not. And the reason why is Major League Baseball itself.\n\nWhen the Yankees’ Roger Maris eclipsed Babe Ruth’s single-season home run mark with 61 dingers in 1961, it was thought by many to be one of the great achievements in sports lore. Yes, there were (as there always are) critics and skeptics: Maris’ 61 homers came over 161 games, while Ruth’s took place in 154. The lord’s year of 1961 was also an expansion season, meaning additional teams with thinned-out pitching staffs.\n\nBut, as the decades passed, Maris’ 61 gained in heft. You could be a loyal Yankee fan, a casual Angels fan, an indifferent non-fan – and odds are you were still familiar with 61. That’s how baseball milestones used to work – Joe DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak wasn’t merely baseball history, but American history. The same went for Hank Aaron’s 755 career homers, for Maris’ 61. They mattered. They were important. They stood the test of time.\n\nAnd then, back in the 1990s, something happened. At the time, I was a baseball writer for Sports Illustrated, somewhat bemused but relatively clueless as to why guys who once boasted pretzel-stick physiques promptly reported to spring training looking like a cross pollination of Evander Holyfield and Michelangelo’s David. When, in 1998, Maris’ 61 was surpassed by not one, but two too-good-to-be-true “stars,” Mark McGwire (who hit 70 home runs) and Sammy Sosa (a more modest 66), a nation rose and celebrated and deemed the men gifts from the gods. My own publication named McGwire and Sosa co-Sportsmen of the Year, and plastered their hulking figures atop the magazine cover, clad in togas.\n\nBefore long, as more and more players underwent dramatic bodily transformations, talk turned to performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) like steroids and human growth hormone. A backup catcher would gripe to a reporter (off the record) about the uneven playing field. A blatant juicer would explain away his muscular additions by citing “a juice diet” (wink, wink) or “these amazing date shakes my mom makes.”\n\nRoger Maris, of the New York Yankees, batting during a game against the Detroit Tigers in 1960. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nInside press boxes, we’d discuss how what unfolded before us was increasingly impossible to believe. Baltimore’s Brady Anderson, who previously had a career-high season home run total of 21, raised eyebrows (and still-unanswered questions) when he hit 50. What occurred to make Sosa’s body more and more like champion bodybuilder Lee Haney? Why does that 35-year-old second baseman have acne coating his back?\n\nWhen, in 2001, San Francisco’s Barry Bonds broke McGwire’s record with 73 homers, we all knew it was nonsense. Not some of us – all of us. Here was a man, at age 36, with muscles growing atop muscles and a skull size that – as I reported in my Bonds biography, “Love Me Hate Me” – had actually increased in recent years (this is physically impossible without the help of HGH). I was in San Francisco the night Bonds passed McGwire, and it was…stupid. Just so damn stupid. The local fans stood and cheered, but it felt flat and meaningless and a bit embarrassing. Like spotting a magician’s fake thumb.\n\nAll the while, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association did … nothing. Home runs were great business, so team owners shrugged off PED suspicions while the union made clear it would refuse to have its players be tested in any sort of methodical, impactful manner. The result was temporary long ball excitement, followed by the quiet-yet-crushing realization (by most involved in the game) that the record book had been rendered meaningless. Trivia: How many career home runs did Bonds hit? (I wrote his biography and have no idea).\n\nFinally, in 2002, the league and union agreed to survey testing, followed by urine testing for PED in 2004, banned amphetamine testing in 2006 and blood testing for HGH in 2012. It’s far from perfect, but it’s an improvement. “We constantly improve that (testing) program,” Rob Manfred, the Major League commissioner, said in 2016. “The science gets better. And it is true that the windows of detection on certain substances have been lengthened – windows of detection, meaning the periods of time in which you can detect a substance in somebody’s body have been improved. It’s just science getting better.”\n\nWith Wednesday’s blast in Toronto, Judge and Maris are tied for the seventh most single-season home runs of all time – behind Bonds, two big McGwire years and three (yes, three) preposterous long-ball assaults from Sosa. Which is why, when I heard Michael Kay, the Yankees’ fantastic announcer, celebrate Judge’s moment with, “He’s been chasing history! And now he makes it!” well, I felt nothing but sadness.\n\nOn the one hand, the 30-year-old slugger has had a season for the ages – he’s all but locked up the AL MVP award, and at this moment is in line to become the Yankees’ first triple crown winner since Mickey Mantle in 1956.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

The wait will extend into a rain-threatened weekend.\n\nJudge went 1 for 2 with a pair of walks as the Baltimore Orioles beat the New York Yankees 2-1 on Friday night.\n\n“It was a pretty electric atmosphere,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “I actually found myself kind of nervous for his first at-bat, maybe just being all focused on it.”\n\nOne game after tying the American League home run record of 61 that Yankees star Roger Maris set in 1961, Judge struck out in the first inning, singled in the third and walked in the sixth against Jordan Lyles (12-11), then was intentionally walked in the eighth by rookie Félix Bautista.\n\n“It was an amazing atmosphere. Probably not an empty seat out there,” Lyles said. “Everyone’s standing up. Everyone’s getting ready for something possible, something great.\"\n\nFans among the 47,583 on a chilly autumn night buzzed for each for the 21 pitches to Judge. His next chance comes Saturday, the 61st anniversary of Maris' No. 61.\n\n“After every swing he took, you could hear audible gasps from the whole entire crowd,” Orioles rookie catcher Adley Rutschman said. “Every time he swung and just a big buildup, so that was pretty cool.”\n\nJudge has six games left: two this weekend against the Orioles, then four at Texas that end the regular season.\n\nJudge also is bidding for the first Triple Crown since Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera in 2012. Judge leads the AL with 130 RBIs and trails Minnesota’s Luis Arraez in the batting race by .3147 to .3141.\n\nThe night was filled with bad news for the Yankees, already assured the AL East title and getting ready for their Division Series opener on Oct. 11.\n\nReliever Zack Britton, just back last week from Tommy John surgery, threw a tiebreaking wild pitch in the sixth inning and immediately left with left arm fatigue.\n\nAll-Star closer Clay Holmes had a cortisone injection Thursday and likely won't pitch in a game until the playoffs.\n\n“There’s no use crying about what you do or don’t have,” Boone said. “You got to make the most of what you do. And the reality is we still have a lot of really talented guys down there.”\n\nGiancarlo Stanton went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts and is 1 for 21 with 13 strikeouts in his last five games. He is hitting .140 in 100 at-bats since returning Aug. 25 from a month out with left Achilles tendinitis.\n\n“I’m hoping it’s still just a timing thing that he’s working through,” Boone said. “He's struggling to find it right now.”\n\nBaltimore (81-76) was eliminated from playoff contention about two hours after the final out when Seattle beat Oakland. The Orioles assured they will stop a streak of five consecutive losing seasons.\n\nRyan Mountcastle singled in a run in the first for his 84th RBI. Oswaldo Cabrera tied the score in the fifth with his fifth home run since his debut on Aug. 17.\n\nAfter going 52-110, the Orioles could become the first team since at least 1900 with a winning record one year after losing 110 or more.\n\n“It just means that we exceeded expectations and that our guys fought all year long,\" manager Brandon Hyde said. \"There’s a lot of appreciation for what these guys have done this year around the league and it’s well deserved.”\n\nMOUND MATTERS\n\nLyles matched his career high for wins in 2019, allowing four hits in seven-plus innings. He tied his season high with nine strikeouts and walked one.\n\nDomingo Germán (2-4) walked his first two batters in the sixth and retired Mountcastle on a groundout, Britton walked Gunnar Henderson and then threw a pitch to pinch-hitter Jesús Aguilar that went to the backstop, and he failed to cover the plate. Rookie DL Hall pitched a perfect ninth with two strikeouts for his first save since 2019 at Class A.\n\nHE\"S BACK\n\nDJ LeMahieu played seven innings at third base and went 0 for 3 in his first game for the Yankees since a stint on the IL caused by an inflamed right second tie. He was in a 2-for-38 slide through Sept. 4 before going on the IL.\n\nSPEEDING\n\nCedric Mullins stole two bases and tied teammate Jorge Mateo for the AL lead with 34.\n\nWEB GEMS\n\nGold Glove CF Harrison Bader sprinted to make a diving backhand catch against Mullins on the left-center warning track in front of the 399-foot sign for the final out of the fifth inning.\n\nHECTOR LÓPEZ REMEMBERED\n\nHector López, a member of the Yankees’ 1961 and ’62 World Series champions, has died at age 93, MLB.com reported, citing his son, Darrol. The Yankees held a moment of silence before the game. López hit .269 with 136 homers and 591 RBIs over 12 seasons for the Kansas City Athletics (1955-59) and Yankees (1959-66). He became the first Black manager at Triple-A in 1969 with the Buffalo Bisons, the Washington Senators’ top farm team.\n\nTRAINER’S ROOM\n\nYankees: INF-OF Matt Carpenter, sidelined since breaking his left toot on Aug. 8, took batting practice and could be activated for next week’s series at Texas, though the Yankees are leaning toward having him report to a camp at Somerset, New Jersey, where he could get more at-bats ahead of the Division Series ... LHP Wandy Peralta, sidelined since Sept. 18 with back tightness, threw a bullpen and will throw another Sunday before the Yankees decide whether to activate him. ... RHP Frankie Montas, out since Sept. 16 with right shoulder inflammation, likely will start throwing Saturday ... OF Andrew Benintendi (broken wrist) is scheduled to take swings Saturday but not against pitchers. ... RHP Michael King said Mets medical director Dr. David Altchek determined his UCL was intact.

Perez said the office did not have additional details on where the deaths took place or information on the deceased individuals.\n\nAdditionally, more than 2.3 million customers had no power Thursday evening, according to PowerOutage.US, and some drinking water systems have broken down completely or have boil notices in effect.\n\n“This could be the deadliest hurricane in Florida’s history,” President Joe Biden said Thursday. “The numbers are still unclear, but we’re hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life.”\n\nFlorida State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis agreed, telling CNN Ian is shaping up to be the largest natural disaster in state history.\n\nA man takes photos Thursday, September 29, of boats that were damaged by Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers, Florida.

Andrew West/USA Today Network Prev Next\n\nFlorida residents assessing storm damage Thursday found collapsed buildings, ongoing flooding, downed power lines and impassable roads, including a key bridge connecting Sanibel and Captiva islands to Florida’s mainland that has been washed out.\n\nApproximately 40 people were taken off the Sanibel Thursday, 12 of whom were injured. Due to the damage to the causeway, first-responders are only able to get to the island by boat.\n\n“The island is in rough shape,” said Sanibel Police Chief Bill Dalton. “The power infrastructure is severely damaged. I would be surprised that there’s a single structure on the island that hasn’t been impacted by the storm.”\n\nSanibel, in Lee County, “got hit with really biblical storm surge,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Lee County Utilities issued a systemwide boil-water notice for all customers effective immediately due to the impacts of the hurricane, according to county officials.\n\n“I just literally got out of a helicopter where I was able to take a complete tour of the entire county and there’s really no words that I can say to tell you what I’ve seen,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marcino said on CNN Thursday. “The Fort Myers Beach area, buildings, major, major homes and buildings completely washed away with vehicles in the water, vehicles in the bay, boats are upside down.”\n\nDeSantis said Thursday night that he surveyed damage in Charlotte County and Lee County.\n\n“Some of the damage was indescribable,” DeSantis said, adding he saw cars and homes floating in water. “The most significant damage I saw was on Fort Myers Beach. Some of the homes were wiped out, some were just concrete slabs.”\n\nAbout 200 people have been rescued by the Fort Myers Fire Department, Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN Thursday night. The search and rescue operations appear to have come to an end in the city, according to Anderson.\n\nAnderson said city has not had any fatalities. On Friday, the city will open “several food, water and ice distribution centers,” Anderson said.\n\nA boil water notice is in effect in the city of Fort Myers, according to a government statement posted Thursday. “This applies to water consumed for drinking, washing dishes, and brushing teeth among other uses,” the statement said.\n\nLee County – which includes Fort Myers — issued a boil water notice Wednesday.\n\nOfficials in Kissimmee – just south of Orlando – told CNN Thursday evening “it’s been a worst-case scenario” for the city.\n\n“One of our hospitals here, Osceola Regional – which is a trauma two-level center – was surrounded by water this morning. Our rescues could not make entry,” Bill Litton, Osceola County’s emergency management director, told CNN Thursday evening.\n\nEmergency responders conducted rescues by air, land and boat to save people trapped by the floodwaters. As of 2 p.m. Thursday, more than 500 people have been rescued in Charlotte and Lee counties, the Florida Department of Emergency Management said in a tweet. In Orlando, emergency responders navigating a street-turned-river told CNN they had conducted at least 200 rescues since early Thursday morning.\n\nThe US Coast Guard’s 7th District rescued 68 people Thursday, which is included in the 700 state-wide rescues the governor reported Thursday, according to Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson.\n\nFlorida First Lady, Casey DeSantis, said Thursday she launched the Florida Disaster Fund to assist in rescue efforts. The fund raised more than $10 million within 24 hours of its launch, she said.\n\nThe rescue efforts come a day after Ian came ashore near Cayo Costa as a Category 4 hurricane with 150-mph winds, making it one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall on Florida’s west coast. The storm cut a path from near Fort Myers in the southwest across to the eastern part of the state, and its combination of wind, rain and storm surge caused flooding that DeSantis called “a 500-year flood event.”\n\nHere are the latest developments:\n\n• Hurricane warnings for South Carolina: Hurricane warnings are in place for the entire coast of South Carolina. In addition, Tropical Storm warnings are in place from Jupiter, Florida, up the east coast to Duck, North Carolina.\n\n• Record-high storm surges: Ian’s storm surge hit up to 12 feet in some places in western Florida. On Thursday morning, a storm surge warning – meaning life-threatening surges could hit – was in place for a coastal stretch from northeastern Florida into an area north of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n• More than a foot of rainfall: Lehigh Acres near Fort Myers got 14.42 inches of rain, and Warm Mineral Springs near Port Charlotte got 11.05 inches. Up to 30 inches of rain may have fallen in parts of Florida by storm’s end, forecasters say.\n\nRescue teams navigate waters to free trapped residents\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 04:14 - Source: CNN 'I know we all look crazy': Resident shares why she didn't leave before storm\n\nSunrise on Thursday gave Florida residents their first look at Ian’s overnight wrath – and the results were not pretty.\n\nAs Ian pushed inland, ocean water piled up onshore Wednesday – 12 feet in some places – and 150-mph winds whipped. 911 call centers in several counties were inundated.\n\nScott Carlos, who rode out the storm in his fourth-story Fort Myers condo, saw waves of water crash into homes across the street, up to their roofs, he said. Roads are littered Thursday with washed-out vehicles, he told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“Everybody’s garages basically just gave out. … Cars are everywhere, smashed up in the street. There’s debris everywhere,” he said.\n\nAs Ian continued moving northeast, heavy rain and flooding has been reported in the Orlando area, where 8 to 12 inches of rain had already fallen and up to 4 more inches of rain was expected. In Orlando, a reporter for CNN affiliate WESH rescued a woman after seeing her trying to drive through floodwaters, carrying her on his back in waist-high water to dry ground, WESH video showed.\n\nIn Fort Myers – where about 90% of electric customers were without power – Fire Chief Tracy McMillion told residents to stay inside, and to stay hopeful. “We’re coming for you, be encouraged,” he told residents Wednesday night.\n\nThe city’s downtown streets were flooded Wednesday with almost 4 feet of water, Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN.\n\nThomas Podgorny was trapped in his two-story home in Fort Myers with three others, watching vehicles float away outside and worrying about others who did not evacuate, he told CNN Wednesday evening.\n\n“I’ve lost my house. I have water and gas flowing through my bottom floor,” he said. “My neighbors have very little breathing room in their one-story house.”\n\nOne couple there was trapped in their home when the ceiling caved in.\n\n“Something is dripping on me,” Belinda Collins recalled her partner saying. “He got up, and the ceiling – the family room ceiling – caved in.” They called 911 and were waiting for a call back about when it would be safe to leave, they said.\n\nIn Port Charlotte, the storm tore off the roof above a hospital’s ICU with patients inside Wednesday, forcing staff to move them to a post-operation recovery area, Dr. Birgit Bodine, an internal medicine specialist at the facility, told CNN.\n\nWater gushed down stairwells to other floors, and other patients needed to be moved either to beds in hallways or to a different, dry wing of the hospital.\n\n“We still have water in hallways that we’re still sloshing through,” but patients are safe in dry beds, and as many as possible were transferred to the dry wing, Bodine told CNN Thursday morning.\n\nPeople in nearby Collier County, which includes Naples, were also trapped in their homes, calling for help, after electricity went out. In Naples, half the streets were not passable Wednesday because of high water, officials said.\n\n“Some are reporting life threatening medical emergencies in deep water. We will get to them first. Some are reporting water coming into their house but not life threatening. They will have to wait. Possibly until the water recedes,” the Collier County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday evening.\n\n9/28 5pm EDT: #Ian will cross the FL peninsula and likely bring life-threatening storm surge on Thursday & Friday along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, & South Carolina, where a storm surge warning is in effect. Residents should follow any advice from local officials. pic.twitter.com/Q8eZ9PfVpg — NHC Storm Surge (@NHC_Surge) September 28, 2022\n\nComplicating matters, neighboring Lee County’s 911 system was down and calls were being rerouted to Collier County, Chief Stephanie Spell told CNN. “At this point the majority of our 911 calls are water rescues,” Spell added.\n\nIn Sarasota County, sheriff’s deputies and fire crews had a backlog Thursday morning of more than 500 calls for help to respond to, the county sheriff’s office said. Deputies were “responding to the highest priority calls” that still were in the queue Thursday morning, the office said.\n\nResidents in parts of Pasco County were also asked to boil their tap water as the water distribution system in the area lost pressure and a water main ruptured.\n\nIn Manatee County, residents were asked to limit flushing, showering, doing dishes and laundry due to power outages impacting the system.\n\nIn Cape Coral, authorities were getting reports of significant structural damage across the city, Ryan Lamb, the city’s fire chief and emergency management director, told CNN.\n\nDeSantis has asked President Biden to approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also asking Biden to grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian’s landfall.\n\nSouth Carolina braces for incoming storm\n\nWith Ian again a Category 1 hurricane, a state of emergency was declared in Charleston County Thursday.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to hit South Carolina Friday near or just after these high tide times in the 11 a.m. hour. It’s currently located about 240 miles south of Charleston and is moving toward the north-northeast at 10 mph, according to the hurricane center.\n\n“We are looking at an early afternoon landfall,” said CNN Meteorologist Tom Sater. “The entire southeastern coastline is pretty much going to be inundated with a surge again. It’s not going to be what we saw in southwest Florida, but in Charleston you toss in … 7 feet of a surge, the entire downtown historic area is flooded.”\n\nCoastal cities along the East Coast like Jacksonville, Florida, Savannah, Georgia, and Wilmington, North Carolina, could see anywhere from 2-7 feet of storm surge, Sater said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the biggest variable with Hurricane Ian may be “human reaction” to the storm.\n\n“It’s people failing to take the necessary precautions. That’s the real danger that we have, is human error,” McMaster said. “Doesn’t make much difference whether this comes in at hurricane strength or below at storm strength or somewhere on the line, cause it’s going to be blowing strong winds and it’s going to be all over the state at different levels.”\n\nThe US Geological Survey coastal change forecasts released Thursday predicts waves and surges will likely cause 11% of South Carolina’s dunes and 1% of Georgia’s dunes to be continuously covered by ocean water.\n\n“This is the most severe type of storm effect on coastal beaches, with flooding behind the dunes that may impact coastal communities,” a news release from the USGS said.\n\nAdditionally, 43% of South Carolina’s dunes and 24% of Georgia’s dunes are expected to be overwashed by Ian. This means sand will be pushed inland, resulting in changes to the coastal landscape that could block roadways.\n\n“Overwash can reduce the height of protective sand dunes, alter beach profiles and leave areas behind the dunes more vulnerable to future storms,” the release said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had the incorrect location for storm witness Scott Carlos.

Its reach extended more than 100 miles inland. Savage winds tore trees from the sandy Florida soil, blocking roads, smashing roofs and taking lives – four in Gadsden and three Jackson counties. The death toll could rise as search and recovery effects kick in.\n\nOn the coast, a double-digit storm surge roared ashore. People ordered to leave didn't. Miraculously, there were no deaths in Franklin and Wakulla counties. Homes and businesses are damaged, main roads are all but gone, but community spirit remains intact.\n\nUnaccustomed to the destructive rage of hurricanes, inland communities like Calhoun and Liberty counties were cut off for days – roads were blocked and all communication was cut off.\n\nFive days on, the extent of the damage and the recovery time is unknown. What follows is a blow-by-blow account of how an unlikely hurricane laid waste to our communities.\n\nTwo years after Hurricane Hermine forced this community to dust off and fine tune disaster preparation and damage restoration plans, Michael swept through.\n\nFierce winds knocked out power to almost the entire grid of 117,00 customers. Downed trees blocked more than 300 roads. Businesses, colleges, schools and state and local government offices shuttered for days.\n\nMichael carved a path of destruction as it swung less than 100 miles to the west. More wind than rain, it left in its aftermath wires hung limp, utility poles snapped in half.\n\nDamage is indiscriminate and random. A red rose remains on its stem, while 70-foot pines tossed about by Hurricane Michael's winds toppled like dominoes. Yards, streets, roads and highways are blocked with majestic oaks, their tree trunks peeled down to the ground.\n\nColumn:'It's just stuff': Michael's degrees of destruction put it in perspective for Tallahassee\n\nAnalysis:Was Tallahassee lucky in its meeting with Hurricane Michael? 'A resounding yes'\n\nThe ubiquitous bucket trucks pass as if on parade. An army of linemen. Reinforcements from as far as Louisiana and Tennessee. Parking lots buzz with shoppers. They picked apart grocery shelves, ice by the pallet, water by the truckload and beer – if only for refreshment – by the case. The commodities of recovery, the commerce after the storm.\n\nAt nightfall, the darkness cloaks the landscape revealing a brilliant starry sky. Black holes sit where marquees used to be. Michael packed unprecedented power; more than 97 percent of Tallahasseeans were left without it.\n\nThe recovery continues apace. Schools and universities reopen on Monday. Stop lights blink again, the \"OPEN\" neon lights of businesses indicate things are returning to normal.\n\nAnd a shred of optimism. As of late Saturday, tens of thousands have had their power restored.\n\nAn hour north of where Hurricane Michael made landfall, 140 mph winds undressed buildings, stripped brick facade from storefronts, and shredded gas stations and pulverized homes.\n\nA Confederate monument was sliced in half. Buildings and shops surrounding the courthouse square were partially reduced to rubble.\n\n\"It was like everybody's been saying – like a bomb went off,\" said Nathan Hooppell, whose house roof was damaged in the Indian Springs neighborhood. As the storm came through, Hooppell and his brother Nick feared for their lives.\n\nOthers were less fortunate. Jackson County authorities confirmed three Michael related deaths, including a man in Alford who was killed by a falling tree.\n\nThe power grid was crippled throughout the 800-square-mile rural county. Out of fuel, Jackson Hospital transported critical-care patients to nearby Dothan, Alabama, according to Rodney Andreasen, director of Emergency Management.\n\nAndreasen urged patience.\n\nColumn:After a collision with Hurricane Michael, an obituary for the Marianna I knew | Mark Hinson\n\nThe Florida National Guard and various state agencies were tasked with the recovery effort. The Convoy of Hope, a charity that was just assisting Hurricane Florence victims in the Carolinas, was handing out bags of groceries and cases of water at a local WalMart.\n\nA big challenge was clearing blocked roads and convincing local motorists to say off the roads to allow the cleanup to proceed more quickly. Jackson County Fire and Rescue Chief Mark Foreman reported a lot of vehicle crashes and injuries at night.\n\nHe urged people who want to help to donate money to the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and other established nonprofits. Putting Jackson County back together again won't happen overnight, Foreman cautioned.\n\n\"It's going to take time. But we're working 24/7,\" he pledged. \"So everyone needs to know that help is on the way.\"\n\nWind gusts of up to 100 mph and a record 11 ½- to 12-foot storm surge caused record coastal flooding leaving a soggy, muddy mess for homes, businesses and government offices.\n\nAccording to a preliminary assessment by the Wakulla County Sheriff's Office, there was significant damage to all non-elevated structures within storm surge impact area in places like St. Marks, Panacea, Carrabelle.\n\nIn St. Marks, water invaded homes, business and even City Hall, causing the worst surge in the memory of longtime residents. Several people had to be plucked from rising storm waters.\n\nWCSO said due to the extent of damages and debris, entry into the affected areas will be restricted to residents, property owners, invited guests, emergency personnel and recovery crews.\n\nThe cleanup will be long. On Thursday, store employees were mopping, pressure washing, and picking up garbage. At a grocery store, all the sugar had spilled. Books were waterlogged and bloated from the moisture. River sludge an inch thick invaded all the restaurants.\n\n“We experienced estimated sustained wind speeds of up to Hurricane force with gusts up to 100 mph,\" according to a WCSO statement on Facebook.\n\nThe hurricane force winds took a toll on the county's rich foliage, said Lt. Chris Savary, spokesman for the Wakulla County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"We had well over a 1000 trees just on lines,\" Savary said. \"We stopped counting after a while.\"\n\nTrees knocked out communications, blocked roads and entangled power lines, cutting power.\n\nThis resulted in 100 percent power outage in Wakulla County, which is served by both Duke Energy and Talquin Electric Co-op. More than 13,000 homes and business served by either Duke Energy or Talquin Electric are without power.\n\nHomes, businesses and livelihoods lay in ruins after Hurricane Michael pounded the historic fishing village and tourist destination. Ankle deep water covered streets in the commercial downtown shopping areas even as the monster storm was hours from making landfall farther west.\n\nTwo-Mile Seafood, Steve Nash and Dee Cook's three-decade-old seafood distribution company, was in shambles by the time the frothing storm waters receded. Across U.S. Highway 98, boats ripped from their moorings during the storm, rested on their sides.\n\nThe residential neighborhoods were largely spared flooding and damage except for the occasional downed trees on roofs.\n\nMore from Apalachicola:\n\nDanny Getter, his wife and kids and other families weathered the storm at their house on Fourth Street in Apalachicola. With winds that shook his roof and pushed the back door, Michael was the strongest storm he has ever experienced.\n\n\"Never like this,\" he said.\"I will never stay in a Category 4 ever again.\"\n\nBut others are already looking forward as the cleanup begins. Apalachicola is known for its seafood and annual fall seafood festival.\n\nDreamal Worthen, a professor in the Florida A&M's School of Agriculture and Food Sciences who grew up in Oyster City, has a family home there. She said the community is still hoping to have the Seafood Festival, which is usually the first Saturday in November.\n\nWorthen said the festival is very important to the city's economy.\n\n\"It opens up the community and generates money for the city, for the hotels, for seafood workers and people who make crafts,\" she said before heading down to her hometown from Tallahassee Saturday.\n\nAuthorities feared the worse for the houses and inhabitants of this barrier island. Much of it sits at or below sea level. Michael's project 10-to-12-foot storm surge could submerge much of the weekend vacationers retreat.\n\nDuring the storm, the surge connected the waters of the bay and the gulf. Video on social media showed waves moving through the yards. Aerial photos illustrated the damage done to houses on the gulf side of the island.\n\nSome residents stayed despite orders to evacuate. They survived with harrowing tales of the fierce winds and angry water.\n\nBob Bogursky waited out the storm with his wife Sharon in their house on the east side of the island. They lost some shingles and siding but gained some wisdom about trying to test fate and the power of Mother Nature.\n\n\"She said she would never do it again,\" Bogursky said of his wife. It was too harrowing.\"\n\nLocated right on the Gulf in the direct path of Michael with its more than 140 mph winds and record storm surge, Mexico Beach was left in a heap of shattered lumber, trashed household items and broken hearts and altered lives.\n\nAfter the winds died down Wednesday, residents emerged to find homes gone, apartment buildings smashed like match-stick houses, skeletal remains of wood.\n\nVideos from ground zero:\n\nMichael scattered the tools and conveniences of everyday life all along U.S 98. Spoons, Knies, pots and pans, power tools, shovels, chairs and clothing were strewn everywhere.\n\nBecky Daniel and her wife Monica Barber spoke for many of their neighbors as they reacted to the devastation Thursday.\n\n\"This was our heart,\" Daniel said of their home turned to rubble. \"It's just gone.\"\n\nOne person was reported killed in Mexico Beach.\n\nResidents were just glad to escape with their lives.\n\nApartment dwellers James and Cynthia Murphy sheltered with a friend whose home sat further back from the water and at a higher elevation. After the storm, they recalled their ordeal.\n\n\"We had to go, the water was coming up,\" said Cynthia Murphy, who couldn't find her cat and feared for her life.\n\nIn the summer they fled a forest fire. In the fall, many Eastpoint residents decided to face down the gale force winds and a 10-foot storm surge of Hurricane Michael.\n\nAfter the storm had passed, the canal littered with benches, tables and other furniture. The detritus of a hurricane's aftermath.\n\nEastpoint is home to many for whom struggle is a daily occurrence. Some sought refuge. Some stayed, preferring to brave Michael's wrath rather than return to unfathomable disaster. Returning wasn't always easy. Parts of U.S. Highway 98, the coastal highway, was washed out.\n\nSome businesses survived, however. Lynn's Quality Seafood's building withstood nature's onslaught.\n\nRelated:After Hurricane Michael: Struggling coastal communities begin long recovery\n\n\"We've had extensive damage to businesses, homes and infrastructure,\" Franklin County Sheriff A. J. Smith said. Recovery is going to be time-consuming, he said.\n\n\"It could take several weeks. We're still cleaning roads. A lot of roads have been damaged. There's extensive damage by water and some are washed out. It does take us while.\"\n\nOn Friday, state Department of Transportation officials were on the scene examining U.S. Highway 98, the key artery in the area.\n\nWater has been restored but there's the matter of electricity.\n\n\"We're making progress,\" said Smith. \"The county is still without power.\"\n\nSmith said dealing with the wildfire this summer helped emergency management officials in their response to Michael.\n\n\"It made us sharper. We've had a lot of things happen since I've been sheriff,\" he said. \"Every time we go through something like this, it makes us stronger. It makes us better.\"\n\nWhile Apalachicola homes were largely unscathed, the residents of Port St. Joe about 30 miles west down the highway, fared much worse.\n\nCommunication with the coastal community has been almost non-existent. Photos emerging in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael show destruction and devastation.\n\nThe winds undressed houses with brick facades, exposing the interior wood and vulnerable drywall.\n\nAt St. Joe Lodge No. 111 on Reid Avenue, the roof was torn off. Bricks were scattered on the street below. From the outside, it looked more like a structure gutted by fire than by wind and rain.\n\nSnapped pine trees littered yards.\n\nHouses of worship were not spared. The First Baptist Church of Port St. Joe’s roof was stripped of shingles, exposing the wood beams. Its white steeple was bent forward at a precarious angle.\n\nAt Port St. Joe Marina, boats were overturned, sunk and damaged like an ambushed fleet.\n\nErin Hill, a Florida A&M School of Journalism alum, had been trying to reach her mother, Linda Hill, without much luck until Saturday afternoon. Cell phone and landlines seemed inoperable.\n\n\"So far all of my family and friends survived the storm. Some of them lost their homes, but we’re all just thankful they are alive,\" she said in a Facebook message. \"I do know all the gas stations in St. Joe were destroyed, so no one there has access to gas.\"\n\nFor others, the news is not nearly as disastrous. Mark Hillis, a member of the Florida State University Board of Trustees, spent Friday cleaning up debris and examining storm damage at his weekend home in the 12-house Mariner's Harbor gated community. Everyone has a boat slip on the dock, which has been wrecked by Michael's storm waters, said Hillis, who sheltered his boat in Tallahassee.\n\nFor more than a day, calls to the Liberty and Calhoun sheriff's offices went unanswered. A persistent busy signal instead of a receptive voice. Communications to the two rural Big Bend communities that straddle the Apalachicola River and the Eastern and Central time zones were nonexistent.\n\nLiberty County law enforcement officers had to resort to a HAM radio to reach the outside world.\n\nBy Thursday help had arrived in uniform. The National Guard had been dispatched to distribute water, MRE's and tarps to residents walloped by Hurricane Michael to the west.\n\nWinds damaged the roof of the Calhoun-Liberty Hospital in Blountstown. A mobile unit was brought in to provide medical assistance, MRIs and X-Rays.\n\nDowned trees and debris littered or blocked all the roads. Rural residents were trapped behind their long dirt driveways. Calhoun County Sheriff Glenn Kimbrel called the damage \"catastrophic\" as if an F5 tornado had torn through the county.\n\n“Anywhere you travel in this county, it looks like a bomb exploded over, under, in, you name it, in this county,” Glenn said.\n\nResidents of Blountstown and neighboring Bristol, in Liberty County, are separated by the Apalachicola River and by a time zone. The storm left both communities battered and struggling to regain their footing.\n\nTrees lay everywhere, their root balls ripped from the ground or snapped like twigs. Stoplights in downtown Blountstown lay in the street while their wires dangled over people frantically trying to connect with resources. At the high school in Blountstown, bleachers on the football field lay twisted and crumpled like tin foil. Behind them, the building which served as the emergency shelter had major roof damage. The historic courthouse’s brick chimney’s lay toppled on the roof like the thousands of trees across the county.\n\nTrees that didn’t fall were stripped barren of their leaves. Tin roofing, siding and debris scattered across every part of both communities. Fuel was scarce.\n\nResidents of Liberty and Calhoun have seen dangerous tornadoes. Tropical cyclones like Michael, however, are unheard of.\n\nSaid Bobby Tipion of Clarksville, \"We're not used to this.\"\n\nMichael brought Gadsden County to its knees. After the eyewall walloped western sections of the County Wednesday afternoon, high winds knocked out power to the enter rural community.\n\nAs night fell, looters reportedly took to the streets. The disorder prompted Sheriff Maurice Young to institute a 24-hour curfew that was later eased to a dusk to dawn, 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew. Young vowed to arrest curfew violators except those on their way to work or those who have an emergency.\n\nCounty officials said four people died during the storm. One man was killed in Gretna after a tree crashed through his house. The home is now in shambles after officials retrieved his body more than 24 hours after the tragedy. Authorities have struggled to notify relatives of victims and confirm the details of what happened to the other three victims.\n\nHaving no electricity, many residents On Friday, Quincy residents descended on the Gadsden County Jail where National Guardsmen were handing out water, food and tarps. The distribution center was one of six quickly created to assist residents in the wake of the hurricane.\n\nThe heavy military presence is expected to remain in Quincy and other small towns. Other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, are on the ground pitching in to assess and repair the damage.\n\nThe victims of Hurricane Michael:\n\nTrees punched through rooftops, slammed sidewalks and streets and knocked out power lines that dangled and dropped to the ground. Chainsaws buzzed as crews removed trees from yards of stately homes on Quincy's King Street,\n\nA drive through Gadsden County shows green debris littering the roads, surrounded by thick forest. Dead power lines dangled low over intersections or sprawled ribbon-like across winding roads. The entire county, which is supplied by Talquin Electric, is without power after Michael.\n\nThe air was heavy with both sadness and smoke in the county’s rural communities – Gretna, Sawdust and Greensboro – where people burned large piles of debris. The peaceful quiet of the areas was cut by the murmur of chainsaws and crane engines and sirens.\n\nIn Greensboro, many trees fell around homes, spared by a hair. But the ones who didn't miss trees' paths suffered great damage. The town of church-goers and migrant farm workers were sticking together. One couple was cooking tortillas and cutlets on makeshift grills together the afternoon after the storm. Neighbors helped each other clear driveways.\n\nLongtime Gadsden residents had never seen this much of nature's wrath before.\n\nMichael was a \"catastrophic hit for us,\" said Sheriff Young. “This is probably the worse that a lot of people have experienced in their lifetime.”\n\nStaff writers Jeff Burlew, Karl Etters, Nada Hassanein, Brian Miller, and TaMaryn Waters contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/28/hurricane-ian-live-update-florida/10454266002/", "title": "Hurricane Ian live updates: About 1.7M remain without power", "text": "This version of our live blog is stripped of anything that makes it difficult to load on your mobile device.

Four people died in North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said Saturday.\n\nNow a post-tropical cyclone, Ian churned northward Saturday across central North Carolina after hammering the coast of South Carolina and devastating swaths of Florida.\n\nPower was knocked out for over 300,000 customers in North Carolina and almost 100,000 in Virginia as of Saturday morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nIn South Carolina, almost 60,000 people were still without power after Ian toppled trees and flooded roadways.\n\nMeanwhile, over 1.2 million people remained without power in Florida as officials assessed the damage and continued search and rescue efforts. The storm left a broad trail of destruction in the state, flooding areas on both of its coasts, tearing homes from their slabs and demolishing beachfront businesses.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday that Hurricane Ian is “likely to rank among the worst in the nation’s history” and Florida will take “months – years – to rebuild.”\n\nGET TEXT UPDATES: Sign up here for text updates on Ian.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►In South Carolina near Myrtle Beach, the end of the Pawleys Island pier collapsed and was floating as Ian made landfall, according to a Twitter post from the Pawleys Island Police Department.\n\n► Florida's Volusia County Community Information Director Kevin Captain said at a news conference Friday afternoon that the Daytona International Speedway was flooded by Hurricane Ian. \"Even our iconic speedway is underwater,\" he said.\n\n►Cubans protested for a second night Friday over delays in restoring electricity to the country after Hurricane Ian knocked out power across the island.\n\nHeavy rain hits central Appalachians, mid-Atlantic\n\nHeavy rains were forecast Saturday morning for the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic as Ian trekked across central North Carolina and toward Virginia, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is expected to weaken and dissipate over south-central Virginia by Saturday night.\n\nBut until then, Ian will bring gusty winds and drop 2 to 4 inches of rain with local maximums of 6 inches onto the central Appalachians and coastal mid-Atlantic, which may see limited flash and urban flooding.\n\nMajor river flooding is expected in parts of central Florida into next week, but swells seen in the Southeast should subside over the weekend.\n\n'Baby, it's time to go':First-time Florida mom gives birth in midst of Ian's wrath\n\nDeath toll likely to grow in Florida, other states\n\nThe destruction left behind by Ian has made it difficult to quickly know how many had perished in the storm, but the death count has climbed to 31, the Associated Press said Saturday.\n\nOn Friday morning, Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said there were as many as 21 deaths, but only one had been confirmed as the result of the storm, while officials were evaluating 20 other deaths.\n\nAmong the newly reported deaths in Florida were a 62-year-old woman who was injured and drowned after a tree fell on a mobile home, a 54-year-old man found trapped in a window after drowning and a woman tangled in wires in Florida's Lee County.\n\nMost of the 27 people who died in Florida drowned, but others died in the aftermath of the storm, including an elderly couple who died after their oxygen machines lost power.\n\nThe storm also killed at least four people in North Carolina, including a 25-year-old man whose vehicle hydroplaned, a 24-year-old woman whose vehicle slipped off a wet road and struck a tree, a 22-year-old man who drowned in his truck and a 65-year-old man who died from carbon monoxide poisoning from his generator, Gov. Cooper said in a Saturday statement.\n\n\"We mourn with the families of those who have died and urge everyone to be cautious while cleaning up to avoid more deaths or injuries,\" Cooper said.\n\nBefore hitting Florida, Ian also swept through Cuba earlier this week, killing three people.\n\nPost-Tropical Cyclone Ian tracker\n\nAfter slowly moving across Florida, Ian gained new strength over the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday before wreaking havoc on South Carolina, Georgia and more states along the East Coast.\n\nIt weakened to a post-tropical cyclone Friday afternoon, and by 11 a.m. Saturday, it was located 160 miles west-southwest of Richmond, Virginia, and was moving north-northeast at 10 mph with maximum sustained winds of 25 mph, the hurricane center said.\n\nCheck here for the latest updates on the storm's strength and track where it's headed next.\n\nRecovery begins in Venice, Florida\n\nVENICE, Florida – Electricity, stoplights and cellphone service were all improving Saturday as returning residents jockeyed for gas and hot meals at food trucks set up in closed restaurant parking lots. Heavy equipment rolled through on trailers, and there were major detours in place because of flooding-related safety closure of nearby Interstate 75.\n\nTree-trimmers, water-damage repair workers and electricians were busy at work restoring services to an area that saw heavy winds but relatively less damage than neighboring Edgewater.\n\nAfter getting up early, Douglas Schuler, 75, waited in line for an hour at Costco to get gas for his generator, which he’s been sharing with neighbors. He said he still doesn’t have reliable cell service but wanted people to know his neighborhood in the South Venice area was recovering.\n\n“I’ve got relatives in the Midwest who are probably wondering if we’re OK,” he said. “We’re a lot better off than most.”\n\nAfter getting gas, Schuler loaded his SUV with a chainsaw and other equipment to clear broken branches from around the South Venice Baptist Church, where he’s seted to be named a deacon on Sunday.\n\nHe’s seen a few of his fellow parishioners around and encouraged them to attend Sunday services but wasn’t sure who would actually show up.\n\n“We’ll see how many come,” he said. “We’re going to try make life feel normal.”\n\n— Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY\n\nInland Florida choked by river flooding\n\nRising waters continue to wreak havoc in Florida, where river flooding persists long after winds have passed.\n\nAs heavy rains flow into suburban and inland areas, continued river flooding shows how Ian's impacts have stretched far beyond Florida's beaches and coastal towns.\n\nThe rising waters have turned roads into canals, flooded vehicles and trapped families in waterlogged homes. In North Port, a Sarasota suburb, residents are beginning to run out of food and water.\n\n\"Water just keeps going up,\" said Samuel Almanzar, 42. \"Who knows when it is going to stop.\"\n\nLocal officials have said some areas will see rising water levels over the next two days and encouraged residents of flooded neighborhoods to evacuate.\n\nCrews from 30 states rush to restore power in Florida\n\nOf its 2.1 million customers who lost power after Hurricane Ian, Florida Power & Light, a utility that serves about half of Floridians, has restored electricity to two-thirds of them, or 1.4 million customers, Bryan Garner, a spokesperson for the company, told USA TODAY on Saturday.\n\nCrews of about 21,000 people, including those providing aid from 30 states, are working to restore electricity to remaining customers, most of whom can expect power by next week. Garner said FPL will have clearer timelines for hardest-hit communities by Saturday night.\n\n\"In those hardest hit areas, there's likely such catastrophic damage that, even if we get the grid repaired, there will be homes and businesses that will not be able to receive power,\" he said. \"For some homes and businesses, something may have to be rebuilt and electricians may have to come in, so they may be out for an extended period of time.\"\n\nFlooding expected but still 'heartbreaking'\n\nAs Ian drenched some areas with up to 17 inches of rain, floodwaters spilled out of scenic lakes, ponds and rivers and into homes, forcing emergency evacuations and rescues.\n\nResearchers who study flooding, development and climate change were horrified by the emerging images but not surprised. For years, they’ve warned sprawling development in Florida and other coastal states isn’t sustainable, especially with the warming climate supercharging hurricane rainfall.\n\n\"This is kind of what we had expected for days in advance, and it's still heartbreaking to see so many people stranded,\" said Kevin Reed, associate professor in atmospheric science at Stony Brook University in New York.\n\nHe and other experts said they expect Ian's devastation to lead to a push for Florida to do more to protect residents from future flooding as the warming climate makes natural disasters and rainfall more extreme.\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nAt least 25 dead in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona\n\nLess than two weeks after Hurricane Fiona devastated Puerto Rico and plunged the island into darkness, the country's health department announced that at least 25 people have died from the storm.\n\nThe deaths may be either directly or indirectly related to the hurricane, the department said.\n\nEighteen of the deaths were people over 65, while 15 were men while 10 were women.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Thao Nguyen, Jorge Ortiz, Doyle Rice, Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/weather/hurricane-south-carolina-path-florida-aftermath-friday/index.html", "title": "Ian expected to dissipate soon after striking Carolinas and killing at ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Affected by the storm?

By Friday night, it was continuing to pack 60 mph winds but was expected to weaken overnight and dissipate over North Carolina or Virginia late Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nFlash flooding was possible in parts of North and South Carolina and southeast Virginia Friday night, while the storm also threatened parts of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia with tornadoes through Saturday morning, the hurricane center added.\n\nTwo days earlier, Ian made landfall along Florida’s southwestern coast as a major Category 4 hurricane, ravaging coastal communities, turning roads into streams and leaving behind wreckage and debris.\n\nAs communities in the Sunshine State were beginning to pick up the pieces after the powerful storm, authorities in South Carolina late Friday began assessing the damage to their state. Authorities in Pawleys Island, a coastal South Carolina town roughly 70 miles north of Charleston, were cataloging the damage Friday night.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nTwo piers in the state – Cherry Grove Pier in North Myrtle Beach and Pawleys Island Pier – partially collapsed due to the storm. Water had receded on the two causeways, but Pawleys Island police announced they were not letting anyone back on the island until safety assessments were conducted in the morning.\n\nMore than 128,000 customers were in the dark across the state as of 9:30 p.m. Friday, according to poweroutage.us. In North Carolina, more than 330,000 customers were out of power and in Florida, more than 1.4 million.\n\nKnee-deep water inside homes\n\nIn North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Kyle Faust waded through knee-deep water inside his home Friday after the storm roared through. Across Horry County, where the city is located, officials reported Friday night crews were conducting damage assessments and clearing debris, while some roads remained closed.\n\nMyrtle Beach Police urged residents to stay inside and not drive on flooded roadways.\n\n“It’s a pretty scary sight,” Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune remarked earlier of Hurricane Ian. “I’m seeing way too many cars passing by. And I think people just don’t realize how dangerous it is to be out in these types of conditions. We’ve seen so many people’s cars get stuck, and emergency personnel has to go out and rescue people.”\n\nShelters in Charleston County will remain open until 4 p.m. on Saturday, the county wrote in a news release. Buses will start taking people from the shelters back to the original pick-up locations Saturday morning.\n\n“A lot of prayers have been answered,” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. “This storm is not as bad as it could have been, but don’t let your guard down yet. We are not out of the woods, there is water on the roads, still heavy winds, and it is still dangerous in many parts of the state.”\n\nCharleston International Airport’s airfield closed Friday because of high winds and extended the closure until Saturday morning, the airport said.\n\nIn Florida: At least 45 reported dead\n\nFlorida, meanwhile, confronted the dizzying destruction Ian wrought through much of the peninsula Wednesday and Thursday after it smashed into the southwest coast and plowed through central and northeastern areas.\n\nAt least 45 deaths have been reported in the state. Among them, friends of Kevin Behen, who told CNN on Friday night he knew of two men who died making sure their wives were able to escape the home they were all sheltering in that began to flood.\n\n“These guys pushed their wives out the windows to where a tree was,” Behen explained. “They just looked at their wives and they said, ‘We can’t hold on anymore, we love you. Bye,’ and that was it.”\n\nHomes on the coast were washed out to sea, buildings were smashed throughout the state, and floodwater ruined homes and businesses and trapped residents, even inland in places like the Orlando area.\n\nHundreds of rescues have taken place by land, air and sea, with residents stuck in homes or stranded on rooftops, and searchers have made many wellness checks, especially in the Fort Myers and Naples areas, where a storm surge inundated streets and homes.\n\n“It looked as though someone had just dropped from the sky picked up hotels and buildings and took them away,” Lee County manager Roger Desjarlais said. “We also know that not as many people evacuated from those islands as we had hoped for. We know there has to be many fatalities yet to be accounted for.”\n\nIan may have caused as much as $47 billion in insured losses in Florida, according to an estimate from property analytics firm CoreLogic, which could make it the second-most expensive storm in the state’s history when adjusted for inflation after 1992’s Hurricane Andrew.\n\nPresident Joe Biden continued to pledge federal support for Florida as it deals with the devastation caused by the storm, which he noted was “likely to rank among the worst … in the nation’s history” and will likely take “months, years” to rebuild.\n\nAnd the storm’s aftermath poses new, deadly dangers of its own. Some standing water is electrified, officials warned, while maneuvering through debris-strewn buildings and streets – many without working traffic signals – risks injury. Lack of air conditioning can lead to heat illness, and improper generator use can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nMany without homes, water, power\n\nClaudette Smith, the public information officer for the sheriff’s office in Charlotte County, just north of Fort Myers, told CNN the county is in desperate need of help as emergency services continue to be inundated.\n\n“We need everything, to put it plain and simple. We need all hands on deck,” Smith stressed. “The people who have come to our assistance have been tremendously helpful, but we do need everything.”\n\nMany members of the community are without homes, water, and electricity, and there is currently only one operating hospital in the county.\n\nHere’s what to know about the destruction in Florida:\n\n• Deaths in Florida: At least 45 deaths suspected to be related to Ian have been reported in Florida, including 16 in Lee County, 12 in Charlotte County, eight in Collier County, four in Volusia County, one in Polk County, one in Lake County, one in Manatee County and two in unincorporated Sarasota County, according to officials. Unconfirmed death cases are being processed by local medical examiners, who decide whether they are disaster-related, state emergency management Director Kevin Guthrie said.\n\n• Hundreds of rescues and thousands of evacuations: The US Coast Guard has performed over 275 rescues in Florida, Rear Admiral Brendan McPherson told CNN. More than 700 rescues have happened across Florida so far, the governor reported Thursday, and thousands of evacuees have been reported. In Lee County, a hospital system had to evacuate more than 1,000 patients after its water supply was cut off, while other widespread evacuations have been reported in prisons and nursing homes. In Fort Myers, the fire chief was “pretty comfortable” by Friday morning everyone needing help there had been rescued, Mayor Kevin Anderson said. The Coast Guard is treating this like a military operation searching “block by block to make sure that everybody gets out.”\n\n• Historic flooding: Record flooding was recorded across central and northern Florida, including at least three rivers hitting all-time flood records. Officials in Orlando warned residents of dangerous flooding, which exceeded a foot in some areas.\n\n• Much of Fort Myers Beach obliterated: A helicopter flight over Fort Myers Beach shows utter devastation: empty or debris-littered lots where homes and businesses used to be and boats tossed into mangroves. “You’re talking about no structure left. … You’re talking about homes that were thrown into the bay. This is a long-term fix, and it’s life-changing,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said.\n\n• Coastal islands isolated from mainland: Sanibel and Captiva islands in southwest Florida are cut off from the mainland after several parts of a critical causeway were torn away. At least two people were killed in the storm in Sanibel, and the bridge may need to be completely rebuilt, local officials said. Chip Farrar, a resident of the tiny island of Matlacha, told CNN 50 feet of road essential to reaching the mainland bridge has been washed out, and a second nearby bridge has also collapsed.", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris Alaa Elassar Jason Hanna Elizabeth Wolfe", "Christina Maxouris", "Alaa Elassar", "Jason Hanna", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/10/12/hurricane-michael-where-storm-now-what-we-know-damage/1611783002/", "title": "Hurricane Michael: Where the storm is now, what we know about ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nOne of the most powerful hurricanes in American history has moved off land, leaving a trail of destruction.\n\nMichael made landfall Wednesday in the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 hurricane with 155-mph winds.

Governors of four Southeast states declared emergencies.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nWhere is Hurricane Irma now?\n\nAs of 11 p.m. ET, Hurricane Irma’s winds were measured at 160 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The center of the hurricane was located about 300 miles south by southeast of Miami and was moving to the west at 13 mph. Irma made landfall at the Camaguey Archipelago in Cuba.\n\nWhere is Hurricane Irma heading?\n\nOn the current forecast track, the eye of Irma should continue to move near the north coast of Cuba and the central Bahamas for the rest of Friday night and Saturday, and be near the Florida Keys and the southern Florida peninsula Sunday morning, the hurricane center said.\n\nWhat part of Florida is under the hurricane warning?\n\nThe National Hurricane Center had initially issued a hurricane warning for most of South Florida. Late Friday afternoon, the hurricane warning had been extended northward toward the central part of the state, including the east coast of Florida to Sebastian Inlet, and along the west coast of the peninsula northward to Anna Maria Island, southwest of Tampa.\n\nA hurricane watch has been extended northward along the west coast of Florida to Suwannee River. A Storm Surge Watch has been issued north of Venice to the Anclote River, including Tampa Bay, and from Ponce Inlet to the Flagler-Volusia County Line, according to the hurricane center.\n\nWill Hurricane Irma hit Florida?\n\nThe National Hurricane Center’s forecast path for Irma has it hitting South Florida, including Miami and perhaps its highly developed and expensive central region, then up through affluent Broward and Palm Beach counties and farther north, threatening the entire peninsula.\n\n\"I'm afraid Irma is going to track too far west and put most of south Florida right in the eyewall,\" Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach said.\n\nRyan Rogers, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mobile, Ala., said the agency is confident the storm will turn to the north at some point after making landfall in South Florida, but it remains unknown exactly when that will happen.\n\nWhen will Hurricane Irma hit Florida?\n\nMost models have lrma making landfall in Florida sometime early Sunday, but wind and water will be blasting the state before that. Irma is forecast to remain strong as it heads north, so it's unclear how far up state the storm's power will be felt.\n\n“It’s not a question of if Florida’s going to be impacted, it’s a question of how bad Florida’s going to be impacted and where the storm ends up,” Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told reporters Friday.\n\nHow strong will Irma be when it hits?\n\nThe hurricane center said some fluctuations in strength are likely over the next day or two but Irma is expected to stay a Category 4 storm through landfall in Florida.\n\nWhat is the biggest concern from the storm?\n\nA fast-moving storm means the region could avoid the unrelenting rains that Harvey brought to Texas. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who announced the closing of all state schools, colleges and universities through Monday, warned state residents that even if their town is spared the brunt of Irma's wind and rain, there are other dangers. “My biggest concern is the amount of storm surge this storm will bring,” Scott said from the state Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. “This can kill you.”\n\nScott added on Friday afternoon, \"We will quickly run out of good weather to evacuate.\"\n\nShould I be worried about Hurricanes Jose and Katia?\n\nTwo additional hurricanes, Jose and Katia, are roaring in the Atlantic Basin, and neither will hit the U.S. but other countries will be impacted.\n\nOver the weekend, Jose could slam into some of the same Caribbean islands flattened by Irma just a few days ago, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nA hurricane watch has been posted for Antigua and Barbuda, parts of which sustained catastrophic damage from Irma. Torrential rainfall from the hurricane could produce \"life-threatening flooding\" by Saturday across both islands. The British Virgin Islands are also in Jose's path.\n\nMeanwhile, hurricane warnings were issued from Cabo Rojo to Laguna Verde in Mexico as 100-mph Hurricane Katia takes aim on that nation's east coast.\n\nThe storm has claimed at least 20 lives in the Caribbean.\n\nPresident Trump weighs in\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter Friday morning to urge Americans along Irma's path to take necessary precautions and \"get out of its way, if possible.\"\n\n\"This is a storm of absolutely historic, destructive potential,\" Trump said in a video message posted on social media Friday morning. \"I ask everyone in the storm's path to be vigilant and to heed all recommendations from government officials and law enforcement. Nothing is more important than the safety and security of our people.\"\n\nMore than 600,000 face evacuation orders\n\nFlorida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency ahead of the storm. In Miami-Dade County alone, about 660,000 residents are under evacuation orders.\n\nThe Florida Keys, Miami Beach, and parts of Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale, were among areas under mandatory evacuation orders. Officials also announced mandatory evacuations of the Glades communities south of Lake Okeechobee ahead of Hurricane Irma.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers predicts the Herbert Hoover Dike containing Lake Okeechobee “will not be compromised” by Hurricane Irma. But there are concerns that Irma’s winds could push water over the dike. The seven cities under mandatory evacuation orders are South Bay, Lake Harbor, Pahokee, Moore Haven, Clewiston, Belle Glade and Canal Point.\n\nThe same area was hit back in 1928 by the Okeechobee hurricane, which made landfall with 145 mph winds. The dikes failed then and at least 2,500 people drowned, most of them farmworkers and their families.\n\nIn Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal ordered evacuations along the coast. He has declared a state of emergency for 30 Georgian counties and said it is \"very likely\" he'll be forced to expand the declaration to a larger swath of Georgia.\n\nEvacuees facing unprecedented challenges\n\nHurricanes in Florida usually hit from the east or west, allowing residents to flee north or south to avoid the damage. But with Irma projected to make an unusual landfall from the south, the behemoth could envelop the entire Florida peninsula. That has forced evacuees to drive farther and farther north.\n\nConcern about fuel shortages\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott said his office is working with gas suppliers to ensure that gas stations along the Florida Turnpike and I-95 — the main highways leading out of Miami — are kept open and stocked. Scott has asked gas stations in the evacuation zones to stay open as long as they can, and promised operators his administration will provide workers police escorts to evacuate the area when the time comes.\n\n\"We are devoting every state resource, and the federal government is working to try to make sure we have all the fuel we can get here,\" Scott said Friday afternoon. \"If you're in an evacuation zone in South Florida, just remember you need to leave now.\"\n\nIn Washington, the Trump administration issued a waiver to a law known as the Jones Act, which requires that only U.S.-flagged vessels can carry domestic fuel shipments, said White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert.\n\nThe move is meant to help \"bring as much fuel as possible in to help Floridians,\" Bossert said.\n\nScott also urged Floridians who do not have enough fuel for their vehicles to call a state hotline at 1-800-342-3557 for assistance in evacuating.\n\nCan evacuees still fly out of South Florida?\n\nSeveral of Florida’s busiest airports have already announced they’ll suspend flights as Hurricane Irma advances toward the state. Orlando and Fort Lauderdale are among those to say flights will be halted. Other airports are likely to do the same if Irma’s projected track holds.\n\nAt Miami International Airport, anxious fliers waited to see if their planes would depart, while airport personnel helped hundreds of others with already canceled flights evacuate Miami International Airport for hurricane shelters Friday.\n\nMany of the stranded travelers who didn't get out in time were visiting from abroad and spoke little English, causing confusion about what was happening. Around 1 p.m. shuttles began collecting fliers and airport staff went person-to-person checking on needs.\n\nBy 11 a.m. Friday, 271 departing flights and 324 arrivals were canceled at the airport, more than half its average daily schedule.\n\nHow bad could the damage be in Florida?\n\nFlorida has seen Category 5 hurricanes, with winds greater than Irma. Hurricane Andrew roared into South Florida 25 years ago, a fast-moving storm that flattened neighborhoods, tossed cars and trucks around like Matchbox toys, and left millions without power. The storm destroyed more than 25,000 homes and damaged 100,000 others. An Andrew-like storm hitting downtown Miami could cause $300 billion in damage, according to one insurance underwriter.\n\nHow much damage has Irma caused already?\n\nAfter Irma struck Barbuda, its prime minister called the island \"barely habitable\" and St. Martin, an island split between French and Dutch control, saw extensive damage and was almost completely destroyed in places. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, Irma tore off roofs and crippled the only hospital on St. Thomas. The British government said the British Virgin Islands needs extensive humanitarian assistance. Destruction in Puerto Rico and Haiti does not appear to be as bad as feared.\n\nWhat should I do about my pet?\n\nThe American Veterinary Medical Association is reminding pet owners developing disaster plans to include pet evacuation kits. The list is extensive. Important components include 3-7 days worth of food, a two-week supply of medicine, 7 days of water, a dish and water bowl, flea and tick prevention, ownership documents and some \"comfort\" toys. The Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Florida, part of the state’s disaster response system,says are many pet-friendly shelters that allow the whole family to stay together. \"Do not leave your pet behind,\" the program urges. \"If it’s not safe for you, it’s not safe for your pet.\"\n\nWhat was the strongest storm to hit U.S.?\n\nThe strongest storm ever to make landfall in the U.S. hit on Sept. 2, 1935. Hurricanes were not officially named back then, but this one became known as the Florida Keys or Labor Day hurricane because of where and when it hit. The hurricane slammed across South Florida with sustained winds of 185 mph, killing 423 people. Awful as that storm was, perhaps the most horrific storm came 35 years earlier, flattening Galveston, Texas, and killing an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 people.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Bart Jansen, Alan Gomez, Gregory Korte, Caryn Shaffer and Jospeh Bauccum", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/10/11/hurricane-michael-photos-day-after-devastation-hit-florida-panhandle/1598356002/", "title": "Hurricane Michael photos: Day after devastation hit Florida Panhandle", "text": "After making landfall Wednesday as the most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's Panhandle, Hurricane Michael has left a trail of disaster across multiple states.\n\nAlthough Michael weakened Thursday to a tropical storm, it has killed at least seven people and impacted Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia.

Panama City, a popular spring break retreat, and Mexico Beach, another upscale coastline spot, were nearly unrecognizable in Michael’s wake.\n\nHomeowners from Panama City to Port St. Joe returned to see the path of destruction from ferocious winds.\n\nBecky Daniel and her wife Monica Barber pulled up to the scattered remains of their demolished gulf-front home near Mexico Beach. They assessed the damage and embraced each other.\n\n“This was our heart,” Daniel told Florida Today. “It’s just gone.”\n\nMany homes in the heavily-hit Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe areas were reduced to piles of lumber, broken glass and household items.\n\nStill, federal officials warned that evacuated residents should stay away from storm-damaged areas such as Bay County. They said debris, damaged gas and power lines and communication and transportation problems are barriers to a safe return.\n\n“It’s still not safe to return, particularly to Bay County, Florida,” Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Brock Long told reporters.\n\nThe recovery in Florida will take time – especially in Mexico Beach, where Michael made landfall Wednesday afternoon.\n\nFour hospitals and 11 nursing homes in Florida were closed on Friday, according to Kevin Yeskey, acting deputy assistant secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nGulf Coast Regional Medical Center evacuated patients due to storm damage but are treating those who arrive in the emergency room. Bay Medical said it was forced to transfer 200 patients after part of the hospital's roof collapsed, compromising supplies needed to run the hospital.\n\nMichael was just the fourth major hurricane – Category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale – to crash ashore on the Florida Panhandle since 1950, joining Eloise (1975), Opal (1995) and Dennis (2005).\n\nBraun reported from Mexico Beach, Florida.

And that he liked to ride a skateboard in the halls. Nearly a year after British police officers dragged him – heavily bearded, disheveled and resisting – into a waiting van, the cramped quarters where he spent seven years avoiding the long reach of the U.S. Justice Department still retain the odor of cat litter from his trusted feline companion.\n\nA court hearing that began here Feb. 24 could determine whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who published classified U.S. government communications as well as emails hacked by Russia from Hilary Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential campaign, will continue to be confined – and if so, where and how.\n\nThe hearing will decide whether Assange is sent to the U.S. to face trial in a case that could have serious implications for First Amendment protections. Yet the core issues at stake – media freedoms in the digital age and the global limits of the U.S. justice system – have been obscured by Assange's personal life, by the refuge he sought in Ecuador's London embassy and by curious claims about his behavior not that well supported.\n\nAssange extradition:Hearing opens with claims of Trump retribution against media\n\nSince May, the Australian national, 48, has been locked up at Belmarsh Prison, a facility that houses some of Britain's most dangerous lawbreakers.\n\nAssange is there because he was found guilty of skipping bail in 2012; he fled to Ecuador's embassy rather than turn himself in to British authorities for possible extradition to Sweden. At the time, investigators in the Scandinavian country wanted to question him over sexual assault allegations connected to two women.\n\n'Evidence has weakened':Julian Assange's rape investigation dropped by Sweden\n\nAssange hid from British police in Ecuador's poky red-brick embassy building, just yards from the famous luxury Harrods department store, because he feared Sweden would, in turn, extradite him to the U.S. The Department of Justice has indicted him on 18 counts, alleging 17 forms of espionage and 1 instance of computer misuse crimes connected to WikiLeaks' dissemination of caches of secret U.S. military documents provided to him by former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\n\nAssange denies all the allegations. The Swedish case has since been dropped. In Britain, he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail, a period he has already served. He has been denied bail for his extradition hearing because he is considered a flight risk.\n\nBut there's more at stake than one anti-secrecy advocate's freedom.\n\nShocking detail\n\nJohn Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst who blew the whistle on a U.S. government-sanctioned torture program in 2007 that was approved by President George W. Bush because of the feared threats posed by the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, said that Assange's U.S. case could set a precedent that would erode press freedoms for news organizations that publish classified information.\n\n\"If you are able to prosecute someone who has a strong case to be called a publisher, then who's next?\" said Kiriakou, who served jail time after pleading guilty to leaking the name of an officer involved in waterboarding.\n\nAssange describes himself as a political refugee.\n\nHe maintains that as a journalist he should be immune from prosecution and that his work revealed embarrassing and highly damaging facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the detainees held at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAssange's detractors say he doesn't write stories or interview anyone or provide sufficient explanatory context and that the dissemination of raw, unfiltered documents and data – the publication of stolen classified materials – should not count as journalism.\n\n\"WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,\" then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, now the U.S. secretary of State, said in April 2017, in his first public speech as head of the spy agency. \"Assange and his ilk,\" Pompeo said, seek \"personal self-aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values.\"\n\nIn fact, Department of Justice officials in President Barack Obama's administration ultimately decided they could not prosecute Assange for revealing national security secrets, described as one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history, because it risked criminalizing subsequent national security journalism.\n\n\"During the Obama administration it was called 'the New York Times problem,' \" after the newspaper's distinguished record of publishing information on national security matters the U.S. government has deemed secret, said Stephen Rohde, a historian and constitutional law expert, and a past chair of the Southern California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"In other words, how can we indict him for espionage when we're confident he's a journalist, a publisher and enjoys First Amendment rights.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, the First Amendment, as it applies to the press, restrains the government from jailing, fining or imposing liability for what the press publishes.\n\nIt does not shield journalists from criminal liability.\n\nOn the opening day of Assange's extradition hearing, James Lewis, a British lawyer representing the U.S. government, said Assange was guilty of \"straightforward\" criminality for hacking and then publishing secret military and intelligence information that put secret U.S. sources at risk of torture or death in places from Iraq to China.\n\nThe information Assange published contained about 90,000 Afghanistan War-related \"significant activity\" reports, 400,000 Iraq War-related reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay \"detainee assessment\" briefs and 250,000 U.S. State Department cables.\n\nIf nothing else, this material illuminated in shocking detail U.S. military and diplomatic procedure and actions in far-flung places, and the light it shined was not flattering.\n\nWikiLeaks' Julian Assange:Journalist or criminal hacker?\n\nTo his supporters, Assange is a champion of free speech and the public interest whose exceptional computer skills helped him reveal, among other things, video footage allegedly showing U.S. air crews in Apache helicopters killing a dozen civilians in Iraq.\n\nThe dead included two Iraqis working for the Reuters news agency.\n\n\"Assange published evidence of war crimes by the U.S. government,\" said Andrew Wilkie, a left-leaning Australian politician who traveled to Britain in February with fellow Australian lawmaker George Christensen in a show of bipartisan support for Assange. Christensen represents Australia's right-of-center Liberal National Party.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of the Trump administration but I'm a bigger fan of free speech,\" said Christensen.\n\n\"Assange did the right thing,\" added Wilkie. \"He served the public interest.\"\n\nStill, the U.S. government alleges that Assange is a criminal who conspired with Manning to steal thousands of pages of national defense information that has risked the lives of U.S. forces, allies and collaborators from translators to political dissidents with whom it partners to fight repressive regimes.\n\n\"No responsible actor – journalist or otherwise – would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers,\" U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said when the indictment was announced in May 2019.\n\nManning served seven years in prison, including pre-trial custody, before Obama commuted her 35-year prison sentence. She is now back in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. Manning, who was convicted of theft and espionage, says she acted on principle when she handed over the top-secret information to WikiLeaks.\n\nIf Assange is sent to the U.S. to stand trial, he could get a life sentence – 175 years – if a federal court finds him guilty on all 18 charges and the maximum penalty is imposed.\n\nA Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on whether there is any evidence that the WikiLeaks disclosures have directly led to injuries or deaths.\n\nTo date, no evidence of deaths or injuries precipitated by WikiLeaks' disclosures has emerged and Lewis, the lawyer representing the U.S. government in Assange's extradition hearing, said that while Washington believes that many of its informants who were outed by WikiLeaks later \"disappeared\" it can't yet prove the assertion.\n\nJulian Assange:WikiLeaks founder claims ‘spying’ in fight over extradition\n\nSelf-imposed isolation?\n\nEcuador insists it kicked Assange out of its embassy after he became an intolerable nuisance at its building in one of London's most upmarket neighborhoods.\n\nWhile living there, Assange occupied about a third of the embassy's rooms with his cat. He brought in a sun lamp, treadmill, stacks of books, computer equipment and insisted on his own fridge. He also regularly hosted well-known guests such as the musician Lady Gaga and the actor Pamela Anderson. He addressed admirers and gave news conferences from the embassy's tiny balcony – often, as unsuspecting tourists passed by and expensive cars belonging to Harrods' wealthy patrons idled across the street. Due to space constraints, embassy staff had to share a conference room with Assange. One senior diplomat even shared an office with him.\n\nMost people have suffered through a houseguest from hell.\n\nOver time, Ecuador says, that's exactly what Assange became, even allegedly going to the unhygienic length of smearing his own excrement on a bathroom wall. The allegations were first made public in an interview in April 2019 with Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno, who also accused Assange of not looking after his cat and attacking the embassy's security staff. No evidence was released to back up the allegations.\n\nAssange's supporters and legal team strongly deny the claims, which have not been verified. Ecuadorean officials told USA TODAY that some evidence of Assange's misbehavior in the embassy can be found online, such as a YouTube video that shows him standing on a skateboard. Ecuador says it has not released additional evidence because of possible legal retribution from Assange.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that Ecuador started to reexamine its relationship with Assange around the time Moreno took office in 2017. Moreno sought to improve relations with its largest trading partner: the U.S.\n\nIn fact, shortly after Assange was expelled from the embassy, President Donald Trump's administration said it was opening a \"new chapter of cooperation\" with the South American nation that included economic development and natural disasters help.\n\nAnd, cosmetically at least, Assange's expulsion from the Ecuadorean embassy does appear to mark a sea change in U.S.-Ecuador relations that was foreshadowed on Oct. 16, 2018, when the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote a letter to Moreno offering to \"advance crucial matters\" and \"warmer relations\" with Washington if Ecuador \"handed over Assange to the proper authorities.\"\n\nIn February, Moreno became the first chief of state from Ecuador to visit an American president in 17 years. Moreno's predecessor, Rafael Correa, who granted Assange asylum and even Ecuadorean citizenship before it was revoked by Moreno, embraced Iran, closed a U.S. military base, expelled the U.S.'s ambassador and generally railed against what he described as belligerent American imperialism and capitalism.\n\nVegan meal:Pamela Anderson’s present for Julian Assange\n\nWhen USA TODAY visited Ecuador's London embassy in mid-February, some modest refurbishments and redecorations were underway. Officials pointed to the bathroom where they allege Assange spread feces on the wall and also showed off the hotel-style kitchenette where he prepared his meals. But citing legal action in Ecuador and Spain on Assange's behalf, over claims that a security company was contracted by Ecuador's government to spy on Assange while he lived in the embassy, these officials would not reveal further details about what led to Assange's departure. Assange has also tried to sue Ecuador's government for \"violating his fundamental rights,\" by claiming it limited his contact with the outside world while he was holed up there.\n\nEcuador disputes all the allegations and insists it has done nothing wrong.\n\nBritish press reported that his cat, who went by various names including \"Embassy Cat,\" \"Meowchael Moore,\" after the American documentary filmmaker, and \"James,\" was given to a shelter when Assange was forced out of the embassy by British police.\n\nThe YouTube video footage Ecuador cited as evidence for Assange's poor houseguest manners was uploaded to the video-sharing platform in April 2019. It shows a pale and barefooted Assange attempting to stand on a skateboard in a room in the embassy.\n\nHe repeatedly stumbles.\n\nA First Amendment brawl\n\nAssange has been indicted in the U.S. under the Espionage Act of 1917.\n\nAccording to Rohde, the historian and law expert, before Obama took office the 102-year-old act was used just four times against government officials for providing classified information to the media. The Obama administration used it eight times, including against Manning and Edward Snowden, a National Security Agency contractor who leaked information about U.S. telecoms surveillance programs to the press.\n\nSnowden is currently receiving asylum in Russia.\n\nTrump has prosecuted eight government employees for leaking information to the media, according to U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a press freedom advocacy organization. His administration's use of the act against Assange breaks new legal ground because it is the first time it's been deployed to target a media organization as opposed to a government whistleblower.\n\nYet while the First Amendment protects the publication of truthful information, it does so only if this information is acquired legally.\n\nThe Department of Justice alleges that Assange explicitly solicited – encouraged – Manning to break the law by helping her crack a password that gave her higher-level access to classified computer networks.\n\nManning disputes the allegation.\n\nAs does WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Department of Justice's prosecutors are expected to reveal \"forensic\" digital evidence for this allegation when evidence in Assange's extradition hearing is heard in May. Assange's defense team says it, too, has evidence that refutes the allegation.\n\nAccording to a report in the Associated Press from April 2019 the genesis of the Trump administration's dialing up of the rhetoric on Assange can be traced to WikiLeaks' release, in 2017, of thousands of pages of documents revealing details about CIA cyber-espionage tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and consumer electronics. However, there is an alternative explanation for Trump's interest in a case that Rohde said that if successfully prosecuted would have a \"chilling effect\" on First Amendment protections for the press: Trump's disdain for the media.\n\n\"Assange is low-hanging fruit to Trump,\" said Rohde. \"They can go through the whole process, and win or lose, the process will keep the ball in the air and reinforce that he's prosecuting leakers and the media.\"\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, agreed with this assessment.\n\nTrump \"probably believes he can profit politically from pursuing Assange,\" he said.\n\nWhile the U.S. indictment against Assange does not relate to WikiLeaks' 2016 publication of hacked emails belonging to Clinton's presidential campaign, at a preliminary hearing for Assange's extradition case in late February, Edward Fitzgerald, one of his lawyers, nevertheless said there is evidence that Trump, viathen-Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, offered him a pardon if he agreed to say Russia was not involved in leaking the emails. The White House and Rohrabacher deny a pardon was offered.\n\nAs the extradition hearing got underway, Fitzgerald told a British judge the U.S. indictments against Assange were part of the Trump administration's determination to put a journalist's \"head on a pike\" – part of its war on the press.\n\nWikiLeaks intrigue:Trump offered Assange a pardon if he cleared Russia, lawyer says\n\nIf Assange is extradited to the U.S., he will be tried in the same court – the Eastern District of Virginia – as Kiriakou, the CIA analyst, who was also charged under the Espionage Act, but took a lesser plea under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.\n\n\"It's known as the 'espionage court,'\" said Kiriakou, adding that \"Assange doesn't stand a chance\" in that federal district court because the jury pool tilts toward individuals who are members of the U.S. intelligence community and their families.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department chose not to comment on whether the Eastern District of Virginia would offer an impartial setting for jury selection in any Assange trial. The White House and U.S. State Department chose not to comment on whether the administration was concerned about the impact of Assange's case on the First Amendment.\n\nLewis, who represents the U.S. government in Assange's extradition hearing, has repeatedly reiterated Washington's position that journalism is not an excuse for breaking the law and that the court proceedings in Britain will prove that he did so.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of Assange's hearing, Kristin Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief, described the indictment against Assange as \"propaganda.\"\n\nAnd Jennifer Robinson, a member of Assange's legal team, said he did \"what all journalists, all honorable ones,\" do every day: take receipt of information, communicate about how to protect the source of that information (Manning), and publish it.\n\n\"What signal does it send to countries like Russia, China\" and other authoritarian governments around the world if this extradition goes ahead, she asked.\n\n'If the law is respected'\n\nStill, it's far from certain that Assange will lose his extradition case. And even if he does, it does not automatically follow he will be sent to the U.S., according to Anand Doobay, an expert in the rules governing extradition at London-based firm Boutique Law.\n\nDoobay said if the judge decides \"not to refuse\" the U.S. request then Britain's secretary of state will have to decide whether to order it, a call that involves scrutiny of factors such as whether there is a risk that by extraditing him Assange could face the death penalty. British law forbids extradition under such circumstances.\n\nWhile none of the current charges carry the death penalty, Assange's supporters have argued that the Trump administration can't be trusted and could decide to unveil additional charges that do carry a death sentence once Assange arrives on U.S. soil.\n\n'Angst, anger':Roger Stone intervention stokes uncertainty across justice system\n\nDoobay noted that most extradition requests the U.S. makes to the U.K. are granted. It's not clear what will happen if Assange prevails in the British court. Because he has already served the 50 weeks for skipping bail he could simply be free to go. But if he is deported to his native Australia, the U.S. could try to mount a new extradition case. It could also issue an international arrest warrant if he travels beyond Britain's borders.\n\nAssange's health will also be considered and Nils Melzer, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, said in an interview that when he visited Assange in Belmarsh Prison in May last year he was displaying symptoms akin to \"psychological torture\" likely caused by prolonged exposure to extreme stress, chronic anxiety and isolation.\n\n\"He was very agitated,\" he said. \"Not the normal stress you would see in a prisoner.\"\n\nIn a series of preliminary hearings Assange has attended in person and by video link from prison he has sometimes appeared frail and confused when questioned by the judge. He has also lost weight. However, appearing in court for the extradition hearing in late February he mostly looked relaxed and appeared able to follow along with the proceedings. Although he complained several times that he was struggling to hear the legal arguments being made by both sides because of being forced to sit behind a high glass barrier in the courtroom, a scenario he said that has also prevented him from giving \"confidential instructions\" to his lawyers.\n\n\"I'm as much a participant in the court as a spectator at Wimbledon,\" he told the court at one point, referring to the British tennis tournament. \"This case already has enough spying on my lawyers as it is,\" he added, an apparent reference to his claims that he was surveilled during his time in Ecuador's embassy.\n\nAssange's legal team asked the judge, Vanessa Baraitser, to consider whether he can sit in the well of court, next to them, when evidence in the case is heard in May.\n\nShe said she saw no reason to change the seating arrangement.\n\nWikiLeaks' Hrafnsson said Assange's health has been improving but his father, John Shipton, told reporters ahead of the hearing that his son's long confinement has damaged his health and he feared any U.S. extradition would be akin to a \"death sentence.\"\n\n\"His situation is dire, he has had nine years of ceaseless psychological torture where false accusations are constantly being made,\" said Shipton.\n\nRecently, more than 60 doctors wrote an open letter to Britain's secretary of state saying they fear Assange's health is so bad he could die inside Belmarsh Prison, while 130 prominent figures from the worlds of art, politics and the media in Germany urged authorities to release Assange from detention because of his \"critical health.\"\n\n\"If the law is respected, then I don't see any way for him to be lawfully extradited to the U.S.,\" said Melzer, the U.N.'s envoy on torture, noting that there is a \"political offenses exclusion\" in Britain's extradition treaty with the U.S. and that \"espionage really is the quintessential political offense.\"\n\nMelzer added that while governments often prosecute leakers and whistleblowers, government employees who actually implement official policy that involves the perpetration of crimes, such as systematic torture, generally enjoy complete impunity.\n\nInstead, he said, with Assange, \"we're sanctioning\" those that disclose this information.\n\n\"That can't be right,\" he added.\n\nAt the hearing, the prosecution has argued that Assange should not be able to rely on the \"political offenses\" exemption in Britain's extradition treaty with the U.S. partly because in publishing the information he did Assange was not expressly trying to overthrow or a cause a change in the U.S. government or its foreign policy.\n\nFitzgerald, for the defense, described this argument as \"absurd.\"\n\n\"What other reason would Mr. Assange have for publishing this information if it wasn't to cause a change in U.S. policy\" in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, he said.\n\nSteve Bannon testifies:Trump saw Roger Stone as 'access point' to WikiLeaks\n\nMelzer, who is an academic and a lawyer, also expressed concern over the allegations of rape and sexual assault made against Assange that date from 2010. Sweden's authorities ended their investigations without charging Assange in November due to what they characterized as weakened evidence. Melzer said the police reports are riddled with contradictions and possibly even exculpatory evidence, such as text messages that indicate one of the claimants didn't want to accuse Assange of anything and that it was the police who \"made up the charges.\" This claimant was only concerned about getting Assange to take an HIV test because they had unprotected sex.\n\nMelzer said he has written multiple letters to the Swedish authorities asking for clarifications over inconsistencies in internal police correspondence but the response from the Swedish government has been: \"We have no further observations.\"\n\nIn one letter Melzer wrote to Sweden's minister of foreign affairs in May last year he says Assange has effectively been \"publicly shamed\" and \"defamed.\"\n\nThe Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement to USA TODAY that its case against Assange is closed and it does not want to comment on Melzer's allegations.\n\nThe Swedish allegations may appear tangential to Assange's case, but they are in fact a central plank in the circumstances that have directly led to his current plight: It's unlikely Assange would have fled to the embassy without Sweden's original claims.\n\nAssange 'told the truth'\n\nGeoffrey Robertson, a human rights lawyer who previously represented Assange – Robinson, from Assange's defense team, works in the firm he founded, Doughty Street Chambers – said that there was \"no doubt\" that the Trump administration was prepared to pursue Assange \"to the ends of the Earth\" because it is \"determined to create precedents that will shackle investigative journalism\" and prevent it from airing the U.S.'s secrets.\n\n\"This is about deterrence,\" he said.\n\nStill, Robertson added that \"America is a beacon of free speech\" and the First Amendment is a \"phenomenal example to the world\" at a time when all over the planet autocratic governments are trying to jail journalists or \"shut them up.\"\n\nIt would be a shame, he said, if the U.S. \"abandons its principles when we need them.\"\n\nRobertson, who like Assange was born in Australia, has won landmark rulings on civil liberties from the highest courts in Britain, Europe and elsewhere. He has been a United Nations war crimes judge and defended scores of people facing death sentences.\n\n\"What the U.S. wants to do with Julian Assange – let him die in jail, essentially – is completely disproportionate to what he has done: told the truth. And no one has disputed that what Julian Assange did was anything but tell the truth,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/14/the-biggest-news-story-every-year-since-1950/40987857/", "title": "Trump, wars, civil rights, tech advances: Top news stories since 1950", "text": "John Harrington and Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nEach year there are major news events that capture the world’s attention. These stories range from massive conflicts or catastrophes that leave thousands dead or stranded to technological developments and supreme court decisions that completely change our daily lives.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the biggest news stories in each year since 1950. The event we chose for a given year wasn’t always the most talked-about story when it occurred, but each one in retrospect proved to have the biggest impact on history.\n\nMajor milestones in civil rights, wars and conflicts, and breakthroughs in science and medicine stand out in news coverage over this time period. As technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of, progressive ideas also found footing and changed the world. Women, African Americans, and the LGBTQ community demanded, and often won, equal rights – from the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the legalization of same-sex marriage. Here are the most important human rights milestones since 2000.\n\nIncreasingly, major news events in recent years include severe weather events and other catastrophes tied to global climate change.

The parties would agree to a ceasefire three years later. The uneasy relations between North Korea and South Korea last to this day.\n\n1951: Rosenbergs sentenced\n\n• Date: March 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nHusband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are convicted of espionage for their part in passing along atomic secrets to the Soviet Union during and after World War II. They are executed two years later. Not everyone is convinced of their involvement in the scheme. Supporters claim they are scapegoats swept up in the Cold War hysteria of the time. Documents would reveal decades later the extent of Julius Rosenberg’s involvement in the spy ring, though Ethel’s participation in the scheme remains inconclusive.\n\n1952: First hydrogen bomb test\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Marshall Islands\n\nThe United States successfully detonates its first hydrogen bomb, a second-generation thermonuclear device. The detonation in the Marshall Islands is part of Operation Ivy, one of a series of nuclear bomb tests. From 1946 to 1958, the United States used the remote Pacific Marshall Islands as its nuclear weapons testing site, conducting a total of 67 nuclear tests.\n\n1953: The dawn of DNA\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: Cambridge, England, U.K.\n\nCambridge University scientists James Watson and Francis Crick announce they have discovered the double-helix structure of DNA. Though scientists had been aware of DNA since the 1860s and of its role in genetic inheritance since 1943, Watson and Crick were the first to explain how DNA works to replicate itself and pass on genes from one generation to the next.\n\n1954: Brown v. Board of Education\n\n• Date: May 17\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark case involving Linda Brown of Topeka, Kansas, who had to cross a railroad track to reach an all-black elementary school even though an all-white school was closer, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the segregated school system is unconstitutional on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. The clause would be used again by the courts to reverse state-level racial segregation practices and ordinances.\n\n1955: Parks starts a movement\n\n• Date: Dec. 1\n\n• Location: Montgomery, Alabama\n\nRosa Parks makes history by refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus. Her arrest for insisting to remain seated leads to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascent of a young pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., as a local activist leader working to advance the civil rights cause. A successful federal lawsuit by the NAACP against the city leads to the desegregation of the Montgomery bus system on Dec. 21 of the following year.\n\n1956: Hungary suppressed\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Budapest\n\nNine years after the start of the Cold War, Hungarians take to the streets, demanding democratic reforms. Three days later, Soviet Red Army troops invade Hungary, killing thousands. Nine days after the incursion, Soviet troops occupy Budapest in one of the largest and most aggressive actions taken by the Soviet Union since the end of World War II.\n\n1957: The Little Rock Nine\n\n• Date: Sept 24\n\n• Location: Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nU.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower orders federal troops to protect nine African American high school students as they start classes at the all-white Little Rock Central High School. This would become one of the first high-profile actions the federal government would take against state-level racial segregation.\n\n1958: US launches first satellite\n\n• Date: Jan. 31\n\n• Location: Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\nThe United States successfully launches Explorer 1, three months after the Soviet Union sends its first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit. The two superpowers would go on to send more satellites into space, creating a Cold War space race to build ever more sophisticated orbital communications devices and to achieve spaceflight capabilities and generally space superiority.\n\n1959: Castro takes over Cuba\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Havana\n\nU.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista flees Havana as Fidel Castro’s forces advance on the Cuban capital. Days later, rebels led by Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos enter the city, followed two days later by Castro’s forces. Castro quickly consolidates power in Cuba, establishing a communist government in the Caribbean’s largest country.\n\n1960: Lunch counter sit-in\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nWhen four African American college students – Ezell A. Blair, Franklin E. McCain, Joseph A. McNeil, and David L. Richmond – sit down at a Woolworth’s lunch counter and ask for service, they are denied. The young men refuse to give up their seats, their sit-in leading to a larger six-month protest that results in the desegregation of the lunch counter by that summer and many other restaurants across the south.\n\n1961: Berlin Wall built\n\n• Date: Aug. 13\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nBy the late summer of 1961, the loss of skilled workers such as teachers, engineers, and doctors to the West reaches crisis levels in East Germany. On Aug. 12, 2,400 East Germans cross into West Berlin, the most in a single day. The next day, with the approval of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, East Germany begins building a wall that would extend 27 miles through Berlin, dividing families and friends for the next 28 years. The wall would serve as an enduring symbol of the Cold War, used by presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan to inspire a divided city.\n\n1962: Cuban missile crisis\n\n• Date: Oct.16-28\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWhen the United States learns that the Soviet Union is building nuclear missile installations 90 miles south of Miami in communist Cuba, the Kennedy administration enacts a naval blockade around the island, which is at times tested, to demand the removal of the missiles. The standoff is widely considered to be the closest the two nuclear superpowers come to direct military confrontation. Cooler heads prevail. The Soviet Union offers to remove the missiles in exchange for a guarantee that the United States will not invade Cuba. In secret, the administration also agrees to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey.\n\n1963: JFK assassinated\n\n• Date: Nov. 22\n\n• Location: Dallas\n\nAs John F. Kennedy prepares for his re-election bid, the 34th president of the United States embarks on a multi-state tour in September 1963. He is murdered by a sharpshooter’s bullet fired by Lee Harvey Oswald at about 12:30 p.m. as his motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza in Dallas. Oswald himself is murdered two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.\n\n1964: LBJ's \"War on Poverty\"\n\n• Date: Jan. 8\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson struggles to shift focus away from the Vietnam War and on his stated goals of reducing poverty, ending segregation, and establishing the social programs that many Americans rely on to this day, including the immensely popular Medicare program. During his “War on Poverty” State of the Union Address of Jan. 8, 1964, LBJ outlines the need for the country to reduce poverty, end racial discrimination, attend to the health needs of the elderly, and other progressive goals. LBJ later ushers in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965.\n\n1965: Selma to Montgomery march\n\n• Date: March 7\n\n• Location: Selma, Alabama\n\nThe fatal shooting of protester Jimmy Lee Jackson by an Alabama state trooper sparks a march in the state from Selma to Montgomery. Hundreds of civil rights activists march in what becomes known as “Bloody Sunday.” Police confront the marchers, led by John Lewis (who is a House Democrat from Georgia) and others. As the activists cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, police attack the protesters with tear gas and billy clubs, hospitalizing 50.\n\nA comfortable retirement:In which states will your money will last longest or shortest?\n\nRobocalls on the rise:Which states get the most and where does yours rank?\n\n1966: Mao purges rivals\n\n• Date: Aug. 13\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nAt the end of a weeklong session of the Communist Party Central Committee of the People’s Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong condemns the political elites, calling on China’s youth to rebel against the entrenched political hierarchy. It is the beginning of the decade-long Cultural Revolution that fundamentally transforms Chinese society. Intellectuals, members of the former Nationalist government, and people with ties to Western powers are persecuted, sent to re-education labor camps, or killed by factions of the Red Guards formed in the wake of Mao’s call to action.\n\n1967: Six-Day War\n\n• Date: June 5\n\n• Location: Middle East\n\nAmid escalating tensions with its neighbors, Israel launches a pre-emptive strike that destroys most of Egypt’s air force. Syria, Jordan, and Iraq also attack Israel. As the war continues, Israel takes the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, captures East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan, and in heavy fighting seizes the Golan Heights from Syria. A ceasefire goes into effect on June 10.\n\n1968: Dream denied\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Memphis, Tennessee\n\nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is fatally shot by James Earl Ray as the civil rights icon stands on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, a tragedy that sparks race riots nationwide. King’s influence in words and actions touch and move not only the nation, but the world, and resonate to this day. Two months later, on June 4, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and brother of John F. Kennedy, is fatally shot by Sirhan Sirhan, an Arab Christian from Jerusalem, who believes Kennedy is “instrumental” in oppressing Palestinians.\n\n1969: Landing on the moon\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Moon\n\nPresident Kennedy’s goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 is realized six years after his assassination. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins blast off from the Kennedy Space Center at 9:32 a.m. aboard the Saturn V rocket. After three days of travel, Armstrong and Aldrin land the Eagle module on the lunar surface as Collins remains in lunar orbit to pilot the module. Upon their return to Earth, the three astronauts are put in 21-day quarantine to ensure they did not bring back any lunar contagions.\n\n1970: Vietnam War turns to Cambodia\n\n• Date: April 29\n\n• Location: Eastern Cambodia\n\nAlthough the United States should be scaling back U.S. troop presence in Vietnam, President Richard Nixon approves an operation with the South Vietnamese to invade Cambodia to oust Northern Vietnamese forces there. The Cambodian incursion inflames anti-war protests in the United States as it is perceived to be an escalation of U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia.\n\n1971: Pentagon Papers\n\n• Date: Feb. 8\n\n• Location: Laos\n\nThe Pentagon Papers, a study by the U.S. Department of Defense about the country's involvement in the Vietnam war, are released and published first in The New York Times, then other newspapers. The documents expose several missteps and how several administrations have misled the American public about how involved the military was and about plans to escalate the war in 1964. They also reveal an expanded campaign in Cambodia and Laos, especially clandestine bombing in Laos, which today is considered the heaviest bombardment in history.\n\n1972: Nixon goes to China\n\n• Date: Feb. 21\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nNixon, a virulent anti-communist earlier in his political career, surprises the American public by traveling to Beijing for a week of talks in a historic first step towards normalizing relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Until this trip, the United States and communist China were de facto enemies, fighting proxy wars in the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and South Vietnam at the time of Nixon’s visit.\n\n1973: Roe v. Wade\n\n• Date: Jan. 22\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark 7-2 decision that will be known as Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court rules that under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, abortion is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The court adds that as the pregnancy develops the state can balance a woman’s right to privacy with its interest in preserving the “potentiality of human life.” As a result, states can ban abortion in the third trimester except in cases where a pregnancy affects a woman’s health.\n\n1974: Nixon resigns\n\n• Date: Aug. 8\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon announces his resignation amid impeachment proceedings stemming from the Watergate scandal and the administration’s attempt resist a congressional investigation. The scandal exposes abuses of power by the White House after five burglars were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. Nixon becomes the only president in U.S. history to resign.\n\n1975: Saigon falls\n\n• Date: April 30\n\n• Location: South Vietnam\n\nTwo years after the last American troops left Vietnam, communist troops from North Vietnam capture Saigon, ending nearly two decades of relentless war in the rice paddies and jungles of that Southeast Asian nation. The total number of fatal casualties for the United States is 58,220.\n\n1976: The Concorde changes air travel\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: London and Paris\n\nTwo supersonic Concorde jets take off simultaneously – one from London to Bahrain, operated by British Airways, and the other from Paris to Rio de Janeiro via Dakar in Senegal, operated by Air France – marking the first time paying passengers enjoy commercial travel at faster than the speed of sound. Though travel by one of the 16 Concordes ever put into service could slash travel time from New York to London in half, the high cost of maintenance, soaring ticket prices, as well as a fatal accident in 2000, would seal the fate of the narrow, slope-nosed aircraft.\n\n1977: Rise of the personal computer\n\n• Date: January\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nPersonal home computers began to emerge in the 1970s, but many of the earliest versions resembled calculators that would plug into televisions sets. By 1977, however, the desktop home computer begins to resemble the more modern versions – with an accompanying, attached or separate, computer screen and a magnetic tape or floppy disk storage device. The Commodore PET is unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago that year, while the first Apple II and Radio Shack’s TRS-80 also go on sale.\n\n1978: Cult's mass suicide\n\n• Date: Nov. 18\n\n• Location: Jonestown, Guyana\n\nMore than 900 people die in one of worst recorded acts of cult-related mass murder-suicide as nearly all the victims and perpetrators drink a powdered drink mix laced with cyanide. Most of the victims are Americans, devotees of Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones, a former Methodist-trained preacher who built a following and led the flock to Guyana. Among the dead are 276 children. A small number of cult defectors are killed by Peoples Temple gunmen who also slay Leo Ryan, California Congressman who had gone to Guyana to investigate Jonestown.\n\n1979: Islamic Republic born in Iran\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Tehran\n\nWorsening economic conditions, increasing discontent with the government, and wide support for religious leader in exile Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini end the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The shah and his family flee Iran in January 1979. On Feb. 11, the monarchy is dissolved, and on April 1, Khomeini declares Iran an Islamic republic. With support among the nation’s clergy and their many followers, he begins rebuilding Iranian society based on conservative Shiite religious principles. In November, a mob raids the U.S. embassy, taking more than 60 Americans hostage. The crisis would be influential in the following year's presidential election and would not fully resolve until January 1981.\n\n1980: Reagan elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the United States in an economic malaise and the Iranian hostage crisis hobbling the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan is elected the 40th president in a landslide. Reagan, who would serve two terms, was the oldest man elected president at the time. Reagan’s election changes the trajectory of American politics, ushering in an era of conservative leadership. During his tenure, he takes a more aggressive approach to the Soviet Union and increases defense spending. Reagan convinces Congress to cut taxes, a move that many economists credit with triggering an economic boom in the 1980s.\n\n1981: AIDS impacts America\n\n• Date: June 5\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a report about five gay men who had been diagnosed by local physicians with a rare form of pneumonia – the first reported U.S. cases of what would later become known as HIV/AIDS. The infectious autoimmune disease spreads so fast that by the end of the 1982, 500 Americans would die from what the CDC later calls acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The death toll would rise to 5,000 by 1985.\n\n1982: Mexico triggers regional debt crisis\n\n• Date: Aug 12\n\n• Location: Mexico City\n\nGlobal economic stagnation in the 1970s and early 1980s as well as excessive borrowing among Latin America’s biggest economies boils over when Mexico’s Finance Minister Jesús Silva-Herzog tells the U.S. Federal Reserve his country can no longer service its debt of $80 billion. After the announcement, lenders realize virtually every country in Latin America, led by Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, is not able to pay back loans. The crisis would lead to years of eroding wages, weak to negative economic growth, sky-high unemployment, severe austerity measures, and political instability – known as the “lost decade” in Latin America.\n\n1983: The internet is born\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe internet as we know it today – a seemingly endless collection of websites hosted on servers scattered across the globe – is still more than a decade away. At the beginning of 1983, however, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) – a small network for academics and researchers – transitions to the standard TCP/IP protocol of the World Wide Web. The protocol would become the internet's cornerstone and technical foundation as it allows expanded available address space. The protocol also decentralizes the network, thus also expanding accessibility.\n\n1984: Chemicals kill thousands in India\n\n• Date: Dec. 2\n\n• Location: Bhopal, India\n\nThe chemical disaster in Bhopal is still considered history’s worst industrial disaster. About 30 tons of methyl isocyanate, an industrial gas used to make pesticide, are released at a Union Carbide Corp. plant. About 600,000 poor residents of nearby shanty towns are exposed to a highly toxic compound that kills about 15,000 people and countless farm animals, according to Indian government estimates. The calamity leads to a generation of birth defects. To this day, locals claim the now-abandoned site is riddled with toxic materials left behind by Union Carbide, which was acquired by Dow Chemical in 2001.\n\n1985: Reagan, Gorbachev meet\n\n• Date: Nov. 19\n\n• Location: Geneva\n\nDespite his often bellicose criticisms of the Soviet Union, Reagan agrees to meet with his counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Geneva in the first meeting between leaders of the two Cold War foes in nearly a decade. Though the meeting yields little of substance, it initiates a closer relationship between the two men, who both seem committed to scaling back the nuclear arms race between the two nuclear superpowers.\n\n1986: Chernobyl disaster\n\n• Date: Apr. 26\n\n• Location: Prypyat, Soviet Union\n\nA combination of poor design and human error leads to a power surge in a reactor in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This leads to a massive explosion that puts highly radioactive material into the air. Soviet officials try to cover up the incident, but Swedish scientists notice the increased levels of radioactivity. It takes a little over a week for the radioactive emissions to be contained, but by then radioactive particles had already spread thousands of miles by wind currents to countries as far away as France. A 1,600 square mile area around the plant known as the “exclusion zone” is deemed unsafe, and more than 220,000 people have to be resettled. The radiation causes deformities in nearby livestock and cancer in many people near the blast. Though exact figures are hard to come by, the UN reports years later there were over 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children who were in the affected areas. The Chernobyl disaster is still considered the worst nuclear power failure in history.\n\n1987: Stock market tanks\n\n• Date: Oct. 19\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges 508 points, or more than 22%, on Oct. 19, 1987, later referred to as Black Monday. The drop, in percentage terms, is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\n1988: End of fighting in Iran-Iraq war\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Iraq-Iran border\n\nFrom 1980 to 1988, neighboring Middle East countries Iran and Iraq are engaged in a protracted war. It begins when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launches an attack on Iran in 1980, sensing an opportunity in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iraqi forces initially make incursions into Iranian land, but they lose the area gained in 1982 after Iran is able to mobilize its military and repel the Iraqi forces. Hussein seeks a peace deal that year, but Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini refuses. From 1982 to 1988, the fighting is characterized by sporadic missile launches, attacks on each others’ oil tankers, and the use of chemical weapons, mostly by the Iraqis. By 1988, Iran’s economy is in dire straits, forcing Iran to agree to a UN-brokered ceasefire. The two countries signed an official peace treaty in 1990. Anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million troops were killed in the war and up to 100,000 Kurds.\n\n1989: The Berlin Wall falls\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nCracks in the monolithic Soviet bloc are starting to appear in the 1980s, and the very symbol of communist repression comes crashing down in November, when the Berlin Wall is breached, ending a 28-year division of the city. During the day on Nov. 9, a spokesman for East Berlin’s Communist Party says that starting at midnight that day, citizens of East Germany would be free to cross the country’s borders. Almost immediately Berliners start slamming the wall with axes and sledgehammers. By nightfall, the celebration turns into what one observer calls “the greatest street party in the history of the world,” and the city is reunited. East and West Germany would reunite one year later.\n\n1990: Democracy in Poland\n\n• Date: Jan. 28\n\n• Location: Poland\n\nWith the hold of the Soviet Union and communism on East Europe loosening, Poland's ruling communist party votes to dissolve and become more moderate.

The catastrophe costs the lives of 88 people, and the fire consumes 18,500 homes and businesses. State and federal officials estimate that it would cost $3 billion to clean up debris. Climate change activists say the conflagrations are evidence that global warming is no longer a distant concern and that it is occurring now.\n\n2019: Trump impeached\n\n• Date: Dec. 18\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2019, Donald Trump becomes just the third U.S. president to be impeached. A whistleblower reveals that in July Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as cybersecurity company Crowdstrike. These requests were made just after Zelensky said Ukraine wanted to buy weapons from the United States. After the call comes to light, Democratic leaders file two articles of impeachment – for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They say Trump abused his power by using the office of the president to target a political opponent. The obstruction of Congress charge stems from accusations that Trump Administration officials tried to cover up the whistleblower’s report. Trump calls the investigation a “witch hunt” and denies any wrongdoing. The House passes both articles in a vote that goes almost entirely along party lines, moving the impeachment proceedings along to the Senate.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

But claims about the tech tycoon have reached a fever pitch in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Gates wants us microchipped and Fauci wants us to carry vax certificates,” reads one Facebook post with 22,000 shares. The same language has appeared on multiple posts on the platform.\n\n“Due to the large number of people who will refuse the forthcoming covid-19 vaccine because it will include tracking microchips, the Gates Foundation is now spending billions of dollars to ensure that all medical and dental injections and procedures include the chips so that the only way to avoid being 'chipped' will be to refuse any and all dental and medical treatment,” another viral post on Facebook reads.\n\nThe claim has also gone viral on Spanish language pages and media, with some casting Gates as the mastermind of a massive conspiracy that echoes several other claims, including that Gates helped write the House Democrats’ proposed legislation, the TRACE Act.\n\nGates is not planning on implanting microchips in people around the world through vaccines. The claim has been debunked multiple times since the beginning of the pandemic, however, the allegation persists in many online corners.\n\nMore:Fact check: Bill Gates did not craft contact tracing bill\n\nGates denies microchip conspiracy theory\n\n\"I've never been involved any sort of microchip-type thing,\" Gates said in a call with reporters on June 3, adding, \"It's almost hard to deny this stuff because it's so stupid or strange.\"\n\nGates meant for the call to be an announcement of another $1.6 billion in funding for immunization in lower-income countries, but the rampant conspiracy theories still came up. Many conspiracy theorists have claimed that Gates’ donations to public health efforts in developing countries are secretly mind-control efforts.\n\n“In a way, it’s so bizarre you almost want to see it as something humorous, but it’s really not a humorous thing,” Gates said.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is ripe for misinformation.\n\n“It’s frightening, it’s hard to understand, it’s required governments to restrict individual freedoms, and it will lead to mass vaccinations,” Matthew Hornsey, a social psychologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who studies scientific messaging, told USA TODAY. “That’s a perfect storm for conspiracy theories.”\n\nThere is no evidence that Gates or any major institution is trying to implant microchips in people through COVID-19 vaccines. Gates and others have repeatedly denied the claims.\n\nRegardless, a May 20 Yahoo News/YouGov poll found that 44% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats believe Gates is planning to implant microchips in billions of people.\n\n“This illness has been so severe I thought the anti-vaccine folks would be more muted in their approach, but this is apparently not the case,” William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University, told USA TODAY.\n\n“Here, people have a single issue that they have rallied behind; they don’t trust vaccinations. Conspiracy theories are then selectively embraced to justify that feeling,\" Hornsey said.\n\n\"That’s why people are prepared to believe ideas that seem strange and ridiculous to the rest of us. They want to believe it, so they set a very low bar for evidence.”\n\nThe origins and allure of the microchip conspiracy theory\n\nRich and famous people are frequently the center of conspiracy theories. The fact that Gates is a vocal proponent of public health initiatives long scrutinized by conspiratorial-minded groups only makes him an even riper target.\n\nIt is possible that the conspiracy theory partly originated from a December study published by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The study was funded, in part, by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe team had developed an \"approach to encode medical history on a patient\" by including a small amount of dye with a vaccine. The dye, which would be invisible to the naked eye but observable through a specialized cellphone app using infrared light, would keep a record of a child's vaccines. The technique may be especially useful in developing countries, where record keeping is often more difficult.\n\nThe study never experimented on humans and did not involve any hardware technology, like microchips.\n\nMore:Fact check: Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates won't profit from drug remdesivir\n\n“The quantum dot dye technology is not a microchip or human-implantable capsule and to my knowledge there are no plans to use this for coronavirus,\" Kevin McHugh, a lead author on the study, told Reuters.\n\nGates and his foundation have supported contact tracing efforts around the globe. The Gates Foundation has also funded vaccine efforts in developing countries over the years. These individual facts often combine online into narratives like the Gates microchip conspiracy theory, with no substantiating evidence.\n\n\"The fear of insertion of tracking chips and other things like that into our bodies has been a longstanding bogeyman for theorists,\" Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told PolitiFact.\n\n\"There is a lot of tracking that goes on, but the suggestion that it’s being used in this manner and this way seems absurd,\" he said.\n\nMore:Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?\n\nPromotion of digital certificates\n\nOthers have also tried to link claims that Gates wants to create a \"digital certificate\" or \"digital identity\" for all people with the microchip conspiracy theory. Gates has said that some kind of \"immunity certificate\" may be necessary to reopen the economy, but the intended idea is far from mass surveillance or microchipping.\n\n\"Eventually what we’ll have to have is certificates of who’s a recovered person and who’s a vaccinated person, because you don’t want people moving around the world where you’ll have some countries that won’t have it under control,\" Gates said in a TED Talk in March.\n\nThat certificate would not be a physical implant or chip, but rather a digital item one could have on their smartphone or other personal device, as Gates later explained.\n\nAnxieties about mass surveillance are a persistent issue in the digital age, further exacerbating conspiracy theories about the potential for microchipping from famous tech tycoons or the federal government.\n\nOur ruling: False\n\nThere is no evidence Bill Gates is trying to implant microchips in people around the world through COVID-19 vaccines.

But their union is not recognized by the Cuban government, at least not yet.\n\nThat could change as early as Sunday, when millions of Cubans are expected to turn out to vote for or against a major overhaul of the communist-run island’s more than four-decade-old family code, which would include the historic step of legalizing same sex marriage.\n\n“It’s a legal right and we should all be the same before the law. It’s a question of a human right,” Yennys Hernandez told CNN moments after her wedding at the Metropolitan Community Church, a LGBTQ-friendly church that is one of the few on the island to carry out same-sex marriages.\n\nFollowing the church service, the couple reminded assembled friends and family members to vote for the new family code.\n\n“I believe we are all equal in terms of rights, options, possibilities and in terms of being a citizen and expressing that citizenship. I don’t think we are less than the rest of society,” said Annery Rivera, who said that if the new family code passes, she and Hernandez would hold a civil wedding that would mean in the eyes of the Cuban state they are legally married.\n\nAnnery Rivera Velasco and Yennys Hernandez Molina, who married in September. Patrick Oppmann/CNN\n\nA decades-long wait\n\nAccording to the Cuban government, the 100-page family code provides greater protections to women, children and the elderly as well as allowing LGBTQ couples to marry and adopt children.\n\nMembers in the LGBTQ community in Cuba have waited decades for this moment.\n\nBut some also fear a backlash if the code passes.\n\nFollowing the 1959 revolution, gay people were among those sent to work camps known as Military Units to Help Production along with political dissidents, priests and others considered undesirables by Fidel Castro’s new government. Some gay men and lesbians even said they carried out sham marriages to avoid falling under suspicion.\n\nCastro later apologized for the way homosexuals were treated but a full accounting of how many people were sent to the forced labor camps and who ordered their creation has never been revealed by the government.\n\nIn 1979, homosexuality was legalized in Cuba although many gay men and women said they still faced open discrimination.\n\nIn 1993, the Cuban film “Strawberry and Chocolate” about the unlikely friendship between a young supporter of the revolution and an older gay man was released and sparked a national debate about the treatment of LGBTQ people on the island.\n\nFor more than a decade, Mariela Castro, the daughter of former Cuban president Raul Castro, has openly advocated through a government-funded center for improved rights for gays, lesbians and transgender people.\n\nBut the push for greater equality has faced stiff opposition from both outside and from within the Cuban government.\n\nIn 2018, Cuban legislators abandoned provisions that would have legalized same sex marriage amid fears that a homophobic backlash would have lowered turnout for a referendum to approve a new constitution.\n\nThe following year, Cuban police broke up a peaceful LGBTQ rights parade saying the marchers did not have permission to hold the rally.\n\nCuba’s growing evangelical community in particular has openly advocated against approving the family code.\n\nEvangelical pastor Yoel Serrano told CNN that while evangelicals have been more outspoken about their opposition to same-sex marriage, many groups across Cuban society have their reservations.\n\n“I think about 95% of Christians disapprove but it’s not just Christians,” Serrano said. “There are communists who are not in agreement, materialistic people not in agreement. A lot of people who believe in different things that don’t agree with the changes they want to make with the new family code.”\n\nEven at neighborhood “consultations” organized by the government across the island, some people who identified themselves as loyal revolutionaries said they were unsure how they would vote.\n\n“It would be unfortunate if the code wasn’t approved massively because of one article,” a woman named Melba said – referring to the same-sex provision – at a neighborhood meeting in 2021 that CNN was permitted to cover.\n\nIn the weeks before the referendum, the Cuban government has made a full court press in favor of the new family code across state-run media, arguing the new code is proof the island’s now more than six-decades-old-revolution is capable of adapting to the times.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Cubans will vote overwhelmingly to allow same-sex marriage or if they will use the referendum as a rare opportunity to express their anger at the government over wide-spread power cuts, runaway inflation and increasingly bare supermarket shelves.\n\nAt the church in Matanzas, Rev.

National turnout in Friday's poll was 60.5% of 3.2 million eligible voters.\n\n\"With today's vote we have disclosed who we are: a generous, compassionate, bold and joyful people,\" Prime Minister Enda Kenny said, welcoming the outcome Saturday.\n\nEmily Neenan, a physics student at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, was holding a large rainbow-colored umbrella in the forecourt at Dublin Castle, where \"Yes\" supporters gathered to celebrate outside the Irish government complex.\n\n\"I am absolutely thrilled and I didn't think it would pass with such a resounding yes,\" she said. \"Even in more traditional rural areas, it looks like we have done a lot better than we thought we would.\"\n\nAs Neenan spoke on an unseasonably warm and sunny day in Ireland, an occasional cheer rose up from the crowd as Irish politicians who spearheaded the \"Yes\" campaign passed close by on their way to be interviewed by Ireland's domestic broadcasters.\n\n\"You know, it's about time Ireland did this,\" she said. \"It's time Irish society better understands what it looks like, and needs.\"\n\nBefore official results were released, both sides confirmed the outcome earlier Saturday as votes were tallied.\n\n\"We're the first country in the world to enshrine marriage equality in our constitution and do so by popular mandate,\" Leo Varadkar, Ireland's health minister who revealed he was gay during the campaign, told state broadcaster RTE. \"That makes us a beacon, a light to the rest of the world of liberty and equality. It's a very proud day to be Irish.\"\n\nDavid Quinn, the director of the conservative Iona Institute, a leading figure behind the \"No\" campaign, tweeted: \"Congratulations to the 'Yes' side. Well done. #MarRef.\"\n\nQuinn said Friday that the movement to secure equal marriage rights for same-sex couples in Ireland appeared to be insurmountable. For months, polls indicated the majority of Irish voters were in favor of the change.\n\nBut in the days leading up to the vote, Ireland's government — which supports the measure — warned that attitudes may have been hardening and that victory wasn't certain.\n\nCampaigners on both sides said the high turnout, buoyed by strong engagement from younger members of the electorate as well as the many Irish expatriates who returned home to cast their votes, contributed to the \"Yes\" result.\n\nThe referendum is seen as an especially complex one for Ireland, where about 85% of the population still identify as Roman Catholic even though church attendance has been steadily declining for a few decades. The church's moral authority has been questioned in the wake of a series of sexual abuse scandals and coverups involving children.\n\nThe country has been slow to follow a path of social liberalization that has taken root across Europe. Except in cases where a mother's life is perceived to be in danger, abortion is still illegal in Ireland. A prohibition on divorce was repealed only in 1996 following a national referendum.\n\nDublin's storied pubs were fuller than usual Saturday, and reverie spilled out onto streets all across the capital. Many were carrying balloons, flags and other accessories highlighting an issue that for some in that gay and lesbian community seemed almost too good to be true.\n\n\"It's an incredible day that even two years ago we could not have dared to imagine,\" said Panti Bliss, a well-known Irish transvestite who appeared at a rally at Dublin Castle.\n\n\"I think (outsiders) are still hung up on the idea that Ireland is some sort of very conservative country ruled by the Catholic Church,\" Panti, whose real name is Rory O'Neill, told journalists.\n\nAround the world, 18 countries have approved gay marriage nationwide, the majority of them in Europe. Others, such as the United States and Mexico, have approved it in certain regions. In the United States, 37 states have approved gay marriage and the Supreme Court is currently weighing the issue.\n\n\"This is a joyous day for Ireland and for LGBT people and our allies everywhere,\" Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, a U.S.-based gay-advocacy group, said in a statement. \"We are thankful for the leadership of the Irish people, and we hope that many countries, including the United States, follow suit by extending marriage to all their citizens.\"\n\nVisitors to St. Patrick's Cathedral — founded in 1191 to honor Ireland's patron saint — in central Dublin on Saturday afternoon appeared mostly wrapped up in their appreciation of the building's impressive stonewall facades.\n\n\"It is good that Ireland is approving this legislation,\" said Michael Lendhofer, a tourist visiting from Hanover, in northwestern Germany.\n\n\"But I also think that there are some things about the gay community that I don't agree with. For example, I think they should be more private,\" he said, without elaborating.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/13/countries-where-same-sex-marriage-is-officially-legal/39514623/", "title": "Marriage: Countries where same sex unions are officially legal", "text": "Josie Green\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nMay 24 marked the first day that gay and lesbian couples in Taiwan can register to marry. While the new legislation guaranteeing that right is far from perfect – for example, it doesn’t allow a Taiwanese person to marry a same-sex national of another country where same-sex marriage is not legal – it is the first legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in any Asian country.\n\nWhile heterosexual couples enjoy the right to marry, adopt children, and receive their partners’ pension benefits after death, homosexual couples in many countries face discrimination in all of these categories.\n\nTo compile the countries where same-sex marriage is officially legal, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed dozens of news articles and information from Pew Research Center. Countries where same-sex marriage is legal in some areas but not nationwide were excluded.\n\nTo date, only 29 out of the 195 countries in the world have legalized same-sex marriage. While many same-sex couples have no choice but to wait for legalization – some are together for decades before they are finally able to marry – in many countries, people who can choose to get married are doing so later in life.\n\nOpposition to legalizing same-sex marriage often comes from religious organizations who claim that it destroys the sanctity of marriage. However, a U.S. study has shown that heterosexual couples divorce at higher rates than homosexual couples, with some states having lower divorce rates than others, and within each state, places where more people are getting divorced.\n\n1. Netherlands\n\n• Date legalized: April 1, 2001\n\nChange came gradually in the Netherlands – the first country to legalize same-sex marriage. In 1998 many of the marriage-related privileges allowed to heterosexual couples were extended to same-sex couples. Then in December 2000, despite opposition from the country's Christian Democratic Party, legislation passed that expanded the definition of marriage to include people of the same sex. This allowed same-sex couples to marry, divorce, and adopt children. Finally on April 1, 2001, four same-sex couples married, followed by another 382 that month.\n\n2. Belgium\n\n• Date legalized: June 1, 2003\n\nSame-sex couples in Belgium began receiving recognition through registered partnerships in 1998, but it wasn't until 2003 that Parliament legalized same-sex marriage. This gave same-sex couples in Belgium the right to marry – which granted them the tax rights that heterosexual couples already enjoyed – and also officially recognized the status of same-sex couples who married in other countries. In 2006 same-sex couples were given the right to adopt children.\n\n3. Spain\n\n• Date legalized: July 3, 2005\n\nDespite strong opposition from conservative leaders and the Roman Catholic Church, the Spanish Parliament legalized same-sex marriage in a vote of 187 to 147. This granted same-sex couples inheritance, adoption, and divorce rights. The country's Socialist Prime Minister at the time, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, proposed the bill shortly after his election in 2004.\n\n4. Canada\n\n• Date legalized: July 20, 2005\n\nAlthough the federal government of Canada extended common law marriage rights to same-sex couples in 1999, it wasn't until 2005 that the Canadian Parliament legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. When Canada's ruling Conservative Party attempted to re-open the debate in 2006, Parliament voted against the motion.\n\n5. South Africa\n\n• Date legalized: Nov. 30, 2006\n\nIn November 2005, South Africa's highest court ruled that the country's marriage statutes were in violation of the Constitution's equal rights protections and gave the government one year to amend the legal definition of marriage to include same-sex couples. On Nov. 14, 2006, two weeks before the deadline, Parliament voted to remove restrictions to gay marriage in an overwhelming majority vote of 230 to 41.\n\n6. Norway\n\n• Date legalized: Jan. 1, 2009\n\nIn 1993, same-sex couples in Norway were granted the right to civil unions. Fifteen years later, the government replaced this ruling with a new law allowing same-sex couples to marry, adopt children, and undergo state-funded artificial insemination. The law went into effect the first day of 2009. In 2017, the Lutheran Church of Norway, to which nearly three quarters of Norwegians belong, adopted gender-neutral wording that would allow its pastors to conduct same-sex marriages.\n\n7. Sweden\n\n• Date legalized: May 1, 2009\n\nSame-sex couples in Sweden could register for civil unions as early as 1995, but in April 2009 the Swedish Parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage in both religious and civil ceremonies. Though the law does not require churches to officiate, the Lutheran Church of Sweden voted in October 2009 to allow its clergy to conduct same-sex marriages. Adoption rights had already been granted to same-sex couples in 2003, as well as artificial insemination rights in 2005.\n\n8. Portugal\n\n• Date legalized: June 5, 2010\n\nThe Portuguese Parliament passed a law allowing same-sex marriage in early 2010. After review by the Constitutional Court, the law was signed in May and went into effect in June 2010. The law did not grant adoption rights to same-sex couples, however, and it wasn't until 2015 – after four rounds of parliamentary votes – that a law allowing adoption was passed. The law also improved access to artificial insemination.\n\n9. Iceland\n\n• Date legalized: June 27, 2010\n\nThe vote to apply gender-neutral language to Iceland's definition of marriage passed unanimously in Parliament in June 2010. The country's Prime Minister at the time, Social Democrat Johanna Sigurdardottir, was the first openly gay head of state in the world, and soon after the bill passed she married her long-time partner in one of the first same-sex marriages in Iceland.\n\n10. Argentina\n\n• Date legalized: July 22, 2010\n\nAfter hours of debate, Argentina's Senate narrowly passed a bill granting same-sex couples the right to marry, making it the first country in Latin America to do so. The bill also granted the right to adopt children. The Catholic and evangelical Protestant churches vehemently protested the bill.\n\n11. Denmark\n\n• Date legalized: June 15, 2012\n\nDenmark, the first country in the world to allow same-sex couples the right to register as domestic partners (in 1989), began allowing registered same-sex couples to adopt children in 2010. Then in 2012 the country finally legalized same-sex marriage. While the law mandates that the state church – the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark – allow same-sex couples to marry, it does not require clergy to perform the marriages.\n\n12. Brazil\n\n• Date legalized: May 16, 2013\n\nSince 2011, Brazil has recognized same-sex civil unions and granted those couples many of the same rights as heterosexual married couples, including adoption, inheritance, and pension benefits. In 2013, with nearly half the states in Brazil already recognizing same-sex marriages, the country made them legal nationwide.\n\n13. France\n\n• Date legalized: May 18, 2013\n\nAfter an unsuccessful court challenge by the Conservative Party, France's highest court ruled in favor of a bill allowing same-sex marriage and adoptions by same-sex couples in May 2013. The bill was pushed through by President Francois Hollande, who was elected a year earlier, and his Socialist Party.\n\n14 and 15. England and Wales\n\n• Date legalized: March 29, 2014\n\nMonths of debate ended in the British Parliament when a same-sex marriage bill passed in July 2013 and was ratified by the Queen the next day. The law took effect March 29, 2014, when the first same-sex marriages occurred in England. The law, which applies to England and Wales, does not allow for same-sex marriages within the Church of England.\n\n16. Uruguay\n\n• Date legalized: Aug. 5, 2013\n\nUruguay became the second Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage when the president signed a bill into law on May 3, 2013, though it didn't take effect until Aug. 5 of that year. Civil unions between gay and lesbian couples had been legal since 2008, and adoption rights were granted in 2009.\n\n17. New Zealand\n\n• Date legalized: Aug. 19, 2013\n\nOn April 17, 2013, New Zealand passed an amendment to the Marriage Act of 1955 which updated the definition of marriage to \"the union of two people, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity,\" as well as amendments to other bills such as an adoption rights bill, to ensure that same-sex couples would have the same rights as heterosexual couples. The changes took effect in August of that year.\n\n18. Scotland\n\n• Date legalized: Dec. 16, 2014\n\nAmidst protests by the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church, the Scottish Parliament passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in February 2014. The legislation, which went into effect in December 2014, left it up to churches to decide whether or not they would conduct the marriages. The Scottish Episcopal Church decided to perform same-sex marriages in 2017, and the next year the Church of Scotland voted to draft new laws allowing its pastors to conduct the marriages as well. The laws aren't due for final review until 2021.\n\n19. Luxembourg\n\n• Date legalized: Jan. 1, 2015\n\nOn June 18, 2014, in the first major reform of the country's marriage laws since 1804, Luxembourg's Chamber of Deputies approved a bill allowing same-sex couples to both marry and adopt children. The bill went into effect on Jan. 1 the next year. Luxembourg's first openly gay Prime Minister, Xavier Bettel, took advantage of the laws he helped champion and married his partner that same year.\n\n20. Greenland\n\n• Date legalized: Oct. 1, 2015\n\nGreenland, an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark, was not subject to Denmark's marriage law update in 2012. However, the country's parliament, the Inatsisartut, voted unanimously to legalize same-sex marriage on May 26, 2015. The bill, which also granted adoption rights, went into effect Oct. 1, 2015.\n\n21. United States\n\n• Date legalized: June 26, 2015\n\nWhile 36 states had already legalized same-sex marriage, a ruling by the United States Supreme Court in 2015 finally guaranteed the right at the federal level. The court determined that limiting marriage to heterosexual couples was in violation of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protections.\n\n22. Ireland\n\n• Date legalized: Nov. 16, 2015\n\nAfter 62% of Irish voters (1.2 million people) voted in favor of updating the definition of marriage to include gender-neutral terminology, Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote.\n\n23. Colombia\n\n• Date legalized: April 28, 2016\n\nIn a court ruling stating that marriages by people of the same sex don't violate the constitution, Colombia legalized same-sex marriage in April 2016. Previous court appeals against equal rights had led to legal grey areas and officials refusing to register same-sex marriages, but on April 7, when the constitutional court dismissed a petition against equal rights, the precedent was set.\n\n24. Finland\n\n• Date legalized: March 1, 2017\n\nFinland's bill to legalize same-sex marriage, which was approved by Parliament in 2014, started out as a public petition with over 160,000 signatures. Finland's president signed the bill in 2015 but it didn't go into effect until March 2017, making Finland the last of the Nordic countries to legalize.\n\n25. Malta\n\n• Date legalized: Sept. 1, 2017\n\nMalta, a small Catholic nation that was the first country in Europe to ban gay conversion therapy, legalized same-sex marriage in 2017. With the adoption of gender-neutral terminology in amendments to the country's Marriage Act, Malta also granted adoption rights to same-sex couples.\n\n26. Germany\n\n• Date legalized: Oct. 1, 2017\n\nA few days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel rescinded her opposition to a vote on legalizing same-sex marriage, a majority vote passed legislation that did just that. Though Merkel still publicly opposed same-sex marriage, a study by Germany's anti-discrimination agency determined that 83% of Germans were in favor of legalizing.\n\n27. Australia\n\n• Date legalized: Dec. 7, 2017\n\nThree weeks after a nationwide referendum determined that 62% of Australians supported marriage equality, Australia's Parliament passed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage. Churches are not required to perform the marriages, but service industry workers such as florists and bakers will be in violation of anti-discrimination laws if they refuse service to same-sex couples.\n\n28. Austria\n\n• Date legalized: Jan. 1, 2019\n\nFrom 2010, gay and lesbian couples in Austria could form civil partnerships, but a 2017 court decision ruled that civil partnerships were discriminatory. The court stated that if the country failed to pass legislation countering same-sex marriage, it would become legal Jan. 1, 2019. The first same-sex marriage took place shortly after midnight that day.\n\n29. Taiwan\n\n• Date legalized: May 17, 2019\n\nA 2017 Constitutional Court decision declared that Taiwan's marriage definition needed to be updated to include same-sex couples. The court gave the government until May 24, 2019, to change the law. On May 17, 2019, the legislature passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, making Taiwan the first country in Asia to do so.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The right to life of fetuses is also enshrined in the country's constitution.\n\nA report published Tuesday said 4,000 women travel from Ireland to the United Kingdom and other European countries for abortions every year. Some of them are rape survivors or have fetuses with severe health issues.\n\nThe Amnesty report comes less than a month after Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage by national referendum. Ahead of the vote, David Quinn, founder and director of Dublin-based Iona Institute — a socially conservative group that promotes traditional Catholic values — said abortion rights may be the next to face a referendum.\n\nIreland's Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act — which allowed abortion in limited cases for the first time in the nation's history — went into effect in January 2014. The new law was spurred by widespread attention and outcry following the October 2012 death of Savita Halappanavar.\n\nThe 31-year-old dentist died from septicemia a week after she was admitted to a hospital in the western Irish city of Galway while having a miscarriage at 17 weeks pregnant. She asked for a termination but staff refused.\n\nThe law states abortion is a criminal offense unless the mother's life is at risk, including if she is at risk of committing suicide. However, Amnesty International charges it fails to define what constitutes a risk to life. The group also wants women to be allowed abortions in cases of rape, severe fetal impairment, or a risk to their health at the minimum.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee said last year that Ireland should revise its abortion laws to provide for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, serious risks to the mother's health and fatal fetal abnormality.\n\nThe Amnesty report details the cases of women who left Ireland to undergo abortions, including a woman named only as Lupe, who had the procedure in her home country of Spain after carrying a fetus with no heartbeat for 14 weeks.\n\n\"The human rights of women and girls are violated on a daily basis because of a constitution that treats them like child-bearing vessels,\" Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's secretary general, said in a statement. \"The Irish state can no longer ignore this reality, and the appalling impact it is having on thousands of people every year.\"\n\nBut Cora Sherlock, deputy chairperson for the anti-abortion Pro Life Campaign, said Amnesty has \" become a de facto campaigning group for abortion.\"\n\n\"Amnesty has had nothing to say about horrific human rights abuses like babies being born alive after failed abortions and being left alone to die in the corners of hospitals without receiving and medical attention or care,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"Amnesty raises the complex case of rape,\" she added. \"However if they are truly concerned about protecting women they would seek stronger sentences for rapists and real justice for those who are victims of rape.

But hundreds of people had lined up hours earlier, snaking around the downtown Seattle building on a chilly December night. By Thursday afternoon, about 450 licenses had been issued in Seattle.\n\nLast month, Washington, Maine and Maryland became the first states to pass same-sex marriage by popular vote. They joined six other states — New York, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont — and the District of Columbia that had already enacted laws or issued court rulings permitting same-sex marriage.\n\nWashington Gov. Chris Gregoire and Secretary of State Sam Reed certified the election results of Referendum 74 on Wednesday afternoon, and the law took effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.\n\nThe referendum had asked voters to either approve or reject the state law legalizing same-sex marriage that legislators passed earlier this year. That law was signed by Gregoire in February but was put on hold pending the outcome of the election. Nearly 54 percent of voters approved the measure.\n\nBecause the state has a three-day waiting period, the earliest that weddings can take place is Sunday.\n\n\"We waited a long time. We've been together 35 years, never thinking we'd get a legal marriage. Now I feel so joyous I can't hardly stand it,\" said 85-year-old Pete-e Petersen, who with her partner, 77-year-old Jane Abbott Lighty, were the first to get a license in Seattle.\n\nAfter meeting 35 years ago on a blind date in Sacramento, Lighty and Petersen will get married on Sunday. The couple has been out buying shoes and clothes for their wedding.\n\nSame-sex couples who previously were married in another state that allows gay marriage, like Massachusetts, will not have to get remarried in Washington state. Their marriages will be valid here as soon as the law takes effect.\n\nThe law doesn't require religious organizations or churches to perform marriages, and it doesn't subject churches to penalties if they don't marry gay or lesbian couples.\n\nKing County, home to Seattle, and Thurston County, home to the state capital of Olympia, opened at 12:01 a.m. Thursday to start issuing marriage licenses. While King County stayed open all night, Thurston opened briefly to issue licenses to 15 couples who had entered a lottery, then closed and reopened at 7 a.m.\n\nAsked whether the middle-of-the-night marriage license roll-out was necessary, King County Executive Dow Constantine said, \"People who have been waiting all these years to have their rights recognized should not have to wait one minute longer.\"\n\nIn Seattle, the mood was festive. Volunteers distributed roses, coffee and fruit. Couples canoodled to keep warm. Champagne was poured. Different groups of men and women serenaded the waiting line, one to the tune of \"Going to the Chapel.\"\n\n\"We knew it was going to happen, but it's still surreal,\" said Amanda Dollente, who along with her partner, Kelly Middleton, began standing in line at 4 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nAt the Thurston County courthouse on Thursday morning, Deb Dulaney, 54, and Diane McGee, 64, arrived just before 9 a.m. The couple has been together for 16 years, and they moved to Washington state in 2005 from California, where they were registered as domestic partners.\n\nMcGee said they wanted to get married there but were unable to before voters passed 2008's Proposition 8, the amendment that outlawed gay marriage after it had been approved by court ruling. A federal court has since struck down Prop. 8, but an appeal on that case is still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDulaney and McGee registered as domestic partners in Seattle in 2005, and then through the state when the state's domestic partnership law passed in 2007. Now they wanted to take that final step of marriage, even though they plan on moving back to California in the coming months to be closer to family. They haven't set a wedding date but said a simple service is planned within the 60 days that their license is valid.\n\n\"I feel much more moved by it than I thought I would,\" Dulaney said. \"I thought we were just going to come here, get the paperwork and go home. But now, it's like, 'whoa.'\"\n\n\"It's for real now,\" McGee told her.\n\nCouples in Maryland also started picking up marriage licenses Thursday, though their licenses won't take effect until Jan. 1.\n\n\"I really imagined my life as being just with a partner and never having a wife, so to have this day come about and to be a part of it, it means everything to me,\" said Kim Hinken, who was the first person to get a marriage license at a court in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Approval by Irish voters would be a sea change, in a country that only decriminalized homosexuality in 1993.\n\nPolls close at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) and results may not be known until Saturday.\n\nPre-election polls showed a large majority in favor of same-sex marriage. But opponents, who challenge the potential legal, religious and social implications of such a change, are hoping last-minute doubters of such a major step will turn out to defeat the measure.\n\nElectoral officers across Ireland reported a strong turnout at the many churches, pubs and schools where voting took place.\n\nWhile debate on the referendum has exposed some of the deep, lingering divisions in Irish society, it has also benefited from a lack of vitriolic rhetoric from the church that characterized previous referendums here on divorce and abortion.\n\nAs its influence has waned, and still smarting from child abuse scandals, the church has been careful not to take an active role in the debate. Instead, it has been releasing a series of carefully worded statements.\n\n\"I believe that civil partnerships give gay people clear civil rights and recognition as people committed to one another, and I fully endorse this,\" Pat Storey, Ireland's first female bishop, wrote in a letter to her clergy this week in explaining her \"No\" vote. \"However, I do not think this requires the redefinition of marriage to uphold it, and I do not believe marriage should be redefined.\"\n\nIreland introduced legislation on civil unions for same-sex couples in 2010. While marriage is protected under the country's constitution, partnerships are not, meaning that these rights can theoretically be revoked by future lawmakers. By contrast, changes to Ireland's constitution require a national referendum.\n\nAmong those voting in Ireland's capital on Friday morning was taxi driver John Quinn, who said he voted \"yes.\"\n\nAlthough he was not aware of all the implications of backing the change, he said his instincts told him that introducing marriage equality rights for same-sex couples was the correct and necessary thing to do. \"Sometimes making these difficult decisions is as simple as listening to what your gut says,\" Quinn said.\n\nUnder Irish law, citizens living abroad are entitled to vote in Friday's election but only if they return to Ireland. About 60,000 expatriates are eligible to vote and many nationals living as far afield as Canada and Australia were doing just that on Friday.\n\n\"Ireland is already ahead of the curve in comparison to Australia when it comes to gay rights and if we pass this it will put more pressure on Australian politicians to introduce marriage equality there,\" Mark Govern, who works in Sydney but flew home to cast his vote, told the Irish Independent. Dublin to Sydney is a 21,000-mile round-trip.\n\nThe #HomeToVote hash tag was trending on Twitter.\n\nThe musician Hozier said he was \"flying in to vote\" and that it's \"the most important thing you'll do. Don't forget!\"\n\nOran Doyle, a constitutional law expert at Trinity College Dublin, said that if the vote fails, it is unlikely the government would take immediate steps to force through legislation — as happened in Slovenia after a 2012 referendum was rejected there.\n\nInstead, he said, Ireland would likely wait five or 10 years and then hold another national referendum in the belief that attitudes may have evolved further.\n\n\"Nearly everyone I know thinks I'm too optimistic,\" Doyle, who is gay, said. \"I think this is going to pass 2-1.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/11/06/initiatives-on-ballot/1687885/", "title": "Voters in 38 states decide sweeping ballot initiatives", "text": "Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY\n\nVoters in 38 states cast ballots on various initiatives\n\nFour involved same-sex marriage\n\nCalifornia voters were deciding whether to abolish the death penalty\n\nMaine, Maryland and Washington have made history, becoming the first states in which voters legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nA bill allowing same-sex marriages in Maine passed in 2009, but opponents petitioned for a referendum on the issue and that year 53% of voters opposed it.\n\nIn Maryland, a referendum had sought to overturn a law approving same-sex marriage passed earlier this year by the Legislature. In Washington state, a similar initiative was approved by popular vote.\n\nIn Minnesota, voters were being asked whether the state's constitution should ban same-sex marriage, a step beyond the state's existing law against gay marriage.\n\nAcross the nation, voters in 38 states were deciding sweeping ballot initiatives on everything from same-sex marriage and recreational marijuana use to whether genetically engineered foods should be labeled.\n\nNationally, 32 states have voted to restrict marriage to heterosexual couples while while six others — New York, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont — and the District of Columbia have legalized it either by legislation or a judicial ruling\n\nWashington and Colorado became the first states to legalize recreational use of marijuana.\n\nThe recreational use of marijuana was also up for a vote in Oregon, but voters rejected a ballot measure seeking to regulate marijuana like alcohol. Two other states were considering allowing pot use for medical reasons.\n\nThe Washington measure that was adopted would allow adults to possess small amounts of marijuana and also allow its sale to be regulated and taxed. Estimates have showed pot taxes could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but the sales won't start until state officials make rules to govern the legal weed industry.\n\nTogether, the marijuana votes in the three states represented a pushback against the federal government, which backs the drug's prohibition.\n\nMassachusetts residents approved a new law legalizing medical marijuana for people with cancer, hepatitis C, Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis and other conditions. The state becomes the 18th to do so. Arkansas voters narrowly rejected a similar law.\n\nIn California, voters were deciding whether to repeal the state's death penalty and replace it with life in prison without the possibility of parole. If passed, the 726 inmates on death row in the state would have their sentences commuted to life in prison. If so, California would become one of only two states in which voters have repealed the death penalty. The other is Oregon. In the 17 states where capital punishment is outlawed, the change came through legislative action.\n\nBig spending on food issue\n\nCalifornia voters rejected a measure that would required foods made from genetically modified ingredients be labeled. The closely watched race sparked a backlash from agribusiness and chemical conglomerates, which spent at least $44 million in a bid to defeat Proposition 37.\n\nSchool funding also was a major issue in California, with dueling propositions on the ballot. One, sponsored by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, could bring in up to $9 billion a year. California voters approved Brown's initiative to raise sales and\n\nincome taxes to help balance the state budget but rejected a broad-based income tax to raise money for public schools.\n\nIn San Francisco, voters overwhelmingly rejected draining an 89-year-old reservoir in Yosemite National Park that provides water to 2.6 million people in order to restore the Hetch Hetchy Valley to its former natural state.\n\nIn a tight race, Maryland voters approved expanding gambling to include table games such as blackjack and roulette at the state's three existing casinos and the addition of a new casino near the nation's capital, in Prince George's County. More than $90 million had been spent on the gambling initiative by opponents and supporters, an unprecedented amount in Maryland for a single campaign.\n\nTax limits at stake\n\nIn Florida, voters rejected a constitutional amendment limiting tax revenue growth to increases in population and inflation. The proposal was based on a similar provision in Colorado.\n\nIdaho voted on whether to approve a major school overhaul that would include phasing out teacher tenure, implementing merit pay and limiting collective-bargaining rights for teachers' unions.\n\nA vote in Massachusetts on whether terminally ill patients can legally get drugs from a physician to end their lives was too close to call early today. The issue had been hotly debated in the heavily Catholic state. Similar laws have passed in Oregon and Washington.\n\nThirty-four states prohibit assisted suicide outright, while Massachusetts and six others ban it through common law. Montana's Supreme Court ruled that state law doesn't prohibit doctors from helping patients die.\n\nFight over a bridge\n\nWhether a new bridge between Detroit and Canada can be built was on the ballot in Michigan. Manuel Moroun, the billionaire owner of Detroit's Ambassador Bridge, spent more than $30 million on a constitutional amendment designed to thwart construction of a rival bridge. The state also was considering a law requiring two-thirds legislative support for tax hikes. All proposals on Michigan's ballot failed to pass muster with voters.\n\nIn New Hampshire, voters decided whether to add a ban on a state income tax — a tax the state doesn't have — to their constitution.\n\nA proposal to phase out the estate tax was rejected on the ballot in Oregon. The tax starts at 10% for married couples with $2 million in non-farm assets.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/28/navajo-presidential-hopefuls-say-voters-should-decide-big-issues/10154036002/", "title": "Navajo Nation presidential hopefuls say voters may decide big issues", "text": "Navajo Nation presidential candidates say for the most part that hotly debated topics like abortion rights, marijuana legalization and same-sex marriage should be settled \"by the people.\"\n\nThe Navajo Nation has always taken different stances and approaches when it comes to key issues compared to the states that surround the largest tribal lands. For example, the response to COVID-19 has always been to protect elders and the most vulnerable, which is why strict mandates were put into place.\n\nSo when candidates at a forum earlier this month were asked about their thoughts on gun control, abortion, same-sex marriage and legalization of marijuana, the answers were mostly in tune with giving these important decisions to the people to make.\n\n“When you think of the government and how it works, this is not something that is dependent on me as a leader,” said candidate Greg Bigman. “This is the rights of the people. When we see conflict in law between our traditional knowledge and our customary laws, these are things that need to go to the people. That referendum is what protects our people’s rights.”\n\nAfter Roe decision:Indigenous law experts say it's wrong to expect tribes to offer 'safe harbor' abortions\n\nThe Navajo Nation presidential primaries are slated for Tuesday. Of the 15 presidential candidates, 12 gathered at Arizona State University's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law for a forum hosted by the Indian Legal Program.\n\nDuring the first hour, candidates were given the chance to introduce themselves to the audience before they were each given a minute to answer a variety of questions that ranged from how they would work to preserve the Navajo language to their thoughts on abortion rights.\n\n“The Navajo Nation Code said it's a fundamental right for Diné citizens to choose a candidate of their own choice,” said Derrick Beetso, director of the Indian Gaming and Tribal Self-Governance Programs at the law school. “The purpose of today’s event is that we have informed Navajo voters participating in this upcoming election.”\n\nQuestions were submitted by audience members and they included: How would leaders address decline in Navajo language fluency? Why did the Navajo judicial branch did not receive as much of the $1.1 billion ARPA funding as the executive and legislative branch? How will leaders help Navajos with housing on and off the Navajo Nation? And how will leaders address the issues regarding grazing permits on Navajo, especially transferring it through probate?\n\nSolutions on Navajo Nation can differ\n\nThe Navajo Nation has never elected a woman as Navajo President or Vice President, but in this election, there are six women running for the executive office. Former Navajo attorney general Ethel Branch said she supports a woman's right to choose, that gun control is needed, that same-sex marriage should be allowed and that she has an open mind when it comes to legalizing marijuana.\n\nAlthough the topics are debated in many political races, there are differences in how Navajo Nation leaders would approach them.\n\nAbortion is not easily provided because the Hyde Amendment bans the use of federal dollars to fund any type of abortion care except for rape, incest and if a mother's life is in danger. Indian Health Services or Public Law 638 facilities located on any tribal lands have to adhere to the Hyde Amendment because they are federally funded.\n\nSame-sex marriage is void and prohibited under the Diné Marriage Act passed in 2005, and legislation to change that would require a vote by the Navajo Council before it goes to the president for his consideration to make it legal. Marijuana remains illegal.\n\nWhen it comes to elected Navajo leaders, political party affiliation isn’t necessarily an important aspect for Navajo voters.\n\nIncumbent Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez acknowledged that the Navajo Nation is a matrilineal society, where women are the head of the home, and that means a woman should make her own decisions when it comes to her body. On the subject of same-sex marriage, he said this should be a decision made by the people through referendum because it holds more weight than a legislation passed by the tribal lawmakers.\n\nWhile the forum was held at a public university’s law school, and many of the candidates hold masters degrees, Ph.Ds, or law degrees, a question on how candidates would address higher education for their citizens wasn’t asked.\n\nArizona State University has more than 4,000 Indigenous students, who are part a metro area where the American Indian and Alaska Native population increased by 4,832 to 208,094, according to the 2021 Population Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nCrystal Carr, director of legislative affairs and special projects at Diné College, said Navajo Nation is in a unique position in that it has two tribal colleges. Some tribal nations don’t even have one.\n\n“Diné College and Navajo Technical University are the hubs for innovation and educating our next generation and leaders,” said Carr. “These higher education institutions should be held in high regard to be leading research institutions for the Navajo Nation. Our next Navajo Nation president should understand this and provide support for our institutions who are not currently guaranteed funding from the Navajo Nation.”\n\nThe question of why some of the $1 billion of the American Rescue Plan dollars wasn’t given to the judicial branch of the Navajo Nation was asked during the forum, but Carr pointed out that higher education institutions were not even on the list to receive funding.\n\n“Our next Navajo Nation leaders should not easily dismiss our institutions and education when it comes to funding education for our youth,” she said.\n\nMarijuana debate:Legalizing hemp on the Navajo Nation could be good for business, but what's next?\n\nForums aren't the only way to hear candidates\n\nThe forums have been ongoing throughout the summer, and streamed online for those who haven't been able to attend. The forum at the law school brought the candidates to the urban Navajo population, but for some, the forums aren’t only a time to hear the candidates, but a time to analyze what is being said.\n\nNavajo podcasters Majerle D. Lister and Cody Artist cover Navajo life from their perspective on their show. Their podcast is a mixture of political and cultural commentary, along with some personal stories, all showcasing Navajo living. They say they try to make their podcast as humorous and informative as possible. This election season, they have been covering the presidential race.\n\nLister, a Ph.D student at the University of Arizona, and Artist, a graduate from the University of Idaho College of Law, have mainly been watching the forums as they are live streamed. Lister said he's gone to two forums in person, but for the most part he's been watching them online.\n\n“I didn't see Diné over the election via podcasting, let alone give analysis on the candidates based on their knowledge of the candidates, forums, and history of Navajo government,” said Lister. “Podcasting has become a popular media during the pandemic with multiple new ones forming. We wanted to contribute our portion of political commentary as well to provide the opinions of younger Navajo fathers as new fathers.”\n\nLister said they try to represent the younger generations' opinions as much as possible while being generous to opinions they are more critical toward. This election, Lister said, is exciting because of the range of candidates with different ideas and approaches to politics.\n\n“People are inspired and invigorated by the pandemic to do more for their community and this is reflected in the candidates campaign,” he said.\n\n“We have newer candidates with interesting talking points, insight, and ideas for development. Some range from full use of resources for independence to a more planned transition towards sustainability,\" he said. \"Others argue for improved health care, infrastructure, and increased wages for teachers and workers. Some are former candidates, political leaders, grassroots, lawyers, and YouTubers so the backgrounds are more diverse than previous.”\n\nArlyssa Becenti covers Indigenous affairs for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

It's a social revolution.\"\n\n\"The church has a huge task to get its message across to young people. (It) needs to do a reality check,\" Martin said.\n\nSixty-two percent of voters rejected the nation's traditional social conservatism to make Ireland the first nation in the world to approve full marriage rights to same-sex couples by popular referendum. Eighteen other countries have legalized gay marriage through legislation or the courts.\n\nIreland seems an unlikely place to make history on the issue given the Catholic Church's dominant role in the country and its open opposition to passage of the referendum. About 85% of people polled in Ireland's census in 2011 identified as Catholic. The church runs more than 90% of Ireland's public schools. Twice a day, church bells ring out resoundingly on state radio and television to remind Ireland's devoted to recite the Angelus prayer.\n\nIn one concession to the Catholic clergy, the measure does not extend an automatic right for gay couples to be married in a church.\n\nThe Iona Institute, a conservative Catholic think tank, said in a statement, \"We hope the government will address the concerns voters on the 'No' side have about the implications for freedom of religion and freedom of conscience.\"\n\nOran Doyle, a law professor at Trinity College Dublin, said that while the result clearly reflects the secularization of Irish society, its ultimate impact on Ireland's ongoing debate about what type of society it wants to be may be limited.\n\n\"Opposition to the (constitutional amendment) came mostly from the Catholic Church and other religious groups aligned with it. The fact that they could only get 38% support is significant,\" said Doyle, who is gay.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it doesn't follow from this that there is a pronounced shift in attitudes to other questions, such as abortion,\" he added. \"The primary driver on change on this social issue was people's feelings to and on behalf of gay people whom they know.\"\n\nFor Irish voters who approved the measure, the vote represents a recognition that Ireland needs to catch up with Europe in liberalizing social mores.\n\nHomosexuality was decriminalized in Ireland only in 1993. Abortion remains illegal except if a mother's life is endangered. The right to divorce was granted only as recently as 1996. Contraception was illegal until 1980.\n\nYoung voters were a big reason the gay-marriage amendment passed, even though \"most of those people who voted 'Yes' are products of our Catholic schools,\" Archbishop Martin said.\n\nEmily Neenan, a student from Dublin, epitomizes those voters. \"It's about time we had a better understanding of what the Irish people actually want,\" Neenan said.\n\n\"Our society has changed a lot and the laws have not kept up,\" she said. \"We have had a strange dichotomy between those of us who are very young and liberal and welcoming, and these very old and outdated ways of the Catholic Church.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/25/ireland-abortion-vote/643724002/", "title": "Ireland abortion vote: Country goes to polls in historic referendum", "text": "DUBLIN — Prime Minister Leo Varadkar urged people voting Friday in Ireland's abortion referendum to remove the country's \"legacy of shame\" toward women by overturning the strict abortion law that fiercely divides this Catholic nation.\n\n\"If we don't remove the (Eighth) Amendment from the constitution, our doctors and lawmakers can't do anything for women. They can't do anything for women who have been raped, who are children themselves or who have been given the heartbreaking news of fatal fetal abnormality,\" Varadkar said.\n\nThe vote was expected to be an extremely close contest, with polls closing at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET). The result of the highly controversial issue is expected Saturday afternoon.\n\nBut the Irish Times predicted that voters, 68% to 32%, backed repealing Ireland’s Eighth Amendment that affords a fetus the same protections as the woman.\n\nThe exit poll by the Irish Times was conducted by Ipsos/MRBI among 4,000 respondents at 160 polling stations in 158 Irish constituencies.\n\nA second exit poll published Friday on Ireland’s abortion referendum, this time by the nation’s state broadcaster, showed that voters who support women’s abortion rights won a landslide victory.\n\nRTÉ, which commissioned the poll in association with several Irish universities, found that Irish voters 69.4% to 30.6% want the country to change its constitution so that abortion is legal up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nBoth polls, from RTÉ and the Irish Times newspaper, indicated a far wider margin of victory for the “Yes” side than forecast in the run up to the vote after a long and divisive campaign.\n\nSupport to overturn Ireland’s Eighth Amendment was driven by large numbers of younger voters, according to the exit polls.\n\nFully legalized abortion is perhaps the last significant cultural taboo that Catholic-majority Ireland has grappled with following earlier votes on contraception, divorce, homosexuality and same-sex marriage.\n\nThe vote count begins on Saturday morning, with an official result expected in the early afternoon, although it could come later if turnout is especially high.\n\nAbout 3.3 million people are registered to vote.\n\nIreland has held six referendums on various issues over the last decade.\n\nThe last one was in 2015, on same-sex marriage. Voters endorsed it.\n\nFine weather over much of the country, including the capital Dublin, helped feed the high turnout.\n\nCurrently, abortion is only allowed in Ireland if a women's life is at risk. A \"Yes\" vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment, which states that a fetus has an equal right to life as the woman, would mean that Irish women would be able to get an abortion at up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIt would be a major step for a country where almost 80% of the population still strongly identify as Catholic.\n\nAn average of nine women travel every day from Ireland to the United Kingdom, where abortion is legal, to terminate pregnancies, according to the Irish government. Three women each day take abortion pills bought online, risking a 14-year jail sentence.\n\n\"If the referendum doesn't pass, these women will continue to have to travel abroad in their thousands,\" Varadkar said.\n\nJohn McGuirk, a prominent Irish abortion rights opponent, noted that Friday is an international missing children's day.\n\n\"In the U.K., 8 million children have gone missing since the abortion law was introduced. I hope Ireland will not make the same mistake today,\" McGuirk said.\n\nSave The 8th, an organization that opposes abortion, sent an email Friday morning to supporters and media targeted at undecided voters. \"Abortion does one thing, and one thing only — it kills a baby,\" it said.\n\nIn Dublin, \"Yes\" campaigners handed out stickers at major pedestrian crossroads. And many people who voted on their way to work wore \"I voted\" buttons.\n\nMore:Both sides in Irish landmark abortion vote make final pleas to voters\n\nMore:Ireland to be tested by abortion vote on whether to overturn near-total ban\n\nThe major newspapers carried \"letters to the editor\" from concerned citizens.\n\n\"If we vote 'Yes,' every unborn, wanted and unwanted, will have zero rights,\" wrote Frances Kelleher, from Killarney, in the Irish Independent. \"I do not believe the smart people of Ireland want this unrestricted, abortion-on-demand bill. I will be voting 'No.' \"\n\nIf the vote passes it would be another social-change milestone for Ireland after it legalized contraception (1979), divorce (1995) and same-sex marriage (2015).\n\nIt would also leave just three places in Europe where abortion is illegal unless a woman’s life is at risk: the micro-states of Andorra and San Marino, and Malta.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump plans to cut funding to family-planning clinics that offer abortion services. He has also vowed to appoint enough Supreme Court justices who oppose abortion to overturn Roe v. Wade, the abortion rights decision from 1973.\n\nThousands of Irish nationals traveled home to cast their vote in Friday's referendum. Their stories, and journeys, have been filling up social media platforms using the #hometovote hashtag.\n\n\"No flights left from London, so I have a 4 hour train, 4 hour wait and 3 hour ferry to make it home to vote- which is a walk in the park in comparison to the journey that Irish women are making every day to the UK,\" @MichelleMarleyy wrote.\n\nLiam Dunne, 63, a farmer who lives south of Dublin and supports a woman's right to abortion, said he was confident his side would prevail. He believes that abortion should be a personal decision and not up to the government to decide.\n\n\"The way it is now, it's a bit like in America where sometimes there's nothing to prevent your neighbor from buying a gun.

The spacecraft hit about 55 feet from the asteroid's center.\n\nThe spacecraft had launched its camera and a shoebox-size companion, LICIACube, more than a week ago to photograph the mission, which confirmed the impact.\n\n\"This was a really hard technology demonstration to hit a small asteroid we've never seen before, and do it in such spectacular fashion,\" said Nancy Chabot, planetary scientist and mission team leader at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nThe mission culminates a 10-month-long journey for DART, which cost $325 million. The asteroid orbits a larger one named Didymos, and the two were chosen because they don't pose any threat to Earth.\n\n\"There was a lot of innovation and creativity that went into this mission, and I believe it's going to teach us how one day to protect our own planet from an incoming asteroid,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"We are showing that planetary defense is a global endeavor, and it is very possible to save our planet.\"\n\nVISUAL EXPLAINER: Go inside NASA's plan to crash the DART spacecraft into an asteroid\n\nThe DART team said no adjustments were needed on the mission, and it went \"straight down the middle of what our expectations were.\"\n\nThough DART struck Dimorphos as planned, NASA won't know for weeks – possibly months – what happens after the collision.\n\n\"Some things will likely come out in even days, maybe weeks,\" mission systems engineer Elena Adams told reporters. \"But I would say for the quantitative full answer, a couple of months.\"\n\nThe agency's goal was not to destroy the asteroid but shift its orbit around Didymos enough that it changes both of their trajectories. Dimorphos completes an orbit around Didymos in 11 hours and 55 minutes; NASA hopes the collision shortens its orbit by 10 minutes.\n\nBut changing an asteroid's orbit by just 1% could be enough if one were headed toward Earth, NASA says. There are nearly 30,000 near-Earth objects in our solar system, according to NASA, meaning they come within 120.8 million miles of our planet. More than 10,000 near-Earth objects are about the same size as Dimorphos.\n\nPlanetary defense experts prefer nudging a threatening asteroid or comet out of the way, given enough lead time, rather than blowing it up into multiple pieces that could rain down on Earth. Multiple impactors might be needed for big space rocks or a combination of impactors and so-called gravity tractors, not-yet-invented devices that would use their own gravity to pull an asteroid into a safer orbit.\n\nWhile no asteroids of that size are expected to hit Earth in the next 100 years, only 40% of those asteroids have been discovered as of October 2021, NASA says. Fewer than 1% of the millions of smaller asteroids, capable of widespread damage, are known.\n\nBut for now, astronomers say, humanity should feel safe.\n\n\"Our first planetary defense test was a success,\" Adams said. \"Earthlings should sleep better.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/world/dart-mission-nasa-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA's DART mission successfully slams into an asteroid | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA NASA spacecraft has intentionally slammed into an asteroid in humanity’s first test of planetary defense.\n\nThe impact occurred at 7:14 p.m. ET greeted by cheers from the mission team in Laurel, Maryland. The DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, launched 10 months ago.\n\nWhile the asteroid, Dimorphos, was not at risk of impacting Earth, this demonstration could determine how to deflect space rocks that could pose a threat to Earth in the future.\n\n“We’re embarking on a new era of humankind, an era in which we potentially have the capability to protect ourselves from something like a dangerous, hazardous asteroid impact,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division. “What an amazing thing. We’ve never had that capability before.”\n\nA detailed view of Dimorphos can be seen seconds before the DART spacecraft hit the asteroid. NASA\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos were relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers). The team estimates that the spacecraft hit the asteroid at a point about 55 feet (17 meters) away from the space rock’s center.\n\nThe goal of the spacecraft, in addition to impact, is to affect the motion of an asteroid in space, but DART team members say it will take about two months for scientists to determine if the asteroid’s orbit changed.\n\nThe mission is heading for Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting the near-Earth asteroid Didymos. The asteroid system poses no threat to Earth, NASA officials have said, making it a perfect target to test out a kinetic impact – which may be needed if an asteroid is ever on track to hit Earth.\n\nThe event will be the agency’s first full-scale demonstration of deflection technology that can protect the planet.\n\n“For the first time ever, we will measurably change the orbit of a celestial body in the universe,” said Robert Braun, head of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory’s Space Exploration Sector.\n\nINTERACTIVE: One spacecraft’s journey to test Earth’s planetary defenses\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with orbits that place them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) of Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects, or NEOs, that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nCollision course\n\nAstronomers discovered Didymos more than two decades ago. It means “twin” in Greek, a nod to how the asteroid forms a binary system with the smaller asteroid, or moon. Didymos is nearly half a mile (0.8 kilometer) across.\n\nMeanwhile, Dimorphos is 525 feet (160 meters) in diameter, and its name means “two forms.”\n\nOn the day of impact, images taken by DRACO will not only reveal our first look at Dimorphos, but the spacecraft will use them to autonomously guide itself for an encounter with the tiny moon.\n\nDuring the event, these images will stream back to Earth at a rate of one per second, providing a “pretty stunning” look at the moon, said Nancy Chabot, planetary scientist and DART coordination lead at the Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers).\n\nThe spacecraft will accelerate at about 15,000 miles per hour (24,140 kilometers per hour) when it collides with Dimorphos.\n\nThe DART spacecraft also revealed what Dimorphos looks like for the very first time.\n\n“It looks adorable, it’s so cute,” said Carolyn Ernst, DRACO Instrument Scientist at the Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab. “It looks in a lot of ways like some of the other small asteroids we’ve seen.”\n\nThe egg-shaped asteroid’s surface, covered in boulders, looked similar to Bennu and Ryugu, two other asteroids that were visited by spacecraft in recent years. The scientists suspect that Dimorphos is a rubble pile asteroid made of loosely bound rocks.\n\nThe team is eager to learn more about the impact crater left behind, which they estimate to be about 33 to 65 feet (10 to 20 meters) in size. There may even be shattered pieces of the spacecraft in the crater.\n\nIt aims to crash into Dimorphos to change the asteroid’s motion in space, according to NASA. This collision will be recorded by LICIACube, or Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, a companion cube satellite provided by the Italian Space Agency.\n\nThe briefcase-size CubeSat hitched a ride with DART into space. It recently deployed from the spacecraft and is traveling behind it to record what happens.\n\nThree minutes after impact, the CubeSat will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video. The video, while not immediately available, will be streamed back to Earth in the weeks and months following the collision.\n\nProtecting the planet\n\nDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is relative to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. The spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won’t obliterate the asteroid.\n\nThe fast impact will only change Dimorphos’ speed as it orbits Didymos by 1%, which doesn’t sound like a lot – but it will change the moon’s orbital period.\n\nAn illustration shows NASA's DART spacecraft and the Italian Space Agency's LICIACube before the collision with Dimorphos. Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA\n\n“Sometimes we describe it as running a golf cart into a great pyramid or something like that,” Chabot said. “But for Dimorphos, this really is about asteroid deflection, not disruption. This isn’t going to blow up the asteroid; it isn’t going to put it into lots of pieces.”\n\nThe nudge will shift Dimorphos slightly and make it more gravitationally bound to Didymos – so the collision won’t change the binary system’s path around the Earth or increase its chances of becoming a threat to our planet, Chabot said.\n\nDimorphos completes an orbit around Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After the impact, that may change to 11 hours and 45 minutes, but follow-up observations will determine how much of a shift occurred.\n\nAstronomers will use ground-based telescopes to observe the binary asteroid system and see how much the orbital period of Dimorphos changed, which will determine if DART was successful.\n\nSpace-based telescopes such as Hubble, Webb and NASA’s Lucy mission will also observe the event.\n\nIn four years, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will arrive to study Dimorphos, measuring physical properties of the moon, and look at the DART impact and the moon’s orbit.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe valuable data collected by DART and Hera will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially the understanding of what kind of force can shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that could collide with our planet.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/958032/new-era-of-humankind-nasa-crashes-spacecraft-into-asteroid", "title": "'New era of humankind': Nasa crashes spacecraft into asteroid | The ...", "text": "Nasa has successfully collided a spacecraft head-on with an asteroid the size of a football pitch.\n\nIt was “an unprecedented test” of the US space agency’s “capacity to defend Earth from a doomsday scenario”, said The Guardian.\n\nTravelling at 15,000 miles per hour, the multimillion-dollar spacecraft smashed into the Dimorphos asteroid 6.8 million miles from Earth on Monday evening.\n\nThe ten-month $325m mission, known as Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test), “was the first attempt to shift the position of an asteroid or any other natural object in space”, reported Voice of America.\n\nAlthough it will still take weeks to determine how much the asteroid’s path has been altered, Nasa’s director of planetary science, Lori Glaze, hailed the impact as a “new era of humankind, an era in which we potentially have the capability to protect ourselves from something like a dangerous hazardous asteroid impact”.\n\nThe mission has been compared to the 1990s Hollywood film Armageddon, in which a crew of oil drillers are sent to an asteroid to dig a hole and drop a nuclear bomb into it that will smash the rock apart, so avoiding impact with Earth.\n\nTonight @NASA will crash an uncrewed spacecraft into an asteroid.

Instead the paper said the space agency hopes the Dart head-on impact will alter the trajectory of the asteroid by around 1%, “a celestial nudge which will show it is possible to alter a large object’s trajectory in this way”.\n\nThe BBC’s science correspondent Jonathan Amos said that small rocks similar in size to Dimorphos and Didymos, the asteroid around which Dimorphos orbits, could pose a risk to Earth.\n\n“Although sky surveys have identified more than 95% of the monster asteroids that could initiate a global extinction were they to collide with Earth (they won't; their paths have been computed and they won't come near our planet), this still leaves many so-far undetected smaller objects that could create havoc, if only on the regional or city scale,” Amos said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/954940/space-mission-that-will-protect-the-earth", "title": "The space mission launched to protect Earth | The Week UK", "text": "A first-ever space mission to avert the potential threat of an asteroid collision wiping out life on our planet has launched successfully, Nasa has announced.\n\nCarried aboard a SpaceX-owned Falcon 9 rocket, the Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) spacecraft lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Wednesday morning. Never before “in human history has our species tried to knock an asteroid away from our world”, said The New York Times (NYT).\n\nThe “refrigerator-size” probe, which weighs less than 550kg, “will trek around the Sun to slam into a small asteroid named Dimorphos at 15,000 miles per hour next year”, the paper reported.\n\nThe spacecraft is expected to collide with Dimorphos, which orbits a bigger astroid called Didymos, between 26 September and 1 October 2022.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, “cameras mounted on the impactor and on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft to be released from Dart about ten days beforehand will record the collision and beam images of it back to Earth”.\n\nDart project manager Ed Reynolds told a news conference on Monday that the pair of asteroids, which are about 6.8m miles from Earth, provide the “perfect environment to test this methodology”.\n\nThis week's lift-off was shown live on Nasa TV and on the SpaceX Twitter account, and has been celebrated worldwide. The mission is “packed with milestones”, said space.com, “especially in the first few weeks after launch”.\n\n“The Dart team won't be twiddling its thumbs until the big collision,” the site continued. Another in a series of planned big moments “will come about 20 days into flight”, when they fire up Nasa's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster-Commercial (NEXT-C) engine, “a solar-powered ion propulsion system that could find its way onto future spacecraft”, for its first in-space test.\n\nThe main mission, to deflect an asteroid, is “a dry run for the real deal”, said Scientific American. “One day, a technological descendant of Dart could be used to deflect a planet-threatening space rock, saving millions – perhaps billions – of lives in the process.”\n\nThe odds of such a collision impacting an asteroid’s orbit are “100%”, said Dart’s Reynolds. But much still depends on whether the spacecraft can hit its target. “We keep working harder and harder not to miss,” he added.\n\nIf the intended Dart collision were to fail, the spacecraft should have enough fuel to make a new attempt on a different space rock.\n\nIf successful, Nasa will have “a confirmed weapon in its planetary-defence arsenal”, said the NYT.\n\nBut “there are no silver bullets in planetary defence”, Scientific American cautioned. “The bizarre and variable geology of asteroids may serve to rebuff our deflection attempts, our network of early-warning telescopes is rife with gaping observational holes, and the politics of deciding who can try to deflect an inbound impactor are fraught with uncertainty”.\n\nYet there is no doubt that Dart “represents a major step forward”, the magazine added.\n\n.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2021/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/25/ukraine-russian-invasion-strains-space-station-partnership-us/6930686001/", "title": "Ukraine: Russian invasion strains space station partnership with US", "text": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has yet again raised concerns about the country's relationship with the United States in space, a union which has remained remarkably intact despite geopolitical rifts between the two countries.\n\nFour NASA astronauts, two Russian cosmonauts, and one European Space Agency astronaut are stationed aboard the International Space Station, their home traveling 17,500 mph some 200 mile above Earth where Russian forces continue moving into Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia's decades-long partnership in space has historically been one of the more stable elements of the two superpowers' relations, regardless of what happens on the ground. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine is shaping up to be a stern test of that alliance.\n\nIn a statement to FLORIDA TODAY, NASA's Jackie McGuinness on Thursday said the agency \"continues working with Roscosmos and our other international partners in Canada, Europe, and Japan to maintain safe and continuous International Space Station operations.\"\n\nStationed aboard the ISS right now are NASA astronauts Kayla Barron, Raja Chari Thomas Marshburn, and Mark Vande Hei; European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer; and Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov.\n\nMore:Isaacman orders three more SpaceX launches, including first Starship\n\nThe chief of Roscosmos, the state corporation responsible for spaceflight, issued a statement Wednesday and said he values the NASA relationship but feels conflicted about other areas of U.S. policy.\n\n\"We greatly value our professional relationship with NASA, but as a Russian and a citizen of Russia, I am completely unhappy with the sometimes openly hostile U.S. policy towards my country,\" Dmitry Rogozin said just before the invasion.\n\nIn his first speech since the invasion, meanwhile, President Biden on Thursday said new sanctions levied against Russia will target \"the aerospace industry, including their space program.\"\n\nMore:Officials condemn Russian anti-satellite test; debris close to ISS\n\nThat prompted a tart rebuke from Rogozin who implied there could be consequences for the latest round of punitive measures for the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe,\" he tweeted in Russian late Thursday.\n\nDespite SpaceX success, Russia still provides rides to U.S. astronauts\n\nThe ISS has been continually occupied since 2000.\n\nHundreds of people from several countries have conducted scientific research onboard, and the station's hardware is just as diverse – neither the Russian nor American segments are self-sufficient and rely on each other for everything from power to communications.\n\nFor the time being, the U.S. side has an advantage compared to just a few years ago: SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. It stands as NASA's only access to the ISS without reliance on the Russians, giving the agency some leverage.\n\nFor nearly 10 years after the end of the shuttle program in 2011, NASA paid Russia to ferry U.S. astronauts to the space station. For some missions, it still does.\n\nBefore the invasion, the two countries were discussing flying cosmonauts on Crew Dragon in the future, but the status of those talks is unclear.\n\nOfficials for decades have been prepared for political turmoil to rattle operations in space, where the cost of entry has led to partnerships like the ISS. Russia's invasion of Ukraine isn't the first time tensions have led to questions.\n\nJust three months ago, the Russian military fired an anti-satellite weapon that destroyed an old spacecraft, sending a massive debris field too close to the ISS for comfort. The crew had to take shelter in capsules as the field passed by. In 2014, astronauts and cosmonauts were put in a similar situation when Russian invaded and subsequently annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nGoing back to the height of the Cold War, both partnered on Apollo-Soyuz, the first international space mission that saw two capsules from different countries dock in 1975. Millions watched the orbital meeting that potentially signified a more peaceful relationship in space for the two superpowers.\n\nLooking ahead, however, the ISS partnership could see a changing dynamic. NASA ultimately hopes to transfer the aging outpost into the hands of private industry sometime in the next decade while it focuses resources toward missions beyond Earth orbit.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOn Monday, a NASA spacecraft will deliberately slam into an asteroid called Dimorphos.\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission, or DART, aims to see if this kind of kinetic impact can help deflect an asteroid posing a threat to Earth.\n\nThis illustration shows the DART spacecraft heading toward the asteroid Dimorphos. John Hopkins APL/NASA\n\n“We are moving an asteroid,” said Tom Statler, NASA program scientist for the DART mission. “We are changing the motion of a natural celestial body in space. Humanity has never done that before.”\n\nHere’s what you need to know about this mission.\n\nWhat exactly is DART?\n\nThe DART spacecraft is about the size of a school bus. It has been traveling to reach its asteroid target since launching in November 2021. The spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid system on September 26. Impact is expected at 7:14 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere is it going?\n\nThe spacecraft is heading for a double-asteroid system, where a tiny “moon” asteroid, named Dimorphos, orbits a larger asteroid, Didymos.\n\nDidymos. which means “twin” in Greek, is roughly 2,560 feet (780 meters) in diameter. Meanwhile, Dimorphos measures 525 feet (160 meters) across, and its name means “two forms.”\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers).\n\nNeither Dimorphos nor Didymos is at risk of colliding with Earth – before or after the collision takes place.\n\nWhat will DART do?\n\nDART is going down in a blaze of glory. It will set its sights on Dimorphos, accelerate to 13,421 miles per hour (21,600 kilometers per hour) and crash into the moon nearly head-on.\n\nThe spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won’t obliterate the asteroid.\n\nInstead, DART will try to change the asteroid’s speed and path in space. The mission team has compared this collision to a golf cart crashing into one of the Great Pyramids – enough energy to leave an impact crater.\n\nThe impact will change Dimorphos’ speed by 1% as it orbits Didymos. It doesn’t sound like much, but doing so will change the moon’s orbital period.\n\nThe nudge will shift Dimorphos slightly and make it more gravitationally bound to Didymos – so the collision won’t change the binary system’s path around the Earth or increase its chances of becoming a threat to our planet.\n\nWhat will we get to see?\n\nThe spacecraft will share its view of the double-asteroid system through an instrument known as the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation, or DRACO.\n\nThis imager, which serves as DART’s eyes, will allow the spacecraft to identify the double-asteroid system and distinguish which space object it’s supposed to strike.\n\nThis instrument also is a high-resolution camera that aims to capture images of the two asteroids to be streamed back to Earth at a rate of one image per second in what will appear nearly like a video. You can watch the live stream on NASA’s website, beginning at 6 p.m. ET Monday.\n\nDidymos and Dimorphos will appear as pinpricks of light about an hour before impact, gradually growing larger and more detailed in the frame.\n\nDimorphos has never been observed before, so scientists can finally take in its shape and the appearance of its surface.\n\nWe should be able to see Dimorphos in exquisite detail before DART crashes into it. Given the time it takes for images to stream back to Earth, they will be visible for eight seconds before a loss of signal occurs and DART’s mission ends – if it was successful.\n\nThe spacecraft also has its own photojournalist along for the ride.\n\nA briefcase-size satellite from the Italian Space Agency hitched a ride with DART into space. Called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, or LICIACube, it detached from the spacecraft on September 11. The satellite is traveling behind DART to record what happens from a safe perspective.\n\nThree minutes after impact, LICIACube will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video of the impact plume and maybe even spy on the impact crater. The CubeSat will turn to keep its cameras pointed at Dimorphos as it flies by.\n\nThe images and video, while not immediately available, will be streamed back to Earth in the days and weeks following the collision.\n\nHow will we know if the mission was successful?\n\nThe LICIACube won’t be the only observer watching. The James Webb Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope and NASA’s Lucy mission will observe the impact. The Didymos system may brighten as its dust and debris is ejected into space, said Statler, the NASA program scientist.\n\nBut ground-based telescopes will be key in determining if DART successfully changed the motion of Dimorphos.\n\nThe Didymos system was discovered in 1996, so astronomers have plenty of observations of the system. After the impact, observatories around the world will watch as Dimorphos crosses in front of and moves behind Didymos.\n\nDimorphos takes 11 hours and 55 minutes to complete an orbit of Didymos. If DART is successful, that time could decrease by 73 seconds, “but we actually think we’re going to change it by about 10 minutes,” said Edward Reynolds, DART project manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nStatler said he would be surprised if a measurement of the period change came in less than a few days but even more so if it took more than three weeks.\n\nWhat if DART misses and doesn’t hit the asteroid?\n\n“I’m highly confident that we were going to hit on Monday, and it will be a complete success,” said Lindley Johnson, NASA planetary defense officer.\n\nBut if DART misses its proverbial dart board, the team will be ready to ensure the spacecraft is safe and all its information downloaded to figure out why it didn’t hit Dimorphos.\n\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory’s Mission Operations Center will intervene if necessary, even though DART will have been operating autonomously for the final four hours of its journey.\n\nIt takes 38 seconds for a command to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, so the team can react quickly. The DART team has 21 contingency plans it has rehearsed, said Elena Adams, DART mission systems engineer at the Applied Physics Lab.\n\nWhy do we need to test this, and why on this asteroid?\n\nDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is comparable to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. An asteroid the size of Dimorphos could cause “regional devastation” if it hit Earth.\n\nThe asteroid system is “the perfect natural laboratory” for the test, Statler said.\n\nThe mission will allow scientists to have a better understanding of the size and mass of each asteroid, which is crucial to understanding near-Earth objects.\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with an orbit that places them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) from Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe valuable data collected by DART will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially the understanding of what kind of force can shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that could collide with our planet.\n\nWhy don’t we just blow up the asteroid, like in ‘Armageddon’?\n\nMovies make combating asteroid approaches seem like a hurried scramble to protect the planet, but “that’s not the way to do planetary defense,” Johnson said. Blowing up an asteroid could be more dangerous because then its pieces could be on a collision course with Earth.\n\nBut NASA is considering other methods of changing the motion of asteroids.\n\nThe DART spacecraft is considered to be a kinetic impactor that could change the speed and path of Dimorphos. If DART is successful, it could be one tool for deflecting asteroids.\n\nAnother option is a gravity tractor, which relies on mutual gravitational attraction between a spacecraft and an asteroid to tug the space rock out of its impacting trajectory into a more benign one, Johnson said.\n\nAnother technique is ion beam deflection, or shooting an ion engine at an asteroid for long periods of time until the ions change the asteroid’s velocity and orbit.\n\nBut both of these take time.\n\n“Any technique that you can imagine that changes the orbital speed of the asteroid in orbit is a viable technique,” Johnson said.\n\nAn international forum called the Space Planning Commission has brought 18 national space agencies together to assess what might be best to deflect an asteroid, depending on its size and path.\n\nFinding populations of hazardous asteroids and determining their sizes are priorities of NASA and its international partners, Johnson said. The design for a space-based telescope called the Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission is currently in review.\n\nWill any other spacecraft fly by Dimorphos in the future?\n\nThe Didymos system won’t be lonely for too long. To survey the aftermath of the impact, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will launch in 2024. The spacecraft, along with two CubeSats, will arrive at the asteroid system two years later.\n\nHera will study both asteroids, measure physical properties of Dimorphos, and examine the DART impact crater and the moon’s orbit, with the aim of establishing an effective planetary defense strategy.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/01/15/nasa-astronauts-jessica-meir-christina-koch-all-female-spacewalk/4475929002/", "title": "NASA astronauts Jessica Meir, Christina Koch do female spacewalk ...", "text": "Associated Press\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – Two NASA astronauts ventured out Wednesday on a second all-female spacewalk to finish upgrades to the International Space Station’s power grid.\n\nIt was the second pairing of Jessica Meir and Christina Koch outside the orbiting lab. Last October, they teamed up for the world’s first spacewalk by two women.\n\n“Beautiful view out here,” Meir said as their latest spacewalk got underway.\n\nThe women were barely a half-hour into their latest spacewalk when Koch’s helmet camera and lights came loose. Meir tried to get the camera and light attachment back onto Koch’s helmet, but could not get it into the proper grooves.\n\nMission Control advised the women to remove the hoodlike camera and light assembly, rather than waste any more time trying to attach it. The astronauts asked whether the spacewalk would continue, given the lack of lighting for Koch.\n\n“Good question and, yes, we will continue and we’ll try to keep you two together as much as possible,” Mission Control replied. The astronauts were relieved at the news. “Great. Perfect,” they radioed.\n\n“Just be careful,” Mission Control urged Koch. “You’re missing that additional protection.”\n\nThe helmet trouble put the spacewalkers behind in their work to replace old batteries outside the space station.\n\nNASA is in the midst of replacing decades-old nickel-hydrogen batteries outside the sprawling space station with more powerful, longer-lasting lithium-ion batteries. The batteries are part of the station’s solar power network, keeping everything running when the outpost is on the night side of Earth.\n\nFirst all-female spacewalk:Trump calls NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch to congratulate them\n\nKoch also went out with a male colleague twice last October to install three new batteries. But a charging unit then failed, prompting the need for unexpected repairs by Koch and Meir. Meanwhile, the rest of the critical battery installations were put on hold while engineers figured out why the charger failed so soon after new batteries went in.\n\nEngineers now believe the charger got too cold in the extreme temperatures of space. The solution: exposing the chargers to the sun as much as possible during the battery work.\n\nMission Control expects Meir and Koch to replace three more of the old batteries, with the operation wrapping up during a third all-female spacewalk on Monday. That would make a total of five spacewalks for this latest series of battery work.\n\nKoch is just three weeks away from ending an 11-month space mission, the longest ever by a woman.

He was not one to grunt loudly on shots or celebrate wildly after them.\n\nThe way he wielded a racket helped him to win, yes, and win a lot, to the tune of 20 Grand Slam championships — a half-dozen more than any man before him — across a 15-year stretch, and 103 tournament titles in all, plus a Davis Cup trophy and Olympic medals for Switzerland, and spend week after week at No. 1 in the rankings. It also helped him manage to avoid serious injuries for so long and achieve the consistent excellence over decades he prized.\n\n“Every time people write me off, or try to write me off, I’m able to bounce back,” Federer once said in an interview with The Associated Press. On Thursday, at a little more than a month past his 41st birthday and after a series of knee operations, he announced that there would be no more comebacks.\n\nIt is a loss for tennis, to be sure, and a loss for the sports world. The news arrives less than two weeks after Serena Williams, who owns 23 Grand Slam singles titles, played what she indicated would be the last match of her own illustrious career shortly before she turns 41.\n\n“Some depart, others come and the world keeps going,\" one of Federer's great rivals, Rafael Nadal, said recently. \"It’s a natural cycle.”\n\nOK, the world will keep going. But tennis will not be the same.\n\nNot without Williams, who was feted at the just-concluded U.S. Open. And not without Federer, whose last tournament came last year at Wimbledon, and whose final appearance on court will be next week in London at the Laver Cup, a team event his management group founded.\n\nTennis will miss Federer, the player. And Federer, the statesman and ambassador who spoke several languages. And Federer, the instantly recognizable global pitchman who brought his sport to places all over the world that didn't even have tournaments through exhibitions to raise money for his charitable foundation.\n\nOnce a tantrum-throwing kid — on the court and off, where he would overturn a chess table when losing to his father — who grew up admiring basketball stars such as Michael Jordan and soccer players more than tennis players, Federer became a symbol of his sport and someone known as much for the way he carried himself as the hardware he accumulated.\n\n“He was the epitome of a champion; class, grace, humility, beloved by everyone,” Hall of Famer Chris Evert wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe became friends with Vogue editor Anna Wintour and showed up at the Met Gala. He had a special jacket with a gold “15” on it to don right there on Centre Court after winning Wimbledon in 2009 to break Pete Sampras' men's mark of 14 career major trophies. He kept playing, and winning, well past an age that is customary for that sort of thing in tennis, to the point that his two sets of twins — now ages 13 and 8 — eventually were able to be present in courtside guest boxes. He returned after left knee surgery in 2016, the first significant absence of his career, and used a larger racket head and a rebuilt backhand to collect his last three Slams.\n\n“There won't be anybody like him,\" said Tony Godsick, Federer's agent since 2005. \"There will be people who will win more tournaments or will have more Grand Slams. There will always be a new No. 1. There will always be someone holding a trophy up. But no one has had such a big impact and will continue to have such a big impact.”\n\nWhen it came to defining success, Federer cared about longevity as much as anything. He was proud of facing — and defeating — stars from an earlier generation (Sampras and Andre Agassi), from his own generation (Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt, Marat Safin), from the next generation (Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka) and from the current crop (Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas).\n\nHe chased the first group, dominated the second, dueled with the third — Nadal, with 22, and Djokovic with 21, eventually surpassed Federer's Grand Slam total — and set an example for the fourth.\n\nAside from those major trophies won from 2003 to 2018, Federer put together unprecedented stretches of elite play, appearing in 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals (and 18 of 19), along with 23 semifinals and 36 quarterfinals in a row.\n\nHis contests against Nadal, now 36, and Djokovic, 35, were happenings, tantalizing matchups against a backdrop of differing ways of play and contrasting personalities.\n\n“I was lucky enough to play so many epic matches that I will never forget,” Federer wrote in the section of his goodbye post addressed to his competitors. “We battled fairly, with passion and intensity, and I always tried my best to respect the history of the game. I feel extremely grateful. We pushed each other, and together we took tennis to new levels.”\n\nPredicted to be a star from the time he won the Wimbledon junior title as a teenager — a sentiment that only built when he stunned Sampras in the fourth round there in 2001 — it took Federer a little time to get pointed in the right direction: He did not win a quarterfinal match in his first 16 Grand Slam appearances.\n\nThere were six first-round exits in that span, including at the 2003 French Open. So then came this concern: Might Federer not quite be as good as he, and others, thought?\n\nIt all came together at Wimbledon that year, where Federer claimed his first Grand Slam title at the tournament that always meant the most to him. And off he went.\n\n“There was pressure from all sides; also from myself. I wanted to do better in Slams,” Federer said that day. “I’ve always believed, but then in the end, when it happens, you don’t think that it is possible. It’s an absolute dream for me. I was always joking around when I was a boy: ’I’m going to win this.'”\n\nHe would end up with those men's-record eight at Wimbledon, plus six at the Australian Open, five at the U.S. Open and one at the French Open. He is one of eight men with a career Grand Slam, holds the records for most consecutive weeks at No. 1 in the ATP computerized rankings and for oldest to get there, and set a mark for most total weeks that Djokovic eclipsed.\n\nIf anyone worried that Federer is gone for good, one of those athletes who wants to disappear after the playing days are done, he concluded his farewell note with these words: “To the game of tennis: I love you and will never leave you.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2016/01/21/nishikori-goffin-reach-4th-round-at-australian-open/79152404/", "title": "Another Federer milestone: Win No. 300 at a Grand Slam", "text": "AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The countless records and accolades accumulated over a long and illustrious career don't in any way diminish Roger Federer's satisfaction when he sets yet another benchmark.\n\nFederer became the first man to win 300 Grand Slam singles matches when he beat Grigor Dimitrov, a player formerly dubbed \"baby Fed\" for the likeness of their styles, in the third round of the Australian Open on Friday.\n\nThe 34-year-old Federer already tops many \"most of\" lists in men's tennis — from the number of major titles won (17) to the number of consecutive Grand Slam tournaments contested (65). Yet he still gets a thrill from the numbers.\n\n\"It's very exciting, I must tell you,\" Federer told the crowd following his 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory over Dimitrov.\n\nHe compared the latest milestone to his 1,000th win in tour-level matches, which he sealed 12 months ago in Brisbane. \"It was a big deal for me.\"\n\nFederer is now 67 wins ahead of No. 2 and long-retired Jimmy Connors in terms of Grand Slam singles wins, so the mark is safe for a while.\n\n\"It's not something I ever aimed for but when it happens, it's very special,\" he said. \"You look deeper into it, where it's all happened and how. So it's very nice.\"\n\nFederer's next aim is to break a Grand Slam title drought that dates back to Wimbledon 2012. He reached two major finals in 2015, losing them both to Novak Djokovic, who has replaced him as the most dominant man in the draw. He could meet Djokovic in the semifinals.\n\nDjokovic took care of the man who ended Federer's run in the third round here last year, the Swiss star's worst run at the Australian Open since 2001.\n\nThe No. 1-ranked Djokovic needed only 25 minutes to win the first set against No. 28-seeded Andreas Seppi but had a tougher time in the next two, saving two set points in the tiebreaker before winning 6-1, 7-5, 7-6 (6). The five-time Australian Open champion was playing at the same time as Serena Williams, a six-time Australian Open winner, so he shuffled over to Margaret Court Arena.\n\nHe noted how he liked the renovation — the No. 2 stadium has had a roof installed since his last outing there.\n\n\"I played a quality player who took out Federer last year here and who has been on the tour for many years,\" Djokovic said. \"It was a great test. It was a physical match. I'm just glad I got through.\"\n\nAfter extending a streak of making the fourth round or better at every major since a third-round exit at the 2009 French Open, Djokovic will play No. 14 Gilles Simon in the Round of 16. Federer will play David Goffin.\n\nWilliams raced to a 6-1, 6-1 win in 45 minutes over 18-year-old Russian Daria Kasatkina on Rod Laver Arena to set up a fourth-round match with Margarita Gasparyan, whom she beat early at Wimbledon last year.\n\nIf the fourth-round results go on rankings, she'll meet No. 5 Maria Sharapova in a quarterfinal match that will feature both of last year's finalists. While Williams' form has been good, it hasn't drawn quite the same attention as her bright yellow crop top and pleated mini-skirt.\n\n\"I just wanted to push the envelope again, just bring pop culture to tennis, kind of make it really fun,\" she said. \"It's definitely not built for warmth, but it's built for speed.\"\n\nSharapova had a milestone victory when she beat Lauren Davis 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-0 to record her 600th win at tour level, becoming the 17th and only fourth active women's player to reach the mark.\n\n\"I think it's a proud number,\" the 2008 champion and four-time Australian Open finalist said. She next plays No. 12 Belinda Bencic.\n\nNo. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska advanced to a fourth-rounder against Anna-Lena Friedsam, who beat Roberta Vinci — the Italian player who ended Williams' bid for a calendar-year Grand Slam in 2015.\n\nAlso progressing were No. 10 Carla Suarez Navarro and Russian-born Australian Daria Gavrilova, who held off No. 28 Kristina Mladenovic 6-4, 4-6, 11-9.\n\nThe home crowd couldn't quite lift No. 29 Nick Kyrgios, who was distracted by the noise and upset with the umpire in his late-night, four-set loss to No. 6 Tomas Berdych, a two-time semifinalist.\n\nNo. 12 Marin Cilic also lost but Kei Nishikori — whom Cilic beat in the 2014 U.S. Open final — advanced over No. 26-seeded Guillermo Garcia-Lopez and will next play 2008 Australian Open finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/02/12/esther-vergeer-retires-wheelchair-tennis/1912267/", "title": "Wheelchair tennis star Esther Vergeer retires", "text": "AP\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — After a 10-year winning streak in wheelchair tennis, Esther Vergeer felt she had nothing left to prove.\n\nThe 31-year-old Dutchwoman retired Tuesday, ending one of the most amazing careers in any sport.\n\n\"I'm hugely proud of my performances, my titles, and can look back on my career with a great feeling,\" Vergeer said at the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam. \"Keeping going would not add anything.\"\n\nVergeer won the women's singles gold at four straight Paralympics starting in Sydney in 2000 and ending in London last year.

For only the second time, he blew that big edge and lost.\n\nA couple of uncharacteristically sloppy overheads and a framed backhand in a third-set tiebreaker began Nadal’s undoing, and his bid for a men’s-record 21st major championship eventually ended in the Australian Open quarterfinals Wednesday with 3-6, 2-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-5 loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\n“I have to go back home,” Nadal said, “and practice to be better.”\n\nAt his put-the-ball-where-he-wants-it best in the early going, Nadal went ahead rather easily, winning 27 consecutive points on his serve in one stretch and running his streak of consecutive sets won at major tournaments to 35, one shy of Roger Federer’s record for the professional era.\n\nNadal and Federer are currently tied at 20 Grand Slam singles titles, more than any other man in the history of a sport that dates to the late 1800s.\n\nBut Tsitsipas never wavered and that surprisingly poor tiebreaker by Nadal — thinking too far ahead, perhaps? — helped hand over the third set and begin the epic comeback.\n\n“I started very nervous, I won’t lie,” the fifth-seeded Tsitsipas said. “But I don’t know what happened after the third set. I just flied like a little bird. Everything was working for me. The emotions at the very end are indescribable.”\n\nAs Tsitsipas played, in Nadal’s estimation, a “very very high level of tennis” over the last two sets, the 34-year-old Spaniard’s play dipped considerably.\n\nNadal made a total of only 10 unforced errors in the first two sets combined, then had 11 in the third, 14 in the fourth and seven in the fifth.\n\nThe only other occasion in which Nadal went from a two-set advantage to a defeat in a Slam came at the 2015 U.S. Open against Fabio Fognini (who just so happened to have lost to Nadal in the fourth round at Melbourne Park this year).\n\nSo now, instead of Nadal attempting to continue his pursuit of Federer, it will be Tsitsipas — a 22-year-old from Greece with a flashy game — who will meet 2019 U.S. Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals Friday.\n\nNeither Tsitsipas nor Medvedev has won a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nIn the other men’s semifinal, 17-time major champion and No. 1-ranked Novak Djokovic will face 114th-ranked qualifier Aslan Karatsev, who is making his Grand Slam debut.\n\nThe women’s semifinals Thursday (Wednesday night EST) are Serena Williams vs. Naomi Osaka, and Jennifer Brady vs. Karolina Muchova.\n\nNadal won the 2009 Australian Open, but it is the only major he hasn’t won at least twice, with 13 at Roland Garros, four at the U.S. Open and two at Wimbledon.\n\n“Sometimes the things go well,” Nadal said, “and sometimes the things go worse.”\n\nHe came into this year’s first major with doubts about his back, citing that as his reason for pulling out of the ATP Cup team competition that preceded the Australian Open and saying the problem prevented him from practicing properly for about three weeks.\n\nBut Nadal said after the loss to Tsitsipas that his back was not an issue.\n\nNadal hadn’t ceded a set at Melbourne Park through four matches; he won all 21 sets he played at last year’s French Open, where he picked up his 20th Slam trophy to pull even with Federer (Williams has 23, Margaret Court 24).\n\nFederer hasn’t competed in more than a year after two knee operations.\n\nWith squawking seagulls providing an odd nighttime soundtrack at Rod Laver Arena — but no spectators, because they’ve been banned during a local COVID-19 lockdown, and won’t return until Thursday — Nadal always had an answer for anything Tsitsipas tried at the outset.\n\nRush the net? Here comes an angled passing shot. Hang out at the baseline? Good luck trying to outslug Nadal from there.\n\nIt looked like it could be a repeat of their 2019 semifinal in Australia, when Nadal overwhelmed Tsitsipas and allowed him to win just six games.\n\nBut this time, Tsitsipas came in after three full days off, because the man he was supposed to face in the fourth round, No. 9 Matteo Berrettini, withdrew with an abdominal injury.\n\nThat – and a 12-year age difference — might have contributed to Tsitsipas’ being fresher in the late going as they played beyond four hours. Tsitsipas, who’s been pegged as a future star for years, nearly pulled off this sort of shocker against Djokovic in the French Open semifinals in October, going from two sets down to forcing a fifth.\n\nTsitsipas couldn’t seal the deal back then.\n\nHe did against Nadal.\n\nTsitsipas moved out front at 6-5 in the fifth by breaking at love as Nadal flubbed a series of shots, then served out the victory by converting his third match point with a backhand winner.\n\n“I’m speechless. I have no words to describe what just happened on the court,” Tsitsipas said shortly after the match ended. “It’s an unbelievable feeling to be able to fight at such a level and just be able to give it my all out on the court.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/17"}]}

Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nA sense of normality slowly returned to the monarchy this week, as the royals’ extended period of mourning following the death of Queen Elizabeth II came to an end.\n\nAnd, in turn, a fresh era began for the new Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nWilliam and Catherine visited Wales this week for the first time since the Queen’s death, an important initial trip that they probably hope will set the tone for their new roles.\n\nThere was plenty of appreciation for the pair. Large crowds turned out to cheer their arrival in Anglesey and Swansea, where the royals greeted well-wishers and visited local charities.\n\n“Today’s visit is history. We had to be here,” Rebecca Crompton, whose son presented a bouquet of flowers to Kate, told the PA Media news agency. “We were actually on the way to school when I changed my mind and decided to bring him down here for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”\n\nBut as they grow into the positions, William and Kate will chart their own course as the Waleses, prince and princess of a nation that is generally supportive of the monarchy and the union but also retains a strong identity separate from the rest of Britain.\n\nTheir success in the role will be of vital importance to the monarchy, which will be eager to keep a firm foothold in every part of the United Kingdom even as the question of independence swirls in Scotland and, increasingly, in Wales, too.\n\nCNN understands that, despite the then-Prince Charles having been given a grand investiture ceremony by the Queen when he became Prince of Wales in 1969, there are no plans for an investiture for William.\n\nCatherine was presented with flowers by four-year-old Theo Crompton during their visit to the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) Lifeboat Station. WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nCharles’ own investiture at Caernarfon Castle saw protests by Welsh nationalists, who objected to a new Prince of Wales. The title has been traditionally bestowed on the heir to the throne since the 1300s, shortly after the English crown annexed Wales, which borders western England. The two nations have generally enjoyed a close legal and political relationship, but nationalist opposition toward English rule has always been present, too.\n\nInstead of an investiture, William and Kate will focus on deepening the trust and respect of the people of Wales over time, and will return to the nation before Christmas, CNN understands.\n\nThat process apparently includes learning the language. Reverend Steven Bunting, who welcomed the couple at St. Thomas Church in Swansea on Tuesday, told PA Media: “The Prince of Wales was even talking about learning Welsh, and said he’d learned the word ‘paned’ meaning cup of tea and ‘bara brith,’” a traditional tea bread.\n\n“I think he’s taking being Prince of Wales very, very seriously,” Bunting said.\n\nWilliam is following in the footsteps of his father, who famously studied Welsh at Aberystwyth University. The traditional language has seen a revival in recent years, driven particularly by young speakers – another symbol of the distinct culture of the nation.\n\nSupport for independence is also growing among Wales’ three million inhabitants, studies have shown, and senior politicians in the region have long pushed for increased political devolution and decision-making powers.\n\nAnd while nationalism doesn’t always go hand in hand with republicanism, there are signs that William and Kate will have to face that, too.\n\nSome anti-monarchy protesters made their voices heard during Charles’ first visit to Cardiff as King earlier this month, with one heckling him face-to-face about public taxes funding the monarchy. An online petition to scrap the Prince of Wales title “out of respect to Wales” has, meanwhile, gathered more than 35,000 signatures in three weeks.\n\nPrince Charles during his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1969. Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nKeeping the nations of the UK together is an increasingly high priority for Britain’s major political parties, and the royals play a key role.\n\nThe late Queen’s deep links to Scotland were often raised as a symbol of English-Scottish closeness when the issue of a vote on independence flared up there. The monarchy and Downing Street alike will hope that a similar relationship can be maintained by William and Kate in Wales.\n\nIn many ways, it’s a position for which the couple are well prepared. William and Kate lived on the picturesque Welsh island of Anglesey before the birth of their first child, George, allowing them to enjoy a relatively normal life away from the glare of paparazzi.\n\nThe prince rented a cottage there and was able to drive himself to work and socialize with his friends in the Royal Air Force, while Kate would be spotted shopping in the local supermarket, CNN reported back in 2011. Their presence generally failed to bother or impress the locals, who were pretty blasé about their royal neighbors.\n\nBut in their new roles, and with William now the heir to the throne, things will be very different – and any visit to Wales will take on extra importance.\n\nThe Queen died of old age, death certificate confirms.\n\nThe cause of Queen Elizabeth II’s death has been listed as old age on her death certificate, which was released on Thursday.\n\nElizabeth died at 3:10 p.m. local time (10:10 a.m. ET) on Thursday, September 8, at Balmoral Castle, the document said. She was 96.\n\nHer death was announced by Buckingham Palace just over three hours later.\n\nThe Queen’s daughter, Princess Anne, signed her death certificate. Anne accompanied her mother’s coffin on every leg of its journeys through Scotland and London, until it was buried at Windsor Castle.\n\nNational Records of Scotland\n\nNew coins bearing King Charles III’s image revealed.\n\nThe first British coins depicting the new King have been unveiled by the Royal Mint in London.\n\nA special £5 coin and a 50 pence piece were displayed by the mint, showing Charles’ profile. As per tradition, he is facing the opposite direction to the previous monarch – and because he is a male monarch, he is not wearing a crown.\n\nBritish rulers have been depicted on coins for more than 1,100 years, starting with Alfred the Great in the ninth century, according to the Royal Mint.\n\nThe Queen’s profile had become ever-present in British public life over the past seven decades, but the visual identity of Charles III’s reign has started coming together over the past week – and coins are just one part of it.\n\nOn Monday, the new royal cypher was unveiled. The image is used on letterheads, British government buildings, state documents and mailboxes, and replaces Elizabeth’s E II R symbol.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the Royal Mail announced that Charles’ image will feature on its “everyday” stamps.\n\n“Royal Mail will reveal the image and timings of the new Definitive stamps and the new silhouette in due course,” the postal service said in a press release.\n\nKing Charles faces the opposite direction as the Queen, as per tradition.\n\nRoyal supporters line up in Windsor to see the Queen’s final resting place.\n\nPerhaps the most enduring symbol of Britain’s response to the Queen’s death was “The Queue” – a miles-long line that snaked along the Thames river in London, made up of mourners desperate to pay their respects at the monarch’s lying-in-state.\n\nBut Britain’s well-known penchant for queuing didn’t end there. Following Elizabeth II’s burial last Monday, a new, more modest line has emerged – this time occupied by people who want to visit her grave within St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.\n\nThe Castle’s grounds opened to the public Thursday for the first time since the Queen’s death. “The castle feels, like, empty, gloomy. Nobody’s living in it,” the first person in the queue – Anne Daley, 65, from Cardiff, Wales – told PA Media. “You know, you’ve lost the Queen, you’ve lost the duke, you lost the corgis.”\n\n“It’s like when you’ve sold your house and all the history is gone,” she said.\n\nThe line to enter the castle ran throughout the grounds of the building and beyond, PA reported.\n\nAn engraved ledger stone featuring the name of the late monarch was installed in the King George VI Memorial Chapel, an annex to the main chapel, after a private service attended by her family.\n\nThe slab is hand-carved from Belgian black marble and features brass letter inlays reading the names of her parents – King George VI and Queen Elizabeth – followed by the late Queen’s name along with that of her husband, Prince Philip. A garter star separates the two royal couples, and the years of birth and death have been inscribed next to each name.\n\nThe ledger stone at the King George VI Memorial Chapel. Royal Collection Trust/The Dean and Canons of Windsor/Handout/Reuters\n\nPostcards from royals around the globe.\n\nA rift has emerged in the Danish royal family following a decision by Queen Margrethe to strip four of her eight grandchildren of their royal titles in order to “future-proof” the monarchy.\n\nThe 82-year-old monarch, who this year celebrated half a century on the throne, announced on Thursday that from next year the children of her younger son, Prince Joachim, will no longer be known as prince and princess.\n\nThe reason for the move, according to an announcement from the Danish royal household, is to allow the junior royals to lead more normal lives; it also follows similar decisions by other royal families to slim down their monarchies.\n\nThe announcement explained: “The Queen’s decision is in line with similar adjustments that other royal houses have made in various ways in recent years.”\n\nIn a telephone conversation with CNN, Helle von Wildenrath Løvgreen, press secretary to Joachim’s ex-wife, Countess Alexandra, said the countess was “very sad and in shock” that two of her children will lose their titles, along with the children of her ex-husband.\n\n“She can’t believe why and why now, because there’s no good reason. They would lose their titles anyway when they get married one day. Her sons are young men so maybe they might get married in the near future so why shouldn’t it wait until that day so that the titles would disappear on a happy day?”\n\nRead the full story here.", "authors": ["Max Foster Rob Picheta", "Max Foster", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/europe/prince-archie-princess-lilibet-royal-title-intl/index.html", "title": "Archie and Lilibet become prince and princess | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nFollowing the death of the Queen, Harry and Meghan’s children have become His Royal Highness Prince Archie of Sussex and Her Royal Highness Princess Lilibet of Sussex.\n\nThe change is a result of conventions created over a century ago. Under rules set out by George V in 1917, the grandchildren of the monarch automatically receive royal titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of King Charles III, Archie and Lilibet now have the right to be prince and princess, whereas they did not immediately qualify as the great-grandchildren of the Queen.\n\nMeghan last year made a damning suggestion that this title might be denied to Archie because of his mixed-race ancestry. In an interview with broadcaster Oprah Winfrey, the Duchess of Sussex said a member of the royal family had expressed “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born.”\n\n“That was relayed to me from Harry. Those were conversations that the family had with him,” Meghan added, but declined to reveal who was involved in those conversations. “That would be very damaging to them,” she said.\n\nThe duchess said these comments were made at the same time as the couple were told Archie wouldn’t have security or an official title. She said there had also been “conversations” while she was pregnant about the convention being changed once Charles became King, meaning Archie would lose his right to a title.\n\nShe insisted to Winfrey that her concern over her son’s right to the title of prince was linked to her desire for him to be given police protection. Lilibet was born after the interview was conducted.\n\nThe coffin of Queen Elizabeth II lies in state at Westminster Hall in London on Monday, September 19.

The charity also partnered with Aerial Recovery Group, made up for former Green Berets who will \"go in with vans and extract people who are under siege\" in Ukraine.\n\nMila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher join video call with Zelenskyy after $35 million fundraiser\n\nMila Kunis is giving back to her homeland of Ukraine with the help of husband Ashton Kutcher, and the efforts have not gone unnoticed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe couple has helped raise over $35 million in humanitarian relief for the people of Ukraine through their fundraiser on GoFundMe.\n\nZelenskyy thanked the celebrities in a tweet on Sunday, showcasing a photo of the two joining him for a Zoom video call.\n\n\"@aplusk & Mila Kunis were among the first to respond to our grief,\" the president tweeted. \"They have already raised $35 million & are sending it to @flexport & @Airbnb to help refugees. Grateful for their support. Impressed by their determination. They inspire the world. #StandWithUkraine\"\n\nKunis and Kutcher exceeded their initial fundraising goal of $30 million, thanks to the donations of more than 65,000 people, the couple said in a recent video.\n\n\"We're gonna do everything we can to ensure that the outpouring of love that came from you all as a part of this campaign finds the maximum impact with those in need,\" Kutcher said in the video.\n\nThe couple matched $3 million for the fundraiser, which will benefit freight forwarder Flexport and vacation rental company Airbnb. The two organizations will facilitate aid efforts by \"transporting humanitarian aid to known NGOs on the ground\" and \"providing free, short-term housing to up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine,\" Kunis and Kutcher said.\n\n\"The people of Ukraine are strong and brave, but being strong and brave doesn't mean you're not worthy of support,\" Kunis said in a video announcing the fundraiser.\n\n'DWTS' pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy returns to Poland\n\nUkrainian former \"Dancing With the Stars\" professional dancer Maksim Chmerkovskiy has returned to the front lines to assist his home country in relief efforts after fleeing earlier this month.\n\nThe choreographer, 42, shared a video update March 20 on Instagram, telling his followers he's \"fine\" after returning to Warsaw, Poland, three weeks after his exit. He was able to make it on a flight to Los Angeles following an \"insane\" exit from Ukraine to Warsaw via train that he said was going to require \"lots of therapy.\"\n\nHe's now working with his father and brother, fellow \"DWTS\" choreographer Val Chmerkovskiy, on their new organization, Baranova 27, named after their childhood address in Odesa, Ukraine.\n\n\"People are getting tired, and this is the time that I would like to ask everybody to realize that it didn't end or slow down, it got worse in Ukraine,\" Chmerkovskiy said, pleading for viewers to rest but then \"come back to us\" and continue helping to support those in need.\n\nIn the first few weeks, they've raised about $123,000, shipped 134,000 pounds of items such as first aid, baby care and hygiene products. Now, they plan to start a new GoFundMe campaign, aiming to collect $250,000, primarily for shipping costs.\n\n\"We now showed Ukraine as a world that we can all do it together, and we have to continue proudly doing that,\" he said.\n\nA few weeks prior, Chmerkovskiy described his harrowing train ride out of Ukraine and into Poland as \"like out of a movie\" and said he felt \"guilt\" for escaping. He said he went 36 hours without sleep during the trek and remained standing for most of it so as not to take up an additional seat.\n\n\"I'm having a horrible time. I'm having very mixed emotions. I have my friends there, my friends in (the) frontline,\" he said. \"I can't hear from some of the people. I can't get in touch with them. I don't know if they're dead.\"\n\nMichael Keaton, more stars speak out at Critics Choice Awards\n\nMichael Keaton, Billy Crystal, Maria Bakalova and more stars took time during their appearances on stage at the Critics Choice Awards to acknowledge the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and show support to the country under siege.\n\nKeaton, who won best actor in a limited series for his work in \"Dopesick,\" delivered a powerful speech on opioid addiction, which the series explores, and on the war.\n\n\"I want to say thank you to fellow actor President Zelenskyy, and keep up the fight! There is only one way to change things environmentally, socially, and for some sort of racial justice and social justice, two words: Voting rights,\" he said before closing. \"Voting rights and voter suppression.\"\n\nUkraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy won ‘DWTS,’ voiced ‘Paddington’ before becoming president\n\nCrystal shared that his grandmothers were from Odessa and Kyiv and escaped to America and that their laughter fueled his career. \"I pray that somehow, someway, there can be laughter and joy in that part of the world once again,\" he said.\n\nBakalova, who noted that she is from Bulgaria, \"just a few hundred miles from Ukraine,\" praised the \"bravery of the people of Ukraine, who are defending their right to independence and democracy.\"\n\nCritics Choice Awards:Kristen Stewart, fiancée sneak past reporters, more you didn't see on TV\n\nFormer Miss Ukraine describes Kyiv escape, asks for aid\n\nVeronika Didusenko, who was crowned Miss Ukraine in 2018, said she and her 7-year-old son were awoken on the first day of the invasion to the sounds of air raid sirens and explosions, and they joined thousands of others on the road to evacuate.\n\n“On my … journey to the border of Ukraine, there was no place where sirens would not sound, where rockets and bombs would not explode,” she said.\n\nDidusenko told her story at a news conference in the Los Angeles office of women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred, who said she became friends with the former beauty queen several months ago.\n\nThis heartbreaking image from Ukraine is a wakeup call: A free press is essential to freedom\n\nDidusenko and her son eventually made it to Moldova and traveled through other European countries before reaching Geneva, Switzerland.

In some moments it was so sensitive and hard to not show my emotions,” Buialskyi said after the show. “I'm so grateful to the theater, to all the people who helped to do this.\"\n\nSting sings 'Russians' to support Ukraine: 'Never thought it would be relevant again'\n\nSting revived his suddenly relevant ‘80s solo song “Russians” with a new performance on Instagram.\n\n“In the light of one man’s bloody and woefully misguided decision to invade a peaceful, unthreatening neighbor, the song is, once again, a plea for our common humanity,” he told followers on Saturday, noting that he’s rarely sung the song since it was written during the Cold War for his first solo album, 1985’s “The Dream of the Blue Turtles.”\n\n“For the brave Ukrainians fighting against this brutal tyranny, and also the many Russians who are protesting this outrage despite the threat of arrest and imprisonment,\" Sting wrote. \"We, all of us, love our children.

Officials held a groundbreaking ceremony Friday for the more than 40,000-square-foot building, which will include a 1,000-seat auditorium, 10 classrooms, laboratories and a permanent home for U.S. Cyber Camp, which focuses on computer technology. Other companies and individuals made additional donations, and the state provided an economic development grant for construction, which officials said would cost about 40% more than first anticipated because of increased costs for materials and labor. The coronavirus pandemic delayed the project, which already is underway and is set to open in March 2023.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A man upset over the impeachment of former President Donald Trump, illegal immigration and the direction he thinks the country is headed is accused of threatening the lives of the state’s two Republican U.S. senators in a series of profanity-laced voicemails that included saying he would hire an assassin to kill one. “Your life is worth $5,000, that’s all it’s worth,” a message left at the office of Sen. Lisa Murkowski said. “And as you let in these terrorists, assassins, guess what? I’m going to use them. I’m going to hire them.” In a voicemail to Sen. Dan Sullivan, the caller vowed to use “illegals for target practice,” assistant U.S. Attorney General Ryan Tansey said. Some of the voicemails were played in U.S. District Court in Fairbanks on Friday during the first appearance for Jay Allen Johnson, 65, who moved to rural Delta Junction, Alaska, from Texas in 2019. The retired man had earlier ties to the Fairbanks area. Johnson’s wife, Catherine Pousson-Johnson, testified on her husband’s behalf in trying to have him released, detailing a series of recent surgeries he’s had: “He’s in pain right now. My husband is an old man, and he gets very angry listening to politics on the news.” Tansey later asked her if she was aware her husband was making threats against two U.S. senators. “Who hasn’t?” she replied.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Child-welfare officials considering whether to terminate parental rights of inmates facing long prison terms have a constitutional duty to offer reunification services to those prisoners who want to try to keep their children, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday. Though Arizona law doesn’t require the state to offer reunification services to help maintain bonds between prisoner-parents and children, it’s necessary because a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision said parents have a “fundamental liberty interest” in the care, custody and management of their children, the Arizona justices said. They acknowledged that their ruling’s requirement for offering reunification services to prisoners serving long sentences departs from a 2005 state Court of Appeals ruling. It’d be difficult to maintain parental relationships while separated, “but an incarcerated parent can maintain a bond with a child in other ways, such as through visits, phone calls, letters, pictures, and gifts,” the ruling said. The justices considered the reunification issue as part of a father’s appeal of a juvenile court’s termination of his parental rights to two young children. Though the court misapplied two legal standards, other circumstances and the childens’ best interests still warranted termination so that they could be adopted by a family, the ruling said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers on Friday rejected legislation preventing businesses from requiring employees to say whether they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19, after the House speaker and business groups said it would have devastating consequences. The majority-Republican House voted 41-46 in favor of the Senate-backed bill, which would have created a “right of privacy” for employees and contractors regarding their vaccination status. The proposal, which would allow employees to sue under the state’s civil rights law for any violations, was among attempts to limit or prohibit vaccine requirements in response to President Joe Biden’s order that businesses with more than 100 employees must require vaccinations or weekly coronavirus testing. But the measure faced opposition from business groups and hospitals, as well as GOP legislative leaders who said it went too far in restricting businesses. Speaker Matthew Shepherd told House members before the vote that the bill was “an overreach.” Opponents said it would force businesses to choose between exposing themselves to lawsuits by workers or facing federal fines for not complying with Biden’s order. They also said it would have jeopardized Medicaid and Medicare funding for health care facilities and stopped them from preventing infections and contact tracing.\n\nCalifornia\n\nVisalia: Marie Wilcox, a Native American who saved her tribe’s dying language, has died. She was 87. Wilcox was once the last fluent speaker of Wukchumni, but she worked for more than 20 years to produce a dictionary of the language spoken by her tribe in the San Joaquin Valley and taught her family. Now there are at least three fluent speakers of the language, including her daughter. Wilcox died Sept. 25 in a Visalia hospital after her aorta ruptured. Her great hope was for the language work she started to continue, her daughter, Jennifer Malone, told the Fresno Bee. “Her dream for us was to keep it going,” Malone said on the eve of her mother’s memorial service Friday in Tulare County. “So no matter what, we will do this and teach as many people as are willing to learn.” A Wukchumni dictionary Wilcox wrote was copyrighted, and her family is now looking for a publisher for it, Malone said. The Wukchumni are one of the numerous tribes under the larger umbrella of the Yokuts, Indigenous people in the central San Joaquin Valley. But unlike other Yokuts tribes that are recognized by the federal government, the Wukchumni lack federal status and resources for cultural preservation. Wilcox regularly taught Wukchumni language classes through the Owens Valley Career Development Center. The classes will continue.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Civil rights groups have filed to block the state’s new congressional map, arguing the independent redistricting commission that redrew the legislative boundaries to match population growth shortchanged Hispanic residents. The filings Friday from the Colorado Latino Leadership, Advocacy and Research Organization and the League of United Latin American Citizens contend the commission continued to dilute the power of Latino voters by following traditional congressional maps in the state, which have separated heavily Hispanic areas. They argue that Latinos – who are 21% of Colorado’s population – are scattered among several congressional districts, mixed in with white residents who vote against their preferred candidates. The groups pleaded for the commission to group Latinos together by, for example, splitting the city of Colorado Springs and attaching its heavily Latino southern end to a southern Colorado district including Pueblo and the San Luis Valley. The commission balked at that, preferring to preserve what are known as “communities of interest” – cities and neighborhoods with shared needs. When it submitted the maps, the commission told the court they complied with the federal Voting Rights Act and did not discriminate against any voter on basis of ethnicity or language.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A lawmaker is standing by comments that compared Gov. Ned Lamont and his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic to Adolf Hitler. Republican state Rep. Anne Dauphinais initially posted a comment on Facebook on Thursday night that called the Democrat “King Lamont aka Hitler.” Dauphinais posted a longer comment on her Facebook page Friday night that mentioned Nazi concentration camps, book burnings and other actions under Hitler, interspersed with mentions of Lamont’s mandates during the pandemic. “This Governor, with the help of the one-party rule we have in this state right now, has taken dictatorial powers for himself for what will be almost 2 full years when this latest extension expires,” Dauphinais wrote. “Hitler too was a dictator enabled by the rule of the single Nazi party.” Max Reiss, Lamont’s communications director, called the comments “disgusting, repulsive and disrespectful to the history and memory of victims of the Holocaust,” the New Haven Register reports. An email message was left with Dauphinais on Sunday. Her district includes Plainfield and Killingly in eastern Connecticut.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s chain pharmacies are facing a severe staff shortage. Employees at Walgreens and CVS describe chaotic stores with desperate customers waiting in hours­long lines and phone calls that go unanswered. Amalia Lucci said she was surprised to see a closed sign citing “a shortage of employees” at a CVS pharmacy when she went to pick up an antibiotic for her daughter at 4 p.m. “While the door was closed, I saw someone still inside and knocked,” Lucci said. “After explaining my situation, I was able to get the medication, but I could tell he (pharmacist) was really stressed.” Another customer, Mae-Lyn Smith, had to wait more than an hour when she went to pick up medication. “It was not a situation where I could shop around or wait until next day,” Smith said. In social media posts, pharmacists described understaffed pharmacies, customers lashing out during long waits and workers quitting out of stress. “Unfortunately a pharmacy can not be open unless there is a licensed pharmacist and we currently just do not have the pharmacist to staff our pharmacy,” a Walgreens manager, Melissa Anne, wrote in a Facebook post. A number of Walgreens pharmacies have stopped opening on weekends, while many 24-hour stores, mainly in southern Delaware, have reduced operating hours.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Former President Donald Trump’s company lost more than $70 million on his Washington hotel during his four years in office despite taking in millions from foreign governments, according to documents released Friday by a congressional committee investigating his business. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform said the luxury hotel just a few blocks from the White House was struggling so badly that the Trump Organization had to inject $27 million from other parts of its business and got preferential treatment from a major lender to delay payments on a $170 million loan. The committee said the losses came despite an estimated $3.7 million in revenue from foreign governments, business that ethics experts say Trump should have refused because it posed conflicts of interest with his role as president. The Trump Organization said in a statement that the findings of the Democrat-led committee were misleading and false, and it did not receive any special treatment from a lender. Trump’s company has been trying to sell the 263-room hotel since fall 2019 but has struggled to find buyers during the coronavirus pandemic at a reported initial asking price of more than $500 million.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Augustine: A house connected to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is now in the hands of a couple who plan to preserve it. David Manaute and Patti Barry live near 5480 Atlantic View already and were familiar with the house’s history. A historical marker stands on the property, which is on the coastline several miles south of St. Augustine. During the 1960s, King came to St. Augustine to advance the civil rights movement and stayed in different places around town to maintain his safety. The Atlantic View home was the target of attacks by people who apparently thought King was staying there. A bullet hole is still in one of the door frames. Before the shooting, the St. Augustine Record printed the address of the cottage after getting a tip that he was staying there, according to historian David Colburn’s book “Racial Change & Community Crisis.” King wasn’t in the home at the time of the shooting. But he arrived later, and a photo showing him looking at a bullet hole in glass became “one of the iconic images of the civil rights movement,” according to the marker at the property, which is from the ACCORD Freedom Trail. The home was the winter residence of missionaries who supported the civil rights movement, who opened the house to King, according to information from ACCORD.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The unique experience of racing on a runway at one of the world’s busiest airports is back this year. The Mayor’s 5K on the 5th Runway returns Saturday after being canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The airport says it’s “one of the flattest – and fastest – courses in metro Atlanta.” With the pandemic ongoing, masks are required before and after the race. While planes will continue to take off and land on the other runways, the 9,000-foot fifth runway, isolated on the far south side of the airfield, will be cleared. The race course goes down the runway and a taxiway. The race starts at 6:30 a.m., and all participants must clear the runway by 7:30 a.m. so airport workers can sweep the area and prepare for flights to start landing again about 8 a.m., the newspaper reports. Proceeds from the race registration fee go to the Mayor’s Youth Scholarship Program and United Way of Greater Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city will soon begin allowing a limited number of fans at University of Hawaii football games and other outdoor entertainment events as it begins to ease restrictions protecting the community from COVID-19. Gov. David Ige and Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said Friday that they were taking the steps in response to improving public health data, including rising vaccination rates and declining numbers of coronavirus cases, hospitalized patients and test positivity rates. Starting Wednesday, outdoor venues may have up to 1,000 attendees or fill up to 50% of capacity – whichever is smaller. For the next Hawaii football home game Oct. 23, attendees will likely be limited to family and friends of players. Attendees will need to be vaccinated, wear masks and maintain physical distance. No food will be allowed, and water will be the only authorized beverage. Restrictions on indoor entertainment, outdoor weddings and funerals, golf tournaments, road races and triathlons will also be eased. Ige said the goal was to manage Hawaii’s health care infrastructure while taking prudent risks and building back the state’s economy. “This is not an all-clear signal. The pandemic is far from finished in Hawaii, in the nation and around the world,” Ige said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A former state lawmaker charged with rape has been arrested and jailed. Online records show Aaron von Ehlinger was booked into the Ada County Jail on Friday afternoon, KBOI-TV reports. He is facing charges of rape and forcible penetration by use of a foreign object. He was arrested in Georgia on Sept. 25 on a “fugitive from justice” charge in connection with a warrant in the case. Von Ehlinger was a Republican state representative from Lewiston when a 19-year-old legislative intern reported he brought her to his apartment under false pretenses and raped her. Previously, von Ehlinger has denied all wrongdoing and maintained he had consensual sexual contact with her. A legislative ethics committee found that von Ehlinger engaged in “behavior unbecoming” and said it would support a vote to remove him from the Idaho Statehouse. He resigned from office before the vote was held. The Idaho warrant, issued Sept. 9, would have allowed him to be out of custody after his arrest as long as he posted bond. But von Ehlinger did not turn himself in over the subsequent two weeks. If he is convicted of the charges, von Ehlinger could face up to life in prison and be required to register as a sex offender.\n\nIllinois\n\nDePue: Efforts to change the roughly 200-year-old, racist name of a creek in northern Illinois have gained traction. An 11-mile waterway was named Negro Creek after the DePue area’s first Black settler built a cabin at the mouth of the creek in 1829. DePue is about 110 miles southwest of Chicago. Former resident Amy Urbanowski, who is among those pushing for the name change, has received support from the Bureau County Board and a local NAACP branch. She sent the details to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which approves such changes. In the coming weeks, the agency will consider changing the name to Adams, the surname of the Black pioneer. Records of a first name haven’t been located. “Changing the name of the creek is important,” she said, “because it’s good to reflect on how the names of towns and villages are all historically and respectively named after people, not their race.” Urbanowski and others say they’ve heard people refer to the creek by a racial slur over the years. Ladd Village President Frank Cattani said he played on the creek as a child. At an August public meeting about the name change, he used a racial slur several times in describing the waterway, saying that’s how many people still refer to it and insisting that the term “means ‘Black,’ not ‘Black person.’ ”\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: A second spill in less than two weeks at a U.S. Steel plant sent an oily sheen onto a Lake Michigan tributary, prompting officials to close some nearby lake access as a precaution. The sheen was detected Thursday morning on Burns Waterway outside the U.S. Steel Midwest plant in Portage, but by 8 p.m. it was no longer present on the tributary, said company spokeswoman Amanda Malkowski. She said an existing boom had contained the sheen in an estimated 120-square-foot area, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management was investigating, spokesman Barry Sneed said. As a precaution, the Indiana Dunes National Park closed access to the lake Thursday off the neighboring Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk, said spokesman Bruce Rowe. The nearby community of Ogden Dunes also shut down access to Lake Michigan from its beach, a town official said. Indiana American Water’s Ogden Dunes water treatment facility remained online, and the spill wasn’t expected to impact its Lake Michigan source water, spokesman Joe Loughmiller said. The water utility had idled that treatment plant for about a week starting in late September after U.S. Steel’s Portage plant discharged iron-tainted wastewater into the Burns Waterway.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge has extended an order that will prevent state officials from enforcing a law that prohibits school districts from implementing mask requirements until a federal lawsuit challenging the law can be heard. Judge Robert Pratt had earlier issued a temporary restraining order preventing Gov. Kim Reynolds and Department of Education Director Ann Lebo from enforcing the law Reynolds signed in May. The order entered Friday issues a preliminary injunction that continues to prohibit the state from enforcing the law until the court case can be decided. Lawyers for Reynolds and Lebo immediately filed notice of an appeal with the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which could reverse Pratt’s order or keep it in place. “We will never stop fighting for the rights of parents to decide what is best for their children and to uphold state laws enacted by our elected legislators,” Reynolds said in a statement. Eleven parents and The Arc of Iowa, a group that defends the civil rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, sued the state Sept. 3. They claim that the law substantially increases the risk of several children with health conditions of contracting COVID-19 and that it violates federal laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Amid a shortage of glass beads triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the white lines being painted on the state’s highways this year tend not to reflect light as well as officials would like. Still, the smaller glass beads being used to accomplish that purpose should nevertheless be “adequate” and “safe,” said Tony Menke, bureau chief of construction and materials for the Kansas Department of Transportation. “We’ll just probably need to touch them up sooner rather than later,” he said. The reduced brightness results from a nationwide shortage of glass beads of the type the state embeds in roadways to enhance the reflectivity of pavement striping, Menke said. Those beads, placed on top of white lines to help drivers see at night, reflect light back in the direction of the oncoming car’s headlights. Medical-grade oxygen is required to produce the beads, Menke said. But the current spike in COVID-19 cases and the resulting need for oxygen for patients have reduced the rate at which the beads can be produced, he said. In addition, a nationwide shortage of chemicals used to create traffic line paint may prevent all roads Shawnee County maintains that need striping from getting redone this fall, Niehaus said. “We’ll prioritize and get the most-needed segments completed,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge ruled Friday that the Kentucky Constitution prohibits a part of a new state law enabling donors to get tax credits for supporting private school tuition. Franklin Circuit Court Judge Phillip Shepherd said the state cannot implement the “school choice” elements of House Bill 563. The ruling prohibits the creation of any account-granting organizations or education opportunity accounts, nor can the state grant any tax credits for these purposes. Many students could indeed benefit from the legislation’s financial assistance, the judge acknowledged, but he said that points to another constitutional failure. “The very fact that so many children need additional educational assistance, beyond what is presently funded and appropriated for the public schools, is an indication that we, as a state, may well be falling short of the constitutional mandate of ‘an efficient system of common schools,’ ” Shepherd wrote. The law’s opponents objected to using the state tax code to aid private education. Attorneys defending the law argued that tax credits don’t amount to government spending, even if they decrease revenues. Lawyers with the Institute for Justice, which intervened in Kentucky’s suit, said they will appeal. The legislation was passed over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto this year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Citing sharp declines in COVID-19 infection rates and hospitalizations, Louisiana State University announced Friday that it will no longer require proof of vaccinations or negative coronavirus tests to enter Tiger Stadium for football games. Fans still will have to wear masks in any indoor areas of the stadium as required under Gov. John Bel Edwards’ statewide mask mandate. Dr. Catherine O’Neal, chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Hospital and a coronavirus adviser to the university, said the state is seeing less than 5% of virus tests returning positive statewide as Louisiana exits its fourth and worst-yet surge of the pandemic. “Because of this success, we are able to lift the vaccine and testing requirements for entry into Tiger Stadium. By balancing mitigation efforts and risk in the ongoing fight to end the pandemic, we can protect our community and safely celebrate the traditions that bring us together,” O’Neal said in the statement released by LSU. Several people who attended football games had said the university’s compliance checks for proof of vaccination or testing had been spotty at best. Meanwhile, Edwards is no longer pursuing efforts to mandate regular virus testing for thousands of state workers who aren’t vaccinated.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine Preservation has added a historic church and a shuttered ski lodge to its list of most endangered historic places in the state. New entries on the nonprofit organization’s annual list, released Thursday, include First Congregational Church in East Machias and the Sugarloaf Summit Lodge in Carrabassett Valley. The hexagonal Summit Lodge atop Sugarloaf Mountain dates to the 1960s and stood at the terminus of the now-defunct gondola lift. It was open to Appalachian Trail backpackers before it closed altogether in 2009. McCurdy’s Smokehouse in Lubec, the Frank J. Wood Bridge between Topsham and Brunswick, and the Kennebec Arsenal in Augusta remain on the list, which marked its 25th anniversary. “Advocating for the preservation of historic buildings requires an understanding that our work does not happen overnight and oftentimes necessitates a long-term commitment,” said Tara Kelly, executive director of Maine Preservation. Maine Preservation does list some success stories that have been helped by the organization’s work, including Saco Mill No. 4 and the Wood Island Life Saving Station at Kittery Point.\n\nMaryland\n\nCapitol Heights: Two staff members were fatally shot Friday at an apartment complex for seniors just outside the nation’s capital, and a suspect was taken into custody, police said. The shooting happened shortly after 9 a.m. at Gateway Village in Capitol Heights, Prince George’s County and Capitol Heights police said. Both victims were women – one found in a hallway and another in an office, they said. A resident who identified himself only as Donald said the shooter is his friend and lived in the complex. He said the man was fed up with how residents have been treated. “He told me, ‘Don, nobody is standing up for these seniors. I can’t take it no more. I’ve got to do something.’ And obviously what he chose to do is wrong, but he did something,” the resident said. Gateway Village is one of 310 communities in 25 states run by National Church Residences, which describes itself as “the nation’s largest provider of affordable senior housing and services.” Its website says the apartment complex about a half-mile east of Washington includes studio and one-bedroom units for “seniors age 62+.” A county website describes the property as subsidized government housing for seniors with low incomes. National Church Residences spokeswoman Cindy Young said it’s “extremely heartbroken” that two staff members were killed.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city has broken ground on a new memorial to honor the state’s first Black and Indigenous Superior Court judge and all Black veterans. The park in the city’s Roxbury neighborhood is already named after Justice Edward O. Gourdin, but the state on Thursday began the effort to add an 8-foot bronze cast statue of Gourdin and 10 bas-reliefs representing Black soldiers in 10 wars, starting with the American Revolution. Before he became a judge, Gourdin, a Seminole, was an Olympian and a soldier. He won a silver medal in the long jump in the 1924 Paris Olympics and served as commanding officer of the Army’s segregated 372nd Infantry Regiment during World War II. After his discharge, he was a member of the National Guard until 1959, rising to the rank of brigadier general, the first Black soldier to earn the rank in Massachusetts. Gourdin had undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University. Meanwhile, Native American groups marched and rallied on Boston Common on Saturday to observe Indigenous Peoples Day and to call on state leaders to do more to support their communities. Organizers say they want Gov. Charlie Baker to make Indigenous People’s Day a statewide holiday. They also want Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park in Boston’s North End to be renamed.\n\nMichigan\n\nColoma: A rural amusement park that was popular for decades in southwestern Michigan is on the auction block. Visitors could pet animals, ride a Ferris wheel or train, and listen to music at Deer Forest in Coloma. The 25-acre site in Berrien County is for sale, along with many buildings that are in rough shape but still standing. “Perhaps residential might make sense for whomever buys it,” said Rick Levin of Rick Levin & Associates, who is handling the sale. “I don’t know if the best use is a zoo and fun park anymore, but we’ve had a lot of people calling with their fond memories of going here.” The suggested opening bid is $450,000, though the property had been valued at $3.2 million, Levin said. The deadline for the sealed bid auction is 4 p.m. EDT Thursday. Cecil Potts founded the park in 1949. By 1989, more than 3.5 million people had visited Deer Forest, The Herald-Palladium reports. It has been closed since 2014. Rachel Edwards of Coloma fondly remembers a small red house known as Santa’s Summer Village. “You’d go inside and imagine it was where Santa went in the summer for vacation. There was even a sleigh you could sit in. … I know it would take a lot of work, but I would love for whomever buys it to reopen it,” Edwards told MLive.com.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Prosecutors are seeking approval for a more severe penalty than what is outlined in state guidelines if a former suburban police officer is convicted in the shooting death of Daunte Wright. Ex-Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter is facing charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Wright, who was shot while he was trying to drive away from officers during a traffic stop in April. The sentencing guidelines for first-degree manslaughter range from 6 to 81/ 2 years in prison. Potter has pleaded not guilty. She is scheduled to stand trial in December. The prosecutors’ move is similar to one made by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in the trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, convicted in George Floyd’s death. In that case, a judge approved Ellison’s request for an upward departure because Floyd was particularly vulnerable and because Chauvin abused his authority as a police officer. Ellison wrote in a court document filed Wednesday that Potter “caused a greater-than-normal danger to the safety of other people” because she fired into a vehicle with a passenger, and two officers were standing close to the vehicle. Potter is recorded on bodycam video an instant after the shooting saying she mistakenly drew her firearm instead of her stun gun.\n\nMississippi\n\nWinona: Civil rights advocates asked federal appeals court judges Friday to revive a lawsuit they filed against a prosecutor accused of routinely rejecting Black jurors in criminal cases simply because of their race. District Attorney Doug Evans’ jury selection tactics have been under scrutiny for years. His exclusion of Black jurors in one high-profile murder case led to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Curtis Flowers’ conviction in 2019, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh citing a “relentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals.” Friday’s arguments at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans involve a lawsuit focused not on a specific case but on the overall practice of using race as a sole reason for rejecting jurors. It was filed in 2019 by leaders of the Attala County branch of the NAACP and four Mississippi voters, including one who was rejected as a jury candidate in Flowers’ case. They asked a federal judge to declare Evans’ policy unconstitutional and issue an injunction preventing him and his staff from making race-based jury strikes. U.S. District Judge Debra Brown, while acknowledging the plaintiffs’ claims may have merit, dismissed the lawsuit in September 2020, saying an injunction would put the federal court in the improper role of conducting an “ongoing audit” of state court proceedings.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: As some jobs go unfilled, billboards popping up around the city admonish that it’s time to “Get Off Your Butt!” and “Get. To. Work.” The signs that also urge people to “Apply Anywhere” are paid for by a group of business owners, including Brad Parke, who say they’re frustrated. “We don’t know where people are,” said Parke, general manager of Greek Corner Screen Printing and Embroidery. “Obviously they’re not at work. Apparently they’re at home. So that’s where we came up with ‘Get Off Your Butt.’ And then the ‘Apply Anywhere’ is about everyone’s looking for employees. You can’t drive a block through a commercial district without someone having a sign saying ‘Now Hiring.’ ” KYTV reports that the workforce shortage is a major problem in all sectors, affecting the supply chain for all kinds of goods and services, despite the Greene County Commission reporting a record-low unemployment rate at 2.8%. Parke said the billboard company that put up the ad has already been getting feedback. “He said they typically don’t get people calling in about billboards,” Parke said. “But someone called and said, ‘I don’t know who paid for that billboard, but that’s awesome!’ ”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State-employed public health experts say the state’s health department used “misleading and false” claims in support of an emergency rule that urged schools to consider parental input when adopting rules for wearing masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Eighteen epidemiologists wrote to Adam Meier, director of the Department of Public Health and Human Services, saying the Aug. 31 rule “threatens the credibility” of the health department and will “negatively impact our ability to communicate with Montanans in the future,” the epidemiologists wrote in a letter Sept. 17. The rule said schools that mandate face coverings in classrooms “should … be able to demonstrate they considered parental concerns in adopting the mandate” and allow students to opt out based on “physical, mental, emotional or psychosocial health concerns, as well as on the basis of religious belief, moral conviction or other fundamental right.” Along with the rule, Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office released a 13-page report citing studies, news stories and social media posts saying there is “no science behind mask mandates for children” and warned of negative effects for some children wearing masks. The epidemiologists’ letter said that ignored “numerous peer-reviewed studies.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A contract agreement has been reached between the state and its public employees that will provide significant pay hikes, particularly to those working in some health care and high-demand jobs, the Nebraska governor’s office announced Friday. State leaders and the Nebraska Association of Public Employees reached an agreement in principle, meaning it has not yet been ratified. The new contract would include $47 million in new compensation, officials said. The union represents more than 8,000 public employees in agencies throughout the state. “The agreement represents a substantial increase in pay for our members working within 24/7 facilities and across state government,” NAPE Executive Director Justin Hubly said. The new agreement would amend the 2021-23 contract to give covered state employees at 24-hour-a-day facilities a $3-per-hour pay increase. Also, starting Nov. 1, it provides a 20% increase pay line adjustment for jobs classified as high demand and a 30% increase pay line adjustment for health care workers identified as critical. The agreement also would increase overtime pay at 24/7 facilities and provide for an additional 2% cost-of-living adjustment July 1.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Amid a shortage of school bus drivers, 15 high schools in and around the city will start having students ride regularly scheduled public transit to and from campus this week. Clark County School District officials announced last week that the “Ride On” program starts Monday with the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada. Officials promised safe and timely transportation, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Students will board RTC buses at stops near their homes to ride existing routes, along with regular riders, to stops near school, officials said. The RTC said 200 security officers patrol bus stops and transit centers, and each bus has 12 cameras that police can monitor live. Parents have complained since school began Aug. 9 about frequent bus delays and unpredictable service causing some students to miss classes. The sprawling district with 366 schools usually operates almost 1,600 bus routes but has about 240 school bus driver vacancies. Last month, officials canceled some high school sports games due to transportation issues.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu asked the Department of Veterans Affairs on Friday to “follow through on their promise” to purchase millions of heavy-duty rubber gloves procured by a New Hampshire company in response to a pandemic-related request for personal protective equipment. In a letter to Secretary Denis McDonough, Sununu said the secretary’s office reached out in October 2020 to the company, Gigunda Group, “to locate, procure and ultimately provide funding” for 500 million gloves. The company has helped the VA with other PPE requests, including $7.4 million worth of nasal swabs. “At that time, locating 10 million or 20 million nitrile gloves was a big deal,” Sununu wrote. “Gigunda was tasked with searching the globe to locate a supplier that could provide 500 million gloves and with capability to provide as many as 2.5 billion over time.” Since then, Sununu said he learned the VA’s procurement arm claims no such request was made. “This is unacceptable,” he wrote. “Over 20 million nitrile gloves have been sitting in Gigunda’s TSA secure facility since May, and yet the VA has chosen to ignore and deny the existence of this successful partnership,” he wrote.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDeal: A coalition of environmental and fishing groups says the state should drop a plan to double the amount of money it spends on beach replenishment, asserting that money could be better spent on more effective ways to protect the state from climate change. Standing on a beach in Deal, a Monmouth County shore town due to get new sand as part of a $26 million replenishment project next month, the groups on Thursday decried New Jersey’s plan to increase the amount of money it spends on shore protection from $25 million to $50 million a year. They say that money would be better spent on measures to address repetitive flooding in the northern and central parts of the state along the Raritan and other rivers that often sustain catastrophic damage during storms like Tropical Storm Ida. “Given what just happened with Ida, if the state has an extra $25 million to spend on resiliency or preparing for climate change impacts, should we really be spending it putting sand on the beach in front of wealthy peoples’ second homes?” asked Mike Castellano, chairman of the Jersey Shore chapter of the Surfrider Foundation. Twenty-one groups signed a statement urging the state to reject a bill already passed by the state Senate but awaiting action in the Assembly that would double shore protection funding.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: After a four-year hiatus, state election regulators have resumed spot-checks on campaign finance disclosures by politicians, election candidates and political committees, with 10 accounts referred to New Mexico’s fledgling State Ethics Commission and state prosecutors for possible enforcement action. The random sampling of campaign finance disclosures from the 2020 general election cycle taps into a newly deployed electronic campaign finance reporting system at the Secretary of State’s Office that reconciles an intricate web of campaign contributions, transfers and expenditures. State law requires an annual sampling of 10% of accounts, triggering a review of roughly 110 accounts. Results were published Friday. Regulators attributed the hiatus in part to scarce resources. Alleged violations included groups receiving contributions from unidentified sources and failing to register as political committees. In addition to the 10 referrals, six committees or candidates are currently working to resolve discrepancies with the secretary of state’s office. The agency focuses on education and voluntary compliance.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city will phase out its program for gifted and talented students that critics say favors white and Asian American students, while enrolling disproportionately few Black and Latino children. Starting in the next school year, the nation’s largest school system will stop giving 4-year-olds a screening test used to identify gifted and talented students, according to an outline of the plan released by the city’s education department Friday. The program currently admits only 2,500 pupils a year out of 65,000 kindergartners citywide. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the change will help tens of thousands get advanced instruction, instead of just a select few. “The era of judging 4-year-olds based on a single test is over,” he said in a statement. “Every New York City child deserves to reach their full potential, and this new, equitable model gives them that chance.” The city will instead train all kindergarten teachers to provide accelerated learning in which students use more advanced skills such as robotics, computer coding, community organizing or advocacy on projects while staying in their regular classrooms. The city will also screen students going into third grade to determine if they would benefit from accelerated learning in various subjects while staying in their classrooms.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A county governing board has formally apologized for the mob lynching of a Black boy unlawfully taken from a jail in 1921, saying it suspected some prominent local officials allowed the killing to take place. A report issued Tuesday by the Chatham County Board of Commissioners found no investigation ever was conducted to find out who killed Eugene Daniel, 16, but evidence suggests a county commissioner, the county sheriff, the county coroner and the county jail keeper at the time all were complicit in the death. “The lynching of Eugene Daniel is a painful part of Chatham County’s history, and while our apology can’t change what happened, we feel it is an important step in helping his family and our entire community heal,” Chatham County Commissioner Karen Howard said, according to local news reports. News accounts from the time reported Daniel was accused of trespassing inside a home where a white woman said she saw a Black man standing in her bedroom. Daniel was killed by a mob of residents near Moore’s Bridge outside Pittsboro, about 35 miles west of the capital. According to the Raleigh News & Observer, it is unknown exactly how many people were lynched in North Carolina, but researchers say there could have been as many as 300 such killings from 1882 to 1968.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A lawmaker from southeastern North Dakota who’s accused of misdemeanor theft in Bottineau County said Saturday that he’s surprised by the charge and believes it’s fabricated. Republican Sen. Jason Heitkamp, of Wahpeton, said he was in Bottineau last week to retrieve some of his belongings from his former girlfriend and did not steal anything. He said he had been served with a summons but had not seen a copy of the complaint. “I have literally not seen the charges or what I am being accused of, so I can’t say much,” he said. “I’ll be open and honest with everybody, but I don’t know what’s happening. I have no reason to steal anything because I have everything I need.” Heitkamp, 56, recently completed his first year in the Legislature. He is a member of the judiciary and political subdivisions standing committees and the human services and water topics overview interim committees. He previously served on the Richland County Commission, Bottineau City Council and Prairie Rose City Council. Heitkamp said he did not yet have an attorney. His first court appearance is scheduled for Nov. 2. “I will be exonerated from it,” Heitkamp said. “I am not guilty. Just say it out.”\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The former director of a county jail where federal authorities described conditions as “inhumane” was sentenced Friday to serve nine months in that same jail. A Cuyahoga County sheriff’s deputy handcuffed Kenneth Mills in a Cleveland courtroom, as Visiting Judge Patricia Cosgrove chastized him while delivering the sentence. “What you’ve done is unthinkable and callous,” Cosgrove told Mills. “I don’t know how you can look at yourself in a mirror.” Conditions worsened during Mills’ four-year tenure, prosecutors said, with inmates living in unsanitary conditions with little or no medical care and inedible food while locked in their cells for periods of 24 hours or more. Prosecutors said Mills fronted a money-making plan to have the jail in downtown Cleveland serve as a regional corrections facility that would charge suburbs and Cleveland to house their prisoners. The regionalization plan led to severe overcrowding and forced corrections officers to work in intolerable conditions, prosecutors said. Mills, 56, was convicted in September on misdemeanor counts of dereliction of duty for having caused unsafe conditions in the jail and falsification for having lied to Cuyahoga County Council when he said he had not blocked the hiring of badly needed jail nurses despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An advocacy group filed two initiative petitions related to marijuana Thursday, one of which creates the framework to allow cannabis sales without a doctor’s recommendation. The other makes changes to current medical marijuana laws. If the petitions withstand any legal challenges, Oklahomans for Responsible Cannabis Action would have 90 days to gather 178,000 signatures for each proposal. If enough signatures are collected, the proposed constitutional amendments would appear on a statewide ballot. The recreational petition would let anyone 21 or older grow, purchase, transport, receive, prepare and consume marijuana and marijuana products. The proposed amendment sets limits on amounts over which a business license would be required. Recreational cannabis would be taxed at no more than 15%, compared to the current 7% excise tax on medical marijuana. If the petition passes, the tax on medical marijuana would be phased out over a year. Anyone serving time for a marijuana-related conviction could ask the court for resentencing or dismissal, according to the proposed ballot initiative. The second petition filed Thursday proposed replacing the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority with a standalone agency, the Oklahoma State Cannabis Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A judge has rejected a request by 33 Oregon State Police troopers to temporarily halt a mandate that requires them to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18. Retired Oregon Supreme Court Justice Jack Landau said in an opinion Thursday that based on case law, “the police power of the state includes the authority to enact public health laws that may have the effect of curtailing individual rights,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Landau, who is presiding over the troopers’ lawsuit in Jefferson County Circuit Court, also said Gov. Kate Brown is acting within her legislatively granted authority in issuing the mandate. Brown has required vaccinations for the state’s executive branch employees, including the troopers, and for hundreds of thousands of health care workers and K-12 educators and volunteers. Religious or medical exemptions can be requested. At least eight lawsuits have been filed. Thursday’s ruling is the second that denies plaintiffs’ request to temporarily stop the mandates. On Tuesday, the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that arguments made by a group of 25 health care workers, firefighters and paramedics who are opposed to vaccination have “little-to-no likelihood of success” if hashed out in further court proceedings.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A state court ruling will allow a plywood box to remain – for the moment – over a statue of Christopher Columbus that the city has been trying to remove from a south Philadelphia park since the explorer became a focus amid nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the Commonwealth Court ruling late Saturday night vacated a decision earlier in the day by a Common Pleas Court judge to allow immediate removal of the box covering the statue on Marconi Plaza. City representative Kevin Lessard said Saturday night that removal of the covering during the holiday weekend “would pose a serious public safety risk.” He earlier said officials would stop any attempt to remove the covering prior to the state court hearing. Attorney George Bochetto, who represents supporters of the 144-year-old statue, had vowed that it would be visible by the time a scheduled Sunday parade concluded at the plaza. In Philadelphia, a city with a deep Italian heritage, supporters say they consider Columbus an emblem of that heritage. Mayor Jim Kenney said Columbus was venerated for centuries as an explorer but had a “much more infamous” history, enslaving Indigenous people and imposing punishments such as severing limbs or even death.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: Protesters are planning to gather near the newly erected statue of one of the state’s earliest English settlers Monday to demand that it be taken down. Members of the Narragansett Indian tribe, Native Green, NCAAP Providence and Black Lives Matter Rhode Island are expected to gather at the Rev. William Blackstone statue in Pawtucket on Indigenous Peoples Day. “A big Band-Aid has been taken off of many things in this country and exposed things that were so ugly, so now is the time for healing,” Bella Noka, a Narragansett elder, told WPRI-TV. “But you don’t try to put that dirty, nasty Band-Aid back on the wound that’s healing, and that’s what they did with this statue.” Blackstone – after whom the Blackstone Valley region is named – settled the area in the 1630s at a time when the Indigenous population was brutally oppressed. The 14-foot statue was put up in August by the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council Inc. on a private plot of land. The council said it is trying to spur conversation and understanding.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: Horry County will likely become the latest government in the state to ban digging deep holes in the sand at the beach. The County Council unanimously gave key approval earlier this month banning digging holes deeper than 2 feet on beaches. It faces one final vote later this month, The Sun News reports. Supporters said deep holes are dangerous to people walking on the beach who may not see them and fall down and also are a hazard to sea turtles. A number of other South Carolina beach governments have passed similar bans on digging holes, including Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head Island Kiawah Island and Surfside Beach.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBlack Hawk: Residents of a neighborhood where a sinkhole appeared last year say they are tired of waiting for answers and, in some cases, feel abandoned by politicians who received their votes in previous elections. “This was our nest egg,” Valerie Smith said. “We planned to sell, and now that’s our house, our business. We’re ready to retire, and we don’t know what to do.” Smith and her husband, Cole, still live in their home on Prairie Violet Lane in Hideaway Hills, where a sinkhole exposed an abandoned gypsum mine April 27, 2020. About 40 people from 15 homes were forced to evacuate. Since the sinkhole opened, two law firms representing more than 100 residents filed lawsuits and performed tests and studies. One law firm is trying to receive class-action certification, the Rapid City Journal reports. Smith said residents haven’t heard from local or state government officials, which only adds to the deepening frustration in Hideaway Hills. “I wish our Gov. Kristi Noem would do something for us,” she said. “It wouldn’t take that much to fix our neighborhood versus worrying about big fireworks displays. Why don’t you take the millions (of tax dollars) and fix neighborhoods for the people that actually voted for you?”\n\nTennessee\n\nPigeon Forge: Country star Dolly Parton and her Smoky Mountain businesses have raised $700,000 to help residents affected by catastrophic flooding in Middle Tennessee. According to a Wednesday news release, Parton chose United Way of Humphreys County to receive and distribute the donation at the suggestion of her friend and fellow country music legend Loretta Lynn. A foreman at Lynn’s ranch was among those who died in the flood. Parton said she was compelled to help out after the support the Smokies received following the 2016 Sevier County wildfires. “I hope that this money can be put to good use to help the people of Middle Tennessee with what they need during their recovery,” Parton said in a statement. During the Aug. 21 flood, more than 500 homes and 50 businesses were damaged after up to 17 inches of rain fell in less than 24 hours over a weekend in the rural community.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state Senate on Friday approved newly drawn district maps that would keep Republicans dominant in the state’s congressional representation, even amid rapidly shifting demographics. Next the maps will go to the GOP-dominated Texas House of Representatives, where they are expected to be approved before reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk to be signed into law. Minority rights groups and Democrats say the Republican mapmakers are ignoring demographic trends. More than 9 in 10 of the 4 million people who moved to Texas over the past decade are people of color. Texas is now home to more than 29 million people, the latest census figures show. America’s largest red state is second in population to California, which is home to nearly 40 million. That growth led to Texas gaining two more seats in Congress, for a total of 38 representatives. Republicans currently have 23 of Texas’ congressional seats, while Democrats have 13. Under the proposed maps, the number of Hispanic-majority districts would shrink from eight to seven. There would also be no districts with a majority of Black residents. State Senator Joan Huffman, a Republican and the chair of the Senate’s redistricting committee, said the maps were drawn fairly and “blind to race.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: President Joe Biden on Friday restored two sprawling national monuments in southern Utah, reversing a decision by President Donald Trump that opened for mining and other development hundreds of thousands of acres of rugged lands sacred to Native Americans and home to ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. The Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments encompass more than 3.2 million acres and were created by Democratic administrations under a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historic, geographically or culturally important. “This may be the easiest thing I’ve ever done so far as president – I mean it,” a smiling Biden said at a White House ceremony attended by Democratic lawmakers, tribal leaders and environmentalists. Restoring the monuments’ boundaries and protections restores their integrity, upholds efforts to honor the federal trust responsibility to tribal nations, and conserves the lands and waters for future generations, Biden said. Bears Ears in particular was an important site to protect, Biden said, noting that the 1.3 million-acre site is the first national monument to be established at the request of federally recognized tribes. It is “a place of healing … a place of reverence and a sacred homeland to hundreds of generations of native peoples,” Biden said.\n\nVermont\n\nRoyalton: A federal judge heard arguments Friday about whether a private institution, Vermont Law School, has a right to conceal two large murals against the artist’s wishes because some members of the school community find them racially offensive. Artist Samuel Kerson painted the murals – “Vermont, The Underground Railroad” and “Vermont and the Fugitive Slave” – for the school on two walls inside a building in 1994. Last year the school said it would paint over them and, when the artist objected, said it would instead cover the murals with acoustic tiles. “Despite its beneficent intentions, the mural has not aged well,” the school said in a court filing in response to a lawsuit filed by Kerson. “Its depiction of African Americans strikes some viewers as caricatured and offensive, and the mural has become a source of discord and distraction at Vermont Law School – an institution whose explicit mission it is to educate students in a diverse community.” Lawyers for Kerson, who lives in Quebec, argued in court papers that the artwork is protected by the Visual Rights Act that safeguards artists’ works from “distortion, mutilation, or other modification … which would be prejudicial to (their) honor or reputation.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Negotiations broke down Friday between members of the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on which proposed maps they should use as a starting point. The meeting ended after Democratic citizen co-chair Greta Harris left. The impasse came just two days before the commission was supposed to turn in maps for Virginia’s state House and Senate districts. “At this point, I don’t feel as though all members on the commission are sincere in their willingness to compromise and create fair maps for the Commonwealth of Virginia,” Harris said before leaving. A number of other members also left, effectively ending the meeting because it lacked a quorum. Others wanted to push on. Harris said in an email that she did not resign from the commission and had only left the meeting. The commission is tasked with dividing the state’s voters into new legislative and congressional districts, while also trying to ensure that Black and minority voters are given a fair shot to elect candidates of their choice. The 16-member commission is evenly split between Democratic and Republican appointees. And it was already struggling to break a partisan divide before Friday’s impasse.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Residents who sued the Snohomish County Auditor seeking an audit of the 2020 election because of alleged but undocumented “electronic manipulation” of ballots could square off with lawyers for the state Democratic Party. On Wednesday, state party lawyers filed motions to intervene in the lawsuits filed by Republican voters in eight counties including Snohomish, King, Pierce, Thurston, Clark, Whatcom, Lincoln and Franklin, The Daily Herald reports. They want all the cases tossed out. “This lawsuit is entirely unfounded and appears to be little more than a coordinated political attack on the integrity of Washington elections,” lawyers for the Democrats wrote in a motion filed in the Snohomish County case. “Plaintiffs stand before the Court with nothing but speculation, fueled by conspiracy theories, asking for breathtaking and entirely unwarranted ‘relief.’ ” The lead plaintiff in all the suits is Washington Election Integrity Coalition United, whose leader, Tamborine Borrelli of Gig Harbor, traveled the state in search of residents willing to join in. The original lawsuits allege auditors used uncertified voting equipment and manipulated thousands of ballots in an unspecified statewide race. Each lawsuit seeks a “full forensic audit” conducted like one in Arizona that found no evidence of fraud.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The death toll continues to surge from the coronavirus pandemic, according to state health data released Friday. There were at least 115 new COVID-19 deaths reported during the first seven days of October, according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That follows a September toll of about 600 deaths – more than the four previous months combined. The state is on pace to surpass 4,000 total deaths from the pandemic this week. On Sept. 21, state officials warned that a surge in deaths from the delta variant of the virus would last up to six weeks. But there are signs in other areas that the surge is slowing down. According to health data, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 dropped to 839 Friday, the lowest total in a month. There were 238 people in hospital intensive care units, down from a record 296 on Sept. 29. And the 157 COVID-19 patients on ventilators was the lowest since Sept. 19. Active cases statewide have gone up slightly in the past few days after dipping to 11,331 on Tuesday, the lowest since late August. Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday that improvement in the numbers “leads us to absolutely believe wholeheartedly that we have passed through the eye of the storm.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Federal prosecutors announced Friday that they won’t file charges against a white police officer who shot Jacob Blake last year – a shooting that sparked protests that led to the deaths of two men. Officer Rusten Sheskey shot Blake, who is Black, during a domestic disturbance in Kenosha in August 2020. The shooting left Blake paralyzed from the waist down and sparked several nights of protests, some of which turned violent. An Illinois man shot three people, killing two of them, during one of the demonstrations. State prosecutors decided not to file charges against Sheskey earlier this year after video showed that Blake, who was wanted on a felony warrant, was armed with a knife. The U.S. Department of Justice launched its own investigation days after the shooting. The agency announced Friday that a team of prosecutors from its Civil Rights Division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Milwaukee reviewed police reports, witness statements, dispatch logs and videos of the incident and determined there wasn’t enough evidence to prove Sheskey willfully used excessive force or violated Blake’s federal rights. Blake’s uncle, Justin Blake, called the decision “unconscionable” and said it “definitely steps on every civil right we can imagine this country owes every African American descendant.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The intensive care unit in the state’s biggest hospital was at full capacity Friday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. While not all ICU patients were dealing with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus contributed to the strain, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/25/whiskey-webs-alien-abductions-goldfish-invasion-news-around-states/39619731/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Preservationists are trying to save a more than 200-year-old site in southwest Alabama that was once both a military installation and a hospital. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has recognized the Mount Vernon Arsenal and Searcy Hospital as one of the nation’s most endangered places. Officials are trying to develop a plan and raise money to save the area, located north of Mobile. The arsenal was established in the early 1800s, and many of those buildings remain. Apache leaders including Geronimo were interred there in the late 1800s. The facility became a mental hospital for African Americans in 1900s when Alabama was racially segregated by law. It was integrated decades later and closed in 2012. About 40 buildings remain at the site, but many are deteriorating.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Wildlife officials are making plans to deal with an invasive species at a pond in the middle of the city. The Anchorage Daily News reports more than 150 orange, white and red goldfish are swimming in Cuddy Pond near the city’s main library. The aquarium pets are domesticated carp originally bred in China. Goldfish can carry diseases and bacteria that harm the ecosystem and other marine animals. Alaska Department of Fish and Game invasive species research biologist Krissy Dunker says the department last year tried using electroshock equipment to stun fish and make them easier to catch. She says the fish simply swam deeper. Dunker says it’s more humane to euthanize unwanted pet fish than to release them into the wild, where they’re likely to starve in winter.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Inspectors with the state School Facilities Board once identified critical problems at schools during inspections – high carbon dioxide levels in one school’s classrooms, a 50-year-old air-conditioning system in another school, fire alarm systems in need of repair. But those inspections are almost extinct. Since 2017, officials have conducted just one inspection of one school. State law requires that the School Facilities Board inspect all district school buildings once every five years for building deficiencies and conduct preventive maintenance inspections at 20 randomly selected districts every 30 months. Arizona has 2,001 district school buildings, according to the state Department of Education. Officials conducted 20 deficiencies inspections in 2015 and 18 in 2016. They did no inspections in 2017 and 2018 and one in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River park has been designated as the state’s first International Dark Sky Park. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that park officials spent two years getting 345 light fixtures into compliance. It recently became the world’s 71st dark sky park. Mark Foust, who heads the park, says he hopes the designation can serve as an example for other parks in the region that want to partake in the process. The park stretches along 135 miles of the Buffalo River. Park ranger Cassandra Johannsen says most of the 1.2 million visitors go to float the river, but she has encountered people who visit exclusively for the night sky. Bruce McMath, chairman of the Arkansas Natural Sky Association, says park rangers and amateur astronomers have developed impressive dark-sky programs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A floating device designed to catch plastic waste has been redeployed in its second attempt to clean up a huge island of trash swirling in the Pacific Ocean between California and Hawaii. Boyan Slat, creator of The Ocean Cleanup project, announced on Twitter that a 2,000-foot-long floating boom that broke apart late last year was sent back to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch last week after four months of repair. A ship towed the U-shaped barrier from San Francisco to the patch in September to trap the plastic. But during the four months at sea, the boom broke apart under constant waves and wind, and the boom wasn’t retaining the plastic it caught. Fitted with solar-powered lights, cameras, sensors and satellite antennas, the device intends to communicate its position at all times, allowing a support vessel to fish out the collected plastic every few months and transport it to dry land.\n\nColorado\n\nManitou Springs: A Coloradan is trying to break a record for hiking a notoriously steep and difficult trail as many times as he can in a year. The current record is 1,719 ascents of the Manitou Incline near Manitou Springs. The Colorado Springs Gazette reports 62-year-old Greg Cummings is now about halfway toward breaking his friend Roger Austin’s record. Cummings is averaging over five ascents and descents a day and has completed the trail about 870 times since January. The trail is short but climbs nearly 2,000 feet in less than a mile. The trail consists almost entirely of hundreds of steep steps up a mountainside. Cummings says the challenge is especially difficult because he has Type 1 diabetes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A Yale University library will display a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence and hold a public reading to mark the 243rd anniversary of the nation’s founding. The Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library says the document is one of only 26 known copies of the first printing of the Declaration of Independence. Those copies are known as the Dunlap Broadside, named after John Dunlap, who printed about 200 copies in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776. They were distributed to the original 13 states. The Yale copy will be displayed in a temporary exhibition case at the library from June 27 through July 11, except for the July 4 holiday, when the library will be closed. The public reading is scheduled for July 5 at 4 p.m.\n\nDelaware\n\nPrices Corner: Calling attention to what has been described as “a violent and often-ignored chapter of Delaware history,” legislators and more than 100 community members gathered Sunday to unveil a historical marker commemorating the only documented lynching in the First State. Installed by the Delaware Public Archives at New Castle County’s Greenbank Park in Prices Corner, the marker memorializes the 1903 lynching of laborer George White at the hands of a white mob. He was burned at the stake, according to historical accounts and newspaper archives. “I don’t think he’s ever going to be forgotten,” said Savannah Shepherd, a rising senior at the Sanford School in Hockessin, standing in front of a tower that is all that remains of the New Castle County workhouse White where was imprisoned before his death. The high schooler was instrumental in getting the memorial put up.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The 2018 Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals are among 11 new entrants into the district’s Sports Hall of Fame. The Capitals earned entry after bringing the National Hockey League title to Washington for the first time. Owner Ted Leonsis accepted the induction plaque in a ceremony Sunday at Nationals Park. Other honorees included former Redskins defensive end Charles Mann; Tom Brown, who played for the Senators and Redskins; University of Maryland women’s lacrosse coach Cathy Reese; former DeMatha Catholic High School and Duke basketball player Danny Ferry; Maryland soccer coach Sasho Cirovski; two-time Olympic gold medal swimmer Tom Dolan; horse racing writer Andrew Beyer; and Kevin Payne, first president and CEO of DC United (soccer).\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A woman’s effort to protect herself from domestic violence has become a flashpoint in the debate over gun rights and victims’ safety. Courtney Irby gave her estranged husband’s guns to police after he was charged with domestic violence-aggravated battery, only to find herself arrested for theft. Now a state lawmaker and gun safety advocates are championing her cause, asking a state attorney to drop the charges, while gun rights advocates want her prosecuted. Irby spent six days in jail on charges of armed burglary and grand theft. At the time she turned in the assault rifle and handgun, Joseph Irby was spending one day in jail, accused of ramming into her car after a divorce hearing. She had received a temporary injunction for protection. Federal law prohibits people under a domestic violence restraining order from possessing guns, but it’s up to local law enforcement to enforce it, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A hand-painted silk flag carried into battle by members of the 127th United States Colored Troops in the Civil War now has a home at a museum in the city. The piece of history recently auctioned off in Philadelphia landed in the collection of the Atlanta History Center and is the most expensive artifact the center has acquired. According to the center, at least 180,000 African Americans served in the United States Colored Troops, a branch of the U.S. Army formed after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. The units were segregated and commanded by white officers. Estimates are that three-fourths of the soldiers were formerly enslaved men. The history center has 11,000 items in its Civil War collection, which is one of the largest in the nation. But items specifically associated with the U.S. Colored Troops are very rare, and the center owns only a dozen.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A new altar has been built near the summit of Mauna Kea, less than a day after state officials dismantled two other “ahu” in preparation for the construction of one of the world’s most advanced telescopes. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports the new ahu isn’t directly blocking access to the site where the Thirty Meter Telescope is planned. The two dismantled ahu were blocking access to the site. The new ahu is across the road from the Maunakea Visitor Information Station where a structure called Hale o Kukiaimauna stood until state officials took it down Thursday. State officials announced they were giving permission for construction to begin on the Thirty Meter Telescope. The decision came after the state Supreme Court in October upheld the project’s permits.\n\nIdaho\n\nKelly Creek: Wildlife officials are urging black bear hunters to choose their targets with care after a protected grizzly bear was spotted in north-central Idaho for the first time in a decade. A hunting guide restocking a black bear baiting site encountered the 3-year-old male grizzly in the lower Kelly Creek area of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests this month. The grizzly bear is collared and tracked by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The agency says the bear crossed into Idaho last August, but wildlife officials captured it and sent it back to Montana. Wayne Kasworm, who monitors bears for the agency, says the bear headed south again after it was released. Idaho Fish and Game officials say hunters need to be cautious for the rest of black bear season.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: State troopers are teaming up with truck drivers in the Chicago area to crack down on distracted driving. The (Joliet) Herald-News reports the “Trooper in a Truck” program has troopers riding along in the cabs of commercial motor vehicles to better spot distracted drivers. Maj. Robert Meeder says troopers have a better vantage point from a truck’s cab to see if drivers in other vehicles are texting or doing other things that are unsafe. If the trooper sees something, he or she notifies police units up ahead to stop the violators. Meeder said during a news conference in Joliet that distracted driving is a leading cause of traffic crashes.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The region’s archbishop has forced a Catholic high school to fire a gay teacher, just days after another school in the city defied a similar order despite church officials saying they would no longer recognize it as Catholic. Cathedral High School announced Sunday that it’s terminating the teacher’s contract to avoid a split with the Indianapolis archdiocese. Leaders of Cathedral High School, a private school affiliated with the Brothers of the Holy Cross religious order, said in a letter on the school’s website that disobeying Archbishop Charles Thompson would cost the school its nonprofit status and its ability to have Mass celebrated on campus. This is the third Indianapolis Catholic high school that’s faced pressure from Thompson over employees in same-sex marriages since he became archbishop in July 2017.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A University of Iowa team has won a $115million grant to develop satellites for studying a system of radiation created by the sun – “space weather.” The NASA grant will underwrite development of satellites expected to be launched within the next three years with more satellites developed by Southwest Research Institute scientists. The satellites are designed to gather data on how the sun creates solar wind and how Earth responds to the solar wind. NASA scientists say goal is to understand what drives space weather so humans can mitigate any harmful effects. NASA official Nicky Fox says solar particles generated by the sun can interfere with undersea cables, power grids, radio communications and other electronic equipment.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State education officials are raising pay and fast-tracking various teaching professionals in a two-pronged effort aimed at combating teacher shortages. Last year, Kansas schools had more than 600 vacant positions, many in rural areas and the state’s most urban districts. Low pay has been blamed for much of the trouble attracting and retaining teachers. Legislative approval of multiyear school funding increases amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars has given districts a chance to offer teacher raises that were difficult to include in previous budgets, the Kansas News Service reports. Fast-tracking teaching assistants and other professionals to head classrooms is the other part of the plan. Education officials say they believe the upcoming funding boost will alleviate teacher shortages.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: University of Louisville professor Stuart Williams was experimenting with a case of bourbon when he made an accidental discovery – a drop of the spirit, when diluted and evaporated under certain conditions, formed a microscopic pattern of thin strands. Williams calls the pattern a “whiskey web,” which looks like a lattice of lightning when it’s lit up. And he believes it may prove to be a unique “fingerprint” that can be used to identify different bourbons, although his research is still in the early stages. Thousands of flavors contribute to the taste of a bourbon, Williams says, and he believes the physical components that make up those flavors, such as fatty acids, are primarily responsible for generating these webs. Only American whiskeys, which are aged in a new, charred barrel, appear to create these webs, based on the research so far, he says.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new federally led study of oil seeping from a platform toppled off Louisiana’s coast 14 1/ 2 years ago finds releases lower than other recent estimates but contradicts the well owner’s assertions about the amount and source of oil. Oil and gas have been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico since a subsea mudslide caused by Hurricane Ivan on Sept. 15, 2004, knocked over a Taylor Energy Co. production platform. Taylor is fighting a federal order to cap the well. The company says oil sheens on the water’s surface indicate there’s only a dribble of oil. The new report says its findings contradict that. The scientists used sonar and a new tool they call a “bubblometer” to estimate the seepage. Taylor says it wants verifiable scientific data about the leak and a scientifically and environmentally sound solution.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: City officials are waiting on a decision from the state about whether new African immigrants here can receive state assistance. The Portland Press Herald reports the Portland City Council canceled a meeting that had been scheduled for Monday to discuss financial support for the asylum-seekers. Mayor Ethan Strimling says the city postponed the meeting to give Gov. Janet Mills more time. More than 200 people were staying at an emergency shelter in Portland late last week. Most are from Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and they’re seeking asylum in the United States. City Manager Jon Jennings says the number of immigrants arriving in the city seems to have stabilized in recent days. They’re staying at a basketball arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Assateague Island welcomed new life Friday with the birth of a wild horse. “Ms. Macky,” also known as N2BHS-AL, gave birth to a male bay pinto colt. “The new foal, N2BHS-ALR, and band live most of the year in the very busy developed area and campgrounds. For this reason, the National Park Service expressly reminds visitors that it is essential to remain a minimum of a bus length (40’) away from the wild horses at all times,” the National Park Service said in a release. About two-thirds of foals in the Assateague Island National Seashore are born in April, May and June. “A mare will be very protective of her new foal and it is vitally important for their well-being that visitors give them, and all of the wild horses, plenty of space,” the release said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Researchers on Cape Cod are launching a new study focused on the hunting and feeding habits of the region’s great white sharks following last year’s two attacks on humans. Greg Skomal, a state marine biologist leading the effort, says the hope is to contribute critical information to the ongoing debate over how to keep Cape beachgoers safe. The new research calls for placing sophisticated tags on sharks to track their swimming speed, depth and body position in the water. Skomal says researchers also hope to determine how many seals great whites are eating and whether that’s affecting the seal population. Local officials have been wrestling for months with how to respond to public concern over last year’s attacks, which included the state’s first shark-related fatality in more than 80 years.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: State officials are questioning whether crews digging water service lines in the city near an American Indian burial ground found human remains after an inspector found work was being conducted without an archaeologist. The Flint Journal reports the inquiry came in a June 18 letter from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to Flint Public Works Director Robert Bincsik. The work appears to have been done without required professional oversight, violating an agreement among the state, Flint and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. The letter asks for details and plans for future work. City spokeswoman Candice Mushatt says no human remains were found, and the city is seeking an archaeologist so excavation can continue.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Starting July 1, Minnesotans who rape their spouses finally can be charged with sexual assault. Wage theft becomes a crime. And drug manufacturers will help shoulder the costs of the opioid epidemic. Those are some new laws taking effect July 1 along with the state’s new $48 billion budget. Minnesota will have what sponsors say is the country’s toughest wage theft law. It comes down hard on employers who cheat workers by making it a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. An estimated 39,000 Minnesotans annually are victims of wage theft in some form. Drug manufacturers and distributors will now have to pay much higher registration fees, which will raise about $21 million annually to help fight the opioid epidemic in the state.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A historical marker has been placed near the river where two men in southern Mississippi said they were abducted by aliens in 1973. News outlets report the city of Pascagoula dedicated the marker Saturday at Lighthouse Park. Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker said they were on the shores of the Pascagoula River when what appeared to be aliens pulled them onboard a UFO, examined them for about 30 minutes and then returned them to Earth. Both reported the event to the sheriff’s department and were checked out at a hospital after it happened Oct. 11, 1973. The story has become known worldwide. Parker published a book about the experience in 2018. Hickson died in 2011. Both said many people doubted their story. A few witnesses have come forward to corroborate some details.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A judge ruled Monday that the state’s lone abortion clinic can continue performing abortions through Friday but kicked the clinic’s lawsuit out of court. St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended a preliminary injunction he previously issued in order to give a Planned Parenthood affiliate in the city time to take a licensing fight before an administrative panel. Stelzer ruled the clinic has not yet exhausted its options outside court to handle the dispute over its license to perform abortions. The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic’s abortion license. The judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Rail Link has been awarded a $3.5 million federal grant to design a safety system for a railway between southern Montana and northern Idaho. The Billings Gazette reports the Federal Rail Administration grant will fund the design and environmental review of implementing a positive train control, an automated system to stop a train before a crash. The safety system would be designed to identify potential problems and warn train operators. It would stop the train if the operator doesn’t act. Montana Rail Link aims to install the system on the 655-mile line running from near Billings to Sandpoint, Idaho. The grant was awarded under the federal Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Program and the Special Transportation Circumstances Program.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Visitors to Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium can now see two newborn sea lion pups in the zoo’s Sea Lion Pavilion. The first pup was born June 12 to 9-year-old Gemini. Another was born Tuesday to 10-year-old Coco. The sexes of the pups are not yet known. The sea lion pups and their mothers are on display with the father of both pups, 15-year-old Chino. The zoo currently has eight sea lions: two males, four females and the two pups. Next year, the zoo is set to open Owen Sea Lion Shores, a new sea lion habitat that will include underwater viewing. The area also will include a natural beach that will allow females to give birth on land and gradually introduce pups to the water, as they would in their natural habitats.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Eldorado Resorts will buy Caesars in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $17.3 billion, creating a casino giant. The acquisition Monday puts about 60 casinos and resorts in 16 states under a single name, one of the biggest gambling and entertainment ventures in the United States. “Together, we will have an extremely powerful suite of iconic gaming and entertainment brands, as well as valuable strategic alliances with industry leaders in sports betting and online gaming,” Eldorado CEO Tom Reeg said in a statement. The company, which will be called Caesars, will be led by Reeg, along with Eldorado Chairman Gary Carano. It will be based in Reno, where Eldorado is based, with a “significant corporate presence” in Las Vegas, where Caesars is based.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire is going to help residents who want to support the state’s pollinators by creating wildflower meadows. The university says pollinators such as bees are critical for New England’s fruit and vegetable crops, and residents have the ability to help by enhancing local habitats. The university is hosting a free event on the subject July 30 at the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station’s Woodman Horticultural Research Farm in Durham. The university says the state has a diverse set of native bees, but habitat loss is a threat to the pollinators. Cathy Neal, a researcher with the agricultural experiment station, says hundreds of pollinator gardens and habitats have been installed in the Granite State in recent years.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMorris County: A photo of a 3-year-old lab mix as he sat beside his recently deceased owner’s empty hospital bed went viral and resulted in his adoption. The dog named Moose was photographed waiting for his owner to return to the hospital bed, apparently unaware he had died, according to a post on the Eleventh Hour Rescue’s Facebook page. Moose was returned to the county-based shelter and its Randolph kennels, where his new family found him. “MOOSE HAS BEEN ADOPTED by a wonderful family who will care for and love him for the rest of his life!” Eleventh Hour Rescue said in the social media post. “Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts! We wish all of our dogs had the same chance at finding a home as Moose does now!”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A longtime advocate and employee of the University of New Mexico University Libraries is donating his collection of rare George Orwell books. The university says professor and curator emeritus Russ Davidson has agreed to donate his Orwell book collection, which includes first editions of “Animal Farm” and “1984” in various languages. Davidson’s extensive collection also includes scarce editions of many of Orwell’s other books, essays and journalistic writings. The collection will be part of an Orwell exhibit in Zimmerman Library from September through next spring. Davidson worked at University Libraries for 25 years. The British-born Orwell was known for his allegorical novella “Animal Farm” and dystopian novel “1984,” both of which tackled totalitarianism. “1984” has become a best-seller in the U.S. again during the Trump administration.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: During Pride month, “somewhere over the rainbow” means crossing the street – over the multicolored crosswalk leading to the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. On Saturday evening, crews from the city’s Department of Transportation painted the pedestrian crossing closest to Stonewall, at Christopher Street and Seventh Avenue, in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. That pavement was hardly celebratory 50 years ago, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, when a police raid on Stonewall touched off riots that inspired the global Pride movement. The Stonewall Inn is now part of a national monument honoring LGBTQ civil rights. Embedded in the epoxy base of the new Village crosswalk are U.S. pennies from 1969, along with a Stonewall 50 logo enamel pin.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTrenton: Nine months after Hurricane Florence inundated the state, communities such as this one illustrate the slow and uneven pace of recovery. With hurricane season starting June 1, the courthouse and jail have yet to reopen as judges hear cases in an office building and inmates are housed in another county. Dozens are seeking federal buyouts of ruined homes, threatening Trenton’s tax base. Even the mayor has yet to move back into her house, due to a shortage of available construction workers. The county also lacks a newspaper or television station to help tell its story. But several residents say that charities have helped spread the word and have done work to get them moved back in, offering hope. The September 2018 hurricane turned downtown into a shallow lake of muddy water, flooding 106 homes – all but about 20 of the town’s households, town officials say.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The Ralph Engelstad Arena at the University of North Dakota is preparing to unveil what it calls the largest video display in college hockey, a 50,000-pound scoreboard manufactured by South Dakota-based Daktronics. The Engelstad Family Foundation, which has been at odds with recently departed school president Mark Kennedy over a basketball floor logo and other issues, has donated $4 million for the $6 million project. The remaining $2 million is coming out of the building’s long-term repair and building fund. Arena manager Jody Hodgson says the idea to upgrade the video display was suggested by foundation trustee Kris Engelstad McGarry about a year and a half ago. Hodgson says the four 34-foot-wide by 15.5-foot-high video boards complement “the original vision” of Ralph Engelstad, a former North Dakota hockey player.\n\nOhio\n\nAshland: BalloonFest is back. The 29th annual extravaganza will be held at Ashland’s Freer Field from Thursday through Saturday. Mindi White, president of Ashland BalloonFest, says 30 hot air balloons are scheduled to be part of this year’s festivities. Food vendors will open at 4 p.m. Thursday, though opening ceremonies won’t happen until 6:15 p.m. on the main stage. The media flight is scheduled to follow at 6:30. The first of three balloon glows will take place at 9:15. All flights will be dependent on the weather. Balloon glows will take place at the same time Friday and Saturday. Saturday’s balloon glow has been named in honor of John Moran, who had taken part in 23 BalloonFests and died at last year’s event when he hit his head on burners while disassembling his balloon.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Drivers who owe fines and fees for traffic violations will be able to settle for pennies on the dollar under an amnesty program approved by the City Council. Beginning July 1, drivers whose citations were issued at least two years ago will have until March 31 to resolve them. People who can’t pay their fines and fees could have their costs waived. People who have dragged their feet to pay a basic traffic ticket or show up for court will be able to settle for $155, a reduction from $613. The cost of the same ticket for someone who pays on time is $172. Officials say the program could help resolve more than 116,000 outstanding cases and help people with suspended driver’s licenses to get them back.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A law passed by the Legislature gives farmers and ranchers immunity from liability while fighting dangerous wildfires, such as the one that chewed through acres of wheat fields and grasslands last year, The Capitol Press reports. The law is similar to one that prevents bystanders from being sued if they try to help during an emergency, according to the newspaper. Gov. Kate Brown signed the bill last week at a ceremony with the Oregon Wheat Growers League. Wheat farmers were the first to respond to the rapidly spreading fire and used their disc plows and water trucks to slow it down before any firefighters arrived. The blaze destroyed 122 square miles of dry wheat fields and grasslands and was devastating for wheat farmers. Its sponsor, Sen. Bill Hansell, R-Athena, says the farmers who used their plows to create dirt firebreaks around homes and small communities were critical in slowing the flames.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers say a just-unveiled compromise budget package won’t include any extra money for the state to bolster federal census efforts. House Republican officials said Monday that there’s no need for the state to help fund a federal government function. A commission tapped by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf to study how to ensure an accurate census in Pennsylvania had asked for $1 per person to aid the outreach, or close to $13 million. Some states are undertaking a similar analysis and, in some cases, devoting money to the cause. The government takes a headcount every 10 years to allocate seats in Congress and billions in federal dollars for such things as transportation projects and education. Wolf’s office says the state would lose almost $2,100 a year for each person who isn’t counted.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Kingstown: A company specializing in wind power blade maintenance has chosen the state for its U.S. headquarters, a sign of Rhode Island’s growing offshore wind industry. Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor told the Boston Globe last week that British company GEV Wind Power has committed to staying at Quonset Point in North Kingstown for at least 12 years. The company plans to create 125 jobs in the state. Pryor says he traveled to the United Kingdom twice in recent months to secure the deal. Pryor acknowledged that Massachusetts is building its role in the wind power industry but says Rhode Island is the “first mover” in this field. The Rhode Island Commerce Corp. was scheduled to vote Monday on a $1.9 million tax credit for GEV.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: This year, the Confederate flag won’t temporarily be raised at the Statehouse to mark the day it was permanently taken down. A group calling for racial fairness – Showing Up for Racial Justice Columbia – has a permit to rally on the grounds July 10. The South Carolina Secessionist Party has raised a Confederate flag on a temporary flagpole the past three years to protest the date the rebel banner was permanently removed. Showing Up for Racial Justice Columbia founder Sarah Keeling told The State newspaper she applied for the permit the minute it was available so the Secessionist Party couldn’t gather. Officials review requests to hold events partly to prevent conflicts with other groups. The Secessionist Party might not have shown up because the group has splintered.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Arc of Dreams is changing the city’s skyline. And once it’s standing, the massive art piece that will be SculptureWalk’s staple art piece downtown itself will change from day to day thanks to an illumination system at the base of each side of the arc. The arc is equipped with 18 high-powered LED bulbs – nine on each side – that will splash color onto the steel structure from the ground up. In each bulb are red, white, green and blue diodes, which can be mixed and matched to create any number of colors. The lights are connected to digital software that will give SculptureWalk the ability to schedule color changes and even create the look of movement by rapidly changing colors that are splashing up and down the arc.\n\nTennessee\n\nMartin: A couple is donating $22 million to provide scholarships at the University of Tennessee-Martin, marking the largest gift in campus history. A news release says the gift by Bill and Rosann Nunnelly was announced during the University of Tennessee’s board meeting Friday. The donation will occur after the Nunnellys’ deaths, although four Hickman County students will begin receiving scholarships this fall. Dickson, Giles, Lawrence, Lewis, Maury and Humphreys county students could qualify for future scholarships. More than 90 scholarships could be awarded annually. Bill Nunnelly was raised on a farm in the Hickman County community bearing his family’s name. The semi-retired entrepreneur earned an undergraduate degree from UT Martin in 1970.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A worldwide sailing competition has returned to the city this week as the 2019 CITGO Etchells World Championship Regatta is contested on Corpus Christi Bay. The weeklong event will feature nearly 120 sailors from across the world, competing for the coveted championship trophy. Racing begins at noon Tuesday and is at the same time each day through Saturday. The Etchells sailboat traces it roots back to the 1950s, when E.W. “Skip” Etchells designed a boat for a yachting magazine competition to find a new three-man Olympic keelboat. The design lost out to the “Soling” for the Olympics but took hold in other sailing competitions. The boat is just over 30 feet long and has a main sail area of 188 square feet. It is considered one of the most popular competition boats in the world.\n\nUtah\n\nWest Haven: As the state’s population booms, some farmers in Weber County are making the tough but sometimes lucrative decision to sell their land as small family plots give way to homes. The Standard-Examiner reports that Phil Green is among Ogden-area farmers who recently sold land to housing developers. Green sold 56 acres that his family used for a dairy farm and to grow hay and corn. Today, more than 100 new houses fill that land. Green says it was hard to let the land go, and he sometimes cries when he walks through the subdivision. But he’s also glad he had the opportunity to sell. Weber County Commissioner Scott Jenkins says selling the land is sometimes a no-brainer for farmers struggling to make profits working the land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is looking for volunteers to count bats this summer. The department says the little brown bat is endangered in the state, and long-term volunteer monitoring is critical to its management and recovery. It’s holding a training session for volunteers next week in Fair Haven. The little brown bat population has declined by up to 90% in Vermont. Volunteer citizen scientists help by monitoring rare colonies of female bats and their young. State biologist Alyssa Bennett says the state has shown that the small surviving population appears to be holding steady. The free presentation and training will be held Friday at Bomoseen State Park from 8 p.m. to after dusk. Afterward, volunteers will be given sites to monitor.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia is considering a petition to remove a statue of a Revolutionary War hero because it depicts a potential attack on Native Americans. The Daily Progress reports that the school’s segregation commission is considering a petition to remove a statue of George Rogers Clark from campus that shows him and his soldiers possibly about to attack a group of Native Americans. The statue calls Clark the “Conqueror of the Northwest” and was given to the school in the 1920s. Clark led a militia that fought the British and their Native American allies during the Revolutionary War. In 1779 he routed the British from Fort Sackville in the Battle of Vincennes in present-day Indiana. He is the brother of William Clark, who co-led the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: Wind is damaging the state’s cherry crop, but how much is not yet known. “Some say significant, but we won’t know until it runs over the line,” said B.J. Thurlby, president of Northwest Cherry Growers in Yakima, referring to when wind-damaged fruit reaches packing lines. Before winds reaching 35 mph hit the area last Wednesday, up to 90% of cherries were being packed, which is an excellent rate, Thurlby told the Capital Press. That percentage will probably drop. Wind bangs cherries around, bruising them as they hit or rub branches, leaves and other cherries. The riper the fruit, the more susceptible to damage they are. Rainiers bruise more easily than dark cherries. A lighter crop helps in some areas because clusters aren’t so tight, putting cherries in constant contact with each other.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The leader of the state’s Republican Party is applauding a state senator’s call for intolerance against members of the LGBTQ community. Republican state Sen. Mike Azinger wrote an opinion article Sunday titled “The Shame of LGBTQ Pride” in The Parkersburg News and Sentinel after the paper covered a gay pride picnic. State GOP chairwoman Melody Potter then wrote on Facebook that Azinger’s article was “right on.” Azinger wrote that “sexual deviancy is going mainstream” and said the solution “is not political correctness and tolerance.” Azinger says he’s taking a biblical position. Potter did not return a call to her office. Andrew Schneider, executive director of the advocacy group Fairness West Virginia, says Potter and Azinger are forgetting their scripture when it comes to loving others.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison is setting up a new marker recognizing the campus as the ancestral home of the Ho-Chunk tribe. The university announced Monday that UW-Madison leaders and Ho-Chunk Nation officials dedicated the plaque on Bascom Hill on Thursday. The marker is entitled “Our Shared Future” and acknowledges the campus occupies ancestral Ho-Chunk land, a place the tribe called Teejop. The marker notes the tribe was forced to give up the territory in 1832. The plaque says both the federal and state government tried unsuccessfully to force the tribe out of Wisconsin, but UW-Madison recognizes the Ho-Chunk Nation’s sovereignty, as well as the sovereignty of the other 11 tribes that reside in the state. The marker will be part of all prospective student tours.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A national park and a nonprofit group plan to spend $8 million to improve boating facilities and address environmental damage along the Snake River in western Wyoming. The Snake River Gateways campaign is a joint effort between Grand Teton National Park and the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. The project will focus on boat launches and landings near Moose, Pacific Creek and Jackson Lake Dam. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports plans call for adding shelter for visitors at the busy landing site at Moose. The boat ramp at Pacific Creek will be replaced, and a nearby parking area will be reconfigured. The Jackson Lake Dam site will also get a new boat ramp and parking area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/25"}]}

Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/europe/british-prime-minister-resigns-what-happens-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "What happens when a British Prime Minister resigns? | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation on Thursday following mounting pressure from lawmakers in his own party to stand down.\n\nUnder the UK political system, between elections, only Conservative members of Parliament have the ability to remove a sitting Conservative Prime Minister.\n\nSo, what happens to the UK government when a Prime Minister resigns, and how is a new leader elected?\n\nWhen will a new leader be in place?\n\nDuring his statement Johnson said he will not leave office immediately, but will wait until his successor is chosen.\n\n“I’ve today appointed a cabinet to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place,” he said.\n\nJohnson said that the timeline for the process will be announced next week, but it has been suggested he could remain in power until the Conservative Party conference in October.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Sir John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in office for an extended period of time while a new Conservative leader is chosen.\n\n“The proposal for the Prime Minister to remain in office – for up to three months — having lost the support of his Cabinet, his Government and his parliamentary party is unwise, and may be unsustainable,” Major wrote in a letter to the Chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, Graham Brady.\n\nAnd Dominic Cummings, who served as Johnson’s most senior adviser before becoming an outspoken critic of the Prime Minister, warned against allowing him to stay in post.\n\n“We’re all in for a nightmare if he’s allowed to squat,” said Cummings.\n\nRecent precedent shows that the time taken to choose a new leader can vary.\n\nAfter Theresa May resigned on May 24, 2019 it took until July 24 for Boris Johnson to take over, but when David Cameron resigned on June 24, 2016 it took just a few weeks for May to take office on July 13.\n\nWho will be Prime Minister while all this happens?\n\nAs Johnson indicated in his resignation speech, he plans to stay in office until a successor is chosen.\n\nThat’s what would happen under normal circumstances: A Prime Minister who has resigned as party leader stays in office as caretaker Prime Minister until there is a new party leader.\n\nBut it’s not clear that the Conservative Party will stand for that in Johnson’s case.\n\nOne alternative would be for Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab to step in as caretaker. There’s no precedent for that – but there’s also no precedent for more than 50 government officials to resign in two days in order to force a Prime Minister out.\n\nWill Johnson’s resignation trigger a general election?\n\nNo. It starts the Conservative Party process for choosing a new leader of the party.\n\nUK Prime Ministers are not directly elected by the people; Johnson is Prime Minister because he is the head of the largest party in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Conservatives will still be the largest party after Johnson quits, so the new head of the party will become Prime Minister.\n\nHow is the new Conservative Party leader chosen?\n\nLeadership candidates need the support of at least eight lawmakers.\n\nIf there are more than two candidates, Conservative Party lawmakers hold round after round of votes to whittle the number of leadership candidates down to two.\n\nThen Conservative Party members nationwide vote – by mail – between the two finalists.\n\nThe winner becomes leader of the party – and Prime Minister.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nIs there any way to force Johnson to leave before a new Conservative Party leader is chosen?\n\nConservative lawmakers could, in theory, try to force him out themselves by calling a vote of confidence among Tory MPs. But Johnson survived a vote like that just a month ago.\n\nUnder current party rules, that means there can’t be another party confidence vote in him for 12 months.\n\nThe rules could be changed, but it’s not clear the Conservative Party wants to start that kind of infighting when Johnson has already said he’s going, and when a leadership contest is under way.\n\nCan’t the opposition do anything to force Johnson out?\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer said Thursday that if the Conservatives didn’t push Johnson out immediately, the opposition would call a confidence vote in the government among the entire House of Commons.\n\nIf the opposition won, it could theoretically lead to a general election – but even with all the chaos in the Conservative Party at the moment, they still have a big majority in the House of Commons, and they’re not likely to want a general election at the same time as a leadership election. So the chances of the opposition bringing the government down now are slim.\n\nWhen Johnson does finally leave Downing Street, what happens?\n\nHe submits his resignation to the Queen, in person.\n\nThe Palace will announce officially that Queen Elizabeth II has accepted Johnson’s resignation, and will say who she has invited to become Prime Minister to replace him. That person will then go to meet the Queen to accept the invitation. This is a formality.\n\nDoes the new Prime Minister have to call a general election?\n\nNo. The United Kingdom isn’t scheduled to have another general election until December 2024.\n\nThe new Prime Minister could choose to ask Parliament to vote for an early election, but isn’t required to do so.", "authors": ["Richard Allen Greene"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954178/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-conservative-party-conference-2021", "title": "Conservative conference 2021: everything you need to know | The ...", "text": "Boris Johnson is heading into the Conservatives’ conference this weekend to lay out his post-pandemic agenda with a new top team following his ambitious cabinet reshuffle.\n\nThe Tory leader has already unveiled social care funding reforms that steer his party into unchartered “tax-and-spend waters”, as the London Evening Standard’s political editor Nicholas Cecil noted after the announcement earlier this month.\n\nAlthough the prime minister’s plan to hike National Insurance contributions has proved unpopular with some voters and Conservative colleagues, Johnson appeared to be entering “the often frenzied party conference season solidly at the helm of his party”, wrote Cecil.\n\nBut with the UK now facing further so-called black swan events, including the ongoing fuel shortages crisis, some commentators are asking whether Johnson still retains a firm grip on power.\n\nWhen and where\n\nThe Conservative Party conference 2021 is taking place from 3 to 6 October at the Manchester Central Convention Complex and will be streamed online.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nJohnson is planning something “a little different” when he delivers his keynote speech in Manchester, according to The Times. The PM will “stand in the centre of the room”, surrounded by his ministers and Conservative party members, the paper reported.\n\nAnd “taking a direct note out of his Downing Street neighbour Rishi Sunak’s playbook”, Johnson will “pitch himself as the man prepared to make difficult decisions in the national interest”.\n\nHis government, he will reportedly say, is willing to “do what needs to be done”.\n\nToy voters and industry bosses may be in need of reassure following the tax hikes announcement. The Conservatives will enter the conference looking to “reassure the business world that all is well”, wrote the BBC’s political reporter Justin Parkinson.\n\nChancellor Sunak will speak on Monday, “dubbed ‘Business Day’, when industrialists and entrepreneurs will be wined and dined”, said Parkinson. Planned events include panel sessions on “Levelling up”, “Skills, Employment and Growth” and the push to “Build Back Greener”, according to the official conference website.\n\nJohnson may also be looking to put “a little more flesh on the bones of his ‘levelling up’ plans for the UK” during his speech, added Parkinson. And the PM will undoubtedly be keen to “vaunt the success of the vaccines programme and, with the economy improving, project a sense of optimism”.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nAlthough Johnson “invariably gets a rapturous response” from the party faithful, wrote the BBC’s Parkinson, he is also facing the ire of the Conservative grassroots over his controversial social care funding plans.\n\nIn the wake of the tax rise announcement, The Telegraph reported that activists were “starting to rip up their membership cards” and that some cabinet members were “privately deeply concerned”. An unnamed minister told the paper that they feared the plans were “the death knell of Conservatism”.\n\nAmid ongoing unrest, John Strafford, chair of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, is organising a fringe event at the conference, titled “Time for the Conservative Party to be Conservative” .\n\nJohnson will also be under pressure to give more details about how he intends to ‘level up’ the UK, with commentators complaining that plans for the policy remain vague.\n\nDespite the scepticism, the PM views the project as a key part of his “political legacy”, said The Times.\n\n“I don’t think people quite appreciate how seriously Boris takes levelling up,” a senior Whitehall source who “has spoken to Johnson at length about the subject” told the paper.\n\n“There are two things he sees as his legacy. The first is net zero and the second is levelling up. He knows he is going to be judged on that at the next election.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/01/uk/liz-truss-conservative-conference-gbr-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss faces her party faithful after a disastrous week. Many ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss’ first full week as British Prime Minister has not been an easy one. It began with the pound crashing to its lowest level in decades following her government’s mini-budget last Friday. It ended with her meeting the UK’s independent financial forecaster and having to explain herself after a week of economic chaos.\n\nThis weekend, she will travel to Birmingham to attend her Conservative party’s annual conference, a meeting that could become a defining moment in her premiership.\n\nHer party is bitterly divided. Since becoming leader, poll ratings have sunk lower than they were even under the disgraced leadership of Boris Johnson. Conservative members of Parliament fear the combination of tax cuts along with huge public spending to help people cope with energy bills, rising inflation, rising interest rates and a falling pound are going to make winning the next general election impossible.\n\nEven her supporters privately say that while they support her tax cuts, the communication has been appalling and fear that she might never recover from her disastrous start. Many are comparing it to Black Wednesday in 1992, when sterling crashed sufficiently that the UK had to pull out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Then-Prime Minister John Major never recovered from the crisis and despite an economic recovery, lost the next election in 1997.\n\nFor now, no one expects the government to reverse its policy. “They are stuck with this. The thing with radical policy that shakes market confidence is that U-turning creates even more instability and won’t restore market confidence,” says one Conservative MP.\n\nBeyond how a U-turn might look to those outside, the more important reason Truss is likely to stick to her guns is that she sincerely believes that her economic plan is the right thing for Britain. Her supporters argue that the UK has had anemic growth for years. They believe that a more competitive tax system and new regulatory system is the best way to encourage investment, create jobs and grow the economy.\n\nIn itself, this is not a controversial idea. What some fear is that the combination of tax cuts and borrowing to fund public spending is a disastrous combination of policies that have been poorly communicated at the worst possible time.\n\n“We look like reckless gamblers who only care about the people who can afford to lose the gamble,” one former Conservative minister told CNN earlier this week. “My fear is that it’s the final role of the dice to win the next election that has already backfired.”\n\nThe idea that this is a gamble, Truss’ kitchen sink moment, to do something drastic and win the next election, is shared by other Conservatives.\n\nHowever, they are concerned that these policies have been cooked up by politicians who spend too much time in Westminster talking to people who agree with them, but are alienated from what average voters are concerned about.\n\n“Ordinary people are seeing their mortgages go up at a rate that outstrips any government support for energy bills or money saved through tax cuts,” says another former minister. “The crazy thing is that Boris [Johnson] won an 80-seat majority with an electoral coalition that still exists today. Ripping up his government’s policies and reinventing the wheel just wasn’t necessary.”\n\nThe mood going into Conservative Party conference is undeniably bleak. Not everyone thinks that the next election is already lost, but most think the current situation is a mess that needs sorting out very quickly.\n\n“They need to explain their fiscal rules, cut spending on white elephant projects and not look like they are doing everything so hastily,” says a Conservative MP who supported Truss’ leadership campaign.\n\nAnother Truss ally says: “The problem with Liz and Kwasi [Kwarteng, the finance minister] is they are both very intelligent and think about six moves ahead of everyone else. They need to explain their actions more clearly and give people the time to understand what they are trying to do.”\n\nAnd her critics also believe there are ways of turning this around without losing face. “They could keep the policies but roll them out slowly. Kick some stuff into the long grass so there isn’t so much immediate impact.”\n\nThere is also the real possibility that her plans work. Sterling could recover, the economy could grow against the odds and she might have some real wins to take into next election, which is still probably over two years away.\n\nThe question Conservatives are asking is, does Truss have the political talent, both herself and in the team around her, to win over the public?\n\nHer team is full of young people who are undeniably skilled, but in some cases lack the experience you’d typically associate with people who work for the leader of a country, many Conservatives believe. There is also a sense that the third change in leaders in six years has burned through the talent.\n\nThere is still time for Truss to turn things around. But she is losing support from her own side, and there is already speculation that Conservative MPs are thinking about ways to get rid of her, which is incredible just weeks into her premiership.\n\nThe official opposition Labour Party held their conference earlier this week, and the mood was one of cautious optimism. Almost everyone there, from corporate PRs to party activists, felt this was a party on the verge of power.\n\nIn the coming week, Truss needs to address her own party faithful and give them something to be optimistic about.

Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor.\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down – without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n“It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,” Johnson said.\n\n“The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,” he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet “to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.” Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how “painful” it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n“In the last few days, I’ve tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we’re delivering so much… and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,” Johnson said.\n\n“I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it’s painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,” he said, adding that he’s proud of “getting Brexit done” and “leading the West in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n“To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,” he said. “And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them’s the breaks.”\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street’s botched handling of the resignation by Johnson’s former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis – despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister’s Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn’t going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the “right decision” to resign. “We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,” she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a “duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.”\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.”\n\n“He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. “They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,” Starmer said.\n\n“Enough is enough. We don’t need to change the Tory at the top – we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.”\n\n‘Needless damage’\n\nConventionally, when a Conservative leader resigns, he or she gives the party time to hold a thorough leadership contest, in which Conservative lawmakers and then party members nationwide vote.\n\nBut some said Johnson should leave office more quickly.\n\n“We now need a new Leader as soon as practicable,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter. “Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country, and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for the leadership question to be settled.\n\n“There will be a widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end, though notion of Boris Johnson staying on as PM until autumn seems far from ideal, and surely not sustainable?” Sturgeon said in a series of tweets.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told CNN that the party needs “to move swiftly to a leadership contest.”\n\nBaker said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab should be caretaker prime minister, but that Johnson could also continue in office. Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent “routine” operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain’s PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n“I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it’s agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that’s fine with me,” Baker told CNN. “Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.”\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen. He too suggested Raab could serve as the acting prime minister.\n\nHours after Johnson’s announcement, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat launched his campaign for the top job with an editorial in UK newspaper the Telegraph.\n\nBarrage of criticism\n\nJohnson’s departure will mark a remarkable downfall for a prime minister who was once seen as having political superpowers, with an appeal that transcended traditional party lines.\n\nHe won a landslide victory in December 2019 on the promise of delivering a Brexit deal and leading the UK to a bright future outside the European Union. But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee Ivana Kottasová", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/06/24/world-wakes-up-brexit-what-we-know/86326250/", "title": "World wakes up to 'Brexit': 5 things to know", "text": "Jane Onyanga-Omara\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLONDON — The British public voted to leave the European Union in a historic referendum Thursday. The departure is dubbed \"Brexit\" — Britain’s exit from the 28-member bloc.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nMorning! U.K. votes for ‘Brexit’\n\nThe margin of victory for \"Brexit\" in the referendum was 52% to 48%, according to a final tally announced early Friday. \"Leave\" supporters argued that severing ties with the EU is the only way to reduce high levels of immigration and ensure the U.K.'s sovereignty over EU regulations. The “remain” camp said jobs, the economy, national security and the U.K.'s standing on the world stage would be compromised outside the bloc.\n\nCameron announces his resignation\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron, who led the campaign to remain in the EU, announced he will step down. “We should aim to have a new prime minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party conference in October,” he said in a speech outside Downing Street on Friday soon after the vote tally was announced.\n\nHistoric 'Brexit' is here: What happens next\n\nCameron said he informed Queen Elizabeth II of his decision, adding that the will of the British people “must be respected.” Among his possible successors is Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who led the “leave” campaign.\n\nU.K's Cameron vows to 'steady ship' before resigning\n\nPound plunges, global markets in turmoil\n\nThe British pound fell 11% to a 31-year low and Britain's main stock index, the FTSE 100, nosedived 8.7% to 5,790 points shortly after the open Friday. U.S. stocks also nosedived at the open.\n\nMarkets were also volatile in Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 average dropped nearly 1,300 points, or 8%, Friday. The Bank of England — the U.K.'s central bank — said it was monitoring developments closely and \"has undertaken extensive contingency planning.\"\n\n‘No immediate change’ for Britons, EU citizens\n\nCameron said there will be “no immediate change in circumstances” for British citizens living in other EU countries and EU nationals living in Britain. About 3 million people from other EU countries live in the U.K., and 1.2 million Britons live elsewhere in the EU.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of the bloc is allowing the free movement of people and workers. Negotiations between the U.K. and the EU over the exit terms will take at least two years.\n\nEmergency meetings called to deal with fallout\n\nEmergency meetings were called around Europe Friday to deal with the fallout from the vote. “This result clearly has very significant implications for Ireland, as well as for Britain and for the European Union,\" a statement from the Irish government said ahead of an emergency cabinet meeting. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to make a statement following a meeting with lawmakers in Berlin.\n\nThe European Parliament called a special session Tuesday. However Janet Yellen, the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, said Wednesday, before the referendum, that she did not plan any special meetings to respond to the result.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nDavid Cameron announces resignation after U.K. votes for 'Brexit'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/gallery/liz-truss/index.html", "title": "Photos: Liz Truss, the UK's new prime minister | CNN", "text": "Liz Truss has become the United Kingdom's new prime minister, succeeding Boris Johnson, who resigned in July after a series of scandals.\n\nTruss, 47, defeated rival Rishi Sunak in the Conservative Party leadership contest, and she follows Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain's third female premier.\n\nThroughout her political career, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nTruss was elected to Parliament in 2010. In a relatively short period of time, she has established herself as a political force of nature who pursues her agenda with relentless vigor and unequivocal enthusiasm. She served under three prime ministers in several different cabinet jobs, most recently as foreign secretary.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right's figurehead.\n\nTruss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate, and she has enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/uk/boris-johnson-number-10-drinks-lockdown-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson: Downing Street staff invited to lockdown-breaking ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has more questions to answer after it emerged that one of his top officials sent an invitation to a Downing Street party to dozens of employees during the first Covid-19 lockdown in the country.\n\nThe email, from Johnson’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, invited more than 100 staffers to “socially distanced drinks in the No. 10 garden” on May 20, 2020, encouraging them to “bring (their) own booze” and “make the most of the lovely weather.”\n\nAt that time, strict lockdown restrictions were in place in England that banned more than two people from meeting outdoors.\n\nThe revelation deepens a scandal over a series of allegedly rule-breaking parties held in and around Downing Street that have sparked public fury, sunk Johnson’s Conservative Party in opinion polls and led to scrutiny over his position as prime minister.\n\nIn the email, first published by ITV News on Monday, Reynolds said: “After what has been an incredibly busy period it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No10 garden this evening.”\n\n“Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!” the email added.\n\nA source who worked in Downing Street at the time has confirmed the contents of the email independently to CNN.\n\nThe revelations led to another round of public outrage, which has been simmering since the first reports of a Christmas party inside Downing Street in 2020 were published last December.\n\nTwo-thirds (66%) of UK adults say that Johnson should resign following allegations that he attended the BYOB social gathering when England was under lockdown, according to a new Savanta ComRes snap poll, published on Tuesday.\n\nAnd four out of 10 (42%) people who said they voted for Johnson’s Conservative Party in the last election said that he should resign, the poll found. That’s a rise of nine points – from 33% – in people saying he should resign in December.\n\nHannah Brady, a campaigner for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died with the virus four days before the email was sent. “At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?,” she said in a statement.\n\n“To think that whilst it was happening Boris Johnson was making the ‘most of the weather’ and throwing a party for 100 people, is truly beyond belief,” she added. “Could there be a more disgraceful example of ‘one rule for them, and another rule for the rest of us’?”\n\nMixing between households was at the time limited to two people, who could only meet outdoors and at a distance of at least 2 meters (6.5 feet). In workplaces, official guidance stated that in-person meetings should only take place if “absolutely necessary.”\n\nThe wisdom of organizing a drinks party during that period was questioned by some staffers who were invited, according to the BBC. One wrote to a colleague: “Is this for real?,” while another message said: “Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?,” the BBC reported.\n\nJohnson refused to respond to reports that he and his wife, Carrie Johnson, had attended the event when pressed by a journalist on Monday, saying only: “That, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray.”\n\nGray, a senior civil servant, has been tasked with investigating the alleged parties. She took on the role after Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was removed from the probe, following revelations that he had known about a party held in his own department.\n\nEdward Argar, the minister of state for health, also deflected questions on the issue on Tuesday. “I don’t know what did or didn’t happen. All I’ve seen are the reports, the email that was reported yesterday, and various sources quoted by various media and journalistic outlets,” Argar told British broadcaster Sky News.\n\n“That’s why it’s right that this is looked into independently by Sue Gray, and therefore it’d be wrong for me to comment.”\n\nBut Keir Starmer, the opposition Labour Party leader, said on Tuesday: “Boris Johnson, your deflections and distractions are absurd.”\n\n“Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them,” Starmer added. “Stop lying to the British public. It’s time to finally come clean.”\n\nAnd the Metropolitan Police, which has been criticized for refusing to investigate any of the reported parties, said it was “in contact with the Cabinet Office” over the event.\n\nA deepening scandal\n\nJohnson has faced multiple claims that social events were held inside 10 Downing Street in the spring of 2020 and the run up to Christmas that year, when local restrictions barred such gatherings.\n\nWhen those questions began, Johnson rebuffed them by saying that no parties had taken place and his staffers and aides had followed the rules at all times. But since then a flood of allegations and leaks have shed light on several alleged gatherings.\n\nLast month, a photo emerged allegedly showing Johnson drinking wine with Downing Street staff during a gathering that took place on May 15, 2020 – five days before the “bring your own booze” gathering was scheduled. The image, shared with the Guardian, shows staff gathered in the garden at Downing Street, which is also the Prime Minister’s residence. In the photo, Johnson is seen with his then-fiancée Carrie Symonds and two others seated at a table with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson responded to the image saying: “Work meetings often take place in the Downing Street garden in the summer months. On this occasion there were staff meetings following a No. 10 press conference.”\n\nMeanwhile a video of staff joking about a “Christmas party” in December 2020 that “was not socially distanced” prompted the resignation of Allegra Stratton, one of Johnson’s closest aides.\n\nCNN established last month that social gatherings were indeed held on December 18, 2020, as well as November 27 of that year, and confirmed a Daily Mirror report that Johnson himself gave an impromptu speech at the latter.\n\nA separate photo of Johnson hosting a Christmas quiz party at Downing Street that allegedly broke Covid-19 restrictions was then published by British newspaper The Mirror. A spokesperson said “the Prime Minister briefly took part virtually in a quiz to thank staff for their hard work throughout the year.”\n\nPublic anger prompted Johnson to call for an inquiry. On Monday, the Prime Minister would not elaborate on whether he had already been interviewed by Gray yet.\n\nAngela Rayner, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responding to reports of the email, said: “Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us.”\n\n“He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates,” she added.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Rob Picheta Arnaud Siad Niamh Kennedy Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee", "Rob Picheta", "Arnaud Siad", "Niamh Kennedy", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/09/14/theresa-may-heels-england/90362096/", "title": "British PM criticized for wearing leopard print high heels", "text": "Tom Peck\n\nThe Independent\n\nTheresa May should “finally set an example we can be proud of” and wear flat shoes instead of her trademark kitten heels to this year’s Conservative Party conference and beyond, according to the leaders of a trade union campaign.\n\nThe TUC conference in Brighton, England, is backing a new law to ban women from being forced to wear high heels in the workplace, and have asked the Prime Minister to support it.\n\nThe campaign began when 27-year-old temporary receptionist Nicola Thorp was sent home from work for wearing flat shoes. The damaging effects of high heels on the feet and the back are well documented.\n\nNearly 150,000 people have since signed a petition calling for a government inquiry and a debate in Parliament on the campaign.\n\nPenny Robinson from the GMB Union, who took off her high heels before making her speech, said:\n\n\"When Theresa May became Conservative leader and prime minister, I expected to read analysis of her policies, her priorities and her approach to Brexit. Instead, most of the newspapers concentrated on her love of shoes and extensive shoe collection.\"\n\nRobinson said that the prime minister may be known for her \"leopard print kitten heels, her leather boots and her Jimmy Choos, but if she really wants to advance the cause for women in the workplace there are two things she can do. The first is to make a point of wearing pumps, flats and comfortable shoes for Cabinet, for PMQs and for meeting all those EU leaders.\"\n\nShe added, \"Let the media see that you can be the most powerful woman in the country - maybe the second after Frances O'Grady (TUC general secretary) - without needing to wear designer shoes to meet men's expectations. \"For once, set an example we can actually be proud of.”\n\nMay, who in her appearance on Desert Island Discs chose as her luxury item ‘a lifetime subscription to Vogue’ is not expected to take the TUC’s advice.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/14"}]}
