One major inconvenience may be over at last.\n\nMost the time, you don’t want the government getting involved in tech product design, for obvious reasons. Apple’s products are cool because of a design icon named Jony Ive — a bunch of DC bureaucrats could never match his output.\n\nBut Apple’s also guilty of manufacturing an infuriating number of charging cables that work only for its own devices. Lord help you if you’re an iPhone user who loves her Kindle and wears a Garmin watch. That’s three cables you’re packing for a weekend trip. Four if you bring your laptop. It’s been this way for decades, and no one likes it.\n\nAll of that could change soon.\n\nThis week, the European Union took an unusual step to reduce cable clutter and waste by requiring Apple and other smartphone makers to support a single common charging standard for mobile devices as early as the fall of 2024.\n\nUnder the legislation, virtually all of your everyday devices that are rechargeable via a wired cable — phones, tablets, e-readers, earbuds, cameras, portable speakers, etc — will have to be equipped with a port known as USB-C.\n\nIt’s not a total surprise — Apple’s been preparing for the end of its special Lightning connector for some time. The company already uses the USB-C standard in some Macs and iPads and is reportedly testing iPhone models that swap out the Lightning port. But the law could put a fire under Apple’s designers to shift fully to USB-C and potentially finally kill the Lightning charger for good.\n\nYou may be thinking, Finally! One charging cable for all my stuff!\n\nAnd I hear you. We’ve all got that shoebox packed with every type of cable ever made (except for the one you need) collecting dust in the closet, and I, too, would like to confidently throw it in the garbage.\n\nBut the EU’s ruling is about a decade too late.\n\nThe environmental damage is done. We’ve all already bought the extra Apple Lightning chargers to ensure we never run out of juice on our iPhones and AirPods because we are a screen-addicted people who can’t stand the sound of our own thoughts. We can neither fall asleep nor wake up without our phones; we don’t know which route to take to work without an app’s guidance; I’ve heard of people who don’t fill every waking moment with a Spotify playlist or podcast in their ear, but I do not know, nor do I care to find out, how they manage it.\n\nApple (AAPL) hates the idea (shocker) because it argues it will slow innovation and render about a billion devices obsolete. But they’ve been testing new iPhone models with USB-C ports anyway, and I have no doubt that one of the world’s most valuable companies will be A-OK in figuring out how to wring more money from customers in the meantime.\n\nEnjoying Nightcap?

{"question_id": "20220617_2", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/12/politics/whats-in-senate-gun-reform-agreement/index.html", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA bipartisan group of senators unveiled an agreement on principle for gun safety legislation Sunday, providing an overview of a forthcoming package of reforms to address one of the nation’s most pressing and divisive issues in the wake of mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas.\n\nOne of the biggest factors still to be sorted out in the framework agreement is how the legislation will be written. The announcement includes the support of 10 Republican senators, which would give the proposal enough support to overcome the Senate filibuster – but maintaining it through the legislative process will be a massive challenge for lawmakers to accomplish before the next congressional recess in two weeks.\n\nStill, Democrats have an ambitious goal: draft the bill and keep Republicans on board before the next recess, aides tell CNN. Many of the details in the plan are still unsettled, according to one aide, who also provided CNN with a more detailed rundown as of Sunday on how some of the proposed provisions would work.\n\nHere is what the lawmakers included in the framework and what they left out.\n\nReforms included in the agreement\n\n‘Red flag’ laws\n\nOne of the most significant pieces of the framework is helping states create and implement so-called red flag laws, which are aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves or others. This legislation would provide significant funding to help states create new red flag laws, but the 19 states – and Washington, DC – that already have these laws on the books would also be eligible for funding to improve the effectiveness of their established programs.\n\nMental health and telehealth investment\n\nThe proposal also includes “major investments to increase access to mental health and suicide prevention programs; and other support services available in the community, including crisis and trauma intervention and recovery.”\n\nMembers are going to be messaging these provisions carefully over the next several weeks because while Democrats view them as important, they want to emphasize that most people who struggle with mental illnesses are not violent.\n\nClosing the so-called boyfriend loophole\n\nThe senators said the legislation will address the so-called boyfriend loophole, which deals with whether unmarried partners could keep guns if they were found guilty of violence against a dating partner.\n\nEarlier this year, the Senate negotiators involved in the Violence Against Women Act dropped the provision because of objections from the National Rifle Association, dealing a huge blow to Democrats. But its inclusion in this framework signals that at least 10 Republicans are willing to buck the nation’s largest gun lobby on an issue where they have a long-held position.\n\nCurrently, only a person who has been married to, lived with or had a child with a partner they’ve been convicted of abusing are blocked from having a gun. Closing the loophole would mean that anyone who was deemed to have been in a serious dating relationship and convicted of domestic violence would no longer be eligible to own a gun.\n\nEnhanced review process for buyers under 21\n\nThe other major change in the legislation is issuing a more thorough review process for people between ages 18 and 21 who go to buy a gun like an AR-15. Under a background check review, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System would have to also contact state and local law enforcement to search for any disqualifying mental health or juvenile records, according to the Democratic aide.\n\nNICS would have to call the appropriate agency that adjudicates mental health records in each state. NICS would have up to 3 days to conduct the search, but it could be extended another seven days if the initial review raises concerns, meaning the process could take a total of 10 days.\n\nIt is not an established waiting period since each individual’s review could be vastly different from just a matter of hours to up to 10 days.\n\nClarifying the definition of a Federally Licensed Firearm Dealer\n\nThe language for this provision is still being debated, but it would require more firearm sellers who are proven to be “engaged in the business of selling firearms” to be put on notice that they need to register to become Federally Licensed Firearm dealers. It’s significant because it means those dealers have to conduct background checks under federal law.\n\nSchool security resources\n\nThe legislation would address an area Republicans have focused on in recent weeks: school security. The lawmakers said in their release that the proposal provides money “to help institute safety measures in and around primary and secondary schools,” while also supporting “school violence prevention efforts” and training for school employees and students.\n\nWhat lawmakers left out\n\nExpanded background checks\n\nNotably, the agreement doesn’t include a provision that would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. Currently, background checks are not required for gun sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers.\n\nDemocrats have long supported such a requirement, and last year the House passed gun legislation that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales, marking the first congressional move on significant gun control since Democrats won the White House and the majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nAssault weapons ban\n\nAlso left out is a federal ban on military-style assault weapons, another measure Democrats have been pushing in recent years, citing mass shootings that have involved such weapons.\n\nHigher minimum age of purchase\n\nAdditionally, the agreement doesn’t include a change to the age at which a person needs to be to purchase an assault-style weapon. Democrats, including West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, the chamber’s most conservative Democrat, have said the age to purchase assault weapons must be raised from 18 to 21.", "authors": ["Lauren Fox Devan Cole", "Lauren Fox", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/06/12"}]}

They were later pulled over and arrested, Coeur d’Alene Police Chief Lee White said.\n\nThe group was headed to a Pride in the Park event at Coeur d’Alene City Park, police said. The event included a Pride walk and performances by local musicians, dancers and drag artists.\n\nLocal and state police were plentiful and on high alert Saturday because they wanted “to make sure this event went off safely,” Mayor Jim Hammond said. They’d also received threats about a separate group meeting in another city park; threats that turned out to be unfounded, he said.\n\nHammond referred to those arrested as young men who “seem to not have a purpose.” Asked what he thought the group might have done had police not thwarted their alleged plans, he said, “I have not seen that these people had any firearms, so I think it would’ve been mostly just disruption and trying to cause fear.”\n\nPolice found at least one smoke grenade, White said.\n\nAll 31 individuals were from outside the local area, Hammond said previously. Just two are from Idaho, according to a booking summary from the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nIt’s unclear why they picked Coeur d’Alene’s out of all the Pride events going on in the nation, but Hammond said perhaps they thought they could “get away with more” in a smaller community like Coeur d’Alene, a city of about 56,000 residents located just over the Washington border from Spokane.\n\nThe North Idaho Pride Alliance, which organized the event, released a statement Sunday saying its members were resting “after successfully organizing a momentous, joyful, and SAFE Pride in the Park community celebration under the most challenging of circumstances. … We are deeply grateful to law enforcement agencies who were present and professionally responded.”\n\nHere’s what we know about the arrests:\n\nPolice received report of a group dressed like ‘a little army’\n\nThere was a large police presence at the Pride event after authorities received information “there were a number of groups” planing to disrupt Saturday’s activities, White said.\n\nPolice did not have information that Patriot Front members were coming, White said Monday.\n\n“We had some information that there might be some, some individuals who are loosely affiliated with the some of the groups who were planning to protest the Pride event that day, and so we were adequately staffed for it, but we didn’t have any intelligence that there was going to be a riotous group coming to this event prior to the 911 call that we received,” he said.\n\nA concerned citizen called police Saturday afternoon to report “approximately 20 people jumped into a U-Haul” in a local hotel parking lot, the chief said.\n\nPolice arrested 31 men near a Pride event in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, on Saturday. John Rudoff/Reuters\n\nThe group was equipped with shields and masks and “looked like a little army,” the caller said, according to White.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after the call, officers stopped the U-Haul and detained 31 people, White said. They were charged with misdemeanor conspiracy to riot, he said.\n\nThe group was dressed similarly, wearing khaki pants, blue shirts and hats with plastic inside them, the chief said. They were also equipped with “shields, shin guards and other riot gear,” along with papers White described as “similar to an operations plan that a police or military group would put together for an event.”\n\n“It is clear to us, based on the gear that the individuals had with them, the stuff they had in their possession in the U-Haul with them, along with paperwork that was seized from them, that they came to riot downtown,” White said.\n\n“I think some of us were a bit surprised by not only the level of preparation that we saw, but the equipment that was carried and worn by those individuals, along with the large amount of equipment that was left in the van when the stop happened,” White said at a news conference Monday.\n\n“That level of preparation is not something you see every day,” the chief said.\n\nCity, state and Kootenai County police responded with two SWAT teams, White said.\n\n“I don’t think this would have been as successful had we not had one extremely astute citizen who saw something that was very concerning to them and reported it to us,” he said.\n\nOfficials aren’t releasing the identity of the caller to protect that person, White said.\n\n“Since myself and other members of our agency have been receiving threats, including death threats, I think it is appropriate that we withhold that person’s information at this time,” the chief said.\n\nThe men were released after posting bond, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said. They’re due back in court at a later date.\n\nThe individuals came from a dozen states, according to a booking summary from the sheriff’s office. Seven are from Texas, six from Utah, five from Washington and three from Colorado. One was from as far away as Alabama. The youngest is 20 years old, and the oldest is 40, according to the summary.\n\nLaw enforcement arrested 31 men believed to be affiliated with a White nationalist group. From North Country Off Grid\n\nCoeur d’Alene police are leading an investigation with the FBI’s assistance, FBI spokesperson Sandra Yi Barker.\n\nPolice arrested at least two other people in connection with the Pride event, authorities said. They were charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing, police said.\n\nMen affiliated with White nationalist group, police say\n\nIn addition to the clothing associated with Patriot Front, most of the men had logos on their hats “consistent with the Patriot Front group,” and some were wearing arm patches associated with the organization, White said.\n\nThe Patriot Front believes their White ancestors conquered America and “bequeathed it to them,” according to the Anti-Defamation League. Members espouse fascist and anti-Semitic beliefs, which they spread through propaganda campaigns, the ADL says.\n\nThe Texas-based group was formed following the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when members of the White supremacist group, Vanguard America, split off to form their own organization, the ADL says.\n\nThomas Ryan Rousseau Kootenai County Sheriff\n\nAmong those arrested Saturday was Patriot Front leader Thomas Ryan Rousseau, Kootenai County sheriff’s Sgt. Shane Moline said.\n\nRousseau led several dozen members of Vanguard America Texas during the Unite the Right rally and later led a contingent of VA members to create Patriot Front.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Patriot Front and people believed to be associated with Rousseau but did not immediately hear back.\n\nCoeur d’Alene residents and businesses have long made it clear the city is “too great to hate,” going back to the early aughts, when the Southern Poverty Law Center helped the city shut down an Aryan Nations group with a compound north of the city, Hammond told CNN.\n\n“We are not going to back to the days of the Aryan Nations,” Hammond said at the news conference Monday.\n\n“We are past that and we will do everything we can to make sure that we continue to stay past those kinds of problems,” the mayor said. “We are a culture of love and kindness, and we will continue to be.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that CNN had reached out to Thomas Ryan Rousseau's legal representative.

{"question_id": "20220617_5", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/business/gas-prices-five-dollars-national-june/index.html", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFor the first time ever, a gallon of regular gas now costs $5 on average nationwide, according to AAA’s Saturday reading.\n\nThe record is hardly a surprise. Gas prices have been rising steadily for the last eight weeks, and this latest milestone marks the 15th straight day that the AAA reading has hit a record price, and the 32nd time in the last 33 days.\n\nThe national average stood at $4.07 when the current run of price increases began April 15. The current price reading from OPIS represents 23% increase in less than two months.\n\nAnd the rising gasoline prices is doing more than just causing pain at the pump for drivers. They are a major factor in the prices paid by consumers for a full range of goods and services rising at the fastest pace in 40 years, according to the government’s inflation report Friday.\n\nInflation caused consumer confidence to hit a record low on Friday, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. Worries about what the Federal Reserve will do to battle inflation has sent US stocks plunging in recent months, wiping out billions in household wealth.\n\nWhile a $5 national average is new, $5 gas has become unpleasantly common in much of the country.\n\nData from OPIS, which collects the readings from 130,000 US gas stations used to compile the AAA averages, showed that 32% of stations nationwide, nearly one of every three, were already were charging more than $5 a gallon in readings Friday. And about 10% of stations across the nation are charging more than $5.75 a gallon.\n\nThe statewide average was $5 a gallon or more in 21 states plus Washington DC in Saturday’s reading.\n\n$6 gas could be next\n\nAnd gas prices are unlikely to stop there. With the summer travel season getting underway, demand for gasoline, coupled with Russian oil shipments cut off due to the war in Ukraine, oil prices are soaring on global markets.\n\nThe US national average for gasoline could be close to $6 later this summer, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said earlier this week about the demand for gas as people hit the road for long-anticipated getaways. “Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations.”\n\nThe highest statewide average has long been in California, where the average stood at $6.43 a gallon in Saturday’s readings. But the pain of higher prices is being felt across the country, not just in California or other high-priced states.\n\nCheap gas hard to find\n\nThat’s partly because the cheapest price wasn’t all that cheap — the $4.47 a gallon average price in Georgia gives it the cheapest statewide average. Less than 300 gas stations out of 130,000 nationwide were charging $4.25 a gallon or less in Friday’s reading from OPIS. For purposes of comparison, before the run-up in prices earlier this year, the record national average for gas had been $4.11, set in July 2008.\n\nAnd even in some states with cheaper gas prices, such as Mississippi, lower average wages mean that drivers there have to work more hours to earn the money needed to fill their tank than drivers in some of the higher priced gas states, such as Washington.\n\nThere are some early signs that people are starting to cut back on their driving in the face of the higher prices, but it’s still a modest decline.\n\nThe number of gallons pumped at stations in the last week of May was down about 5% from the same week a year ago, according to OPIS, even though gas prices have risen more than 50% since then. The number of US trips by car has slipped about 5% since early May, according to mobility research firm Inrix, although those trips are still up about 5% since the start of the year.\n\nThe chief concern is that consumers will cut back on other spending to keep driving which could push an economy already showing signs of weakness into recession.\n\nNumerous reasons for record prices\n\nBeyond the strong demand for gasoline, there is also a supply problem that’s driving up the price of both oil and gasoline. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the sanctions on Russia imposed in the United States and Europe since then is a major factor, since Russia was among the world’s leading oil exporters. But it is only part of the cause.\n\nOil is a commodity traded on global markets. The United States has never imported significant amounts of oil from Russia, but Europe has traditionally been dependent on Russian exports. The EU’s recent decision to ban oil tanker shipments from Russia sent oil prices soaring globally.\n\nThe price of a barrel of crude closed above $120 a barrel Friday, up from just less than $100 a month ago. Goldman Sachs recently predicted the average price for a barrel of Brent crude, the benchmark used for oil traded in Europe, will be $140 a barrel between July and September, up from its prior call of $125 a barrel.\n\nOther factors beyond Russia’s withdrawal from the global market are limiting supply. OPEC and its allies have sharply cut back oil production as demand for oil crashed in the early months of the pandemic, as much of the world’s businesses shut down and people stayed close to home. Global oil futures briefly traded in negative territory due to lack of space to store the glut of oil. Some oil producing nations slashed production in an effort to support prices, and some of that production is back online but not all of it.\n\nUS oil production and refining capacity also have not fully recovered to the pre-pandemic levels. And because prices are even higher in Europe, some US and Canadian refineries that would normally supply the US market with gas are exporting gasoline to Europe.\n\nMany oil companies have been slow to increase production, despite the high price that the oil could fetch, instead using those soaring profits to buy back their own stock in an effort to raise their share price. ExxonMobi has announced it intends to repurchase $30 billion of its stock, more than its total capital spending budget for the year.\n\n– CNN’s Matt Egan and Michelle Watson contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/11"}, {"url": "https://gasprices.aaa.com/"}, {"url": "https://gasprices.aaa.com/"}, {"url": "https://gasprices.aaa.com/"}]}

Greg Gianforte declared a statewide disaster Tuesday and announced he would seek an expedited presidential disaster declaration to help cover the cost of recovery.\n\nThe dangerous flooding is just one of several extreme weather events bearing down on communities across the US, including a blistering heat wave affecting more than 100 million people, and severe storms knocking out power for hundreds of thousands in the Midwest and Ohio River Valley.\n\nDramatic flooding prompts evacuations and rescues\n\nRain and snowmelt flooded rivers including the Yellowstone River, which runs northwest through Yellowstone Park in Wyoming and then north and eastward through several nearby Montana communities.\n\nThe flooding washed out parts of roads especially in the northern part of the park, and inundated south Montana homes, businesses and infrastructure Monday, forcing many families to evacuate. In the Montana city of Gardiner, a gateway to the park’s northern entrance, video from witnesses showed a building collapsing into the Yellowstone River on Monday.\n\nIn Montana’s Park County, which includes Gardiner, at least two homes collapsed into the intruding river and numerous homes and businesses were flooded, Greg Coleman, the county’s disaster emergency services manager, told CNN Wednesday.\n\nFor some, roads and bridges were rendered temporarily impassable by the flooding, leaving them trapped, at times without clean water or power.\n\nThe Montana National Guard used four helicopters to help with evacuations in affected areas on Monday and Tuesday and also sent soldiers to the city of Red Lodge to establish a command center for search and rescue efforts, the force said. The Guard has used helicopters to rescue 87 people in south-central Montana since Monday, it said Wednesday.\n\nA Montana helicopter company flew about 40 people out of Gardiner, which was temporarily isolated by flooding, Laura Jones with Rocky Mountain Rotors told CNN.\n\nA house that was pulled into a flooded creek in Red Lodge, Montana, is pictured Tuesday. Matthew Brown/AP\n\nIn the south Montana community of Absarokee, situated along a Yellowstone River tributary, resident Tracy Planichek and her husband had just reached their long-awaited goal of having a new home when the flood threat forced them to evacuate.\n\nNow, she told CNN, she is desperately hoping it has avoided the destruction seen in other homes, some of which were swept away. “(We’ve) never been able to afford a new house,” she said. “It’s sitting at the top of the lane, and we’re hoping that by some God miracle that our house will be there.”\n\nA road from Livingston into Gardiner was reopened Tuesday to local traffic, goods and services, but “significant damage” remains, Park County Sheriff Brad Bichler said.\n\nA road near Yellowstone National Park's northern entrance was significantly damaged by flooding.

Courtesy Zachary Beard\n\nKari Huesing, who works at the Yellowstone Gateway Inn, told CNN the area has been a ghost town this week. One hotel, she said, shut down and sent all of their employees home. Her hotel will have a meeting to decide what they can do going forward.\n\n“This is all based on tourism,” Huesing said. The Yellowstone Gateway Inn had been booked for a year, Huesing said, and now there is all but one person at the hotel who actually recently checked out.\n\nFlood wave moves to Billings and further east\n\nA wave of flooding still was moving east Wednesday along the Yellowstone River, threatening more trouble in south Montana.\n\nBy early Wednesday, major flooding from the river was being reported in Billings, roughly a 175-mile drive east of Gardiner. The river in Billings rose above its previous record, 15 feet, around 4 p.m. Tuesday, said the National Weather Service.\n\n“Exactly how high the river is, is a bit unsure with floodwaters impacting the gauge a bit at these higher levels, but have not seen a downturn trend yet,” the service’s office in Billings tweeted early Wednesday.\n\nFields and streets were flooded along the river Tuesday just outside Billings, images posted to Facebook by the Yellowstone County Sheriff’s Office showed. One picture showed two people walking in calf-deep water in a neighborhood.\n\nBillings public works officials said they decided Tuesday night to shut down water plant facilities after flooding in the Yellowstone River caused river levels to exceed 16 feet, according to a Facebook post from the department.\n\n“As of Wednesday at 8:30 a.m., the water level at the plant reached more than 16 feet. For the plant to operate effectively, the river needs to be at 15 feet or below,” officials said in the post.\n\nPublic works director Debi Meling said Wednesday no one had planned for this level of flooding the facilities were designed and recognized the diligence of the facilities’ operational teams.\n\nShe added the plant would not return to “normal operations” until river water levels decrease.\n\nMeling said all reservoirs are filled, and the plant would have water for the community for about a day to a day and a half. Superintendent of Parks Mike Pigg said firetrucks were filled with water and water for all city parks was turned off.\n\nThe river should crest there Wednesday – though attention will turn to high temperatures that could cause more snowmelt and more flooding in the region this weekend.\n\nBillings will approach record temperatures in the upper 90s Friday and Saturday, while the higher elevations will be in the 60s and 70s. This would be warm enough to melt the remaining snow pack and lead to additional river rises over the weekend. And more rain is possible in the area on Sunday.\n\nA lot of rain and snowmelt in only three days\n\nWhat led to the flooding was substantial rainfall and snow runoff over the weekend in the Beartooth and Absaroka mountain ranges, which span the Montana-Wyoming state line.\n\nThe combination of rain and snowmelt created a “total water event of at least 4 to 9 inches,” the National Weather Service in Billings said Tuesday.\n\nThat amount of runoff is similar to the region receiving two to three times a normal June’s precipitation in only three days, according to CNN meteorologists.\n\nIn the park, officials had all visitors move out of lodging and campgrounds and leave the park to prevent anyone from being stranded, the National Park Service said in a news release. The park averages between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors in June, Sholly said.\n\nThe park has also closed the Yellowstone back country and has been in contact with groups in the area.\n\nA washed out bridge at Yellowstone National Park's Rescue Creek. National Park Service/AP\n\n“We have contacted or know the whereabouts of every back country user currently in Yellowstone,” Sholly said, noting one group remained in the northern range. No helicopter evacuations have been necessary, he said.\n\nNo known injuries or deaths occurred in the park because of the flooding, Sholly said, and officials do not believe the animals in the park have been significantly affected.\n\nThe park’s southern loop “appears to be less impacted than the northern roads” and teams will try to determine when the loop can be reopened. But officials expect it to stay closed at least through Sunday, the park’s release states.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Amir Vera Elizabeth Wolfe David Williams Paradise Afshar", "Jason Hanna", "Amir Vera", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "David Williams", "Paradise Afshar"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}]}

The White House has said shots could begin as early as next week.\n\nChildren younger than 5 are the only age group not currently eligible to be vaccinated against Covid-19. About 17 million kids will become eligible for Covid-19 vaccines once they’re authorized for this age group.\n\n“To be able to vote for authorization of two vaccines that will protect children down to 6 months of age against this deadly disease is a very important thing,” said committee member Dr. Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University.\n\nShe compared the day to December 2020, when the first Covid-19 vaccines were authorized for adults and older teens.\n\n‘Benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks’\n\n“The benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks, particularly for those with young children who may be in kindergarten or in collective child care,” committee member Oveta Fuller, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said of the Moderna vaccine.\n\nCommittee member Dr. Art Reingold added that even though the risk of Covid-19 hospitalization and death is lower for young children than for adults, children already get vaccinations to protect them against diseases for which their risk is low.\n\n“If we have a vaccine with benefits that outweigh the risks, then making it available to people is a reasonable choice,” said Reingold, of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n“I would point out that we as a country continue to give a large number of vaccines to children where the risk of the child dying or being hospitalized of those diseases are pretty close to zero,” he said, such as polio and measles.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in children is concerning and much higher when compared with influenza-related deaths and hospitalizations, FDA official Dr. Peter Marks said at Wednesday’s meeting.\n\n“There still was, during the Omicron wave, a relatively high rate of hospitalization during this period,” said Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “That rate of hospitalization actually is quite troubling, and if we compare this to what we see in a terrible influenza season, it is worse.”\n\nMarks said the number of deaths for children 4 and under during the first two years of the pandemic “also compares quite terribly to what we’ve seen with influenza in the past.”\n\n“We are dealing with an issue where I think we have to be careful that we don’t become numb to the number of pediatric deaths because of the overwhelming number of older deaths here. Every life is important,” he said, adding that “vaccine-preventable deaths are ones we would like to try to do something about.”\n\nMarks said the Covid-19 vaccines are an intervention similar to the influenza vaccine, which has been broadly and routinely used and accepted to prevent deaths.\n\nModerna vaccine ‘well-tolerated’ in youngest children\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is already authorized for adults. In a meeting Tuesday, the FDA’s advisers voted unanimously in favor of expanding the emergency use authorization to include older children and teens, ages 6 to 17, saying it would also offer more benefits than risks.\n\nModerna’s Covid-19 vaccine, when given as a 25-microgram dose, is “well-tolerated” in children ages 6 months to 5, said Dr. Rituparna Das, Moderna’s vice president of Covid-19 vaccines clinical development, during Wednesday’s meeting as she described the safety profile of the vaccine among this age group and adverse reactions.\n\n“Pain was the most common event,” Das said. “Young children’s events included fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting and chills. For infants and toddlers, events included fever, irritability, crying, sleepiness and loss of appetite.”\n\nThese reactions were more common after the second dose of vaccine and resolved within two or three days, Das said, adding that fever was an important assessment of the vaccine’s safety for this age group.\n\nFever after any dose of vaccine happened in about a quarter of the children, but more often after the second dose, and one incident of febrile seizure was considered to be related to vaccination, Das told the committee members. The child who had the seizure remained in the vaccine study and got a second dose of vaccine with no serious events.\n\nNo deaths or cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported among vaccine recipients, Das said.\n\n“In summary, mRNA-1273 was well tolerated,” she said, using the technical name of Moderna’s vaccine. “Local and systemic reactions were seen less frequently in these youngest groups.”\n\nConcern over number of doses\n\nVRBPAC member Dr. Paul Offit said in Wednesday’s meeting that children who get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will have to complete a three-dose series to get sufficient protection.\n\n” ‘Do the benefits outweigh the risks’ is something I can support, but I do have some concerns about this vaccine,” said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania.\n\nCommittee member Dr. Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences also mentioned concern that some children might not complete all three doses and that uptake of the vaccine will be slow.\n\n“Three doses will certainly benefit. I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get a third dose,” she said. “My concern is that you have to get the three doses to really get what you need.”\n\nData from a phase 2/3 trial of the Pfizer vaccine included 1,678 children who had received a third dose during the period when the Omicron coronavirus variant dominated. The vaccine appeared to be safe and had a strong immune response. The data has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal.\n\nAntibody levels tested one month after the third dose showed that the vaccine produced a similar immune response as two doses in 16- to 25-year-olds, the companies said.\n\nIn FDA briefing documents, it was noted that among young children who had received the vaccine in trials, there were no cases of anaphylaxis, myocarditis or pericarditis, and the most common adverse reactions among children 6 months to 23 months were irritability, drowsiness, decreased appetite and tenderness at the injection site. For children 2 to 4 years old, the most common adverse reactions were fatigue and pain and redness at the injection site.\n\nWill these children get vaccinated?\n\nThere is already slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines among children in the United States.\n\n“Having vaccine options for the youngest children is very important; however, we have seen a relatively low uptake of Covid vaccines in children in the 5- to 12-year-old group, and so my concern is that uptake in the youngest children under 5 years old might also be lower than we would like,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBarouch, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee, helped develop and study the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nHe said there were “striking” differences in how many adults are fully vaccinated compared with children and teens.\n\nChildren 5 to 11 were the most recent group to become eligible for vaccination, in November. But just 29% of these children are fully vaccinated with their two-dose primary series in the United States, according to the CDC, compared with about:", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}]}
