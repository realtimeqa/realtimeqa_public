We don't have anything. We have God, and the hope help will come.\"\n\nNow packing sustained winds of 130 mph, the center of Fiona is due to pass just west of Bermuda early Friday, with conditions starting to deteriorate Thursday, said CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford. The island nation is under a hurricane warning; Americans are warned not to travel there, and relatives of US government personnel may leave, the State Department said.\n\n\"The National Hurricane Center is certain that Bermuda will experience tropical-storm-force winds,\" Shackelford said. \"Once Fiona passes by Bermuda, the storm is forecast to impact Nova Scotia by Saturday afternoon.\"\n\nIn the Canadian province, residents should prepare for tropical storm-like or even hurricane-like conditions starting as early as Friday evening by securing outdoor items, trimming trees, charging cell phones and creating an emergency kit, said Jason Mew, director of the emergency management office. Shelters will be open for those experiencing homelessness and anyone else in need, he said.\n\nThe Canadian Hurricane Centre has issued a hurricane watch for Nova Scotia from Hubbards to Brule, Prince Edward Island, Isle-de-la-Madeleine, and the coast of Newfoundland from Parson's Pond to Port aux Basques.\n\nHurricane Fiona \"could be Canada's version of Sandy,\" Canadian forecasters warned, comparing the size and intensity as well as the combination of a hurricane and a more winter-like storm such as a nor'easter.\n\nA tropical storm watch has also been issued for several coastlines in Atlantic Canada, including from west of Brule to Cap Madeleine, Quebec, and Anticosti Island.\n\nResidents in Atlantic Canada need to be prepared for a long period of utility outages and structural damage to buildings, according to Environment Canada, Canada's national weather service.\n\n\"Fiona will be historic for Atlantic Canada,\" said Brian Tang, atmospheric science professor at the University of Albany.\n\nMeanwhile, a developing storm poised to be named Hermine could become a monstrous threat to the US Gulf Coast by next week, forecast models showed.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, where Fiona delivered flooding rains and an islandwide blackout as it made landfall Sunday, more than 450,000 people lacked or had intermittent water service, according to the government's emergency portal system\n\nAs of Thursday, 495,000 customers, about 38%, have electricity in Puerto Rico, according to LUMA Energy, which operates the island's power grid.\n\nAbout 890,000 customers, or 67% of all users, now have running water, according to Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority Executive President Doriel Pagán Crespo.\n\nA man collects spring water Wednesday at a mountain next to a highway in the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona in Cayey, Puerto Rico\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, where Fiona moved onto land early Monday, 725,246 customers remain without running water and more than 210,000 homes and businesses were dark Wednesday, said Maj. Gen. Juan Méndez García, director of the country's emergency operations center.\n\nMore than 2,260 homes were destroyed, and some communities were cut off from aid, he said.\n\nElectricity problems dog Puerto Rico\n\nAs Fiona hit the Dominican Republic in the middle of the night, Iverice Viera rushed in waist-deep floodwater to wake up her neighbors in Higüey, she said.\n\nShe's now trying to dry out her belongings.\n\n\"The rooms are empty. I had to throw away a lot. There's no electricity or water to wash anything,\" Viera told CNN en Español.\n\nPuerto Rico, in the meantime, was making some progress on the relief front.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration Wednesday for the US territory, FEMA said. The move allows residents to access grants for temporary housing and home repairs as well as low-interest loans to cover uninsured property losses.\n\n\"This ensures that our people will have access to additional help from FEMA to recover from the damage caused by this event,\" Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said in a tweet\n\nBut crews have faced setbacks in restoring power. Equipment problems have temporarily knocked lines believed to have been repaired back offline, Josué Colón, executive director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, said Wednesday.\n\nFiona hit almost exactly five years after Hurricane Maria plunged the island into an extended blackout.\n\nAcross the island, more than 800 people were housed in dozens of shelters Wednesday, according to Puerto Rico's housing secretary, William Rodriguez.\n\nNew York City's mayor has deployed staff from city agencies to Puerto Rico to help officials surveying damage.\n\n\"The team will include representatives from New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM), New York City Department of Buildings, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and the New York City Department of Design and Construction,\" according to a news release from the mayor's office.\n\nCars drive Wednesday under a downed power pole in Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced Thursday his authorization of aid and recovery efforts for Puerto Rico, including the deployment of 74 New Jersey State Troopers and a civilian medical doctor.\n\nFiona also menaced parts of the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday, and many areas of the British territory were still without power Wednesday, namely on Grand Turk, South Caicos, Salt Cay, North Caicos and Middle Caicos, said Anya Williams, acting governor of the islands.\n\nOfficials there were relieved no one was killed in the storm, they said as they began visiting islands and making repairs.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi", "Alaa Elassar"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/weather/hurricane-fiona-puerto-rico-dominican-republic-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Turks and Caicos under shelter-in-place order as Hurricane Fiona ...", "text": "(CNN) Hurricane Fiona battered the Turks and Caicos islands most of Tuesday with hurricane-force winds, torrential rain and several feet of storm surge, prompting officials to urge residents to stay indoors.\n\nIn its devastating path of destruction, the storm has killed at least five people across the Caribbean, cut power and water service for most of Puerto Rico's 3.1 million residents and left more than 1 million without running water in the Dominican Republic.\n\nOfficials in the Turks and Caicos said late Tuesday evening that a shelter-in-place advisory remained in effect amid heavy winds and rain.\n\n\"We hope to have an all-clear some time later this evening but as it stands right now, we're still asking residents to remain indoors,\" Anya Williams, deputy governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a virtual briefing. There have so far been no reported deaths or serious injuries across the islands, Williams added.\n\nFiona, a Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 125 mph, was continuing to hammer parts of the islands around 8 p.m. ET Tuesday and was strengthening, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm was centered about 75 miles north of North Caicos Island on Tuesday night, the hurricane center said.\n\nForecasters have warned of possible \"life-threatening flooding\" as the storm's heavy rains continue pouring over parts of the British territory of about 38,000 people, the center said.\n\nThe islands of Grand Turk, South Caicos, Salt Cay, North Caicos and Middle Caicos were experiencing island-wide power outages Tuesday night, Williams said, adding restoration efforts will begin as soon as it's safe.\n\nThe storm will slowly move away from the islands Tuesday night and Wednesday and begin approaching Bermuda Thursday, where it's expected to dump up to 3 inches of rain and create \"life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the center said. A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued by the Bermuda Weather Service.\n\nSwells from the storm will also spread westward over the next day or two across the southwestern Atlantic, toward the northwestern Bahamas and the US east coast, the hurricane center said.\n\nDominican Republic, Puerto Rico dealing with deadly aftermath\n\nStill dealing with Fiona's ruinous path are the Dominican Republic -- where the storm's outer bands could cause flooding after it traversed the Caribbean nation Monday -- and Puerto Rico, which Fiona crossed a day earlier, causing a near blackout and leaving damage not seen there since Hurricane Maria made landfall five years ago Tuesday, officials said.\n\nPhotos: Hurricane Fiona slams the Caribbean Nicasio Gil walks through the stagnant water left by the swollen Duey River while grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona in Higuey, Dominican Republic, on Tuesday, September 20.

Aurielys Esther Jimenez, 18, was traveling by motorcycle when she was struck by a power pole that fell due to strong winds, the director said. She was taken to a hospital where she was later pronounced dead.\n\nOfficials there on Monday also confirmed the death of a man in Nagua, in northeastern Dominican Republic, who died after powerful winds knocked down a tree that hit him. There was also one death reported in the French territory of Guadeloupe, which Fiona hit late last week, and two in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, 58-year-old Gilberto Ayala Aponte was swept away by a swollen river behind his home in Comerío. A second man, 70-year-old José Cruz Román, died in a fire accident that occurred when he was trying to put gasoline in his generator while it was turned on, officials said.\n\nParts of Puerto Rico will have seen rain totals of more than 30 inches , as Fiona pushed rivers to overflow and high water to collect in parts of the territory, flooding homes, streets and fields. Rushing waters wiped away a bridge, carrying its structure downstream, one video shows. Mudslides blocked some roads leading from coastal areas to the interior, a CNN crew saw.\n\nThe damage is catastrophic in the territory's center, south and southeast regions, Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1.16 million of the island's roughly 1.47 million utility customers still were without power as of Tuesday night, according to estimates from PowerOutage.us , which notes updated information on restoration efforts is limited.\n\nMore than 2,000 people were working to restore power, Mario Hurtado, the chief regulatory officer for utility company LUMA Energy, told CNN's Jake Tapper Tuesday. LUMA operates Puerto Rico's power grid.\n\nOn the same day, New York's attorney general called on federal authorities to investigate the energy provider, saying residents continued to experience frequent outages and high electrical rates five years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria and \"after billions of federal dollars were spent to modernize and strengthen the island's electrical grid.\"\n\nFiona forecast to continue strengthening\n\nFiona intensified into a Category 3 storm as it moved away from the Dominican Republic's northern coast early Tuesday.\n\nThis is the first major hurricane -- Category 3 or higher -- of this year's Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe Turks and Caicos islands could see a total of 5 to 10 inches of rain from Fiona as well as storm surges -- ocean water pushed onto land -- of up to 3 feet above normal tide levels, the hurricane center said Tuesday night.\n\nHurricane conditions continued in Turks and Caicos Tuesday night and tropical storm conditions -- winds of at least 39 mph -- were expected over parts of the southeastern Bahamas for the next several hours, the hurricane center said.\n\nContinued strengthening is expected as Fiona turns from the Turks and Caicos. It could be a Category 4 storm -- with sustained winds of 130 to 156 mph -- by late Wednesday over the Atlantic. It could still be at Category 4 when it passes Bermuda, forecasters say\n\nOver the weekend, Fiona might make landfall in eastern Canada as a hurricane. It is too early to know exactly where or how strong it might be.\n\nFiona leaves behind devastated Puerto Rico\n\nTuesday marks five years since Hurricane Maria's catastrophic landfall in Puerto Rico and some who lived through the 2017 crisis say Fiona's flooding destruction could be even more severe.\n\nJuan Miguel Gonzalez, a business owner in Puerto Rico, told CNN that his neighborhood had still not finished its recovery from Maria when Fiona struck. But this time, he says, the flooding brought even more damage to their homes.\n\n\"A lot of people -- more than (during) Maria -- lost their houses now ... lost everything in their houses because of the flooding,\" Gonzalez told CNN on Monday. \"Maria was tough winds. But this one, with all the rain, it just destroyed everything in the house.\"\n\nJetsabel Osorio stands in her house damaged five years ago by Hurricane Maria before the arrival of Fiona in Loiza, Puerto Rico.\n\nWater service also was interrupted for most, because river flooding affected filtration processes and must recede before safe treatment can resume, officials said. On Tuesday morning, about 60% of customers on the island had no running water, the territory's aqueduct and sewer authority said.\n\nMore than 1,200 people were staying in about 70 shelters on the island Tuesday, Pierluisi said.\n\nNational Guard troops direct traffic as resident Luis Noguera helps clear a road affected by Hurricane Fiona in Cayey, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to the hundreds of Puerto Rican National Guard members aiding in rescue and recovery efforts, the White House said Monday that President Joe Biden told Pierluisi during a phone call that federal support will increase in the coming days.\n\nFEMA administrator Deanne Criswell traveled to the island Tuesday to assess damages and the agency announced it was deploying several teams to bolster response efforts on the ground.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul also announced the state would send 100 state troopers to assist relief efforts in Puerto Rico. She also said teams from New York Power Authority are available to help with power restoration.\n\nMore than 1 million customers without water service in Dominican Republic\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, where up to 20 inches of rain fell in places, emergency workers brought nearly 800 people to safety, Méndez García said Monday. At least 519 people were taking refuge in the country's 29 shelters Monday, he said.\n\nMore than 2,100 households were affected by the storm and more than 600 homes destroyed, Méndez García said in a Tuesday update. And at least 23 roads and 18 bridges sustained damage, leaving 12 communities cut off.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, more than 1.85 million customers were without running water as a result of the storm's damage, he said, adding that 68 aqueducts were out of service across the Dominican Republic, with a handful of others only partially working.\n\nSome in the Dominican Republic were also without electricity Monday as 10 electric circuits went offline, emergency management officials said. It's unclear how many people are impacted by the outages.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with the correct age of the second victim in Puerto Rico, after updated information from officials.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe", "Christina Maxouris", "Jason Hanna", "Melissa Alonso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/20/hurricane-fiona-updates-puerto-rico-dominican-republic/10432582002/", "title": "'Big part' of Puerto Rico will have power soon, Gov. Pierluisi says", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news of Tuesday, Sept. 20. For the latest coverage on Hurricane Fiona, follow our updates from Wednesday, Sept. 21 here.\n\nHurricane Fiona grew more powerful Tuesday as it rolled past Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic after pounding the islands with up to 30 inches of rain, triggering overwhelming flooding, mudslides, and destruction.\n\nThe storm reached the Turks and Caicos Islands as a Category 3 hurricane, blasting the British territory of about 40,000 people with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. The government imposed a curfew and urged people to flee flood-prone areas as the archipelago braced for a storm surge of 5 to 8 feet.\n\nEarly Wednesday, the storm threatened to strengthen into a Category 4 storm as it lashed the Turks and Caicos Islands and was forecast to squeeze past Bermuda later this week.\n\nAbout 80% of Puerto Rico remained without power early Tuesday, more than 24 hours after the storm shut down the island's entire electrical system, though officials said they were making progress restoring parts of it. Water service was cut to more than 837,000 customers – two-thirds of the total on the island, officials said.\n\nGov. Pedro Pierluisi and power distribution company LUMA Energy both said a \"big part'' of the island would have electricity back by Wednesday, the newspaper El Nuevo Día reported. Pierluisi allowed for the possibility it might take until the weekend.\n\nRECOVERY BEGINS:The power is out. Homes are flooded. Fiona leaves a 'nightmare'\n\nThe governor also requested a major disaster declaration, which if granted would free up federal funds for public and individual assistance. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would urge the federal government to cover 100% of disaster response costs as part of that declaration, instead of the usual 75%.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, more than 1 million people were without running water and 700,000 homes and businesses were without power, the national Emergency Operations Center said.\n\nAt least three deaths were reported, two in Puerto Rico and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n►More rain was forecast through the week in parts of Puerto Rico, and conditions were not expected to significantly improve. \"Catastrophic and life-threatening flash, urban, and moderate to major river flooding, as well as mudslides, are likely for southern and eastern Puerto Rico through Tuesday due the rainfall from Hurricane Fiona,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\n►Thousands have been displaced as Puerto Rican authorities said at least 2,300 people and 250 pets were in shelters across the island.\n\n►In Grand Turk, hurricane conditions were slamming the capital of the small British territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands. The government imposed a curfew and urged people to flee flood-prone areas.\n\n►For the U.S. mainland, forecasters say the hurricane is not expected to threaten the United States.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nHurricane Fiona threatens to strengthen into a Category 4\n\nLate Tuesday night, Fiona was centered about 95 miles north of North Caicos Island, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 30 miles from the center. It had maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and was moving north at 8 mph, according to the Hurricane Center, which said the storm was likely to strengthen into a Category 4 hurricane as it approaches Bermuda on Friday.\n\nFEMA tries to rectify mistakes from Maria\n\nThe head of FEMA said Tuesday the agency will be sending “hundreds of additional staff’’ to Puerto Rico in the coming days, besides the 1,000-plus already in the island responding to Hurricane Fiona – about 700 of whom had been aiding recovery efforts from Hurricane Maria, which struck with devastating force exactly five years ago.\n\nDeanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is among those who have recently traveled to the U.S. territory, arriving Tuesday to assess the damage and figure out what other resources might be needed.\n\n5 YEARS AFTER MARIA:Puerto Ricans are still struggling. Then came Fiona.\n\nCriswell said in a statement that FEMA intends to “place staff in each of the impacted communities to supplement our already vast footprint.’’\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to 2017, when FEMA’s response to Maria’s impact on Puerto Rico was widely criticized, leading the agency to acknowledge mistakes in organization, preparedness and staffing in an internal report the next year.\n\nThe agency said it has increased the number of its warehouses in Puerto Rico from one to four and boosted supplies of meals and water tenfold.\n\n“FEMA’s very well positioned for this response,’’ said Keith Turi, assistant administrator for recovery. “We’ve made a lot of progress in planning and preparedness with our partners in Puerto Rico and the municipalities in the last five years.’’\n\nEarly toll in Dominican Republic: 1 dead, 12,000 displaced\n\nMore than 1,000 residents of the Dominican Republic were living in shelters Tuesday after Fiona tore through the country. More than 1 million of the nation's almost 12 million people were without running water, and more than 700,000 homes and businesses were without power, the national Emergency Operations Center said.\n\nOne death was reported, 12,485 people were displaced, 3,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and four bridges collapsed.\n\nJuan Manuel Mendez, director of the organization, told Dominican Today that Isidro Odalis Smith, 68, was crushed by a falling tree in the northern town of Nagua in Maria Trinidad Sanchez province.\n\nPresident Luis Abinader pledged to restore drinking water and electrical service to communities \"as soon as possible.\" He said authorities would need several days to assess the damage.\n\nOfficials closed ports and beaches and told most people to stay home from work. The hurricane left several highways blocked, and a tourist pier in the town of Miches was severely damaged by high waves. At least four international airports were closed, officials said.\n\nHow you can help\n\nAdvocates stresses the importance of supporting local organizations and grassroots mutual aid groups providing on-the-ground relief to communities in Puerto Rico. Multiple organizations are providing crucial aid such as solar lights, generators, supplies and food.\n\nTo help Puerto Ricans and others in the Caribbean recover, here's a list of some nonprofits and mutual aid funds you can support.\n\nMore rain for overwhelmed Puerto Rico\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of another 1 to 4 inches of rain for much of Puerto Rico into Wednesday morning. Storm totals have reached 12 to 20 inches in most areas, but some locations have seen up to 35 inches.\n\n\"Localized additional flash and urban flooding is possible in southern portions of Puerto Rico,\" the weather service said.\n\nNational Guard Brig. Gen. Narciso Cruz put the flooding in perspective by comparing it to the massive amount of water Category 4 Hurricane Maria brought five years ago Tuesday.\n\n“There were communities that flooded in the storm that didn’t flood under Maria,” Cruz said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”\n\nFiona made landfall as a Category 1 storm Sunday afternoon on the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico, then made landfall again early Monday on the Dominican Republic's east coast.\n\n2,500 affected in coastal Salinas\n\nIn hard-hit Salinas, a municipality of about 30,000 people on the southern coast of Puerto Rico, Mayor Karilyn Bonilla estimated 2,500 people had their homes swamped. The National Guard led a team of responders in more than 500 water rescues, and Bonilla expressed gratitude for lifesaving efforts \"that put their own at risk.\"\n\n“We had to do a titanic operation to rescue people who were in areas completely flooded,\" Bonilla said. \"Refugees tell us that they have been living in some communities for 60 years and an event of this magnitude had never happened.\"\n\nMinerva Monge, 70, was rescued with her husband by the National Guard after water in their home reached their knees.\n\n\"What I hope is that everything calms down, the place dries up and we can return,\" she said.\n\nBiden promises more federal aid\n\nAccuWeather estimated the economic impact on the island from Fiona at about $10 billion. President Joe Biden, who has declared a state of emergency to release federal aid, said he spoke with Gov. Pedro Pierluisi late Monday. Biden promised to increase support \"substantially\" in the coming days.\n\n\"Jill and I are keeping the people of Puerto Rico in our prayers as Hurricane Fiona passes over your beautiful island,\" Biden tweeted. \"We are here for you, and we will get through this together.\"\n\nPuerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricane Maria 5 years ago\n\nFiona struck Puerto Rico almost five years to the day after Hurricane Maria slammed the island on Sept. 20, 2017, with wind speeds of up to 155 mph – just 2 mph short of a Category 5 storm.\n\nMaria caused nearly 3,000 deaths, destroyed the power grid and devastated tens of thousands of homes – about 3,000 of which remain covered by tarps.\n\nBridge built after Maria swept away by Fiona\n\nThe destruction wrought across the island by Fiona included a temporary bridge in the city of Utuado that was built after Hurricane Maria. The bridge over the Guanica River in the central mountain region was swept away by floodwaters Sunday when Fiona made landfall.\n\nU.S. House Delegate Roberto Lefranc Fortuño posted video of the bridge, known as PR-123, tearing apart and washing away. People can be heard screaming amid the clattering of metal as a man stands with his hands on his head in disbelief.\n\nIN MEXICO:Major earthquake strikes on Sept. 19 for third time since 1985\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/weather/hurricane-tropical-storm-fiona-monday/index.html", "title": "At least 2 dead in Puerto Rico after 'unbelievable' Hurricane Fiona", "text": "(CNN) At least two people have died in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Fiona , Gov. Pedro Pierluisi told CNN, as rescuers scrambled to save flooding victims.\n\nA 58-year-old man died after being swept away by La Plata River behind his home in Comerío, and a man in his 30s died after attempting to fill his generator with gasoline while it was on, setting it on fire, according to Press Secretary Sheila Angleró-Mojica.\n\nThe storm wiped out power to most of the island before crashing into the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Ricans who remember the wrath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 say Fiona might be more destructive.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" said Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a business owner in San Juan.\n\n\"A lot of people -- more than (during) Maria -- lost their houses now ... lost everything in their houses because of the flooding,\" Gonzalez told CNN's Leyla Santiago.\n\n\"Maria was tough winds. But this one, with all the rain, it just destroyed everything in the house. Gov. Pierluisi also told CNN Monday that damage on the island is mostly rain-related.\n\nBy midday Monday, about 1,000 people in Puerto Rico had been rescued by emergency crews, said Maj. Gen. José Reyes, adjutant general of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n\nThe \"catastrophic rain that won't stop\" is \"the biggest challenge\" for responders, Federal Emergency Management Agency Coordingating Officer Robert Little told CNN's Erin Burnett Monday evening.\n\n\"The first responders, the local responders, the responders of the government of Puerto Rico, are not able to get out and help those that needed or access the damage like they would like to do,\" he added.\n\nCars and buildings are partially submerged in Puerto Rico, which remains lagely without power.\n\nIntense rain was expected to produce more mudslides and catastrophic flooding through Monday night.\n\nOne hundred first responders from New York will head to the US territory to help as soon as weather allows, Pierluisi said, adding that the governors of New Jersey and California have also pledged to send help.\n\nFiona made landfall Monday morning in the Dominican Republic after crossing onto land a day earlier in southwestern Puerto Rico.\n\nStill, Puerto Rico remains almost entirely under flash flood or flood warnings -- nearly five years to the day after Hurricane Maria devastated the territory.\n\nOne area north of the city of Ponce reported over 2 feet of rain in 24 hours.\n\nRescues were underway Monday in the western Puerto Rican municipalities of Mayaguez and Hormigueros, officials said. The Guanajibo River in Hormigueros surpassed its previous record height set during Maria.\n\nMeanwhile, southern Puerto Rico can expect another 4 to 8 inches of rain or more early this week -- meaning Fiona will leave the island deluged with 12 to 30 inches of rain, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across Puerto Rico,\" the center said.\n\nAt least one death was reported in the heavily-damaged city of Basse-Terre , the capitol of the French territory of Guadeloupe, the vice president of the territory's environmental agency said.\n\nFiona could become a major hurricane by Wednesday, with winds reaching 111 mph . That would make Fiona the first major hurricane of the year in the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMassive power outages cripple Puerto Rico\n\nA house is deluged Sunday in Cayey, Puerto Rico. Three people inside the home were reportedly rescued.\n\nJust 115,000 out of 1.4 million customers on the island currently have power, Pierluisi said Monday evening. The entire island was in the dark early Monday, PowerOutage.us reported.\n\nAnd it could be days before power is restored, the main power utility in Puerto Rico said Sunday, as daily high temperatures after Monday are forecast to reach the mid-80s to 90s.\n\nSeveral transmission line outages contributing to the blackout, LUMA Energy said. Power will be restored \"gradually,\" Pierluisi said in a Facebook post.\n\nOnly 35% of customers are getting water services because water filtration plants are being impacted by the river flooding and excess rain, the governor said.\n\nHurricane evacuees take refuge at a public school in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico.\n\nBy late Monday morning, a bit of good news from island's capital: The power system came back up for hospitals in San Juan's medical complex, Puerto Rico Health Secretary Dr. Carlos Mellado López said. The complex is the island's most important and stretches across 227 acres, according to the Health Administration of Puerto Rico.\n\n\"The power system at all the hospitals in the Medical Center Complex has been restored,\" Mellado tweeted Sunday night. \"Our patients are safe and receiving the medical care they need.\"\n\nFiona's latest path\n\nIntense rainfall will continue producing mudslides, landslides and catastrophic flooding across Puerto Rico through Monday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFiona could intensify as it moves across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe hurricane slammed the Dominican Republic community of Boca de Yuma early Monday, whipping maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm knocked 59 aqueducts out of service, leaving more than 1 million people in the Dominican Republic without running water, according to Jose Luis German Mejia, an emergency management official. At least 54 homes have been reported damaged so far, said Juan Manuel Mendez, the country's emergency management director of operations.\n\nEmergency officials have transported 789 people to safety, Mendez said at a storm briefing Monday. More than 500 people are housed in 29 shelters, he said.\n\nTen electric circuits are offline currently, but officials did not have an exact number of how many customers were without power.\n\n\"This is still an emergency event,\" and the storm is still affecting the country, said Mejia.\n\nLife-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding is forecast for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic through early Tuesday, the hurricane center said.\n\nFiona could also dump 10 inches of rain in the eastern and northern parts of the country, according to the center.\n\nAs Fiona moves away from the Dominican Republic's northern coast, it's expected to intensify as it moves north over warm water.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected in the southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday, and Fiona is expected to impact the eastern Turks and Caicos on Tuesday morning.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said Monday evening.\n\n\"Fiona will continue turning northward and then northeastward this week, nearing Bermuda on Friday as a major hurricane,\" CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nYet another widespread calamity\n\nPower outages have become a familiar crisis for many who live in Puerto Rico. Just five months ago, residents suffered another islandwide blackout after a fire broke out in a power plant.\n\nSome parts of the island still bear the scars of Maria, which inflicted catastrophic infrastructure damage ; it took almost a year for power to be restored across the island.\n\nSamuel Rivera and his mother Lourdes Rodriguez lived without power for about a year after Maria, Rivera told CNN. On Sunday morning, they lost power once again, conjuring up similar fears to those they had five years ago.\n\nThey were also concerned a nearby river might overflow and trees surrounding their home could be felled by the powerful winds, they said.\n\nRushing waters easily wiped away a bridge , carrying its structure downstream, one video of the dangerous flooding shows. Elsewhere in the city of Arecibo, quickly moving waters overtook large construction vehicles and entire trees as rain fell in sheets, another video by Samuel De Jesús shows.\n\nMany rivers on the eastern side of the island were at moderate to major flood stages Sunday afternoon, including one southeastern river which rose over 12 feet in less than seven hours.\n\nUS President Joe Biden early Sunday approved an emergency declaration to provide federal assistance to disaster relief efforts.\n\nMore than 300 FEMA emergency workers were on the ground to respond to the crisis, said Anne Bink, FEMA's associate administrator for Response and Recovery.\n\n\"Our heart goes out to the residents that again are going through another catastrophic event five years later,\" Bink said, nodding to Maria. This time, she said, FEMA plans to implement lessons learned from the 2017 crisis.\n\n\"We were much more prepared. We have four warehouses now strategically located throughout the island, which includes commodities, exponentially larger supplies than in the past,\" Bink said.\n\n\"We're proactively there -- and well ahead of any storm hitting -- to make sure that we are coordinating. And all of the planning efforts we undertake during those blue skies days can be brought to bear when the rain falls.\"\n\nBiden told Gov. Pierluisi in a Tuesday call that he would \"ensure that the Federal team remains on the job to get it done, especially given that Puerto Rico is still recovering from the damage of Hurricane Maria five years ago this week,\" a readout of the call said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe", "Holly Yan", "Melissa Alonso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/19/hurricane-fiona-puerto-rico-dominican-republic-updates/10424046002/", "title": "Hurricane Fiona: Two-thirds of Puerto Rico is without water service", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Monday, Sept. 19. For the latest updates on Hurricane Fiona, see our coverage from Tuesday, Sept. 20.\n\nHurricane Fiona smashed through Puerto Rico on Monday with pounding rain and winds that triggered mudslides, \"catastrophic\" flooding and a power outage that swept across the entire island. Hundreds of thousands lacked running water.\n\nMore than 1,000 water rescues were performed and more were underway, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said. Even as the storm made landfall Monday in the Dominican Republic, it continued to slam Puerto Rico with unrelenting rains -- more than 30 inches in southern parts of the island.\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Juan urged residents to move to higher ground \"immediately.\"\n\n\"Heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding continues across much of Puerto Rico,\" said Richard Pasch, a specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nAuthorities reported two deaths in Puerto Rico – one a 58-year-old man swept away by a flooded river in the inland town of Comerio and another one a 70-year-old man burned while trying to operate a generator. Another death was reported in the Dominican Republic, where a person was hit by a falling tree.\n\nThe Aqueduct and Sewer Authority said more than 800,000 customers – two-thirds of the homes and businesses – were without drinking water service. The entire power grid across the U.S. territory went down Sunday afternoon before the storm made landfall, leaving everyone without electricity.\n\nLess than 10% had regained power Monday, and power distribution company LUMA Energy warned that it could take several days to fully restore electricity because of the outage's magnitude.\n\nIn an effort to restore power, LUMA and other power distribution companies worked to recover services to over 200,000 customers around the island late Monday.\n\n\"We have the equipment, tools and resources to respond to this event,\" the company said.\n\nThe Dominican Republic government reported one death from falling trees because of the storm, which prompted at least four international airports to shut down, but by late afternoon Fiona was moving away from land. It could strengthen into a major hurricane by Tuesday.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, National Guard and Municipal Emergency Management personnel were helping with evacuations and water rescues in several communities of severely damaged Salinas in the south, Mayor Karilyn Bonilla Colón said. She urged residents to stay in their homes or shelters. The southern city of Ponce, the largest population center outside the San Juan metropolitan area, also experienced major flooding.\n\n\"Lands are saturated, rivers are overgrown, areas are flooded areas, and streets are still impassable,\" Bonilla Colón said. \"Please stay safe and consider the first responders and rescue personnel who have done a titanic job to save lives.\"\n\nHelicopter pilot helps residents in need, shares 'traumatizing' pictures of damage\n\nMuch as he had done five years ago in the wake of Hurricane Maria, helicopter pilot Carlos Benitez took to the sky Monday morning to survey the damage from Hurricane Fiona and identify Puerto Ricans in need of rescue.\n\n“We saw more than 200 houses flooded all the way up to the roof, people on the top of the roof, on the balcony, requesting rescue,” said Benitez, 42, who notified rescue personnel of their locations. Others were on boats and jet skis, he said.\n\nBenitez, who typically does charter flights, said he flew for seven hours and shared videos of what he saw on social media. He has been receiving messages from people begging him to check in on their loved ones.\n\n“Even though you have a strong mind, even though you have a strong heart, that PTSD always comes back, just the same way that we have five years ago for Maria,” he said. “It’s traumatizing what we see.”\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\nTwo-thirds of Puerto Rico out of water service\n\nWater service was cut to more than 837,000 customers – two thirds of the total on the island – because of turbid water at filtration plants or lack of power, according to officials. Only 34% of households have potable water.\n\n“The majority of rivers are too high. We have 112 filtration plants and the majority are supplied by rivers,” Aqueduct and Sewer Authority executive president Doriel Pagán Crespo said in an interview with a San Juan radio station. She said personnel will be dispatched for cleanup as water levels drop.\n\n“We have our personnel activated, we haven’t stopped working … we’ll keep working,” Pagán Crespo said.\n\nThe agency said on its Twitter page that water could be turbid upon service restoration and recommended that customers boil water for three minutes before using it for human consumption.\n\n– Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nUp to 30 inches of rain could fall\n\nParts of the island are still healing from the battering wrought by Hurricane Maria five years ago, and more than 3,000 homes still have blue tarps for a roof. Now residents could see up to 30 inches of rain before the storm rolls out of the area late Monday, AccuWeather reported.\n\n\"These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across Puerto Rico,\" said Brad Reinhart, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, adding that \"life-threatening flash and urban flooding is likely for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic.\"\n\nHURRICANE FIONA MAKES LANDFALL:Puerto Rico hammered, hit with island-wide power blackout\n\nWinds of up to 85 mph ripped the top off houses and businesses. Water rushed through streets and into homes. Roads were torn apart, and in the central town of Utuado, a temporary bridge installed by the National Guard after Maria washed away. Hours of rain were still to come.\n\nErnesto Morales, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Juan, said flooding reached “historic\" levels.\n\n“It’s important people understand that this is not over,” Morales said.\n\nHow to help Puerto Rico\n\nIn addition to FEMA and local emergency responders, several organizations are providing relief efforts for residents, including solar lights, generators, essential supplies and food. Here's how to help:\n\n►PRxPR is a disaster relief fund focused on rebuilding Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The organization is now collecting monetary donations for short- and long-term humanitarian needs in Puerto Rico.\n\n►Project HOPE, an international organization that assisted in the response to a series of damaging earthquakes that struck Puerto Rico in late 2019 and early 2020, said it has \"teams on the ground'' evaluating the health needs of people impacted by the hurricane.\n\n►Brigada Solidaria del Oeste, a mutual-aid group based in Boquerón, Puerto Rico, is collecting emergency essential donations such as solar lamps, water filters, water-purification tablets and first-aid kids, as well as monetary donations.\n\n►The Puerto Rican Civic Club in San Jose, California is raising funds for solar lights and gas generators in Puerto Rico. Donate Amazon items and funds here.\n\n►The Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on Latino empowerment, is raising funds for on-the-ground emergency relief services and essential supplies for communities affected by the storm.\n\n– Cady Stanton\n\nLocals have been feeling brunt of storm for days\n\nDarlene Nieves, an assistant program officer for the aid organization Mercy Corps, said power and water interruptions in Puerto Rico began Thursday night -- three days before the hurricane made landfall, and some communities remain isolated.\n\n\"I have been trying to reach my family, but I can't because the access to roads is blocked by fallen trees, landslides and severe flooding,\" said Nieves, who has relatives in the central mountain town of Naranjito. \"We see the same scenario almost everywhere, and we still received flash flood warnings today.\"\n\nNelson Cirino was sleeping in the northern coastal town of Loiza on Sunday when the roof blew off his home.\n\nAda Vivian Román said the storm knocked down trees and fences in her hometown of Toa Alta, southwest of the capital San Juan. She worried about how long the public transportation she relies on to get to her job at a public relations agency will be unable to operate.\n\n“But I know that I’m privileged compared with other families who are practically losing their homes because they are under water,” she said.\n\nGov. Pierluisi canceled school across the island for Tuesday and said only essential, immediate response personnel should report to public agencies. More than 2,000 residents had moved into 128 shelters, he said.\n\nPuerto Rico in 'constant state of emergency'\n\nMercy Corps says it has been helping people on the island better prepare for disasters by transforming local community centers into \"resilience hubs\" with different combinations of solar energy, potable water storage, communication systems, emergency kits and disaster preparedness training.\n\n“Puerto Ricans have faced a constant state of emergency over the five last years,\" said Allison Dworschak, leader of the agency's Caribbean Resilience Initiative. \"Those who don’t have the financial means to repair the damage properly are especially vulnerable to the impacts of storms like Fiona.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has declared a state of emergency and ordered federal assistance to supplement local responses.\n\nAdvocacy group says 'corporate greed' contributed to disaster\n\nJesus Gonzalez, with the Center for Popular Democracy, says \"corporate greed\" and predatory hedge funds have made the damage worse. Gonzalez says the federal government knew Puerto Rico would once again confront a natural disaster but did nothing to prepare. The privatization of Puerto Rico’s power system caused less investment in infrastructure and green energy in favor of profits, Gonzalez said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\n“Austerity-driven policies have crippled Puerto Rico's infrastructure in order to pay (debts), limiting the island's ability to recover from the devastating impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nWHAT IS THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE? Breaking down how we classify hurricanes.\n\nWhere is Fiona now?\n\nBy 5 p.m. ET Monday, Fiona was drifting away from the Dominican Republic and heading northwest at 10 mph in the direction of Grand Turk Island 130 miles away, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm packed maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, making it a Category 2 hurricane, and they're expected to get stronger.\n\nThe core of Fiona is expected to move near the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands by Monday night or early Tuesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nRain totals of up to 15 inches were projected for the eastern Dominican Republic, where authorities closed ports and beaches and told most people to stay home from work. The National Hurricane Center also warned of life-threatening flash flooding in the region.\n\nFiona became the third hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic season on Sunday, hours before its first landfall on the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico. At landfall in Puerto Rico on Sunday, Fiona was a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph.\n\nQUIET START TO SEASON:August hasn't been this devoid of tropical storms since 1997. Is hurricane season over?\n\nFiona made a second landfall in the Dominican Republic early Monday about 20 miles south of Punta Cana with sustained winds of 90 mph.\n\nWhere will Fiona go next? Will it impact the U.S.?\n\nImpacts from Hurricane Fiona will continue over the next few days after the storm leaves the Caribbean, forecasters said. \"Even though the threat of direct impacts to the United States has lessened, beaches up and down the Eastern Seaboard will still feel Fiona's effects,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Renee Duff said.\n\nBeaches along the U.S. East Coast will experience high waves, strong rip currents, minor beach erosion and minor coastal flooding around times of high tide much of this week as Fiona passes by offshore, AccuWeather said.\n\nMeteorologists expect Fiona to become the season's first Category 3 major hurricane by midweek with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph. It could spin near Bermuda as a major hurricane late Thursday or on Friday, forecasters said.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice and Thao Nguyen USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/weather/hurricane-fiona-puerto-rico-dominican-republic-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Fiona reaches Category 4 as it moves north, leaving ...", "text": "(CNN) With Category 4 Hurricane Fiona poised to sideswipe Bermuda later this week, people in the storm's deadly wake still faced days without basic utilities late Wednesday -- including much of Puerto Rico, where most were left without power and running water.\n\nMore than a million people in Puerto Rico still had no power by Wednesday afternoon, according to the island's emergency portal system. And more than 450,000 people across the island were without water service or with intermittent service as of Wednesday night, according to the website.\n\nWater is the top concern for residents like Carlos Vega, whose town of Cayey in the mountains of east-central Puerto Rico faced not only utility outages but also partially collapsed roads -- an effect of the major flooding and more than 2 feet of rain that parts of Puerto Rico were hit with.\n\n\"(Being without) power ... we can face that and we can deal with that. The biggest concern is with our water. Can't live without water,\" Vega told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nFiona killed at least five people in the Caribbean as it tore through the region last weekend and into this week, including one in Guadeloupe, two in Puerto Rico and two in the Dominican Republic.\n\nFiona also whipped parts of the Turks and Caicos islands on Tuesday with sustained winds of almost 125 mph, officials said. That left many areas without power, including on Grand Turk, South Caicos, Salt Cay, North Caicos and Middle Caicos, said Anya Williams, the acting governor of the islands. Authorities were able to begin visiting several islands and begin repairs.\n\nA fallen palm tree lies in the Ports of Call Resort entrance in Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nNo deaths had been reported in Turks and Caicos as of Wednesday evening, Williams said in an update.\n\nFiona's flooding especially left critical infrastructure damage in Puerto Rico and then the Dominican Republic, which the storm crossed Monday. More than 1 million utility customers in the Dominican Republic had no water service as of Wednesday morning, and more than 349,000 customers were without power, according to Maj. Gen. Juan Méndez García, director of the country's emergency operations center.\n\nMeanwhile, parts of Puerto Rico, where hundreds of thousands remained without power, reached heat indices -- what the air feels like when combining temperature and humidity -- of 105 to 109 degrees Wednesday, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Shackelford.\n\nThe landfall in Puerto Rico on Sunday came nearly five years after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, leaving thousands dead and cutting power to and water service to more than 1 million people for what would become months\n\nStorm presses north and could threaten Bermuda and Atlantic Canada\n\nFiona, after its center passed the Turks and Caicos as a Category 3 storm, strengthened to Category 4 -- sustained winds of at least 130 mph -- early Wednesday over the Atlantic.\n\nBy around 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, it was centered about 605 miles southwest of Bermuda, heading north with sustained winds of 130 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said\n\nFiona is expected to strengthen some through Wednesday night and approach Bermuda late Thursday, potentially still as a Category 4 storm, forecasters said\n\n\"Fiona is forecast to be a hurricane-force cyclone through Saturday,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nFiona's powerful center is currently expected to pass west of Bermuda, sparing the British island territory its worst winds. But sustained winds of at least tropical-storm force -- 39 to 73 mph -- are expected to reach Bermuda by late Thursday or early Friday, the center said\n\nbecause of the storm. The department also authorized family members of US government personnel to leave the island in anticipation of the storm. The US State Department issued a travel advisory Tuesday urging US citizens to reconsider travel to Bermudabecause of the storm.The department also authorized family members of US government personnel to leave the island in anticipation of the storm.\n\nThough the storm isn't expected to track near the US East Coast, it could generate onshore waves of 8 to 10 feet there over the weekend, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Wednesday.\n\n\"It's not a good weekend to go to the shore and get in the water -- it's time to stay out of the water,\" Myers said of the East Coast.\n\nFiona could affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, potentially hammering the region with high winds, storm surge and heavy rainfall. A storm surge is expected to bring up water levels along Bermuda's coast starting late Thursday.\n\n\"Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nThe storm has strengthened over the past few days -- it made landfall in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as a Category 1 hurricane before battering both with outer bands as it moved over water and toward the Turks and Caicos as a storm in Categories 2 and 3.\n\nPhotos: Hurricane Fiona slams the Caribbean Nicasio Gil walks through the stagnant water left by the swollen Duey River while grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona in Higuey, Dominican Republic, on Tuesday, September 20.

I managed to cover them with something and block them with a washing machine,\" she told Noticias SIN this week.\n\nAnother woman in Nizao who was clearing mud from belongings told Noticias SIN that she was frustrated because flooding frequently damages the region. This week, she left all belongings behind when floodwater encroached, she said.\n\n\"We can't take it any longer. Every year we lose our bed, clothes, food, everything,\" the second woman told Noticias SIN.\n\nMore than 610 homes in the Dominican Republic have been destroyed, and some communities were cut off from aid due to the storm, said García, the nation's emergency operations center director.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said on Twitter Wednesday that the federal government has approved a major disaster declaration request for the island, which ensures additional help from FEMA.\n\nThough US President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration Sunday , a major disaster declaration will bring additional resources -- primarily individual assistance in the form of funding for housing and other needs, as well as public assistance to provide for the permanent rebuilding of damaged infrastructure.\n\nRestoration crews face challenges\n\nThe governor expected \"a large portion of the population\" would have power restored by late Wednesday, with the exception of the island's southern region, which has suffered the most severe damage, he said Tuesday.\n\nBut restoration crews faced challenges: Many lines thought to have been repaired were temporarily knocked back offline because of various equipment issues, according to Josué Colón, executive director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.\n\nCrews could also encounter issues that require a pause in work so that an already impaired grid is not overloaded, a spokesman for the power provider, LUMA Energy, said Wednesday.\n\nPierluisi will take an aerial tour of the island with Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, he said. Criswell arrived on Tuesday to determine what additional federal help is needed, and that day surveyed damage with the governor in the city of Patillas.\n\n\"The community there ... (had) severely impacted roads, and bridges were damaged. Water was flooding the streets, and ... other parts of the community (were) inaccessible,\" Criswell said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"But I also saw a resilient Puerto Rico,\" she said. \"I met with a woman named Anna, who opened up her own home in her own driveway to help create a path for the community.

Fiona is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to the island late Thursday or early Friday.\n\nA hurricane watch and tropical storm watch was in effect for Bermuda on Wednesday. Fiona is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to the island late Thursday or early Friday. TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS: Gusty winds are expected to continue over parts of Turks and Caicos islands Wednesday morning as the storm moves toward Bermuda. With an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain expected, flooding may continue in the area.\n\nPossibility for another hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nA developing tropical system could spin up into a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico by the middle of next week, forecasters warned Wednesday.\n\nThe system, known now as Invest 98L, was located near the northeastern coast of South America on Wednesday. T​he majority of computer forecast models curl the system northward into the Gulf of Mexico around the middle of next week.\n\n\"This is the most significant threat for the U.S. mainland we've had this hurricane season,\" AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter said.\n\nMost computer models predict the system will be a tropical storm by the weekend in the Caribbean. The models then show the system strengthening into a hurricane by early next week. If it becomes a named storm, it would be called Hermine.\n\nIt does not appear this system will be a threat to areas in the northeastern Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, all of which have been hardest hit by Hurricane Fiona.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nDamage in Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, at least two people died after a 68-year-old man was struck by a falling tree and an 18-year-old girl was struck by a falling electrical post. Fiona left over 400,000 homes without power, blocked highways and forced over 1,550 people into government shelters.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos Islands, officials imposed a curfew and urged people to leave flood-prone regions as Fiona approached Tuesday. The area saw minimal damage and no reported deaths. But telecommunications on Grand Turk, the capital island of the Turks and Caicos, were severely affected, and the archipelago saw a handful of downed trees and electric posts.\n\nHurricane projected to hit eastern Canada\n\nFiona is on track to make landfall in eastern Canada along the Atlantic coast, with Nova Scotia in its path this weekend, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada.\n\nThe government organization said Fiona is expected just south of Nova Scotia Friday night, passing through eastern Nova Scotia Saturday and reaching the lower North Shore of Quebec and southeastern Labrador early Sunday. Hurricane-strength winds and between about 4 and 8 inches of rainfall are possible.\n\nHigher-than-usual water temperatures in the North Atlantic this year could mean less weakening of the storm before it hits Canada. In the past, colder waters have typically weakened hurricanes into tropical wind and rainstorms before reaching the region, according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"Fiona will bring widespread power outages due to high winds, flooding due to torrential rain and isolated storm surge and massive seas offshore and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Anderson said.\n\nFiona comes 5 years after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico\n\nAs Hurricane Fiona bore down on Puerto Rico this week, residents of the U.S. territory in the Caribbean didn’t have to look far for reminders of the last great storm to hit the area, exactly five years ago: Blue tarps are draped over thousands of homes, structures in need of repair still dot the island and power outages remain persistent.\n\nThe deadliest natural disaster in Puerto Rico in 100 years, Hurricane Maria killed roughly 3,000 people and destroyed the electrical system. Though Fiona made landfall Category 1 storm, the damage it wrought even before it struck – including the loss of power and potable water – served as a grim reminder of why, for many of the island’s residents, Maria marked a distinct before and after in their lives.

The system is expected to unleash historic rainfall of up to 30 inches, widespread flooding and dangerous mudslides, forecasters said.\n\n“The damages that we are seeing are catastrophic,” Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said.\n\nIn the central mountain town of Utuado, the storm washed away a bridge that police say was installed by the National Guard after Hurricane Maria hit on Sept. 20, 2017.\n\nHundreds of people were evacuated or rescued across the island as floodwaters rose, submerging cars, first floors, and an airport runway in the island’s southern region.\n\nLUMA Energy, the company that operates power transmission and distribution, said fierce winds disrupted transmission lines, leading to “a blackout on all the island.” Fully restoring power could take several days, LUMA said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden declared a state of emergency on the territory, home to 3.2 million people, the vast majority American citizens.\n\nHurricane Fiona's projected path\n\nThe eye of Fiona was heading northwest toward the eastern part of the Dominican Republic, the hurricane center said in its 5 p.m. EDT advisory, and was expected to roar near the country's northern coast Monday before turning toward the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday.\n\n\"Torrential rains and mudslides are expected across Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic,\" the center said.\n\nAfter its path through the Caribbean and Bahamas, Fiona could move on a track toward Bermuda, Accuweather said. Hurricane warnings were in effect Sunday for Puerto Rico and parts of the Dominican Republic.\n\nForecasters expect the hurricane to gain strength in the next two days, with wind speeds possibly reaching 115 mph.\n\nFIONA ON THE MOVE:Tropical Storm Fiona takes aim on Puerto Rico, Caribbean islands\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nFiona was expected to drop 12 to 18 inches of rain over eastern and southern Puerto Rico, and as much as 30 inches in isolated spots, forecasters said.\n\nThe storm could pound cities and towns along the southern coast that are still recovering from a series of powerful earthquakes that struck in 2019.\n\n\"These rains will produce life-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding across Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic, along with mudslides and landslides in areas of higher terrain,\" the hurricane center warned.\n\nWHAT IS THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON HURRICANE WIND SPEED SCALE?:Breaking down how we classify hurricanes\n\nWhat was the storm that devastated the island?\n\nFiona will not be the mammoth system Hurricane Maria was when it made landfall as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 20, 2017, but it still poses a serious threat, Accuweather said.\n\nMaria was devastating to the island, leading to at least 3,000 deaths. Thousands of homes, roads, and recreational areas have yet to be fixed or rebuilt. The government has completed only 21% of more than 5,500 official post-hurricane projects, and seven of the island’s 78 municipalities report that not a single project has begun, the Associated Press reported.\n\n“I think all of us Puerto Ricans who lived through Maria have that post-traumatic stress of, ‘What is going to happen, how long is it going to last and what needs might we face?’” resident Danny Hernández said.\n\nHernandez, who works in the capital of San Juan, said he planned to ride out the storm with family in the western city of Mayaguez. Residents stocking up at grocery stores were nervous, Hernandez said.\n\n“After Maria, we all experienced scarcity to some extent,” he said.\n\nIn the southwest town of El Combate, which is in the storm’s path, hotel co-owner Tomás Rivera fretted about the amount of rain that could be unleashed.\n\nRivera said workers brought bedridden family members to the hotel, concerned about the slow government response after Maria. Rivera said he has diesel, gasoline, food, water, and ice on hand. “What we’ve done is prepared ourselves to depend as little as possible on the central government,” he said.\n\nMARIA DEATH TOLL:Hurricane Maria killed more than 70 times the official toll, study says.\n\nHow big of a concern is the power grid?\n\nHurricane Maria obliterated Puerto Rico's power grid. The grid is still very fragile and in the process of reconstruction. Outages are frequent.\n\nLUMA warned of “widespread service interruptions” earlier Sunday. By the afternoon, the entire island was dark. More than 3,000 homes still only have a blue tarp as a roof and infrastructure remains weak.\n\n“Current weather conditions are extremely dangerous and are hindering our capacity to evaluate the complete situation,” the company said, adding that power restoration could take days.\n\nHealth centers were running on generators, some of which have failed. Health Secretary Carlos Mellado said crews were working to repair generators at the Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nWill Fiona directly impact the mainland US?\n\nThe potential for a direct impact on the U.S. mainland has lessened since last week, Accuweather said, but the storm could whip up dangerous surf and strong rip currents along the East Coast later this week.\n\nHow has the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season gone so far?\n\nFiona became the third hurricane of the Atlantic season when it formed on Sunday. The season has gotten off to a slow start.\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, no hurricane had formed by August, and no storm has directly affected the mainland U.S. The first hurricane of an Atlantic season typically develops by Aug. 11, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe season officially began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30. The peak of the season is usually around Sept. 17.\n\nQUIET AUGUST:August hasn't been this devoid of tropical storms since 1997.

Ricardo Rosselló praised the work of residents and emergency crews in heeding calls to evacuate flood-prone areas but warned heavy rains were still moving through parts of the island and urged everyone to remain vigilant.\n\n“The people of Puerto Rico responded to the call for preparation and took this event seriously,” Rosselló said Thursday. “Your actions saved lives.”\n\nAs Irma marched toward the Dominican Republic and Cuba, it left a deluge of rain and swollen waterways across Puerto Rico, an island of 3.4 million people. Seven rivers throughout Puerto Rico were running above flood levels and as much as 12 rains fell on some parts of the island, according to the National Weather Service in San Juan. More rain was expected through Friday, especially in the south and southwest.\n\nThe main challenge ahead is returning power to the more than 1 million customers — nearly 70% of the island — without electricity. Residents also struggled without water in some areas as officials dispatched work crews early Thursday to return the much-needed services.\n\nMore:Florida under hurricane watch as Irma roars toward U.S. mainland\n\nMore:Where is the Category 5 storm now and where is it headed next?\n\nMore:Floridians fleeing Hurricane Irma face unique challenge: Where to go?\n\nIn San Juan, which sits on the northern part of the island, closest to Irma’s path, some hotels remained open as Irma skirted nearby.\n\nThe Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan housed about 70 guests overnight, said Geida Perez, a front desk agent. The hotel lost power at about 5 p.m. Wednesday and switched to generators, but Irma's fury wasn’t felt nearly as strongly as expected, she said. Guests huddling in a hotel ballroom for extra protection from the storm barely heard the winds outside, she said.\n\n“We’re actually quite OK,” Perez said. “When we saw it wasn’t as catastrophic as we thought it would be, people calmed down.”\n\nOn Wednesday, travelers hoping to flee the island aboard a JetBlue and American Airlines flight were forced to shelter in San Juan when those flights were turned around in the air, as Hurricane Irma’s outer bands menaced the island. A Delta Airlines flight made it to San Juan around the same time and ferried travelers back to New York in an event widely shared across social media.\n\nPorts on the island remained closed Thursday, and it was unclear when commercial flights would resume. Schools and government offices are scheduled to reopen Monday.\n\nThough largely sparing Puerto Rico, Hurricane Irma cut a devastating path across the northern Caribbean, leaving at least 10 dead and thousands homeless in places like Antigua, Barbuda and St. Martin. The storm continued its menacing march toward Florida, where meteorologists forecast it would make landfall early Sunday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center predicts Irma will remain at Category 4 or 5 for the next day or two as it passes just to the north of the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Thursday, nears the Turks & Caicos and parts of the Bahamas by Thursday night and skirts Cuba on Friday night into Saturday.\n\nIt's then expected to turn north toward Florida, where evacuations were ongoing from vulnerable coastal areas and airlines were rapidly canceling flights.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/07"}]}

We still have a problem with Covid. We're still doing a lot of work on it. It's -- but the pandemic is over,\" Biden said.\n\nThe US government still designates Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency and the World Health Organization says it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But the President's comments follow other hopeful comments from global health leaders.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a news briefing last week that the end of the Covid-19 pandemic was \"in sight, \" and that the world has never been in a better position to end the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Last week, the number of weekly reported deaths from Covid-19 was the lowest since March 2020,\" Ghebreyesus said. \"We have never been in a better position to end the pandemic. We're not there yet, but the end is in sight.\"\n\nLast month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adjusted its Covid-19 guidance to urge the nation away from measures such as quarantines and social distancing and instead focus on reducing severe disease from Covid-19. But the agency says some people, including those who are older, immunocompromised, have certain disabilities or underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for serious illness, and may need to take more precautions.\n\nThere were about 65,000 new Covid-19 cases reported each day over the past two weeks, data from Johns Hopkins University shows, and reported cases are dropping in almost every state. Across the United States, about 400 people are dying every day from Covid-19. Although official case counts are far from representative of true levels of transmission, forecasts published by the CDC say that new hospitalizations and deaths will hold steady for the next month.\n\nFor people hospitalized for Covid-19, the risk of dying fell to the lowest it's ever been during the Omicron wave, according to a study published last week by the CDC. The researchers suggest that there were several contributing factors to the improved mortality risk: high levels of immunity, both from vaccination and previous infection, advances in treatments and properties of the Omicron subvariants that made them less likely to cause disease.\n\nBiden on 2024\n\nThe President told \"60 Minutes\" in the interview aired Sunday he had not made a \"firm decision\" on whether he would run for reelection in 2024 but said he intended to run.\n\n\"Look, my intention, as I said to begin with, is that I would run again. But it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen,\" Biden said.\n\nThe President said: \"I'm a great respecter of fate. And so, what I'm doing is I'm doing my job. I'm gonna do that job. And within the time frame that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, make a judgment on what to do.\"\n\nThe President and top administration officials have maintained the President intends to run again in 2024, but Biden told ABC in December that it would depend on whether he was in good health.\n\n'I don't want to get myself in the middle'\n\nBiden told CBS he had not been briefed on the contents of the documents that were removed from former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence by the FBI in August, and said he did not want to interfere with any potential actions by the Department of Justice.\n\n\"I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don't want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take. I -- I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not,\" Biden said.\n\nThe Justice Department removed 11 sets of classified documents from Mar-a-Lago while executing a search warrant for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other crimes, according to unsealed court documents.\n\nAsked what his reaction was when he saw the photograph taken by the FBI that showed an array of documents found on Trump's property, Biden said: \"How that could possibly happen? How one -- anyone could be that irresponsible?\"\n\n\"And I thought what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods? By that I mean names of people who helped or, et cetera. And it just, totally irresponsible,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden said no one has briefed him on whether important national security secrets were revealed by the storage of those documents at the former President's residence.\n\n\"I have not personally spoken to anyone on that -- in that regard. I'm sure my administration is aware of all of that, and so is the National Security Council. But I have not,\" Biden said.\n\nThe President also told CBS that US military personnel would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. The President was asked whether \"US forces, US men and women would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion,\" a prospect US officials privately fear is becoming more likely.\n\n\"Yes,\" Biden responded.\n\nIt's not the first time Biden has gone beyond the US approach of \"strategic ambiguity\" when it comes to Taiwan. During a visit to Tokyo in May, Biden said the US would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force.\n\nThe White House has consistently said after Biden's comments that US policy hadn't changed, and \"60 Minutes\" reported receiving a similar response to Biden's answers in their interview.\n\nUnder the \"One China\" policy, the US acknowledges China's position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing's claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. Biden repeated his commitment to those policies in the \"60 Minutes\" interview.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan", "Jamie Gumbrecht", "Allie Malloy", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/politics/biden-covid-pandemic-over-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Biden declares the Covid pandemic over.

We're still doing a lotta work on it. ... But the pandemic is over.\"\n\nHe added, motioning around to the floor of the auto show: \"If you notice, no one's wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it's changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.\"\n\nIt is a complicated point of view Biden is taking since, as CNN's report points out , the US government still designates Covid-19 a public health emergency and will continue to do so through at least October 13, when that declaration is up for possible renewal.\n\nMore work to do\n\nBiden is right that there is more work to do. His administration is seeking additional money from Congress to help with vaccine development among other things and Biden's declaration could chip away at a remaining urgency among lawmakers.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill said Monday that Biden's words will essentially shut the door on approving new money\n\n\"If it's over, then I wouldn't suspect they need any more money,\" Sen. John Cornyn, the Texas Republican and member of the party leadership, told CNN's Manu Raju.\n\ngotten a first booster, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention parents of kids under 5 now eligible for the vaccine are skeptical of getting it for their children. Forty-three percent of those parents said they would definitely not get their child vaccinated, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey in July. There's a clear lag among Americans getting vaccine booster shots. Most of the country has gotten vaccinated, but less than half of those eligible havegotten a first booster, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data . Polls suggest that someparents of kids under 5 now eligible for the vaccine are skeptical of getting it for their children. Forty-three percent of those parents said they would definitely not get their child vaccinated, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey in July.\n\nVaccines, in addition to booster shots, may not completely stop infection, but they are still the best way to avoid a serious Covid-19 outcome, such as hospitalization or death.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of documented cases of Covid-19 each month and hundreds of deaths each day, numbers that the CDC expects will hold steady rather than fall or spike.\n\nRecalling Fauci in April\n\nUS officials have flirted with declaring the pandemic over before. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser and the outgoing director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said back in April that the country was \"out of the pandemic phase.\"\n\nA day later, he said on CNN that his comments had been mischaracterized and that he did not mean to say the pandemic was over.\n\nChanges in the past five months\n\nFauci and other experts have long said the US would have to live with the virus. That appears to be what's happening now as the intervening months have seen multiple developments.\n\nImmunity wanes over time, but nearly every American now has some level of immunity, either through previous infection or vaccination.\n\nNearly everyone 6 months and older has access to vaccination.\n\nA new Omicron variant-specific booster shot has been authorized to hopefully help control spread and hospitalizations.\n\nThe CDC ended recommendations for social distancing and quarantine as means to control the virus and eased mitigation recommendations for schools.\n\nTreatments like the antiviral Paxlovid, which Biden took when he contracted Covid-19 over the summer, have helped cut down on deaths.\n\nPeople are still dying: 425 per day, on average, and more than 13,000 over the past month, according to data maintained by Johns Hopkins University. That's too many. But it's far from a year ago, when the daily average of deaths was well over 2,000.\n\nAmericans are acting differently\n\nWhether the pandemic is officially over or not, Americans continue to return to a more normal life. Most Americans, 57%, said in an Axios-Ipsos survey released this month that they are at least somewhat concerned about the virus. But a minority, 28%, said they social distanced in the past week. A somewhat larger minority, 37%, said they had worn a mask more than occasionally. And a strong majority, 64%, said they had gone out to eat.\n\nNearly half, 46%, said they had returned to their pre-Covid-19 lifestyle.\n\nThe other thing Biden said about Covid-19\n\nBiden clearly sees ending the pandemic as a key to his presidency and at least partially blames it for how voters perceive him.\n\nWhen Pelley asked how Biden why his presidential approval rating was \"well below 50%,\" Biden almost immediately pointed to uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\n\nBiden: I think you'd agree that the impact on the psyche of the American people as a consequence of the pandemic is profound. Think of how that has changed everything. You know, people's attitudes about themselves, their families, about the state of the nation, about the state of their communities. And so there's a lot of uncertainty out there, a great deal of uncertainty.\n\nHe added that America has surpassed 1 million deaths as a result of Covid-19.\n\n\"My point is it takes time.

But I’ve been double vaccinated, double boosted. Symptoms are mild and I really appreciate your inquires and concerns. But I’m doing well, getting a lot of work done. Going to continue to get it done and in the meantime, thanks for your concern and keep the faith. It’s gonna be OK,” Biden, who was unmasked while standing outside on the Truman Balcony, said in the 20-second video the White House says was filmed by a masked and socially distanced videographer.\n\nThe mild symptoms and diagnosis protocol for Biden – a double-boosted 79-year-old at high risk for experiencing severe illness – will mean isolating and “working and resting” at the White House residence for the rest of the day, according to a senior administration official. This is the first time Biden has tested positive for Covid-19, and he last tested negative on Tuesday, per White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nBiden has called several people in the hours since his diagnosis. He wrote on Twitter Thursday afternoon that he is “doing great” following the positive test and said he called Pennsylvania politicians to send his regrets about having to cancel a scheduled trip to the commonwealth.

It requires a doctor’s prescription.\n\n“Consistent with (US Center for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nThursday marks “Day 0” of the President’s Covid-19 timeline – meaning he will be in isolation until at least next Tuesday in accordance to the CDC’s guidelines.\n\nThe President’s symptoms include “rhinorreha (or ‘runny nose’) and fatigue, with an occasional dry cough, which started yesterday evening,” according to a letter from the President’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor. Biden did not have a fever Thursday morning, White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told CNN.\n\nJha later told reporters that Biden’s oxygen levels were “normal” as of Thursday morning and that Biden’s Covid-19 virus sample has been sent to a lab to identify the specific variant he is infected with. Results are expected in “less than a week.”\n\nBiden first tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test Thursday morning as part of routine screening, and the positive result was later was confirmed by a PCR test, his physician said.\n\nO’Connor also noted that the President met the FDA’s criteria for use of the antiviral Paxlovid, adding, “I anticipate that he will respond favorably, as most maximally protected patients do.”\n\nDue to his age, Biden is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, although the CDC says older adults being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nJha said Thursday that Biden has the “full set of protections” to deal with Covid-19 at his advanced age.\n\n“The bottom line is given how much immunity he has from vaccines, given that he was started on treatments right away … I think all of those things very dramatically reduce his risk of serious illness,” Jha told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny during the White House press briefing. “And that’s really the goal here, is to prevent serious illness, to keep that risk as low as possible. I think he’s gotten that full set of protections.”\n\nBiden received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination on March 30.\n\nStaff takes measures to adapt, Harris and first lady keep their previous schedules\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden tested negative on Thursday.\n\nJean-Pierre indicated that the West Wing will continue to practice its current protocols but that the White House residential staff will be taking measures to create a “very minimal footprint” to avoid infecting others.\n\nThe number of aides who staff the White House residence will be reduced to the “bare minimum” in light of Biden’s positive Covid-19 diagnosis, an official told CNN.\n\nAnd a mid-level West Wing aide who works in close proximity to Biden and was on his recent trip to the Middle East also tested positive for Covid-19, according to two sources familiar. The person is not considered a close contact of the President and tested positive earlier this week.\n\nHarris is expected to keep her normal schedule while Biden isolates. The senior administration official said there are no plans and no need to transfer executive powers to Harris – as was done last November for 85 minutes, when Biden was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy.\n\nHarris has been identified as a close contact of Biden, a White House official told CNN. Harris last saw Biden on Tuesday and tested negative on Thursday. She is a close contact, an additional aide says, because they spent more than 15 minutes together while being briefed on the presidential daily brief. The White House official added that Harris will follow CDC guidelines for those who are vaccinated, including wearing a well-fitting mask while around people for 10 days from the date of the last close contact.\n\nThe first lady and the vice president said they had both spoken to the President on Thursday following the diagnosis.\n\nJill Biden told reporters in Detroit earlier Thursday that she had spoken to the President and that “he’s doing fine. He’s feeling good.”\n\nThe first lady, her spokesman Michael LaRosa told CNN, will keep her original schedule on Thursday, which includes a stop in Georgia before heading to Wilmington, Delaware. She is also double boosted, LaRosa said.\n\nAnd Thursday afternoon, Harris said at an event in North Carolina that the President “is in good spirits.”\n\n“He is working from the White House residence and when he spoke he was very pleased that we are all together today,” she told her audience, adding that Biden told her to “tell everybody hello.”\n\nUpcoming presidential travel canceled\n\nA White House official told CNN that Biden’s scheduled travel to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, later on Thursday for a speech on crime prevention has been canceled. A DNC fundraiser Biden was scheduled to headline Thursday night has been postponed, officials said.\n\nIt’s yet to be determined whether the event will be rescheduled or if donors will be asked to make their pledged contributions.\n\nBiden was also scheduled to travel to Orlando and Tampa, Florida, on Monday, but now he’s expected to be isolating.\n\nBiden has ramped up his engagement with the public over the past year as the White House has shifted its approach toward the pandemic. On Wednesday, Biden traveled to Somerset, Massachusetts, for an event on climate executive actions, where he was seen shaking hands and greeting attendees in the outdoor crowd.\n\nThe President’s positive diagnosis comes less than a week after a swing through the Middle East, where he held meetings with world leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia. While abroad, Biden was seen shaking hands, bumping fists and embracing other leaders.\n\nThe White House is currently working on contact tracing for those who may have been close contacts of Biden, per an official, since his positive Covid test. They plan to inform any close contacts on Thursday, including members of Congress and the press.\n\nAt least one member of Congress who was a close contact after seeing Biden in Massachusetts received a contact tracing call from the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe White House reached out to the lawmaker’s office Thursday afternoon, according to a source familiar, and advised the member of Congress to follow the CDC recommendations for what an individual should do when they’re determined to be a close contact.\n\nOne of the recommendations, for example, for someone who is fully vaccinated and was a close contact is to wear a well-fitting mask while around other people for 10 days from the date of last close contact.\n\nWhite House prepared for this moment\n\nWhite House officials have been preparing for months for what many viewed as the inevitability that Biden would come down with Covid.\n\nA wave of cases – including among Harris, White House staffers and members of Congress – has swept Washington through the spring and summer. And as more and more of his top officials and members of his family contracted Covid, officials came to believe it was possible the President himself would get sick, even as they took steps to shield him from the virus.\n\nKlain, in his Thursday memo to staff, wrote that White House officials “have said for some time that there was a substantial possibility that the President – like anyone else – could get Covid, and we have prepared for this possibility. We are now executing on our plan so that the President can continue to work seamlessly from the Residence.”\n\nBiden last underwent an annual physical in November at Walter Reed National Medical Center. O’Connor wrote in a memo at the time that the President remained “fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.”\n\nOfficials had a loose plan in place for the day Biden tested positive, including informing the public when the tests were confirmed and releasing a letter from Biden’s physician – which both took place on Thursday.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump issued a 1 a.m. ET tweet on October, 2, 2020, announcing that both he and then-first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for Covid-19. And Biden officials have been mindful of how the previous administration handled Trump’s diagnosis and have been intent on being more forthcoming about Biden’s condition.\n\nNow, more than two years into the pandemic, Biden has become the second sitting US president to test positive for Covid-19. His mild symptoms so far stand in stark contrast to Trump’s diagnosis before a vaccine was available in 2020 – a Covid infection that led to a multi-day hospitalization at Walter Reed.\n\nCovid emergency continues\n\nThe President’s infection comes as Covid cases are once again on the rise in the US, driven by the most contagious strain of the virus yet – BA.5. More than 1 million people have died of Covid-19 across the country since the pandemic began.\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing the Covid-19 public health emergency as it seeks new funding from Congress for treatments and vaccines. The public health emergency declaration allows many Americans to obtain free Covid-19 testing, therapeutic treatment and vaccines. Medicare has also relaxed the rules governing telehealth so that many more seniors can access such services during the declaration. And states are not involuntarily disenrolling residents from Medicaid during the declaration, in exchange for receiving more generous federal matching funds.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Thursday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Betsy Klein Kate Sullivan", "Maegan Vazquez", "Betsy Klein", "Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2022/09/20/biden-covid-19-pandemic-over-end-national-emergencies/10433645002/", "title": "Biden says COVID pandemic is over, so end national emergency", "text": "It’s not the first time Biden has prematurely declared victory over the pandemic.\n\nMore than 350 people a day in the U.S. die from COVID-19, which hardly seems a success.\n\nStaying in perpetual emergency allows the Biden administration to accomplish items without the 'inconvenience' of going through Congress.\n\nIt’s no news flash when President Joe Biden speaks first and thinks later.

The same order also prohibited mask mandates by cities, counties, school districts or public health officials.\n\nAbbott also added vaccine mandates to the agenda of the Legislature's third special session of the year that begins Sept. 20, directing lawmakers to consider whether state and local governments can require COVID-19 vaccinations, \"and if so, what exemptions should apply.\"\n\nIn June, the governor signed into law legislation that banned businesses in Texas from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination.\n\nSpeaking from the White House, Biden said the vaccine mandate for businesses — currently being drafted as an emergency rule by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration — was part of a six-point plan to increase vaccinations among almost 80 million Americans who have yet to get the shot.\n\nBiden blamed a \"distinct minority of elected officials (who) are keeping us from turning the corner.\"\n\nMore:Travis County COVID-19 vaccine tracker: 62% of people fully vaccinated\n\nAlthough the president did not name those officials, he has criticized Abbott and Florida Gov.

How do we know? Who gets to decide?\n\nPandemics don't have hard edges. Knowing where they start or stop is a judgment call, and there isn't a clear authority that gets to make that decision.\n\nEpidemiologists recognize a pandemic as a disease outbreak that happens in many countries at the same time and affects more people than an epidemic. Pandemics are often caused by new viruses or a strain of a virus that hasn't circulated among humans in a long time. These events are impactful, often leading to large numbers of deaths, social disruptions and economic hardship.\n\n\"I think we were all a little bit shocked when President Biden said what he said on '60 Minutes,' but I also think that in many ways, he was reflecting what many Americans already think and feel,\" said J. Alex Navarro, assistant director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\nBut because a pandemic is a global event, no single country or leader can decide it's over, he said.\n\n\"Declaring a pandemic over is a little different than declaring a local epidemic over,\" Navarro said. \"To declare a pandemic over, you need to have various regions of the world having their epidemics over. So it looks a little bit different, I think.\"\n\nThe world will probably have to reach an consensus, and that's something that may come as a kind of acknowledgment from the World Health Organization -- or it might not.\n\n\"There's not an official designation-holder,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health Security. \"WHO will acknowledge that we're in a pandemic, but it's not as if somebody calls it a pandemic and then says the pandemic is over.\"\n\nPandemics vs. public health emergencies\n\nBiden's comment doesn't change how the US or other countries are responding to Covid-19. For now, it remains a public health emergency in the United States, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, and it's still a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, according to WHO.\n\nA PHEIC creates an agreement between countries to abide by WHO's recommendations for managing the emergency. Each country, in turn, declares its own public health emergency -- declarations that carry legal weight. Countries use them to marshal resources and waive rules in order to ease a crisis.\n\nWhen these designations are lifted, there will be changes that reverberate through governments and that reach individuals and families. In the United States, for example, the end of the public health emergency will have ramifications for health care coverage and cost-sharing of Covid-19 tests and treatments.\n\nSaying the pandemic is over might influence public perception, but it doesn't materially change how the federal government or states are responding.\n\n\"It's separating out what is the formal legal definition versus what is just a popular discussion of saying, 'hey, we kind of think this is over now, and hey, let's move on,' and there are implications for both,\" said Rebecca Katz, who directs the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University.\n\nIn March 2020, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was finally using the term because of the severity of the disease, how fast it was spreading and \"alarming levels of inaction.\"\n\n\"WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock,\" Tedros said. \"We have therefore made the assessment that Covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.\"\n\nIt was a shift in language that put the world on alert, but it came long after many public health experts had reached the same conclusion, and it didn't change what WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or other international health agencies were doing to respond.\n\nAt this point, WHO is not saying whether it will recognize an end to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"WHO does not have a mechanism for declaring or ending a \"pandemic,' \" spokesman Tarik Jasarevik said in an email to CNN. Instead, he said, WHO will continue to assess the need for the public health emergency, and an expert committee meets every three months to do that.\n\nLast week, Tedros said the end of the pandemic \"is in sight,\" but he added that \"we are not there yet.\"\n\nAnd it's not clear what \"there\" will look like.\n\n\"That's one of the challenges we have is, we don't have a good definition of when the pandemic begins or when it ends,\" said Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nHow an earlier pandemic ended\n\nIn the modern era, there's no real precedent for closing the curtains on a pandemic.\n\n\"We're really in some new territory here,\" University of Michigan's Navarro said.\n\nThe last pandemic that approached this scale was the 1918 influenza pandemic. Back then, there was no federal response. President Woodrow Wilson \"really didn't say anything on influenza as far as we know,\" Navarro said, nor was he expected to.\n\n\"The pandemic response was then much more state and local, and so, citizens residents looked to state and local health officers for their guidance,\" Navarro said. That guidance was typically communicated through local newspapers, which were widely read.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDuring that pandemic, life mostly got back to normal after the devastating wave of fall illnesses in 1918.\n\nWith some exceptions, most mask orders, closures and social distancing orders were lifted by the beginning of 1919.\n\nBut waves of influenza continued until 1920, Navarro said. The United States continued to see cases and deaths, but \"they did not consider that to be sort of an epidemic level.\"\n\nPandemics can end when viruses mutate to become less deadly and people build up some immunity against them, Navarro said.\n\n\"Eventually, we reach an equilibrium where we just sort of live with these microbes,\" he said.\n\nWhether the world is there with Covid-19 still remains to be seen. Vaccines and treatments now offer some protection from severe disease and death, and cases are declining in most parts of the world.\n\nBut in the United States alone, there are still about 65,000 new cases reported daily, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, and an average of about 400 people die from Covid-19 every day.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/biden-comments-covid-taiwan-walkbacks-analysis/index.html", "title": "Why people keep correcting Joe Biden | CNN Politics", "text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden vowed to voters he would always give it to them straight. But his blunt talk keeps getting him into trouble.\n\nBut each time he lays down the law, some White House official, Democratic lawmaker or political ally explains that the President didn't actually say what everyone heard him say, or that he didn't actually mean what he appeared to.\n\nNow, all the mopping up is raising the question of whether the walk-backs are doing more damage than the President's initial frankness by undermining his authority.\n\nBiden is a self-admitted gaffe machine -- his loose tongue often got him into hot water in the Senate and was why he was initially mistrusted by some Obama administration aides as vice president. But Biden is now the commander in chief and can say what he wants -- until the clean-up operation kicks into action.\n\nOften, this comes across as disrespectful to the President. It makes it look like he doesn't know his own mind, or has strayed from a script that subordinates set for him. It offers an opening for Republicans who cast doubt on his cognitive capacity and his fitness for prime time. But the problem also runs deeper: A president's words resonate. In times of crisis, lives can be on the line. Their words move markets. Being constantly corrected sows confusion about Biden's authority and leadership.\n\nPoliticians often run for office promising to tell it is as it is. Biden's friend, the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, for instance, rode his way to the 2008 Republican nomination aboard a \"Straight Talk Express.\" But honesty and bluntness often are not conducive to governing. When the big guy strays off message, he can short-circuit policy machinery and can undermine nuanced positions on Capitol Hill. This was the case this week, when Biden's declaration that the pandemic was over in a \"60 Minutes\" interview undermined a push by House and Senate Democrats for the White House's own request for billions of dollars more in Covid-19 funding.\n\nBiden on Taiwan: strategic confusion or a stroke of genius?\n\nBiden set off an international controversy over his latest pledge, in the interview broadcast on Sunday, to defend Taiwan if China invaded. He's said something similar at least three previous times, trampling all over the principle of \"strategic ambiguity\" that leaves opaque how the US would respond. The policy is designed to make China think twice but also to avoid giving the Taiwanese a sense of security that could spur an independence declaration.\n\nBut each time Biden has apparently moved the ball on Taiwan, his officials put it back.\n\nThere is little doubt that Biden knew exactly what he was doing when he replied \"yes\" to a precise question from CBS' Scott Pelley on \"60 Minutes\" about whether he would deploy US men and women to defend Taiwan if it was invaded.\n\nBut national security adviser Jake Sullivan insisted on Tuesday that Biden hadn't changed policy and dismissed it as an answer to a \"hypothetical\" question, even though US intelligence thinks China is building a force capable of taking Taiwan.\n\n\"The President is a direct and straightforward person. He answered a hypothetical. He's answered it before in a similar way. And he has also been clear that he has not changed US policy towards Taiwan,\" Sullivan told reporters.\n\nBiden did indeed reaffirm his support in the interview for the \"One China\" policy and other foundational diplomatic texts with China. But Sullivan's comment suggests there is a gap between what US policy is toward Taiwan and what Biden says it is. That will raise fears of misunderstandings that could be dangerous.\n\nBiden's allies on Capitol Hill argued Tuesday that strategic confusion can be a virtue — after all, if Americans can't work out what the policy is then China has no chance.\n\n\"Even a walk back, it becomes strategic ambiguity, so I think it's all part of strategic ambiguity,\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said Tuesday. His Democratic colleague from Connecticut, Sen. Chris Murphy, also made the case that this is less a disconnect inside the White House than an example of strategic shrewdness.\n\n\"Whether it's intentional or not, it certainly serves the purpose of keeping China guessing. And that's the whole point, is to be in a position to defend Taiwan without making the explicit promise ahead of time,\" Murphy said.\n\nBut Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the uncertainty was damaging.\n\n\"You know, what are they going to think is our policy if they have the President of the United States saying we will go to war and that's not consistent with what anyone else is saying?\"\n\n\"So it's not a good thing for China to have to look at.\"\n\nFormer Trump administration Defense Secretary Mark Esper, however, sought to co-opt the President into the camp of hawks who want a tougher Taiwan policy.\n\n\"He's said it four times now, I think he's spot on and they are not trying to downplay it, they are trying to completely undermine him to say there's no policy change,\" Esper told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"We need to move away from strategic ambiguity if we are going to deter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\"\n\nTough talk on Putin\n\nIt's not the first time the President's plain talk has reverberated abroad.\n\nIn Warsaw in March, he said that Putin \"cannot remain in power.\" The White House rushed to explain the President wasn't talking about regime change. And foreign policy experts faulted him for personalizing the feud with Putin over Ukraine. But Biden's comment has aged well, at least as a moral judgment. And the President has actually assiduously avoided testing Putin's invisible red lines that could trigger a clash with NATO.\n\nIn fact, his swipe at Putin pales in comparison to the intemperance of his some of his predecessors, including former President Donald Trump, who boasted about having a \"much bigger\" and \"more powerful\" nuclear button than North Korea's Kim Jong Un. And in 1984, a leaked joke made during a microphone test by President Ronald Reagan about the US beginning the bombing of Russia \"in five minutes\" caused uproar.\n\nBiden offers GOP opening after declaring the pandemic over\n\nBut Biden's straight talk isn't just causing problems abroad. His remark in the \"60 Minutes\" interview that the \"pandemic is over\" set government public health officials scrambling, seemed to annoy Democrats on Capitol Hill who have argued for more aid and offered Republicans an opening. Biden did condition his remark by saying that Covid-19 still a problem and there is a lot of work to do. But he again caused officials to try and reframe exactly what he meant and stirred criticism from epidemiologists.\n\n\"What the President is reflecting is the fact that we've made tremendous progress against Covid-19. We're in a very different place now than we were at the beginning of this pandemic,\" Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told MSNBC in attempt to defuse Biden's remark without contradicting him.\n\nThe impression that Biden's remark was a rash aside rather than a considered strategy was bolstered on Tuesday night when Biden adopted Murthy's framing at a fundraiser in New York.\n\nSome medical experts warned that the President had discounted coronavirus deaths roughly equivalent to the toll of September, 11, 2001 every week. They said their metrics didn't justify declaring the pandemic over. And they worried Biden had harmed efforts to encourage people to get boosted.\n\nJUST WATCHED See late night reactions to President Biden claiming pandemic over Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See late night reactions to President Biden claiming pandemic over 01:45\n\nYet Biden might also be right. For many Americans, the sick and vulnerable aside, the pandemic -- as it was originally experienced in the depths of 2020 -- has ended. The disease is now becoming endemic and thanks to vaccines, life is returning to normal for many people. Sports stadiums are crowded with maskless fans. Nations like New Zealand and Australia, which cut themselves off from the world, have relaxed travel restrictions. Only China is sticking with its \"zero-Covid\" policy — apparently to spare the embarrassment of the hardline leaders that mandated it.\n\nStill, Biden did create a huge political headache since the administration is asking Congress for another $22.4 billion for Covid mitigation efforts.\n\n\"We need some more sources to be sure that it's over,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday.\n\n\"Covid is not over,\" Kaine, the Virginia Democrat said, adding, \"We need aid.\"\n\nBut Republicans like Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who is a member of his party's leadership, seized the moment: \"If it's over, then I wouldn't suspect they need any more money.\"\n\nBiden's habit of making bold statements that get clarified may also haunt him on the campaign trail. Last month, in an off-the-cuff comment, he described Trump's \"extreme MAGA philosophy\" as \"semi-fascism.\"\n\nEven some Democrats thought he went too far, and Biden seems to agree he blundered into a Hillary Clinton-style \"basket of deplorables\" gaffe. He hasn't used the construction since and insists that only extreme MAGA voters, not all Republicans, are bad.\n\nBut everyone now knows what he really thinks. The same may be true of Taiwan, although Sullivan insisted at the White House that what Biden said doesn't count.\n\n\"When the President of the United States wants to announce a policy change, he will do so.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its guidance on masking, but earlier this week White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said the Biden administration was “strongly considering” making these higher quality masks more readily available to Americans.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that the agency continues to recommend that “any mask is better than no mask,” and that Americans should wear a “well-fitting mask” to protect themselves and stop the spread of the virus.\n\nThe new announcements from the President come as his administration faces growing scrutiny alongside record Covid-19 hospitalizations, testing challenges and messaging frustration.\n\nBiden acknowledged the malaise that the country is feeling during this latest onslaught of Covid-19 cases.\n\n“I know we’re all frustrated as we enter this new year – the Omicron variant is causing millions of cases and record hospitalizations,” he said, before reiterating his belief that the pandemic is primarily affecting the unvaccinated in a plea for people to get their shots.\n\nThe President outlined how much better off Americans who have received their vaccination and booster shots are compared to those who have not when they are exposed to the virus.\n\n“Right now, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are testing positive, but what happens after that could not be more different,” Biden said.\n\nDuring his remarks Biden also announced plans to deploy a new wave of medical teams to six states to help hospitals combat Covid-19.\n\nThe military medical teams will support the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Henry Ford Hospital outside Detroit, University of New Mexico hospital in Albuquerque and University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, Biden said.\n\n“We were joking earlier – but we weren’t really joking: When you need something done, call in the military,” Biden said in remarks from the White House.\n\nThe President was joined on Thursday by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell for a briefing on the deployment of resources and personnel. The trio will also speak with federal surge teams already deployed to hospitals in Arizona, New York and Michigan.\n\nBiden had announced plans last month to mobilize 1,000 military medical personnel to help overwhelmed hospitals amid the Omicron surge. “These are just part of the first wave of deployments,” the White House official said of the latest mobilizations. “Teams will continue to be mobilized and deployed where they are needed over the coming weeks to confront Omicron.”\n\n“These teams will be providing relief, triaging patients, helping to decompress overwhelmed emergency departments, and freeing up health care providers to continue other lifesaving care. They will be working alongside health care workers on the front lines to give them the support they need,” a White House official said on Monday night.\n\nMore than 151,000 Americans were in the hospital with Covid-19 nationwide on Wednesday, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. And the US averaged more than 747,260 new Covid-19 cases daily over the last week, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThat’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and about 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to JHU.\n\nThe surge has put considerable stress on hospitals nationwide. And, to combat the massive strain on health care services that comes as more staff members call out sick with the virus, state leaders have enacted emergency procedures to help hospitals cope.\n\n“The sudden and steep rise in cases due to Omicron is resulting in unprecedented daily case counts, sickness, absenteeism, and strains on our health care system,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a Wednesday briefing.\n\nThis story and its headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan Kaitlan Collins Betsy Klein Jeremy Diamond Paul Leblanc", "Kate Sullivan", "Kaitlan Collins", "Betsy Klein", "Jeremy Diamond", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/health/biden-pandemic-comments-public-health/index.html", "title": "Biden's comments about pandemic widen public health split over ...", "text": "(CNN) Even as the US prepares for a potential winter surge of Covid-19, President Biden roamed the cavernous halls of the Detroit Auto Show for an interview on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" and, gesturing to the mostly maskless attendees, told the nation, \"the pandemic is over.\"\n\n\"We still have a problem with Covid. We're still doing a lot of work on it,\" he told correspondent Scott Pelley.\n\n\"But the pandemic is over,\" he repeated.\n\nThe timing of the President's remarks was striking: just two weeks after his administration launched a campaign to urge Americans to get booster shots against the latest Covid-19 strains at the same time as they get their annual flu shot. Health officials have also recently renewed their efforts to convince Congress to spend another $22.4 billion on Covid mitigation efforts.\n\nBiden's declaration has created another split-screen moment in efforts to bring Covid-19 to heel. Some public health experts worry that political motives are driving the President's desire to declare the pandemic over, rather than protection of the public's health. Others say the president is right and the acute phase of the pandemic is over, even as the country continues to deal with a high burden of disease.\n\nMore than 400 Americans are still dying each day from Covid-19 on average, a number that hasn't changed much in about three months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. As of the week of Sept. 9, Covid-19 was the second leading cause of death in the US, according to estimates from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n\"In a week, that's Twin Towers, right? It's a 9/11, week after week after week,\" said Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\nExcess deaths and Covid mortality are still higher in the US, per capita, than in other wealthy nations. And we've had a significant dip in life expectancy, he says.\n\n\"By any appreciable epidemiologic data points, the pandemic is not over,\" Gonsalves said.\n\nOne problem that contributes to the confusion is that the definition of a pandemic is squishy. In the simplest terms , a pandemic is an epidemic that occurs around the world and affects a large number of people. It's not up to a single person or organization to declare an official start or end to one.\n\n\"I think it's sort of a term of art,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"There's no criteria or some checklist that you make.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization recognizes a global health threat as something different: a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC. The US also recognizes a public health emergency.\n\nCovid-19 is still considered to be a public health emergency both domestically and around the world.\n\nAn administration official told CNN on Monday that Biden's comments do not mark a change in policy toward the administration's handling of the coronavirus and that there are no plans to lift the public health emergency, which has been in place since January 2020 and now runs at least through October 13.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services has promised to give a 60-day notice to states before ending the emergency declaration, something it has not yet done.\n\nStill, Gonsalves says he was dismayed by the President's assertion that the pandemic is over, especially going into the fall and winter.\n\n\"We are we are terribly under-boosted and under-vaccinated in this country,\" he said. \"What kind of message does it send to say 'the pandemic is over' when you want anyone to get shots into arms, both primary series and boosters? And you want to probably get some money out of Congress to do it?\"\n\nBiden's comments align with a recent Axios/Ipsos poll showing that most American feel there is little risk in returning to their pre-Covid lives. The poll found that the share of people who say they have resumed their normal activities is at the highest point since the start of the pandemic, at 46%.\n\n\"I know the President is taking a lot of criticism. I actually agree with him on this,\" Adalja said.\n\n\"To me, it's about having the tools to shift infections to the mild side and not seeing any concern about hospital capacity, and we have not seen hospital capacity concerns in the United States for some time,\" he said.\n\nAdalja says people who are slamming the President are misunderstanding what it means to be in a pandemic.\n\n\"Just because the President says this is not a pandemic doesn't mean that everything just halts,\" he said. \"And it doesn't mean that everything has to be directly done by congressional funding.\"\n\nThe administration has said it intends to stop buying vaccines, tests and treatments, shifting those things to the commercial market.\n\nWhat many public health experts fear, though, is that when the President says the pandemic is over, people hear that Covid-19 is over, and that's just not the case, said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOsterholm fears that that message just undermines efforts to get people vaccinated and boosted, promote access to testing and treatment and, yes, get them to wear masks in areas where Covid-19 transmission is high.\n\n\"Why would people now want to go get their booster shot if the pandemic is over?\" he asked.\n\nOsterholm says that in his estimation, cases, hospitalizations and deaths are still too high to say the pandemic is over. We also don't know what variants of the virus could emerge or how our immunity will hold up against them.\n\n\"I don't think people really understand what the implications are for this virus,\" Osterholm said. \"All of us want the pandemic to be over, but you can't make it go away by just making a policy decision.\"", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/consumers/2021/08/12/what-arizona-renters-need-know-cdc-eviction-moratorium/5543490001/", "title": "Eviction moratorium: What Arizona renters should know for new ...", "text": "President Joe Biden's administration unexpectedly announced a new ban on evictions last week, leaving courts, landlords and renters scrambling to navigate a new set of eviction rules.\n\nThe administration had previously indicated that evictions would resume when the original moratorium expired July 31. But a surge of COVID-19 cases spurred by the more-contagious delta variant of the coronavirus led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to institute a new moratorium three days later.\n\nThe new moratorium has some different rules and requirements than the former ban, but many of the qualifications and restrictions are similar to the old moratorium.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nHow is this different than the previous moratorium?\n\nThe new moratorium is narrower than the previous CDC eviction moratorium, which protected any American renter who could prove an eligible COVID-19-related impact.\n\nThe new eviction ban applies only to counties with high rates of COVID-19 transmission, reflecting where the CDC recommends vaccinated resident masks indoors and in public settings.\n\nAll Arizona counties fall into this category as of Aug. 10.\n\nHow long will the moratorium last?\n\nThe moratorium is set to expire on Sep. 30, but the protection could end sooner in some parts of Arizona if COVID-19 cases decline.\n\nThe moratorium only applies in counties with \"substantial\" or \"high\" community COVID-19 transmission levels, as tracked by the CDC.\n\nIf a county falls into the \"moderate\" or \"low\" categories for 14 consecutive days, the moratorium will no longer apply in that county, unless the level of transmission increases to \"substantial\" or \"high\" again.\n\nHow do I qualify for the moratorium?\n\nLike the previous moratorium, the eviction protection is not automatic. Renters must provide their landlord with a declaration stating:\n\nThey lost income during the pandemic.\n\nThey can’t make full rent payments.\n\nThey will try to make partial rent payments.\n\nThey have applied for rental help.\n\nThey live in a county with substantial or high rates of community transmission of COVID-19.\n\nAn eviction would leave them homeless or in cramped, unsafe living conditions.\n\nUnder the CDC rules, renters can't earn more than $99,000 a year to qualify. Couples who file joint tax returns can make twice that much and qualify.\n\nAre all evictions prevented?\n\nNo. Only evictions filed for nonpayment of rent are prohibited under the CDC moratorium.\n\nA landlord can still seek eviction for other breaches of the lease, like criminal activity, property damage or health code violations.\n\nDuring the moratorium, landlords can still file for eviction for nonpayment of rent and ask a judge to order an eviction judgment — they just can't enforce the judgment and make their renters leave until after the moratorium ends.\n\nWhat if my lease is set to expire?\n\nIf a tenant's lease ends and the renter does not leave, a landlord can file for eviction to remove them. Whether those evictions are prevented by the new moratorium often depends on a judge's interpretation.\n\nA new Arizona Supreme Court administrative order says judges should presume a lease-end eviction is a nonpayment issue if a renter owes rent or interest. If its a nonpayment issue, that renter should be protected by the moratorium.\n\nHowever, if a landlord can prove he or she ended the lease for a reason other than nonpayment, a judge may allow the eviction to proceed.\n\nIf I have an eviction hearing, do I still have to attend?\n\nYes. The moratorium only prevents the physical lockout of tenants. Evictions hearings will still continue and judges typically automatically award judgments for landlords if the renter does not show.\n\nRenters and landlords can participate in eviction hearings either in person or remotely. Information about how to attend a hearing virtually should be included on all court paperwork.\n\nWhat if a landlord filed for eviction on the 3 days without a moratorium?\n\nThe old CDC eviction moratorium expired July 31 and the new moratorium didn't take effect until Aug.3, meaning there were three days without a moratorium.\n\nHowever, the new moratorium applies to any eviction that has been filed and not yet completed, so all of the evictions filed during the three-day window should be subject to the new protection.\n\nWill landlords challenge the moratorium?\n\nLandlord and real estate groups across the country challenged the previous CDC moratorium.\n\nOne challenge made it to the Supreme Court, where the majority of justices allowed the moratorium to remain intact in June. However, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who cast the deciding vote, indicated that he did not believe the moratorium was constitutional but allowed it to remain in place because it was set to expire July 31 anyway.\n\nA day after the new moratorium took effect, a group of real estate entities asked a federal court to block enforcement of the Biden administration's new policy. The lawsuit will likely make its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a news conference last week, Biden said legal experts he consulted disagree on whether the new moratorium will hold up in court.\n\nHe said he expects the moratorium will be challenged in court, but said the time it will take for the litigation to play out will give states and cities more time to disburse rental assistance to struggling renters.\n\nIndividual landlords can also dispute the validity of their renters' moratorium qualifications in court.\n\nA landlord can file a motion disputing their tenants' CDC declaration. If the landlord can provide a factual basis for filing the motion, a judge will schedule an evidence hearing and may allow the eviction to proceed if the landlord can prove the renter does not meet all of the CDC qualifications.\n\nCoverage of housing insecurity on azcentral.com and in The Arizona Republic is supported by a grant from the Arizona Community Foundation.\n\nReach the reporter at jessica.boehm@gannett.com or 480-694-1823.

The automaker is required to pay $70 million of that amount within 60 days. It can also apply $20 million towards its obligations in the consent order and will be able to avoid $15 million of the penalties if it meets certain performance targets.\n\n\"FCA US does not expect that the net cost of providing these additional alternatives will be material to its financial position, liquidity or results of operations,\" the automaker said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe buy back program involves three of the 23 recalls NHTSA investigated. It covers Ram pickups and Dodge SUVs because they can lose power steering while in motion or have axle problems.\n\nThe agreement also compels the automaker to offer cash incentives to the owners of 1 million Jeep Grand Cherokees that are already under recall to bring in their vehicles for repair. NHTSA says the rear-mounted fuel tanks on the Jeeps can explode during rear collisions.\n\nThe outcome was a stunning turnaround for an automaker that has challenged NHTSA's authority on several occasions. Two years ago, Marchionne, FCA's CEO, pushed back against the agency when it asked the automaker to recall 2.7 million Jeep SUVs. The tussle, which played out in the press, soured the relationship. FCA later agreed to recall 1.56 million Jeeps.\n\nEarlier this year, when NHTSA announced it was looking into FCA's track record on the completion of 23 recalls affecting 11 million vehicles, the automaker said it didn't think a hearing was necessary.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Marchionne acknowledged that the automaker has been slow to adapt to a new regulatory era.\n\nOn Friday Marchionne and two other top executives signed a 37-page consent order that subjects the automaker to $105 million in civil penalties and a buyback involving hundreds of thousands of Ram pickups and Dodge SUVs. The order also requires FCA to offer incentives encouraging the owners of 1 million Jeep Grand Cherokees to take their vehicles to a dealer. The company also must pay for an independent monitor for three years.\n\nKelley Blue Book estimates that the buyback program could cost the automaker more than $900 million, taking the potential cost to more than $1 billion.\n\nIt's the largest fine and vehicle buyback program the agency has ever imposed and the most comprehensive monitoring program the agency has ever put in place.\n\nNHTSA has been moving swiftly under Rosekind, who was appointed in December, to crack down on the industry in the wake of high profile recalls by General Motors for faulty ignition switches and the recall of millions of airbags by Takata.\n\n\"If automakers weren’t convinced before, NHTSA made clear with the record $105-million fine ... that it is serious and will be aggressive about going after automakers who don’t quickly recall vehicles with defects,\" said Autotrader Senior Analyst Michelle Krebs.\n\nNHTSA said its investigation revealed that FCA, in a variety of recalls, failed adequately to inform NHTSA about vehicle safety issues, failed to develop an adequate way to fix the vehicles or produce the parts necessary to repair them and failed to adequately inform dealers about safety recalls.\n\nThe automaker acknowledged its shortcomings and pledged to comply with all of the agency's new requirements.\n\n\"We also accept the resulting consequences with renewed resolve to improve our handling of recalls and re-establish the trust our customers place in us,\" the company said in a news release Sunday. \"We are intent on rebuilding our relationship with NHTSA, and we embrace the role of public safety advocate.\"\n\nFor the next three years, Fiat Chrysler must deal with an \"independent monitor\" with broad oversight involving safety issues. The consent order calls for FCA to submit a list of three names within 60 days. NHTSA gets to choose from among the three.\n\nOnce in place, the monitor will see whether Fiat Chrysler lives up to its responsibilities under the consent order to improve safety in its vehicles. If the monitor determines Fiat Chrysler isn't complying, NHTSA will be notified and sanctions or penalties could follow. The monitor is also supposed to prepare a report 60 days before the order ends.\n\n\"From our vantage point, punishment is one aspect of what we do, but rehabilitation is what we hope lives on,\" Foxx said. \"One of the best ways … to ensure that they get it right is to have some type of ongoing dialogue or oversight.\"\n\nRosekind said the agency forced the automaker to agree to the buyback program because FCA failed to come up with an adequate remedy to fix nearly 200,000 pickup trucks and SUVs it recalled in 2013.\n\nThe buyback program applies mostly to Ram trucks and Dodge SUVs made between 2008 and 2012 that were part of three separate recalls announced in 2013.\n\nThere was confusion Monday over the number of buybacks the automaker would be forced to offer. FCA issued recalled notices for nearly 580,000 Ram pickups and Ram SUVs in 2013. NHTSA initially said the automaker must offer to buy back more than 500,000 vehicles.\n\nLater, Rosekind said the automaker must only offer buybacks to vehicles that have not yet been fixed. The automaker said it has fixed more than 280,000.\n\nGlenn Bradley, of Weatherford, Texas, said he called his dealer Monday to ask about his 2012 Ram 2500 and the dealer had no idea what he was talking about.\n\nFCA has not said how much the buyback program could cost the automaker. However, the automaker said Monday that the scope of the buyback program is less than the number suggested by NHTSA.\n\n\"As of this date, repairs have been completed on well over 60% of the subject vehicles, leaving less than two hundred thousand eligible vehicles,\" the automaker said in a news release.\n\nNevertheless, the automaker said it will offer to repurchase the trucks and SUVs that have not yet been fixed for a price equal to the original purchase price minus a reasonable allowance for depreciation plus 10%. FCA also emphasized that it is allowed to resell the vehicles it repurchases after they are repaired.\n\nRosekind said the agency decided against requiring a buyback program for the Jeep Grand Cherokees that are part of a recall for 1.54 million Jeep SUVs because, in that case, there is an available remedy.\n\nJeep Grand Cherokees from model-years 1993 to 1998 and Jeep Libertys from 2002 to 2007 have rear-mounted fuel tanks that NHTSA says are more prone too fiery rear-end collisions than SUVs made by other automakers. NHTSA has approved the installation of a trailer hitch to provide additional protection in rear end crashes for those vehicles.\n\n\"There is a very clear line where the buybacks were focused on the vehicles where there was no option,\" Rosekind said. \"There was not an available remedy.\"\n\nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

In August, two massive explosions in warehouses in the northern port of Tianjin, China, killed more than a hundred people, left hundreds more injured and devastated large areas of the city.\n\nWithout those charges the automaker would have earned a profit of $303 million for the quarter or 20 cents per share, meeting analyst expectations.\n\nIn July, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hit the automaker with civil penalties of $105 million for its poor track record of completing recall campaigns and also ordered the automaker to offer to repurchase about 200,000 Ram pickups and Dodge SUVs that failed to properly or quickly fix in recalls issued in 2013. Both the penalties and the buyback program were the largest ever levied by NHTSA.\n\nThe quarterly loss follows five consecutive profitable quarters for the automaker. Fiat Chrysler last reported a quarterly loss after the first three months of 2014, when it purchased 41.5% of the company shares previously owned by the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust.\n\nDespite those costs the automaker left its guidance for the year unchanged, saying it still expects to earn an adjusted net profit of $1.3 billion for the year and sell more than 4.8 million cars and trucks worldwide.\n\nFCA sold 1.11 million cars and trucks for the three month period ending Sept. 30, generating revenue of $30.4 billion. That compares with 1.09 million cars and trucks and $26 billion in revenue for the same period a year ago.\n\nThe automaker's North American division continues to be its best performing region in the world, largely because yearly industry sales are on pace to surpass 17 million vehicles for the first time in a decade.\n\nIn North America the automaker said it earned a pre-tax profit of $1.3 billion for the quarter, compared with $613 million for the same period last year.\n\nIn Europe the automaker earned a pre-tax profit of $20 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $59 million for the same period last year.\n\nIn South America the automaker's pre-tax profits fell to $28 million for the quarter, compared with $62 million last year.\n\nIn Asia the automaker reported a pre-tax loss of $91 million, compared with a profit of $187 million for the same period last year.\n\nThe earnings report is the first since the automaker's United Auto Workers union members ratified a new four-year contract and after it completed an initial public offering of Ferrari.\n\nThe new UAW contract provided signing bonuses and pay raises to both entry-level and longtime workers and is designed to eventually come close to eliminating the wage gap by giving entry-level workers a pathway up to $29 per hour.\n\nThe Ferrari IPO is designed to position the Maranello, Italy, brand known for Formula One racing as a standalone luxury brand and to generate funds to help fund FCA's five-year growth plan.\n\nFCA sold 18.89 million shares of the luxury automaker on Tuesday at $52 per share for $982.4 million. The shares sold at the top end of a range set at $48 to $52 per share for the IPO and traded at a high of $60.97 before closing yesterday at $53.85. The stock trades under the “RACE” symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nFCA plans to transfer its remaining 80% stake in the company to its own shareholders. The automaker also purchased 1.7 million, or 9%, of the shares sold during the IPO.\n\nToday, the automaker said Ferrari earned a pre-tax profit of $154 million during the third quarter, compared with a profit of $115 million for the same period last year.\n\nFerrari's profits rose because it sold 1,949 cars during the quarter, or about 300 more than the 1,612 it sold for the same period a year ago.\n\nFollow Detroit Free Press reporter Brent Snavely on Twitter @BrentSnavely.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/09/07/ford-f-150-toyota-prius-honey-smacks-warnings-recalls/1221174002/", "title": "This week's recalls and warnings: Ford F-150s, Toyota Prius and ...", "text": "Two vehicle recalls – one involving nearly 2 million Ford F-150 trucks and another on nearly 200,000 Toyota Prius hybrid vehicles – and an updated notice about Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal were the most noteworthy product warnings issued over the past week.\n\n• Ford F-150: Ford Motor is recalling nearly 2 million pickup trucks to fix a seatbelt defect that could trigger vehicle fires.

Hurricane Fiona, which already battered the Caribbean, is now forecast to brush by Bermuda today before slamming into eastern Canada on Saturday morning. Residents in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island are being warned to prepare for Fiona’s impact. The Category 4 storm, which has already claimed the lives of at least five people and knocked out power for millions this week, will bring damaging winds, high waves and heavy rainfall that may lead to prolonged power outages, local officials said. Several schools, government offices and other businesses in the region have closed today in preparation for the storm.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nOccupied parts of Ukraine are voting in “sham” referendums today on joining Russia. The referendums, which are illegal under international law, have been widely condemned by the West as illegitimate. Such a move could provide Moscow with a pretext to escalate its faltering invasion, which has seen Ukraine regain thousands of square miles of territory this month. The European Union has said it won’t recognize the results and has indicated it is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, backed the referendums in a recent address to the nation. Separately, long lines of traffic were reported at several of Russia’s major land borders, as Russian citizens attempt to flee the newly announced “partial mobilization.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:39 - Source: CNN Hospital overwhelmed with onslaught of Covid-19 patients\n\n3.

After a March 2019 fatal 737 Max crash, the SEC alleges that Boeing and Muilenburg knowingly misled the public about “slips” and “gaps” in the certification process of that flight control system.

Power's global automotive practice. \"We have more recalls now than we have ever had and yet the industry is selling more cars than ever.\"\n\nLegendary consumer safety advocate Ralph Nader said the industry has improved, but continues to get away with cutting corners that harm consumers and the environment.\n\n\"Today, the cars are much safer, less polluting, modestly more fuel efficient ... but there is still a long way to go,\" Nader said Thursday, as he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. \"We’ve ceased to see just carelessness, ignorance and indifference. These are increasingly criminal acts, now prosecuted because there is no criminal penalty in the motor vehicle safety law.\"\n\nErik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan, argues that the long list of recent investigations and recalls has damaged the image of the U.S. auto industry just as automakers need to recruit young, talented engineers to develop autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"Automakers have progressed from occasional, seemingly innocent mistakes and low-profile recalls to endless, high-profile recalls that resulted from decisions to save money, to cover-ups top-level executives blamed on lower-level engineers, to cover-ups suspected of going all they way to the top and claims of paying dealers to lie about sales,\" Gordon said.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans are buying more new cars and trucks than ever before at historically high prices. Last year, automakers sold more than 17.47 million new cars and trucks -- the most in U.S. history -- and this year, sales are on track to match that record.\n\nHandling a crisis\n\nDuring the past six years, as U.S. sales steadily rebounded from the depths of the Great Recession, the CEOs of General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen -- the world's three largest automakers -- all testified before congressional committees to defend decisions tied to safety lapses, fatal accidents and cheating on emissions testing.\n\nAlong the way, CEOs lost jobs, automakers overhauled corporate structures and others took steps to rethink safety processes and speed communication with regulators.\n\nSubscribe and get your\n\nfirst 4 months\n\nfor\n\n50% OFF\n\nClick below to unlock your offer\n\nUNLOCK MY 50% OFF\n\nNow, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice for the way it reports monthly sales of cars and trucks.\n\nThe good news for FCA? Recent history suggests FCA's reputation can survive if it manages the crisis with the right amount of contrition and transparency.\n\nWhat Takata air bag recall?\n\nThe automotive industry is currently in the midst of the largest recall in U.S. history and the general public seems largely unaware or concerned.\n\nThe Takata air bag recall affects 32 million vehicles made by 33 automotive brands. The media focuses on the recall as federal regulators issue dire warnings and automakers send millions of recall notices directly to owners.\n\nAnd yet, the recall has the lowest general awareness of current events and issues at just 52%, according to a recent study by Kelley Blue Book that surveyed 1,000 respondents in June. That's a lower awareness than the Zika virus, at 84%, or Hillary Clinton’s e-mail issue at 87%.\n\nThe low awareness is despite the potential danger of spraying shrapnel caused by defective air bag inflators when the air bag goes off. At least 10 deaths and more than 100 injuries have been tied to the defect.\n\n“Consumer opinions on the Takata air bag recall seem to be another unfortunate case of people thinking ‘it won’t happen to me,’ but this is easily the largest, most expensive automotive safety issue in U.S. history,\" said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book.\n\nTo be sure, Takata, as a company, might not survive its crisis. The company is bleeding money and many automakers are moving work away from Takata to different airbag suppliers. Takata has been working on a restructuring plan and is said to be open to selling to a private equity firm or another company, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nStill, only a quarter of respondents in the Kelley Blue Book survey said they think the Takata air bag recall is very or extremely important.\n\nToyota flubs crisis response, but recovers\n\nToyota President and Chief Executive Officer Akio Toyoda, left, and North America president Yoshimi Inaba testify on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2010, before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Toyota. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP)\n\nToyota was initially slow to react in 2009 when an off-duty state trooper and three members of his family died in fatal car crash when the gas pedal got stuck in the floor mat. The crash was recorded in a horrifying 911 call.\n\nEventually, the Japanese automaker recalled 8.1 million vehicles and CEO Akio Toyoda testified before Congress.\n\nSeveral years later, Toyota was forced to agree to pay $1.2 billion in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, largely because it initially concealed information about defects from consumers and government officials.\n\nThe crisis had a massive impact on the company. Toyota realized that the structure of its company, characterized by top-down management directed from Tokyo, hindered its ability to make decisions quickly and to manage the public relations crisis. Toyota overhauled its global structure, appointed clear leaders in each of its main global regions and provided them with greater decision-making capability.\n\nToyota's U.S. market share plummeted to a low of 12.9% in 2011 from 17% in 2009 -- a massive drop considering the usual slow pace of market share gains and losses in the industry. But the market share drop was largely because of a 2011 tsunami in Japan that stopped production at a number of its plants and decimated the automaker's inventory.\n\nIn 2012, as Toyota launched new cars and trucks, its market share rebounded to 14.4% and has remained relatively steady since.\n\nGM handles ignition-switch crisis\n\nSenate Consumer Protection subcommittee Chair Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., holds up a document as she questions General Motors CEO Mary Barra on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, April 2, 2014, during the subcommittee's hearing on General Motors. McCaskill said the new GM, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, had ample time to recall cars equipped with a faulty ignition switch that is linked to at least 13 deaths. GM began recalling the cars this February. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)\n\nGM's decision in 2014 to recall 2.6 million older-model cars with faulty ignition switches touched off a firestorm of criticism from safety advocates, Congress and the media.\n\nDocuments showed at least some engineers knew about problems with the design of an ignition switch for years before the automaker finally recalled the vehicles and 124 deaths were ultimately linked to the faulty design.\n\nBut GM avoided many of the mistakes made two years earlier by Toyota. GM CEO Mary Barra held town hall meetings with employees urging them to take the safety lapses seriously and to change the way the company operates.\n\nBarra also apologized before Congress and apologized in a four-minute video even though some legal experts said it was risky, from a liability standpoint. GM overhauled how safety is monitored within the company, dramatically ramped up recalls of vehicles for other issues and set up a victims compensation fund overseen by Kenneth Feinberg, a respected attorney.\n\nDespite the controversy, GM's sales increased 5.3% in 2014 -- just shy of the overall industry's 5.9% -- and the automaker's market share remained virtually unchanged.\n\nBy the end of 2014, Fortune Magazine named Barra \"Crisis manager of the year,\" and said \"Barra made herself the focal point of a company in crisis — and in doing so, she may have saved an American icon from going further down a self-destructive spiral.\"\n\nVolkswagen faces serious damage\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 08: Volkswagen Group of America President and CEO Michael Horn (R) makes a brief statement to reporters before testifying to the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill October 8, 2015 in Washington, DC. Horn was questioned by members of Congress about the origins and details behind Volkswagen's emissions scandal, which the company said involved the rigging of engines in 11 million diesel cars around the world to beat emissions tests. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)\n\nVolkswagen, unlike other automakers that managed to survive scandals, is more likely to suffer long damage to its reputation and sales.\n\nOn Wednesday, Volkswagen Group raised the estimated tab on its diesel emissions scandal to a total approaching $20 billion. The German automaker said \"legal risks predominately arising in North America\" would add $2.4 billion to a bill that already totaled an estimated $17.8 billion.\n\nVolkswagen last month agreed to pay up to $10 billion for vehicle buybacks and loss compensation to consumers, $2.7 billion in environmental mitigation, $2 billion on clean-emissions infrastructure and $603 million to most states in a sweeping settlement that must still be approved by a federal judge.\n\nVW has admitted to inserting software in VW and Audi cars with 2-liter engines going back to 2009 that allows them to beat emissions tests.\n\nDamage to Volkswagen's image and sales have been more serious than the damage that Toyota and GM faced because its engineers intentionally designed software to cheat and because fuel efficient diesel engines are at the core of the German automaker's brand image, said J.D. Power's Humphrey.\n\n\"They have a long way to regain consumer trust,\" he said.\n\nVolkswagen's U.S. sales have dropped 8.4% over the first six months of this year while overall industry sales have increased 1.5%.\n\nIn December, 58% of consumers said they have \"complete\" or \"general\" mistrust of VW’s integrity, according to a survey of 1,000 car shoppers conducted by Kelley Blue Book’s KBB.com and 63% said \"intentional deceit\" was the most troubling aspect of the issue.\n\nFCA tries to fend off investigation\n\nFCA is the latest automaker in the cross hairs of a potentially damaging investigation. FCA confirmed July 18 that it's under investigation by the SEC for the way it reports sales figures.\n\nBut if the U.S. government brings a case, Brauer and Humphrey expect FCA has a good shot at managing the crisis without lasting damage.\n\nFactors in FCA's favor include the reality that many automakers have fudged sales numbers over the years, Brauer said.\n\n\"It will come down to evidence and the extent to which Chrysler officially broke laws in trying to tabulate sales that were not real sales,\" Brauer said. \"And it's going to be fascinating. Because we all know this is rampant throughout the industry.\"\n\nSaid Humphrey: \"If it's all about falsifying sales to boost up numbers, I don’t think the public cares. It's an industry thing. Consumers will conclude that 'it doesn’t have to do with … the quality of my car.' \"\n\nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @BrentSnavely.

Quality problems with that launch cost the company billions and played a big role in the departure of two executives.\n\n“There’s a lot riding on it,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Cox Automotive. “Ford has had its troubles with launches and now added to that there are all of these supply chain issues.”\n\nVirtually all automakers have had to scale back production of new vehicles due to a shortage of computer chips and other parts and materials, often temporarily shutting factories. Those production bottlenecks have led to limited supply of vehicles, which in turn has resulted in record high car prices for consumers.\n\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of the company’s founder and the executive chairman of the automaker, compared the importance of the F-150 Lightning to the most important vehicle in the company’s history.\n\n“The Model T over 100 years ago brought cars to everybody. Well, this vehicle will bring electric vehicles, particularly electric trucks, to everybody,” he told CNN’s Richard Quest Tuesday.\n\nKrebs said she think that’s overstating the importance of the Lightning, but she agreed it is a breakthrough vehicle for the shift to electric vehicles on which Ford and other automakers are betting tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe Lightning is not the first electric pickup to hit the market. Upstart Rivian, which makes nothing but electric vehicles, started production of its R1T pickup last fall, but has built only about 3,500 in its first six months of production.

Later, the agency said that only the owners of vehicles under three specific recalls that have not yet had their vehicle fixed are eligible. Fiat Chrysler says that number is less than 200,000.\n\nTo be fair, the automaker has had little time to inform its dealers or even develop the buyback program. Three of the automakers top executives signed a complicated, 37-page legal agreement with NHTSA on Friday, and the buyback program barely fills a half-page of the agreement.\n\nFew others inside the company knew anything about the deal until Monday morning. That means the automaker's marketing staff was unable to even begin developing the program or telling dealers about it until it was announced.\n\nBecause of the intense interest, we asked NHTSA also provide answers to seven key questions about the buyback program:\n\nQuestion: How does this program work? In other words, should owners call dealers or should they wait for a notice in the mail telling them they are eligible?\n\nAnswer. The consent order requires Fiat Chrysler to notify affected owners within 60 days, during which time NHTSA expects Fiat Chrysler will develop detailed procedures for meeting its obligations.\n\nQ: Will the owners receive a check from Fiat Chrysler for the vehicle? Or, how exactly will the payment be made?\n\nA. That's a question better directed to Fiat Chrysler, but Fiat Chrysler is required to pay owners for their vehicles.\n\nQ. Can then then use that money to buy any vehicle from any automaker/dealer?\n\nA. Fiat Chrysler is required to pay vehicle owners for their vehicles; owners will have no restrictions on how they use that money.\n\nQ. How, exactly, is the value of the vehicle to be determined?\n\nA. The consent order requires Fiat Chrysler to \"refund the purchase price paid by the first purchaser of the vehicle for purposes other than resale, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation, and not including the cost of modifications made to the vehicle after the first retail sale. Fiat Chrysler will additionally offer a premium of 10% above the purchase price to any owner of an unremedied vehicle.\n\nQ. Where can owners go to get more information about the buyback program?\n\nA. Fiat Chrysler will provide additional information when it notifies eligible owners. In addition, owners with questions can go to safercar.gov/rs/chrysler/, where they can read the consent order and see other information about NHTSA's enforcement action. We plan to post a Frequently Asked Questions document on that page shortly.\n\nQ. If their vehicle has already been fixed under the recall in question, are they still eligible for the buyback program?\n\nA. Unremedied vehicles are eligible for buybacks.\n\nQ. Fiat Chrysler says there is already an approved remedy for all three recalls that are part of the buyback program. If there is already an approved remedy, why is NHTSA requiring the automaker to conduct a buyback program?\n\nA. As NHTSA outlined in its July 2 hearing, NHTSA has continually received complaints from vehicle owners that they have attempted to receive a remedy, only to be told by dealers that parts are not available....NHTSA has complaints as recent as May 2015, more than two years after the recall was issued, that parts are still not available...., NHTSA is authorized to order the manufacturer to buy back those vehicles, and the agency is using that authority in this case.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/07/20/chrysler-trouble/87323816/", "title": "Fiat Chrysler can't seem to stay out of hot water", "text": "Brent Snavely\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\n\n\nFor some reason, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles can't seem to keep itself out of trouble.\n\nJust when one dust-up with the government dies down, it seems another problem pops up.\n\nFiat Chrysler is now entwined in what could become its biggest problem in recent years -— a federal fraud investigation revealed this week into how the automaker reports sales figures. It's hard to tell how long the investigation will take, or if the government will bring any charges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are both asking questions.\n\nOver the past three years, the automaker has fought with automotive regulators and consumer safety groups. It was in an unflattering spotlight a year ago after some engineers remotely hacked a Jeep Cherokee, and last month actor Anton Yelchin was crushed by a Jeep Grand Cherokee that was part of a recent recall.\n\nUntil now, the automaker has escaped a full-blown crisis on the scale of Volkswagen's emission cheating scandal or the ignition switch recall that engulfed General Motors in congressional hearings and lawsuits for more than a year.\n\nBut we can revisit five of FCA's recent skirmishes with regulators, legal battles and other odd brushes with national and international controversy.\n\n•CEO takes on NHTSA, later agrees to limited \"safety campaign\": In June 2013, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it would not recall 2.7 million Jeeps that the government said were defective and prone to fires because of rear-mounted fuel tanks.\n\nThe move, which followed a two-year NHTSA investigation, was viewed as highly unusual. Safety advocates railed against the company and the issue generated national news coverage. After several tense weeks, FCA agreed to conduct a \"safety campaign\" for 1.56 million Jeeps to install trailer hitches for added protection, but it still denies a defect exists.\n\nSafety advocates criticized the remedy as inadequate, but the issue largely faded away after the agreement was reached. Until...\n\n•NHTSA lambastes Fiat Chrysler for slow recalls: In July 2014, NHTSA publicly called out Fiat Chrysler for its slow rate of recall repairs. In other words, Fiat Chrysler was agreeing to recall cars and trucks and was issuing notifications to customers, but it often didn't have the parts available to actually fix the cars. NHTSA took action after it discovered Fiat Chrysler was, in its opinion, slowly repairing the Jeep SUVs with rear-mounted fuel tanks.\n\nNHTSA concludes Fiat Chrysler's recall repair rate was unacceptable for more than two dozen recall campaigns covering 11 million vehicles. The result: Fiat Chrysler agreed to pay fines and penalties of up to $105 million and agreed to buy back nearly 200,000 Ram pickups and Dodge SUVs.\n\nAt about this time, Marchionne started saying Fiat Chrysler must adjust to a new, more aggressive regulatory environment when it comes to safety and recalls.\n\n•$150-million Jeep verdict: In April, 2015 a jury awarded $150 million to the family of a child killed in an accident involving a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee that caught fire after it was hit from behind. At the time, the lawsuit sparked speculation that the huge award would spark more lawsuits, potentially exposing Fiat Chrysler to more costly jury awards. So far, that hasn't happened.\n\n•Jeep Cherokee hacked:Wired Magazine published a story last July that explained how two computer-security engineers were able to remotely hack into a Jeep Cherokee and take control over the vehicle.\n\nThe report came at a time when awareness of cyber security issues was emerging as a hot topic in the automotive industry. Both regulators and politicians immediately urged the automaker to take action.\n\nFiat Chrysler stressed that it is unaware of any real-world case where one of its vehicles was hacked. Still, the automaker rapidly developed a patch of its infotainment system and recalled 1.4 million vehicles so dealers could install the fix.\n\n•Rising movie star is crushed by Jeep Grand Cherokee: Anton Yelchin, well-known for playing Chekov in recent Star Trek movies, was crushed by his own 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee in June.\n\nThe accident instantly gained worldwide attention because of the popularity of Yelchin, who will star in Star Trek Beyond when it reaches theaters later this month, and because the Jeep is among those FCA had recalled because of a shifter that consumers find confusing.\n\nMike Manley, head of the Jeep and Ram brands for Fiat Chrysler, expressed condolences for Yelchin and his family and said FCA would like its engineers to inspect the vehicle.\n\nYelchin's Jeep was among 1.1 million vehicles in North America that Fiat Chrysler said it would recall in April due to complaints from drivers who had trouble telling if they put the transmission in \"park\" after stopping. The recall includes model year 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees as well as 2012-2014 model year Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/20"}]}

She also was named defensive player of the year for the first time too this season and will be the centerpiece in which the Aces hope will be a title defense next year.\n\nLas Vegas will be attempting to do something that hasn't been done in the WNBA in 20 years. No team has won consecutive championships since the Los Angeles Sparks did it in 2001 and 2002.\n\n“You see it. You see it,” Wilson said. “This is what we’re building. This is what we’re doing. This is it. I’m so happy right now.”\n\nWilson has been the face of the franchise since she was drafted No. 1 by the Aces in 2018. She led the team to the WNBA Finals in 2020 before they were swept by Seattle.\n\nNow she has a WNBA championship to go along with a NCAA title she won while starring for South Carolina as well as an Olympic gold medal.\n\nBesides their MVP, other key players the Aces have signed for the next few seasons included WNBA Finals MVP Chelsea Gray and backcourt mate Kelsey Plum.\n\n“Knowing that we have commitment for next season is special,” Gray said. “We’re doing it for each other and it’s created a bond.”\n\nThat bond starts at the top with Las Vegas Aces owner Mark Davis. He's invested heavily in the team on and off the court since he bought it in 2021. He lured Becky Hammon from the NBA by making her the first WNBA coach to have a $1-million-a-year contract and is building a brand new practice facility.\n\n“In Vegas, we are trying to build a culture that players want to come and take part in something special, something bigger than themselves,” said Hammon, named coach of the year as she led the Aces to the title in her first year.\n\nHammon became the first rookie coach to win a WNBA championship.\n\nShe knows the history of the franchise, starring as a player from 2007-14. The team was swept in the 2008 WNBA Finals. Now the organization is celebrating a championship.\n\n“I don’t know, it’s actually hard to put into words right now,\" Hammon said. “A little surreal. You know, when I took the job in December, I thought when I started kind of breaking down their rosters that I could do something with it. I had a vision of what I wanted to do with this team.”\n\nHammon's vision culminated with a title this year and there could be more on the horizon.\n\n___\n\nMore WNBA playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-playoffs and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/mercury/2021/10/09/after-seven-year-wait-phoenix-mercury-earn-shot-fourth-wnba-title/6074229001/", "title": "After seven-year wait, Phoenix Mercury earn shot at fourth WNBA title", "text": "When the Phoenix Mercury won three WNBA titles in eight years from 2007-14, a league record-tying fourth seemed just around the corner.\n\nDiana Taurasi was in her prime and Brittney Griner still a young pro but already with one championship. Ditto for Sandy Brondello, winning it all in her first season as Mercury head coach. The Mercury were coming off arguably the most dominant season in WNBA history (29-5 regular season, 7-1 in playoffs).\n\nThen Taurasi opted to jump off the year-round basketball cycle and played solely in Russia in 2014-15. It was for that season and symbolically beyond a tipping point. The Mercury still reached the WNBA playoff final four from 2015-18 but not the Finals then in 2019-20 exited in the first or second round.\n\nThere was little about the pre-Olympic portion of this season that lent hope of a championship run. Taurasi, now 39, missed 12 games due to injury from May-July when the Mercury were 9-10 including an embarrassing 99-68 loss to Minnesota on July 3.\n\nThen came the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nTaurasi, Griner and Skylar Diggins-Smith won gold medals and most importantly Taurasi came back healthy when WNBA play resumed Aug. 15. The Mercury went on a 10-game win streak, second longest in team history. Though Taurasi suffered an ankle injury Sept. 6 that contributed to three competitive losses to contenders ending the regular season, there was reason for optimism going into a postseason even as the No. 5 seed without benefit of a bye for a sixth straight year.\n\n\"Before the break, we always talk about that was a whole different season,\" Diggins-Smith said. \"When we came back, we vowed to each other that we were going to put in an effort to get ourselves in a great position for playoffs. This tournament isn't built for five seeds to make the championship. Only ones and twos ever make the championship. We knew it was going to be tough, the position we were in.\"\n\nBut the Mercury found just enough to get it done.\n\nThey are 3-0 in elimination games, winning all by five points or fewer (one in overtime) and 5-2 overall to return to the Finals for the first time since 2014 starting Sunday against No. 6 seed Chicago. The Sky and Mercury left No. 1 Connecticut and No. 2 Las Vegas in their wake in the semifinals, a sign of the league's elite depth given no expansion for more than a decade.\n\nSix teams were capable of reaching the Finals and the lowest seeded of those did, an oddity of sorts that creates a rematch of the 2014 Finals that the Mercury won 3-0 over the Sky.\n\nPhoenix also is 3-0 against Chicago this season but only one of those games was played after the Olympics, a 103-83 win on Aug. 31. Taurasi missed the first two meetings, which the Mercury won by one and three (overtime) points.\n\nThe Sky are healthier than they've been all season and with two additional days of rest, not having played since Wednesday. They have five players averaging double-figure scoring led by wing Kahleah Copper at 18.2.\n\nChicago's star attraction is forward Candace Parker, a two-time WNBA MVP and 2016 champion while with Los Angeles. She is in her first season with the Sky, signing as a free agent to return to her metro hometown where she was two-time USA Today national high school Player of the Year.\n\n\"Chicago is playing really good ball,\" said Brondello, whose husband Olaf Lange is a Sky assistant coach. \"I've watched a lot of their games before our games. They're peaking at the right time. Everyone picked them to win it I think, they had talented players but sometimes it just takes time to jell. Their guards are dangerous but also their post depth can stretch you out. It's a big challenge for us, but we just have to get ready with a short turnaround. Hopefully we'll make this a good series that we can have success and win that championship.\"\n\nThe Mercury are without starting wing Kia Nurse (knee) for the rest of the season and perhaps Sophie Cunningham (calf) at least for Game 1. Shey Peddy will continue in the starting lineup in place of Nurse.\n\nTaurasi goes into the Finals as a second-time parent. Her wife Penny Taylor gave birth to their daughter at 4:24 a.m. Saturday, roughly 8 1/2 hours after Game 5 in Las Vegas. Taurasi left immediately after leading the Mercury comeback in the fourth quarter to an 87-84 win and was with Taylor for the delivery.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns fell just short of their first NBA title, losing 4-2 to Milwaukee in the Finals in July. The Suns/Mercury are the first NBA/WNBA teams from the same city to make the Finals in the same year since the Los Angeles Lakers/Sparks in 2001 and 2002.\n\nThe symbiotic love between the Mercury and Suns will carry into the Finals.\n\nA second WNBA/NBA doubleheader (separately ticketed) will be held Wednesday with the Suns-Portland preseason game at 2 p.m. and Mercury-Sky Game 2 at 6 p.m. Like Chris Paul last week during the semifinals, Suns center Deandre Ayton purchased 500 tickets for the Finals Game 1 that will be distributed to fans at the arena plaza starting at 10:30 a.m. Sunday.\n\nWNBA Finals\n\nSunday: Chicago at Phoenix, noon, ABC\n\nWednesday: Chicago at Phoenix, 6 p.m., ESPN\n\nFriday: Phoenix at Chicago, 6 p.m. ESPN2\n\nOct. 17 (if necessary): Phoenix at Chicago, noon, ESPN\n\nOct. 19 (if necessary): Chicago at Phoenix, 6 p.m., ESPN2\n\nWNBA Finals seedings\n\n2016: No. 1 Minnesota vs. No. 2 Los Angeles (Sparks champion)\n\n2017: No. 1 Minnesota vs. No. 2 Los Angeles (Lynx champion)\n\n2018: No. 1 Seattle vs No. 3 Washington (Storm champion)\n\n2019: No. 1 Washington vs. No. 2 Connecticut (Mystics champion)\n\n2020: No. 1 Las Vegas vs. No. 2 Seattle (Storm champion)\n\n2021: No. 5 Phoenix vs. No. 6 Chicago\n\nUp next\n\nChicago Sky at Phoenix Mercury, noon Sunday, Footprint Center, Channel 15 (ABC) — The Mercury (19-13, 5-2 playoffs) host Chicago (16-16, 5-1) in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals, a rematch of 2014 when Phoenix won 3-0 for its third championship (the defunct Houston Comets, Minnesota and Seattle have won four).

She did just that, leading the Sky to the franchise’s first title.\n\nAllie Quigley scored 26 points and Parker added 16 points, 13 rebounds and five assists and Chicago beat the Phoenix Mercury 80-74 on Sunday in Game 4.\n\n“This one is so sweet,” a champagne-soaked Parker said. “To do it with this group. I love this group, I love this team. And to do it here at home, it was just supposed to be.”\n\nCourtney Vandersloot added 10 points and 15 assists for the Sky, who won the series 3-1, rallying from a 72-65 deficit with 4:42 left. Chicago scored the next nine points to take a two-point lead on Stefanie Dolson’s layup. She then added another basket to make it 76-72 with 45.8 seconds left.\n\nDiana Taurasi was fouled on the next possession shooting a 3-pointer and made the first two free throws, but missed the third. Vandersloot then scored in the lane to seal the victory and set off the celebration.\n\nAs the final buzzer sounded, Parker sprinted to the corner of the court and hugged her family with tears in her eyes.\n\n“It was amazing to just hug my dad and my mom,” Parker said. “It was just an amazing feeling to be from here and see so many people in the stands that have been supporting you since you started. It’s just a moment where you just have to really take it in.”\n\nIt was a full-circle moment for Parker, who triumphantly returned home to Chicago this season after spending 13 years with Los Angeles. She has been continually called the Sky’s missing piece throughout the playoffs, a label she proved accurate many times during Chicago’s stunning run, winning the title as a six-seed.\n\n“It feels amazing. My high school coach is here,” Parker said. “I know Pat’s (Summitt) watching. Got the whole city here. We got the whole city here. We are champions for life now.”\n\nBrittney Griner was a focal point of Phoenix’s offense early on. The seven-time All-Star finished the game with 28 points, 18 of which came in the first half. Griner and guard Skylar Diggins-Smith helped lead a 9-0 run to finish the second quarter and give Phoenix a 44-37 edge at halftime.\n\nYet, Quigley’s fourth-quarter outburst ultimately undid any attempts Phoenix could make to stave off elimination.\n\n“It wasn’t our night,” Phoenix coach Sandy Brondello said. “Allie made some really big shots for them. We left her open, and she made them. It would be nice to be going back to a Game 5 now, but it’s not going to happen this year.”\n\nThe Phoenix Mercury players declined to come to the postgame press conference.\n\nParker initially had trouble getting into a rhythm offensively, going one for six from the floor with just four points by the end of the first half.\n\nPhoenix’s lead stretched to 14 at one point in the third, but the deficit wasn’t big enough to shake Chicago’s confidence down the stretch.\n\n“We stayed together,” Sky coach James Wade said. “It was a microcosm of our season, where you go down and you keep pushing. By the end of it, the crowd took over, our players stayed together and you started to see who we were. I never doubted for a minute that we were going to win that game.”\n\nKahleah Copper, who had been a force in the first four games of the finals, earned MVP honors of the championship.\n\n“I have this edginess and grittiness about me that’s going to keep me going,” Copper said. “It was very important for me to be consistent coming in this year and better than I was last year. You put the work in and you get rewarded.”\n\nANOTHER PICTURE\n\nAfter the game, Parker mentioned a picture she took with her daughter on the court after she won her first championship with Los Angeles. She keeps the photo on her wall, and her daughter’s desire to be part of a similar moment helped convince Parker to come back home.\n\n“I asked her if it was OK if I came to Chicago,” Parker said. “And she was like ‘I want another picture like that.’ It’s crazy, because she came out to the court and said ‘we did it,’ and it was just surreal.”\n\nGETTING TECHNICAL\n\nEmotions were high for both teams right from the start, as Taurasi and Sky forward Kahleah Copper were each hit with technical fouls within a 50-second span in the first quarter.\n\nPACKED HOUSE\n\nThe Sky drew a sell-out crowd despite the Chicago Bears hosting the rival Green Bay Packers just down the street at Soldier Field.

Las Vegas beats Connecticut Sun to win first WNBA championship\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get top sports headlines delivered daily\n\nFor anyone who is still dismissing or ridiculing women’s sports, you are now an outlier.\n\nTV ratings are spiking, for both professional and NCAA women’s sports. Same for attendance; this weekend alone, Wisconsin volleyball set an NCAA regular-season record with 16,833 fans for its match against Florida on Friday night while a record 32,000 people turned out for the San Diego Wave’s game against Angel City FC on Saturday, the first in its new stadium.\n\nThat increase in interest presents a massive financial opportunity. For the owners and organizations savvy enough to recognize it, that is.\n\nDavis is one of those owners.\n\nWith his, and his family’s, long history in the NFL, Davis is not in the business of owning a team for funsies. He wants to, as his father Al used to say, “Just win, baby,” and he recognized it was going to take money and a few bold moves to do it.\n\nHe convinced longtime NCAA coach Nikki Fargas to leave the college game and become team president. He spent big to lure Becky Hammon back to the WNBA after eight years in the NBA as an assistant to San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, making her the league’s first seven-figure coach. The team’s GM is Hall of Famer Natalie Williams.\n\n\"What Becky has accomplished in her first year it’s pretty extraordinary. And Nikki and Natalie,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis signed off on a maximum contract for Wilson, who won her second MVP this season along with defensive player of the year honors. Kelsey Plum, Chelsea Gray, Dearica Hamby and Jackie Young all got extensions during the season, ensuring that the team’s core remains intact.\n\nNo one can question that it was money very well spent. The Aces had the best regular-season record, and nearly swept all the individual awards.\n\nNow they have the prize that really matters.\n\n“Man,” Wilson said after the game. “We champs! We champs! We champs!”\n\nIt’s one thing to build a team that can contend for one title, however, and another to build an organization that can do it year in and year out. By doing the latter, Davis and the Aces are going to force the rest of the WNBA to step up their games.\n\nThough the WNBA is in its 26th season, it still often operates as if it’s grateful for whatever it gets. Players fly commercial during the regular season and early rounds of the playoffs. Three of the first four games of the WNBA Finals went head-to-head against the NFL, including Game 1 last Sunday, which just happened to be the first full day of the NFL season.\n\nNo surprise then that, despite being on ABC, Game 1 had lower ratings than Games 2 and 3, which were on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nBut Davis, much like the owners of the San Diego Wave, Angel City FC and Kansas City Current in the NWSL, is not content with crumbs. Nor will he settle until the league and every other owner, be they of existing franchises or those looking to join in the party, shares his attitude.\n\n“Even before we talk about expansion, we’ve got to make sure the franchises are on solid footing and willing to make the investment to create a greater league. Because I think we’re on the rise,” Davis told USA TODAY Sports afterward. “I think as we get more and more exposure and people understand how it is, they’re going to buy into WNBA basketball.\n\n“I know I’m going to be pushing for a lot of different things. And I’ll get fined for some of them,” he added. “(But) our franchise is going to be a standard bearer.”\n\nA state-of-the-art practice facility is under construction at a complex the Aces will share with the Raiders. Davis is also building an alumni organization similar to what the Raiders have long had – Hammon’s first meeting with Davis and Fargas came when the Aces retired her jersey last season – so players will feel as if they’re part of something larger than the current team.\n\nPut it together, and Las Vegas will soon be, if it’s not already, a destination.\n\n“When you have an owner like Mark so dialed in and trustworthy of you and figuring out what can we do better, how can we do more or get people wanting to come to Vegas or just wanting to play better, the sky is the limit for our franchise,” Wilson said.\n\nNot only for the players. As corporate sponsors increasingly look for ways to align themselves with women and women’s sports, the Aces will be a very attractive partner. It doesn’t hurt that, in a city where professional sports are still in their infancy, the Aces are the first to win a title.\n\n“We’ll always be No. 1, and now it’s up to the Raiders and Knights to bring some more,” Davis said. “But the Las Vegas Aces are No. 1.”\n\nDon't be surprised if they stay there awhile.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/basketball/wnba/fever/2015/09/30/how-the-fever-are-going-to-win-wnba-finals/73085472/", "title": "How the Indiana Fever are going to win the WNBA Finals", "text": "Dana Hunsinger Benbow\n\ndana.benbow@indystar.com\n\nThe film was about to come out. And come out quickly.\n\nGame film of the Minnesota Lynx.\n\nIndiana Fever coach Stephanie White had just stepped off the plane Wednesday in Indianapolis -- the morning after her team clinched a spot in the WNBA Finals -- and was ready with a plan for winning the championship title.\n\nFind the Lynx' vulnerability, White said, and that starts with watching film.\n\n\"Trying to find a way to challenge Minnesota to make everything difficult for them,\" said White, who is the first rookie WNBA coach to lead a team to the Finals. \"When we think about our defensive game plan, we certainly know they have five Olympians and we just can't allow them to do what they do quite so easily.\"\n\nWhite was talking aggressively. The Fever have \"to be disruptive,\" she said.\n\n\"We'll try to find those little chinks in the armor,\" White said, \"and then we'll find out how we can attack them on offense.\"\n\nWhite and the team were met by a crowd of more than 100 at Indianapolis International Airport, screaming fans, loud music and an emcee announcing their arrival.\n\n\"All season long, you guys have believed in us,\" said Fever forward Tamika Catchings to the crowd. \"(This is ) kind of like a repeat. That's what we're going for.\"\n\nThat repeat Catchings is referring to is a repeat of 2012, when the Fever won its last -- and only -- WNBA title against the Lynx. The Fever were the underdogs going into that series but beat Minnesota in four games of the best-of-five format.\n\n\"We're flashing back to 2012. It's all lined up in the cards,\" said Cindy Stantz, who drove from Greencastle to greet the team Wednesday morning. \"Everything is lining up like it did in the past.\"\n\nThere is one difference this time around. Lin Dunn was coaching the team in 2012, but Catchings has no doubt that White can lead the Fever to the title.\n\n\"I can't say enough about our team, the resilience that we've showed all year long. Always rising to the occasion, Catchings said. \"Stephanie continues to challenge us every single day, every single opportunity.\"\n\nLike Game 2 when the Fever were down by double digits at the half.\n\n\"She challenged us,\" Catchings said. \"'If this is your last game, is this how you want to go out?'\"\n\nThe team stepped up and rallied back to the win, taking the series to the final Game 3 Tuesday, which the Fever won 66-51.\n\n\"I had a feeling that we were going to do it this year,\" said Angelique Hughes-Johnson, a fan at the airport cheering on the team. \"We have a great team, a great coach and there is nothing to stop us.\"\n\nWhite agreed as she rallied the crowd.\n\n\"It's been an incredible ride,\" she said, \"But we ain't done.\"\n\nFollow Dana Benbow on Twitter: @DanaBenbow.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2022/09/15/wnba-finals-alyssa-thomas-triple-double-connecticut-sun-game-3/10393625002/", "title": "WNBA Finals: Alyssa Thomas triple-double powers Sun to Game 3 win", "text": "Alyssa Thomas (16 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists) recorded the first triple-double in WNBA Finals history and Connecticut finally found a way to cool off red-hot Las Vegas guard Chelsea Gray as the Sun won 105-76 at home Thursday night to force a Game 4.\n\n“They just kicked our ass in every way possible,” Aces coach Becky Hammon said. “If there was a stat on mental toughness and physicality, they would have kicked us there, too.”\n\nBut before Connecticut won its fourth elimination game of the 2022 postseason, there were scoring runs — a whole lot of them.\n\nAfter Vegas jumped out to a 9-2 lead, Connecticut reeled off a 25-4 run to end the first quarter, building as much as a 23-point lead in the first half. The Sun weathered an Aces run right before the break that cut the lead to nine, then scored three quick baskets to open the fourth quarter and close out the win. With the Sun firmly in control with less than five minutes to play, Hammon pulled her starters. Game 4 will tip Sunday at 4 p.m. ET. The Aces still lead the series 2-1. Both franchises are seeking their first WNBA title.\n\nWNBA playoffs 2022:How Sun and Aces got here\n\nSign up for our sports newsletter:All the sports news you need to know delivered right to you!\n\nThe real story Thursday night, though, was defense. In what might have been the adjustment of the series, Sun coach Curt Miller tapped 6-foot-4 Sun guard DeWanna Bonner — who has an impressive wingspan that stretches beyond her height — to check Gray.\n\nGray finished with 11 points and seven assists, but she did not score in the second half and only attempted seven shots all night. (Nine of Gray’s points came on three consecutive 3s she hit when Bonner was on the bench.)\n\nBonner’s length bothered Gray whenever they were matched up. She blanketed Gray, who was shooting a blistering 60.5% from the field in eight playoff games, averaging 23.3 points and 7.1 assists.\n\nBonner said she tried to “just stay locked in” when guarding Gray, using her length to “limit her from getting a clean look at the basket before she even got to her spots.”\n\n“I think it was a team effort,” Bonner said of slowing Gray. “Now we gotta figure out another game plan to do it again.”\n\nPerhaps more importantly, though, the veteran finally showed up offensively.\n\nAfter scoring just a combined five points in Games 1 and 2, Bonner totaled 18 points, to go with six rebounds, five assists and two steals.\n\n“She’s such a respected presence in our locker room,” Miller said of Bonner, who won two WNBA titles with the Phoenix Mercury. “It’s no secret she has championship pedigree. We have a group that really looks up to her. When she plays with energy and offensive efficiency, it gives the rest of our crew so much confidence.”\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas was dominant in every facet of the game; along with her triple-double she had two steals and a block. Her play energized her teammates — but they said Thomas can play even better, and will have to if Connecticut is to win Sunday and force a decisive Game 5.\n\n“She did all right tonight,” Bonner said, giving Thomas a sly look. “We need her to be great though.”\n\nA'ja Wilson scored 19 and was virtually unstoppable no matter how many defenders Connecticut sent at her, but the Sun dominated the paint, outscoring the Aces 64-26. Jonquel Jones, the 2021 MVP, had 20 points.\n\nSaid Miller: “We did a lot of things better, harder and more determined — with more confidence, more pace and more physicality.”\n\nJones said retired WNBA great Lisa Leslie, one of the most dominant centers in the history of women’s basketball, once told her that to win a WNBA championship, teams must score inside. Jones took the advice to heart.\n\n“That’s the MO of the playoffs, right? The team that wins the paint, wins the game,” Jones said.\n\nJackie Young led the Aces with 22 and Kelsey Plum chipped in 17. Connecticut’s bench also outscored Vegas 26-5. The Sun set a playoff record with 19 assists in the first half, and finished with 32 on 43 made baskets.\n\nAll-WNBA Teams revealed\n\nWilson, the 2022 MVP, along with Las Vegas guard Plum, Seattle forward Breanna Stewart, Chicago forward Candace Parker and Phoenix guard Skylar Diggins-Smith were named to the All-WNBA First Team on Thursday, each earning a $10,300 bonus.

(AP) — Breanna Stewart and Sue Bird helped Seattle finish off a dominant season with another championship.\n\nThe dynamic duo powered the Storm to their second title in three seasons. They both missed last year with injuries.\n\nStewart scored 26 points and Seattle completed a sweep of the Las Vegas Aces with a 92-59 rout Tuesday night. It was the biggest margin of victory in WNBA Finals history.\n\n“It doesn’t feel real we just won and that I was able to contribute the way I did,” said Bird, who averaged 11 assists for the three finals games. “Something when it's all said and done that I’m incredibly proud of.”\n\nIt’s the fourth title in franchise history for the Storm, who also won in 2004, 2010 and 2018. Seattle had pretty much the same core group that won the 2018 championship back for this year, led by Stewart, Bird and Jewell Loyd. The Storm joined Minnesota and Houston as the only franchises to win four championships.\n\nSeattle has now won a record 11 games in a row in the WNBA Finals, dating to the team's first championship in 2004. Bird has been a part of all of them. The veteran guard, who turns 40 next week, was once again a catalyst for the Storm.\n\nBird said she was most proud of the fact that she won it all with one franchise in three different decades.\n\n“There are core groups that have a two-, four-, six-, maybe 10-year run,\" she said. \"I’ve been here for technically 19 seasons, 17 I’ve played. To be able to recreate that magic with different groups.”\n\nBird, who had five points and seven assists in the clincher, said she hadn't thought about whether she'll come back next year.\n\n“Interestingly enough it's never a day of decision. I just kind of start working out and see how I feel,\" she said. \"I wish I could give you more. If the way I feel right now, if I go through my offseason and continue to build on that in a good way I don’t see why I won’t be playing next summer.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Stewart set a WNBA record by scoring more than 20 points for the sixth straight finals game. She was a unanimous choice as WNBA Finals MVP. It was the second time in her young career that she won the award, becoming the fifth player with multiple finals MVPs.\n\n“I wanted to win a ring, that was the priority. Whatever else comes, comes,\" Stewart said.\n\nHer play all season showed she had fully recovered from a torn Achilles tendon that sidelined her for the entire 2019 season.\n\n“She’s just one of those generational players that comes through once in a while that can face adversity and even get stronger because of it and that’s what we saw of her,” Seattle coach Gary Kloppenburg said. “She missed a whole year and came back as a better player in every category on both sides of the ball. Testament to her work ethic and desire to be such a great player.”\n\nStewart and Bird were both on the bench for most of the fourth quarter with the game well in hand. The 33-point margin of victory was the biggest in WNBA Finals history.\n\nThe team shared hugs at center court after the final buzzer as yellow and green confetti streamed down on them. After the on-court celebration, the league had the players' families on a video screen celebrating across the globe. Because the season was played in a bubble in Bradenton, Florida, the league only allowed each player to have one guest attend.\n\nA’ja Wilson, the league’s regular-season MVP, tried to keep the Aces alive. She had 14 of her 18 points in the first quarter, hitting five of her nine shots. She also took four of the team’s six free throws in the period. The Aces, who led the league by averaging more than 23 attempts in the regular season, only had five total in Game 2. Coach Bill Laimbeer voiced his displeasure that the team couldn’t get to the foul line on Sunday.\n\nDespite scoring the first seven points of the game, Las Vegas trailed 23-21 after one quarter after the Storm closed the period on an 11-2 run. Seattle then scored the first six points of the second. Stewart picked up her third foul early in the quarter and had to sit for the final 7-plus minutes.\n\nIt didn’t matter as Seattle extended its two-point advantage to 43-34 at the half.\n\nSeattle put the game away in the third quarter, scoring 12 of the first 14 points in the period.\n\nThe Aces' future is bright. The team was missing Liz Cambage and Kelsey Plum — starters from last year. Cambage was granted a medical exemption to skip playing this season. Plum tore her Achilles tendon.\n\n“I know it hurts. But end of the day you learn and grow from it,” Wilson said. “I know I grew from it. That’s a success in my book and I’m going to keep growing.”\n\nMISSING HAMBY: The Aces clearly could have used Sixth Woman of the Year Dearica Hamby in the series. She said Monday she had been dealing with a quad injury for the past two months and felt her right knee get injured in Game 3 of the semifinals against Connecticut. Hamby played through the injury to finish that game but didn't return. She said she most likely wouldn't need surgery. She averaged 13.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.7 steals during the regular season.\n\nWINLESS ANGEL: Angel McCoughtry came to Las Vegas this season after spending her entire career in Atlanta since getting drafted No. 1 in 2009.

The Commissioner’s Cup is a good sign of things to come with our league.”\n\nThey didn't look jet lagged at all, outscoring Connecticut 43-40 heading into the fourth quarter when none of them played. Seattle had a 28-point lead at that point.\n\nAfter the game ended, the team celebrated on the court as confetti rained down.\n\n“It's different because we don’t know how to feel. It is something big what our players just achieved,” Seattle coach Noelle Quinn said. “I loved the confetti, the trophy, it was like a playoff atmosphere and it was great for our league to add this.”\n\nThe in-season tournament saw Connecticut and Seattle finish as the top teams in the Eastern and Western Conferences.

I wanted to play my best, do my job.”\n\nDespite not having the entire team together until game day, Seattle jumped out to a 28-18 lead after the first quarter behind Stewart. She made five of her six shots in the period.\n\nThe Storm increased their lead to 46-35 at the half. Loyd got going in the third quarter as the Storm turned the game into a rout. She had seven of the team's 22 points in the period as Seattle held Connecticut to just five.\n\n“I thought they had their legs.

Ron DeSantis -- part of a series of moves by Republican governors to transport migrants to liberal enclaves to protest what they say are inadequate federal efforts on southern border security.\n\nMartha's Vineyard had not been expecting the group, and DeSantis' move was sharply denounced by the White House, migrants' advocates and Democratic officials.\n\nAt a church where they had been staying on Martha's Vineyard, migrants cheered Friday morning when they heard the Massachusetts government would shelter them at the Cape Cod military base. They boarded government-arranged buses willingly, officials said, and they arrived at the military installation Friday afternoon.\n\nJoint Base Cape Cod -- already an emergency shelter designated by the state emergency management agency -- is set up to provide \"a safe temporary accommodation appropriate for the needs of families and individuals,\" Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker's office said in a news release.\n\nThe migrants \"will be housed in dormitory-style spaces at JBCC, with separate spaces accommodating both individuals and families,\" and families will not be separated, it said. They will have access to services including legal, health care, food, hygiene kits, and crisis counseling, according to Baker's office.\n\nAt the base, some of the migrants from Venezuela received general information about US immigration laws, according to a migrant who spoke to CNN. At this time, CNN is unable to verify what exactly was shared or from whom due to lack of access.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of civil rights attorneys working with the migrants said their stories are \"heartbreaking -- and infuriating.\" Many of the migrants went to a hospital in need of care upon their arrival at the island Wednesday.\n\nSome of these migrants were sent to Martha's Vineyard even though they have immigration hearings scheduled nowhere near Massachusetts, the group said. Migrants released from government custody often move to other cities in the US as they go through their immigration proceedings.\n\n\"This cowardly political stunt has placed our clients in peril,\" the Lawyers for Civil Rights group said in a news release Friday. \"Some now have immigration hearings as early as Monday thousands of miles away.\"\n\nSome attorneys from the group accompanied the migrants on the buses to the Cape Cod base.\n\nCNN has reached out to Baker's office and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency for comment, as they are coordinating efforts to care for the migrants at the base.\n\nMigrants on Martha's Vineyard board buses Friday that took them to a military base on Cape Cod.\n\nFlights came from Texas, though Florida governor says he arranged them\n\nThough Florida's governor says he arranged for the flights, the migrants had been in Texas -- not Florida.\n\nWednesday's flights originated in San Antonio, Texas, according to the director of Martha Vineyard's airport, Geoffrey Freeman.\n\nFor months, DeSantis has been talking about his plans to get Florida involved in redirecting migrants from the southern border in a way to maximize heartburn for Democratic leaders. And last month, DeSantis telegraphed Florida might help move migrants from the US-Mexico border -- not from his state.\n\n\"We do have money to be able to do (that), but that's from people from the southern border, that's not going in the interior of Florida,\" DeSantis said at an August press conference.\n\nHis administration secured $12 million in the state budget to pay for migrant relocation, and he has repeatedly threatened to use the money to send them to liberal strongholds.\n\nWhen he laid out his immigration plans at a December news conference, DeSantis teased Martha's Vineyard as a potential destination, saying, \"It's somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it is true, if you sent (them) to Delaware or Martha's Vineyard or some of these places, the border would be secure the next day.\"\n\nMigrants on Martha's Vineyard boarded three buses Friday headed for Joint Base Cape Cod.\n\nIn a Friday news conference in Daytona Beach, DeSantis said he intends to use \"every penny\" of the $12 million and set the expectation for more buses and \"likely more\" flights with migrants paid for by Florida.\n\n\"These are just the beginning efforts,\" he said. The governor defended using taxpayer dollars to send the migrants to Martha's Vineyard because he said many of the people who cross the border end up in his state.\n\nState budget records show six days before the migrants were flown to Massachusetts, Florida's Department of Transportation paid $615,000 to Destin, Florida-based aviation company Vertol Systems as part of the governor's program to relocate migrants.\n\nBudget records do not detail what kind of \"contracted services\" Vertol provided the department, nor is it clear whether the $615,000 was for two flights to Martha's Vineyard. Additional budget records obtained by CNN also show the state first requested the payment on September 7.\n\nCNN reached out to Vertol Systems, the Department of Transportation and DeSantis' office but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nA Venezuelan migrant is led onto a bus Friday in Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard.\n\nCivil rights attorneys: Migrants didn't know they were going to Martha's Vineyard\n\nThe migrants on Wednesday's planes did not know they were being taken to Martha's Vineyard specifically, according to the legal group helping them.\n\nThey were induced to board the planes with \"representations of work assistance and immigration relief in Boston,\" the Lawyers for Civil Rights group said in a news release.\n\n\"Mid-flight, they were informed they were not going to Boston after all, but to Martha's Vineyard. They were dropped on the island without notice to anyone in the community,\" the news release reads.\n\nIn his Friday news conference, Florida's governor disputed the migrants did not know where they were going, because he said they had signed a waiver and had been provided with a packet including a map of Martha's Vineyard adding, \"It's obvious that's where they were going,\" and it was all \"voluntary.\"\n\nTwo of the migrants told CNN, while they were in San Antonio, they decided to go on the trip after two women and a man approached them on the streets near a migrant resource center.\n\nOne of the migrants, Wilmer Villazana, said he was put up in a hotel for five days before the flights and was well taken care of. The women told him they were from Orlando and worked for private organizations that raise funds to help migrants, Villazana said.\n\nOne of the women told Villazana and the other migrant, Yang Pablo Mora, they would get help with shelter and jobs once they arrived at their destination, Villazana and Mora said.\n\nVillazana and Mora did not know the flights were headed to Martha's Vineyard, they said. Villazana thought they were going to Boston, he said.\n\nWhite House denounces DeSantis' move\n\nDeSantis' decision to arrange the migrants' flight to Massachusetts was one of two high-profile transports sent north by southern Republican governors this week. On Thursday, two buses of migrants sent from Texas by Gov. Greg Abbott arrived outside Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in the nation's capital.\n\nTexas started busing migrants to Washington this spring . Arizona's Republican Gov.

Ron DeSantis has thrust Florida into an escalating battle between red state leaders and the Biden administration over the US-Mexico border and once again put himself at the forefront of a political cause that is animating Republican voters two months before the midterm elections.\n\nFor months, DeSantis has been plotting out loud his plans to get Florida involved in redirecting migrants from the border in a way that would maximize heartburn for Democratic leaders. His administration secured $12 million in the state budget to pay for migrant relocation and he has repeatedly threatened to use the money to send them to President Joe Biden's home state of Delaware, among other liberal strongholds.\n\nWhen he laid out his immigration agenda at a December news conference, DeSantis teased Martha's Vineyard as a potential destination, saying, \"It's somewhat tongue-in-cheek but it is true, if you sent to Delaware or Martha's Vineyard or some of these places, the border would be secure the next day.\" And last month, DeSantis telegraphed that Florida's involvement in moving migrants might start at the southern border, not with people who had arrived in his state.\n\n\"We do have money to be able to do (that), but that's from people from the southern border, that's not going in the interior of Florida,\" DeSantis said at an August press conference.\n\nStill, as the maneuver played out in real time -- with jarring images of an estimated 50 people, some who fled a brutal South American dictatorship, wandering an unfamiliar Northeastern vacation spot unprepared for their arrival -- it sent shockwaves through Florida and Massachusetts and rattled those left to deal with the fallout. And it served to put the country on notice that the reach of DeSantis, a hard-charging Republican leader who is weighing a campaign for president in 2024, already extends well beyond his state's boundaries.\n\n\"All those people in DC, and New York were beating their chests when (Donald) Trump was president, saying they were so proud to be sanctuary jurisdictions saying how bad it was to have a secure border,\" DeSantis said at a news conference Thursday morning. \"The minute even a small fraction of what those border towns deal with every day is brought to their front door, they all of a sudden go berserk.\"\n\n\"It just shows you...their virtue signaling is a fraud,\" said DeSantis, who's running for a second term in November.\n\nIn Massachusetts, where local officials scrambled to find accommodations for the migrants, Democratic leaders accused the Republican governor of orchestrating a political stunt with human lives.\n\n\"Think about the governor of Florida, one of the largest states in the nation, spending his time hatching a secret plot to ship up 50 immigrants here, families, some of them children as young as four, and use them as political pawns just so he can get on Tucker Carlson and beat his chest about how he's tough on immigration,\" Massachusetts state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, a Democrat, said Thursday morning on CNN.\n\n\"He is a coward, and the real story is the island community that has rallied to come together and support these people -- they represent the best of what America has to offer.\"\n\nIn Florida, the Democratic Party Chairman Manny Diaz called it \"a new low\" for the Florida governor. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist said, \"Everything Ron DeSantis does is to score political points with his hard right base in a thinly veiled attempt to run for President -- but it's Floridians who pay the price.\"\n\nThis is not the first time DeSantis has waded into the country's divisive immigration debate in a way that has maximized exposure for the Republican governor while costing taxpayers. In June of last year, DeSantis sent law enforcement to the southern border, insisting he had \"answered the call\" for help from Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona. A month later, DeSantis visited the border to hold a news conference with Abbott, and he paired it with a fundraising pitch to his supporters.\n\nThose actions earned DeSantis considerable praise from conservative commentators and didn't noticably hurt his political standing in his state, where one in five residents identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino. It remains to be seen if immigrant and Spanish-speaking communities will respond more negatively to DeSantis sending migrants, who were legally processed at the border, 2,000 miles to Massachusetts.\n\nMany of those on the planes to Martha's Vineyard said their country of origin was Venezuela, where millions of people are fleeing the oppressive regime of Nicolás Maduro. More than half the Venezuelans in the country are in Florida, according to a 2020 Migration Policy Institute report, with 109,000 just in the Miami metropolitan area. Political observers in Florida have noted the Venezuelan community's growing political clout in a state that is often won on the margins.\n\n\"We are here today to tell the Governor that no Hispanic, no immigrant, but in this case we, Venezuelans, are not pieces on his political boardgame to get headlines and to get political points in his quest to become the Republican nominee for the 2024 Presidential Election,\" said Adelys Ferro, director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, at a news conference Thursday in South Florida.\n\nIt is not clear if DeSantis and Abbott are coordinating efforts at the border, or competing. Abbot has bussed thousands of migrants to Democratic cities in recent weeks. The morning after the two planes landed in Martha's Vineyard, buses from Texas dropped off migrants outside the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC, where Vice President Kamala Harris resides.\n\nLike DeSantis, Abbott is running for reelection this year and is also a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. Earlier this summer, DeSantis was critical of Texas' response to the surge of migrants at the border, suggesting the Lone Star State shouldn't be letting them cross over to the US in the first place.\n\n\"What they need to do, Texas, should just send them back across the border,\" DeSantis said in June. \"You know, who cares what the feds are saying they're not doing their job. Or not let them come across the border to begin with because they go right across the river. They just walk right across. No one's stopping. So you know, some pushback I think would be good.\"\n\nDeSantis has also been recruiting more Republicans to join his hardline approach to border migration. In a widely followed speech in Arizona last month where he campaigned for Kari Lake, the Republican nominee for governor there, DeSantis hinted at more collaboration to come if she is elected.\n\n\"What I've told Kari Lake, I said, 'Look, if you're willing to put people on that border and keep them from coming in to begin with, I'll send National Guard to help with that,\" DeSantis said.", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/us/five-things-february-17-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Feb. 17: Ukraine, Covid, Government funding ...", "text": "If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

That is according to a senior US administration official, who warned President Vladimir Putin's public openness to diplomacy was a guise. New estimates indicate Russia now has more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine. Western leaders have previously expressed skepticism about Moscow's assertion it was sending some troops back to base, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview Wednesday that there is \"a difference between what Russia says and what it does.\" Separately, Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this weekend to discuss new ways the US and allies can possibly deter Russia from an invasion.\n\n2.

About 230 million of those masks have already been delivered to those locations. Last month, the federal government began distribution of 1 billion free Covid-19 tests directly to households. More than 50 million households have already received their tests , and millions more are on the way, officials said.\n\nJUST WATCHED WH Covid-19 adviser: Government will make high-quality masks for kids Replay More Videos ...

While airlines may ban an unruly passenger from their own flights, competition rules mean that information is not shared with other carriers, so unruly individuals can easily fly on different carriers after violent or disruptive incidents. Nearly 500 unruly passenger incidents have been reported in the first six weeks of 2022, according to data from the Federal Aviation Administration, and 80 incidents have been referred to the Justice Department to consider criminal prosecution.\n\nJUST WATCHED An airline is asking for an unruly passengers no-fly list.

After a federal judge struck down the mask mandate on Monday, the Justice Department filed an appeal to bring mask requirements back inside airplanes and other public transportation methods. But with the mandate no longer in effect, at least temporarily, many US airlines have already dropped their mask requirements for the foreseeable future\n\n5.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf it were possible to separate out the political gamesmanship, secrecy and apparent false promises, the planeloads of migrants taken from Texas to Massachusetts and paid for by Florida could be viewed as a public service.\n\nInstead, the planes are now the subject of a criminal investigation and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the new king of gotcha politics, was chuckling on Fox on Monday night, bragging about sending a message to cities that provide sanctuary to migrants and promising it would pay off for Republicans in November.\n\nToo bad everyone can’t work together because by all accounts border authorities are overwhelmed and there are people at the border who need somewhere to go.\n\nShocking milestone: 2 million encounters\n\nUS authorities have recorded more than 2 million encounters with people trying to cross the southern border this fiscal year and more than 203,000 in August alone, new data from US Customs and Border Protection showed. Read CNN’s full report. Many encounters – 22% last month – are repeat attempts; the 2 million encounters represent fewer than 2 million migrants.\n\nMany of those encountered at the border are still turned away under a pandemic-related health authority a federal judge won’t let the Biden administration end.\n\nBut tens of thousands of migrants seeking asylum on US soil can’t be returned to Mexico, which won’t accept migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Migrants from those three countries alone numbered 55,333 in August.\n\nLooking for places to send tens of thousands of migrants\n\nCNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller has talked to US and Mexican authorities and told me Mexican drug cartels are gouging migrants, charging exorbitant sums to get them across the border after harrowing treks from Central and South America.\n\nOnce in the US, the migrants that cannot be returned to Mexico face an uncertain future as aid organizations try to help connect them with family and contacts in the US while they await asylum proceedings.\n\nWhen those organizations find enough migrants interested in going to New York, Chicago or Washington, DC, they call for a bus in Texas.\n\nThat’s a separate process than DeSantis’ decision to step in on behalf of Florida and transport migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nIn need of a Marshall Plan for immigration\n\nMiller told me in an ideal world, the US would have a sort of Marshall Plan to stop such mass migration at the source in Central and South American countries. In the US, mayors and governors would ideally be working together to distribute migrants.\n\n“The politics in the United States right now are a little too brittle for government to think of each others’ interests,” he said.\n\nThe migrants can’t just stay in border towns, either. Read these reports from El Paso, where migrants are sleeping on the streets because shelters are full, according to the Dallas Morning News and the Texas Tribune.\n\nNot coming to El Paso, coming to America\n\nRather than ask Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for help, El Paso’s Democratic Mayor Oscar Leeser is using emergency funds to facilitate his own buses to New York City, where many migrants are headed.\n\n“The people are not coming to El Paso, they’re coming to America,” Leeser said on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday. “And we look at them and we talk to them and say, ‘Where do you want to go and what’s your destination?’ And then we will take them and help them get to their destination.”\n\nArriving in the US without a place to go\n\nThe big change, he said, is that unlike in the past, people are showing up, in particular from Venezuela, without money and without a place to go.\n\n“We have about 50 percent of the people today that do not have a sponsor, they don’t have money,” Leeser said. “So we’re helping and working to get them to where they want to go.”\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said Monday he has been in communication with Leeser but has not found cooperation from Abbott.\n\nWhile New York will provide sanctuary, he said the city is getting overwhelmed, according to CNN’s report.\n\n“We are not telling anyone that New York can accommodate every migrant in the city,” the mayor said Monday. “We’re not encouraging people to send eight, nine buses a day. That is not what we’re doing. We’re saying that as a sanctuary city with right to shelter, we’re going to fulfill that obligation. That’s what we’re doing.”\n\nA criminal investigation into Martha’s Vineyard flights\n\nBexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar, an elected Democrat, said Monday the migrants shuttled by Florida from Texas to Massachusetts appear to have been “lured” with false promises of work before being sent to Martha’s Vineyard last week.\n\nIt’s not clear what law the operation might have violated, but Bexar said his office is looking into it and criticized using people as political pawns with “false pretenses.”\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, said Monday night that the migrants on planes signed releases and were given a map of Martha’s Vineyard before being left there.\n\n“It was clearly voluntary and all the other nonsense you’re hearing is just not true,” he said on Fox.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s home state of Delaware was preparing for possible migrant arrivals after reports of another unannounced flight from Texas. Read more.\n\nCNN’s Ed Lavandera went to the street corners in San Antonio where the migrants were approached and was told those offers are still being made.\n\nJulian Cyr, a state senator in Massachusetts who represents Cape Cod, said on CNN Tuesday that the migrants sent to Massachusetts have all been given lawyers and are being housed at a local military base.\n\nHe said it’s impossible to argue the migrants agreed to go to Martha’s Vineyard since they apparently didn’t know where they were going and no authorities in Massachusetts were warned.\n\n“This wasn’t about having non-border communities pitch in in this effort,” Cyr said. “This wasn’t about helping vulnerable families seek a better life. This is about using human beings as part of a political stunt. And that is just inhumane and it is shameful.”\n\nWhat we’re doing isn’t working\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents El Paso, argued there has been too much focus on restricting immigration and closing borders.\n\n“We have over the last 30 years as a country, tried it the Republican way, and we’ve shrunken legal pathways,” Escobar said on CNN Tuesday. “When you shrink or eliminate legal pathways you’re going to see more irregular migration,” she said.\n\nShe wants Congress to authorize more processing stations for asylum seekers, including in countries outside the US, to make it easier and more seamless for migrants to enter the country.\n\nCNN’s Priscilla Alvarez notes that it’s not clear exactly how the Biden administration will proceed. She writes:\n\nAdministration officials conceded in a call with reporters Monday that the increase in migration is a challenge. Asked whether the administration is considering moving migrants into the interior, an official cited ongoing discussion about how to improve processing along the border.\n\n“One solution that we know is not a good solution is for hostile governors to be busing or flying migrants – often misleading them – to places where they had no intention of going with no coordination whatsoever,” the official said.\n\nNow a front burner issue\n\nAppearing on Fox, DeSantis claimed credit for bringing immigration to the top of voters’ minds just before the election.\n\n“Immigration and the border, I think, is now … a front burner issue,” he told Fox’s Sean Hannity. “And I think this is one where Republicans have the advantage, without question. So run on it. And then if we do get majorities in the Congress, Sean, they need to do something with that power to hold Biden accountable on this issue.”\n\nDeSantis is probably right on part of this point. Republicans in recent history have reliably used immigration as a wedge issue heading into elections, most notably in 2010, when they won control of the House of Representatives, and 2016, when Donald Trump won the White House.\n\nIn a recent NBC News poll of registered voters, the Republican Party has a massive 36-point advantage over Democrats on “dealing with border security,” and a smaller but still significant 17-point advantage on “dealing with immigration.”\n\nPerceptions of migrants matter\n\nWhile asylum seekers being bused or flown by Texas, Arizona and Florida are in the country legally as they await hearings in the judicial system, it’s not at all clear that your average US voter necessarily views them that way.\n\nThe asylum seekers from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua often cross the border without documentation and then declare themselves to border agents before being released to await a hearing, a process that takes years.\n\nThe perception is hugely consequential. If they perceive immigration as legal, 44% of registered voters surveyed in a New York Times/Siena poll released this month agree with Democrats on the issue, while another 44% said they side with Republicans.\n\nBut when it comes to illegal immigration, a majority of registered voters, 51%, agree with Republicans compared to 37% who agree with Democrats. Republicans hold a similar edge on the economy, the other issue on which they’re focusing.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

The fire, which remains 0% contained as of Monday morning, has charred more than 15,000 acres in central California’s Mariposa County, officials said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the region, which frees additional resources to battle the fire. About 2,500 personnel are working to help extinguish the blaze, which has been burning since Friday and has destroyed at least 10 structures and damaged five others. The wildfire comes as much of the US has been experiencing sweltering heat and worsening drought conditions fueled by climate change.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nOccupied parts of Ukraine are voting in “sham” referendums today on joining Russia. The referendums, which are illegal under international law, have been widely condemned by the West as illegitimate. Such a move could provide Moscow with a pretext to escalate its faltering invasion, which has seen Ukraine regain thousands of square miles of territory this month. The European Union has said it won’t recognize the results and has indicated it is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, backed the referendums in a recent address to the nation. Separately, long lines of traffic were reported at several of Russia’s major land borders, as Russian citizens attempt to flee the newly announced “partial mobilization.”\n\n3. Migrants\n\nA Democratic lawmaker in Florida is suing Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to stop him from transporting more migrants from the southern border, arguing last week’s flights to Martha’s Vineyard violated state law. State Sen. Jason Pizzo, a Miami Democrat, says DeSantis illegally misspent taxpayer dollars by flying about 50 migrants from San Antonio to the Massachusetts island. DeSantis has vowed to transport more migrants from the border, and previously told reporters that the flights to Martha’s Vineyard were “just the beginning.” DeSantis said the action was paid for with $12 million that was allocated in the state budget, and he promised to use “every penny.”\n\n4. Pandemic fraud\n\nMore than $45 billion in pandemic unemployment benefits may have been fraudulently paid to criminals between March 2020 and April 2022, the US Department of Labor said in a memo on Thursday. This is the latest report to identify widespread schemes to steal money from a variety of federal relief programs after Congress enacted an expansion of the program to help Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s also a big jump from the $16 billion figure estimated in June 2021. Fraud skyrocketed when state unemployment agencies were overwhelmed with record numbers of claims and relaxed some requirements in an effort to get the money out the door quickly to those who had lost their jobs. Within five months, more than 57 million people filed claims for unemployment benefits.\n\n5. Air travel\n\nBoeing has agreed to pay $200 million for misleading the public about the safety of its 737 Max plane following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that, following an October 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 Max jet that killed 189 people, Boeing and then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg knew that part of the plane’s flight control system posed an ongoing safety concern – yet told the public that it was safe to fly. After a March 2019 fatal 737 Max crash, the SEC alleges that Boeing and Muilenburg knowingly misled the public about “slips” and “gaps” in the certification process of that flight control system. Elsewhere in the aviation industry, American Airlines recently announced it will ban an unruly passenger for life after the individual punched a flight attendant.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nSpace Force theme song becomes comedy fodder\n\n“Are you not entertained?” Watch this gorilla stun zoo visitors with a dramatic and commanding entrance.\n\nRicher people are eating more at IHOP and Applebee’s\n\nWhich would you prefer: a $900 tin of caviar or a $9 stack of pancakes?

Ron DeSantis' decisions -- like the one to fly 50 migrants to Martha's Vineyard .\n\nThey are the desired outcome of the hard-driving Republican's approach to politics as he seeks reelection and eyes a possible presidential campaign designed to appeal to a radical party base that relishes candidates who stoke outrage.\n\nIn an earlier political age, DeSantis' hopes for higher office might have ended right here. Using desperate migrants fleeing repression and economic blight in Venezuela as pawns in a power play hardly seems compatible with American ideals of welcoming poor, hungry peoples yearning to breathe free.\n\nYet it is a commentary on today's politics -- and the incentives for radicalism and extreme gestures that define the modern Republican Party -- that the Florida governor's move was being seen in some quarters as his most audacious yet. It again displayed the uncanny talent for weaponizing cultural issues that excite GOP grassroots voters and how DeSantis uses his gubernatorial perch to create record of action on the \"Make America First Again\" agenda. It's a strategy that has made him a megastar on conservative TV and means he would be a formidable 2024 presidential primary candidate, whether his former mentor -- ex-President Donald Trump , the champion of extreme gesture politics -- runs or not.\n\nThe storm over the migrants in Martha's Vineyard played out exactly according to the hardline governor's playbook -- just like previous controversies over the teaching of sexuality in schools, transgender athletes, masks during the coronavirus pandemic and his vow to go after nearly non-existent voter fraud. In this as in other cases, DeSantis took action that some on the left and in the media deemed extreme and beyond the pale. Then, he appeared on camera defiant -- not only owning his decision but taunting those whose criticism he turns into yet more fuel to grow his power and appeal to the GOP base. The image of an unapologetic conservative standing up to his critics is politically very effective -- for now, at least, given that he's not facing a broader national electorate.\n\nBut there remain some mysterious aspects of the episode -- not least the fact that DeSantis, who runs Florida, organized flights for migrants from Texas.\n\nAnd there are growing signs that the migrants sent to Martha's Vineyard may have been misled to convince them to get on the planes. CNN's Maria Santana reported, for instance, that three migrants who were sent to the island were told by a woman named \"Perla\" that they would get help with shelter and jobs once they arrived at their destination.\n\nBiden administration is offering Republicans an opening on immigration\n\nDeSantis' dispatch of migrants may be inhumane. But it's got its own harsh logic.\n\nHe claims cities like Washington, DC, and states like Massachusetts are encouraging the flow of migrants because they do not fully cooperate with immigration enforcement authorities. His disdain for \"sanctuary\" cities and states is shared by another Republican governor keen on stunt politics -- Greg Abbott of Texas. The staunch conservative from the Lone Star State sent two new busloads of migrants to Washington where they were deposited Thursday outside Vice President Kamala Harris' official residence to make a similar point. Volunteers had said they were prepared to receive the group at the city's Union Station. It was not clear whether the change of destination was motivated by a desire to make a political splash to match the impact made by DeSantis.\n\nThere are some grounds to suggest the strategies are having an impact. The Democratic mayors of New York and Washington, Eric Adams and Muriel Bowser, have said their cities' capacity to deal with an influx of migrants sent by Republican governors is close to being overstretched. Such comments lend credibility to warnings by border states that their resources are overwhelmed by surges in migrant crossings. Still, publicity ruses like those pulled off by DeSantis and Abbott are doing little to actually solve a complex problem. They instead serve as a political launch pad -- much like the one that rocketed Trump to the White House with his searing anti-immigration rhetoric in 2016.\n\nBut when it comes to solving the problem, the Biden administration is not blameless either. It has long struggled to find a way to talk about border security, which, for all the hysteria on the right, is a real issue and one that concerns many voters.\n\nHarris, for instance, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the border was \"secure\" -- a comment that conflicts with the views of many voters and the evidence of nearly 2 million border encounters reported by US Customs and Border Protection in the fiscal year that ends September 30.\n\nYet the right's demagoguing of migrants only serves to further politicize the immigration issue that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both tried to solve with a coalition of bipartisan lawmakers, only to founder on the unwillingness of Capitol Hill conservatives to compromise. In the volatile politics left by the Trump presidency, there's no chance a serious immigration reform bill could get anywhere near passing.\n\nIn a Pew Research Center survey from August, for example, 73% of Americans said increasing security along the US-Mexico border to reduce illegal crossings should be a very or somewhat important goal. But the issue is more important to Republicans than Democrats, helping to explain why GOP politicians concentrate so heavily on border issues.\n\nDeSantis seeks to spite the left\n\nDeSantis left no doubt that he was motivated by a desire to spite authorities in liberal states and even to seek revenge on anti-Trump voters.\n\n\"All those people in DC and New York were beating their chests when (Donald) Trump was president, saying they were so proud to be sanctuary jurisdictions, saying how bad it was to have a secure border,\" DeSantis said Thursday.\n\n\"The minute even a small fraction of what those border towns deal with every day is brought to their front door, they all of a sudden go berserk.\"\n\nYet while it's possible to see a coherent political strategy behind the migrant transportation policies of DeSantis and Abbott, it is inescapable that both governors are exploiting the tragedies of vulnerable people for political gain. In fact, the Venezuelans taken to Martha's Vineyard are actually victims of the kind of vengeful socialist dictatorship DeSantis can normally be relied upon to condemn.\n\nThese are desperate people, and whatever the merit of their asylum claims, they're being treated as a faceless group and not as individual humans. Christina Pushaw, director of rapid response for the DeSantis reelection campaign, left no doubt that they are mere props.\n\n\"Martha's Vineyard residents should be thrilled about this. They vote for sanctuary cities — they get a sanctuary city of their own. And illegal aliens will increase the town's diversity, which is strength. Right?\" Pushaw tweeted.\n\nStill, if DeSantis hoped to highlight hypocrisy among east coasters on an island packed with vacation homes, he was disappointed.\n\nThe people in Martha's Vineyard didn't go \"berserk,\" as he said. Instead they rushed to help. Residents provided food, clothes and shelter, despite having no prior notice from DeSantis about the migrants' arrival on Wednesday.\n\n\"We've been through Covid. we've been through hurricanes. we've been through this. ... Every one of those we've risen up as the Vineyard, 'cause we're resilient,\" Edgartown Town Administrator James Hagerty told CNN's Miguel Marquez.\n\n\"We take care of our own, we take care of the community, help people out.\"\n\nWhite House slams 'cruel' migrant transport scheme\n\nDemocrats were quick to seize on the cold-heartedness of the DeSantis and Abbott tactics, even at the risk of providing more grist for the conservative media mill.\n\n\"What they are doing is an illegal stunt, is a political stunt. And it's really just disrespectful to humanity,\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. \"It is just cruel.\"\n\nDavid Leopold, a legal adviser to America's Voice, an immigration advocacy group, said: \"Forcible transfer of a civilian population is a crime against humanity. And human trafficking is a serious federal crime in the US. Both of these are hallmarks of an anti-democratic totalitarian leader.\"\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Ken Burns also sensed a sinister political motivation on the part of DeSantis.\n\n\"It's basically saying that you can use a human life ... and to put it in the position of becoming a political pawn in somebody's authoritarian game,\" Burns said on CNN's \"New Day.\"\n\nWhile it's clear these migrants are being used as pawns, accusations of human trafficking do not take into account the fact that some migrants welcome the chance of transportation away from border states and deeper into the United States, ahead of appointments with authorities for immigration and asylum hearings that could take months or even years to arrive.\n\nBut Republican reaction to the drama in Martha's Vineyard underscored the electric effect it has on the GOP base.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is running for reelection and once was a proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, strongly backed DeSantis.\n\n\"Immigration is a federal responsibility, which this administration is not meeting. A handful of communities and states are carrying the predominant burden of it,\" Rubio told reporters. \"And so if a migrant voluntarily -- which is what it is, the case in most of these, not all of them -- if a migrant voluntarily offers to go to another part of the country, I think it's perfectly reasonable for a state to assist them.\"\n\nAs Rubio understands, any Republican who wants a future in the party must talk tough on immigration. For that reason, the latest deliveries of migrants to liberal jurisdictions by Abbott and DeSantis are unlikely to be the last such stunts.", "authors": ["Analysis Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}]}

Hurricane Fiona, which already battered the Caribbean, is now forecast to brush by Bermuda today before slamming into eastern Canada on Saturday morning. Residents in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island are being warned to prepare for Fiona’s impact. The Category 4 storm, which has already claimed the lives of at least five people and knocked out power for millions this week, will bring damaging winds, high waves and heavy rainfall that may lead to prolonged power outages, local officials said. Several schools, government offices and other businesses in the region have closed today in preparation for the storm.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nOccupied parts of Ukraine are voting in “sham” referendums today on joining Russia. The referendums, which are illegal under international law, have been widely condemned by the West as illegitimate. Such a move could provide Moscow with a pretext to escalate its faltering invasion, which has seen Ukraine regain thousands of square miles of territory this month. The European Union has said it won’t recognize the results and has indicated it is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, backed the referendums in a recent address to the nation. Separately, long lines of traffic were reported at several of Russia’s major land borders, as Russian citizens attempt to flee the newly announced “partial mobilization.”\n\n3. Migrants\n\nUkrainian authorities have found 440 graves at a mass burial site in Izium, an eastern city recently recaptured from Russian forces, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said in a Twitter post today. “We want the world to know what is really happening and what the Russian occupation has led to,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that Ukrainian and international journalists will be shown the site to see what had been uncovered. Izium was subject to intense Russian artillery attacks in April and was taken back by Ukrainian forces on Saturday, delivering a strategic blow to Russia’s military assault in the east. Separately, the White House announced a $600 million security package for Ukraine on Thursday, providing its military with another round of assistance during its ongoing counteroffensive against Russia.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 02:31 - Source: CNN New images show alleged mass burial site in Ukraine\n\nA Democratic lawmaker in Florida is suing Republican Gov.

DeSantis has vowed to transport more migrants from the border, and previously told reporters that the flights to Martha’s Vineyard were “just the beginning.” DeSantis said the action was paid for with $12 million that was allocated in the state budget, and he promised to use “every penny.”\n\n4.

It’s also a big jump from the $16 billion figure estimated in June 2021. Fraud skyrocketed when state unemployment agencies were overwhelmed with record numbers of claims and relaxed some requirements in an effort to get the money out the door quickly to those who had lost their jobs.

He was talking about the potential actions of other flight crews in a crisis.\n\nIn the final, harrowing seconds of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the pilots tried desperately to keep their Boeing 737 Max aloft.\n\nNothing worked. Not pulling back on the yoke to try to get the nose up. Not attempting to adjust the trim, the preliminary report on the crash would show. Making matters worse, multiple alarms, clackers and other audible warnings distracted the pair. The jet crashed in March outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, killing 157.\n\nThe crash laid bare Boeing's shortcomings in having designed an automated flight system that overrode the actions of the flight crew. But it also raised questions about pilot experience — whether mistakes were made in the cockpit and whether foreign airlines require pilots to have enough training. Those questions will be at the fore Monday, when a committee of the United Nations-backed body that sets international standards for air travel is scheduled to take a fresh look at pilot requirements.\n\nBooking fall travel or holiday flights? How to find out if it's on a Boeing 737 Max\n\nIn the U.S., 1,500 hours. Overseas, 240 hours\n\nIn the U.S., copilots must have a minimum of 1,500 flight hours, the same as pilots, before they can take the right seat in a commercial airliner. Internationally, it's only 240 hours and can include a mix of time in simulators.\n\nWhile the preliminary accident report in the Ethiopian crash showed the 29-year-old pilot had 8,122 hours of flight time, the 25-year-old first officer had only 361 total hours, having received his commercial airline license three months earlier.\n\nThe crash followed another about five months earlier involving another 737 Max flown by Lion Air. That plane plummeted into the Java Sea, killing 189. In both crashes, probes revealed an automated system repeatedly pointed the planes' noses down as pilots tried to pull up. Boeing had installed the system to compensate for larger engines positioned farther forward on the wing.\n\n'It will be a crash for sure':Ethiopian pilot pleaded for training after Lion Air Boeing 737 Max crash\n\nAfter the Lion Air crash, Boeing had insisted the 737 Max is safe because pilots can follow a procedure to switch off the system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg hinted about six weeks after the Ethiopian crash that pilots did not \"completely\" follow procedures.\n\nThe crash report illuminates what he may have meant. In particular, the report shows pilots never cut back the plane's power after takeoff, which would have made it harder to manually control the horizontal stabilizer.\n\nWould a more experienced or better-trained crew have made a difference?\n\nLately, talk of blaming the pilots has largely died down. Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, the retired US Airways pilot who became a national hero in 2009 after saving all his passengers by ditching his disabled jetliner in the Hudson River, testified to a House panel last month\n\nthat while it's hard to look back in hindsight, he believes other crews might have reacted the same as the pilots of the two jetliners that ended up crashing if confronted with the same circumstances.\n\nStill, leaders of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and its Aviation Subcommittee, two Republicans and two Democrats, have requested the Transportation Department's inspector general look into pilot training standards for commercial pilots operating outside the U.S., including for those who fly the Boeing 737 Max.\n\n\"If these pilots, hard as they tried to save their passengers, did not receive adequate training in the first place, then that is another factor that demands action. That is true no matter where they are flying or where they were trained,\" wrote one of them, Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., in a commentary for Fox Business last month.\n\nOn Monday, a committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a unit of the United Nations known commonly as ICAO, is scheduled to review flight-hour requirements for pilots. The meeting was scheduled before the 737 Max crashes and won't be limited to requirements for commercial pilots, said Miguel Marin, chief of the operational safety section of ICAO's Air Navigation Bureau.\n\nBut rather than moving closer to the U.S. standard, ICAO appears to be headed toward another approach. It is more concerned with pilots' skills and demonstrated competency rather than just flight hours, perhaps ready to question whether a minimum-hour requirement is still needed. A recommendation to reduce flight hours, if one comes, would reflect a long-standing difference of philosophy.\n\n\"The U.S. went one way. The rest of the world went the other way,\" said Michael Wiggins, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\nIn the U.S., there's little appetite to banish the 1,500-hour rule for copilots.\n\n\"Industry pundits argue over the effectiveness of the 1,500-hour rule, but it certainly reduced the number of regional airline captains flying their entire month with 250-hour interns,\" said Louis Smith, president of FAPA.aero, a pilot job advisory service.\n\nOn autopilot:'Pilots are losing their basic flying skills,' some fear after Boeing 737 Max crashes\n\n'Experience equals safety'\n\nLarry Rooney, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, said \"experience equals safety\" and deadpans: \"If you're going to fly in winter weather, you need to see it a couple of times.\"\n\nThe flight-hours has become a major issue for commuter airlines in the U.S. They have seen a worsening pilot shortage since the minimum flight-hour requirement for copilots was raised in 2013 from 250 hours. The change resulted from an investigation into the 2009 crash of a Colgan Air commuter plane outside Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe Regional Airline Association, representing commuter carriers, asserts higher flight-hour standards have raised the typical costs of becoming a copilot to $200,000. That makes it hard to afford the career with starting salaries for copilots averaging $61,602.\n\nSome pilots say there's a lot more to flight safety than a sheer number of flight hours.\n\nFormer airline pilot and aviation expert John Cox said he supports the 1,500-hour rule but believes there should be offsets that reflect higher levels of training.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force, he said, prepares young officers to fly fighters in combat with as little as 300 hours of flight time. By contrast, private pilots concerned wholly about trying to meet the 1,500-hour requirement can rack up hours by flying banner-towing planes in good weather — hardly the same level of stress and high-caliber experience as in the military.\n\n\"What matters is not the quantity of hours but the quality of training,\" said Cox.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/westpb/2022/05/11/passenger-lands-plane-palm-beach-airport-pbia-florida-after-pilot-incapacitated/9729414002/", "title": "Airplane emergency landing in Florida after pilot is incapacitated", "text": "WEST PALM BEACH — What could have been a deadly nightmare for a pilot and two passengers turned into an \"epic\" story Tuesday when a man with no flight experience successfully landed a small plane at Palm Beach International Airport after the plane's pilot became incapacitated, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe nine-seater Cessna 208 Caravan was on the way back from The Bahamas just before noon when the pilot told his passengers he wasn’t feeling well. He fell against the controls, putting the aircraft into a nosedive and sharp turn, according to the FAA.\n\nInstead of panicking at 10,000 feet, one of the passengers grabbed the controls and called into Fort Pierce Air Traffic Control as the plane was about 30 miles offshore.\n\n\"I've got a serious situation here. My pilot has gone incoherent. I have no idea how to fly the airplane but I am maintaining (at) 9,100 (feet),\" the passenger told Fort Pierce air traffic control around 11:21 a.m.\n\nAfter locating the plane, PBIA air traffic controller Robert Morgan was in the passenger's ear and directing him to the ground. A 20-year veteran of air traffic control and a flight instructor himself, Morgan was reportedly called in from his lunch break to help the passenger make sense of the plane's controls.\n\n“We’ve never had anything like that…I felt like I was in a movie,” Morgan told the FAA. “Everybody wanted to participate, and came out of the offices to assist in any kind of way.”\n\nMore:Jupiter teacher arrested on charges of unlawful sexual activity with former student\n\nMore:Disruptive PBIA airline passengers get lesson in the limits of 'free speech' | Frank Cerabino\n\nMore:With coronavirus in retreat, PBIA air traffic surging, but still below 2019 levels\n\nMiracle landing Palm Beach: Talking the passenger through the plane's complicated navigation system\n\nMorgan said his first instructions were for the passenger to make a slow turn to the north, noting that the shoreline is going to be on the right.\n\n\"He (the passenger) lined himself up with the runway without too much help on my part,\" Morgan said, adding that with the help of a fellow passenger, he found the speed indicator.\n\n\"We need to slow you down some,\" Morgan said but he had never flown the plane. He was fairly certain that the brakes were on top of the rudder pedal. He was right.\n\nMorgan saw the altitude drop from 1,000 feet to 600 feet and then to 300 feet. He got nervous when the plane disappeared off radar. He remembers telling the passenger that the runway was going to look bigger.\n\n\"Before I knew it, he was on the ground.\"\n\nMorgan and the passenger successfully touched the plane down at PBIA at 12:37 p.m.\n\nThe two passengers and pilot have not been named publicly.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office has not released information on the pilot's condition, but footage from the landing shows an ambulance left the scene on the runway with its lights activated.\n\n\"Bobby was able to use his Air Traffic Control skills and flying skills to guide this passenger to Palm Beach International Airport and land safely,\" Morgan's wife Michelle posted on Facebook. \"Prayers for the pilot. I thank God Bobby was able to help these men.\"\n\nMiracle landing at PBIA: What we know about the plane\n\nThe plane involved in Tuesday's incident is registered to Beach Amphibian, LLC of East Haven, Conn. That company has owned the plane since 2015.\n\nThe Cessna 208 Caravan is often used by commuter airlines, charter services and flight training.\n\nDick Erler is the chief flight instructor for Monarch Air, a flight training school based in Addison, Te. His company specializes in Cessna airplanes.\n\n“This is pretty much a miracle,” said Erler, who noted that what happened at Palm Beach Airport has been the topic of discussion throughout the day in the aviation industry. “Both the passenger and the air traffic controller are true heroes.”\n\nIt takes hours and hours of training to be able to fly a Cessna 208, Erler noted.\n\n“To land that plane without knowing anything about it is incredible. And the air traffic controller deserves all the credit in the world.”\n\nMiracle landing at PBIA: What we know about the flight path\n\nFlight tracking data shows the Cessna originally took off from Lake Wales Municipal Airport, about 26 miles southeast of Lakeland, at 8:15 a.m. Tuesday before briefly stopping at Treasure Coast International Airport.\n\nThe plane went on to the Leonard M. Thompson International Airport, known as the Marsh Harbour Airport, located in a town in the Abaco Islands in The Bahamas, where it stayed for just 39 minutes, potentially to pick up the passengers, before starting the flight back to Fort Pierce.\n\nBut the plane never made it back to Fort Pierce.\n\nFlightpath data shows the plane made a sharp turn south about 30 miles southeast of Fort Pierce when it was flying at about 12,000 feet. That could have been when the passenger radioed into the Fort Pierce Air Traffic Control tower.\n\nController Christopher Flores at Fort Pierce Tower tried to locate the plane. Operational supervisor Justin Boyle and Palm Beach operations supervisor Joshua Somers rushed to provide help in tracking it while Flores instructed the man to fly straight ahead and to start a gradual descent.\n\nThe team located the plane approximately 20 miles from Boca Raton Airport over the Atlantic Airport. Instead of landing there, Morgan guided the passenger to the Palm Beach Airport because it has a longer runway, was less congested, and had adequate radio coverage.\n\n\"Morgan walked the passenger through turns, selecting flap settings needed to create enough lift at slower speeds and trim (to alleviate pressure from the control surfaces during flap extension) and explaining how to land. He then made sure the passenger had the Palm Beach runway in sight,\" according to the FAA release.\n\nThe unsuspecting pilot did not know how to stop the plane, so Morgan instructed him how to brake and adjust levers.\n\nMiracle landing at PBIA: 'Oh my gosh... that was a great job'\n\nAs the plane landed at PBIA just after 12:30 p.m., commercial planes were delayed to keep the runway clear. Air traffic control told an American Airlines pilot nearby to hold off approaching runway 10L.\n\n\"It's gonna be a couple minutes. You just witnessed a couple passengers land that plane. ... Man they did a great job,\" the air traffic controller said.\n\n\"Did you say the passengers landed the airplane?\" the pilot asked. Upon confirmation, he added \"Oh my gosh... that was a great job.\"\n\n\"No flight experience. We got a controller who worked them down. I think he is a flight instructor,\" the air traffic controller said of Morgan.\n\n\"Epic,\" the American Airlines pilot responded.\n\nEmergency medical services and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office assisted the original pilot. Neither of the passengers had any injuries, according to the FAA.\n\n“At the end of the day, I feel like I was just doing my job,” air traffic controller Morgan said, “But it was like on a higher level than you thought you’d have to do it.”\n\nKatherine Kokal is a journalist covering northern Palm Beach County and Mike Diamond covers Palm Beach County government and transportation.

But critics said weakening the standard would mean writing new regulations in the \"blood\" of crash victims.\n\nSen. John Thune, R-S.D., said the goal of his provision added to broader FAA legislation by a narrowly divided Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee is to provide better quality training rather than a quantity of flying hours.\n\n“The amendment would allow prospective pilots to receive credit toward flight-hour requirements if taking structured and disciplined training courses if completion of those training courses will enhance safety more than an unstructured accumulation of flight hours,” Thune said.\n\nBut Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a former Army combat pilot, said watching videos in a hotel ballroom can’t replace flying experience. She compared the 1,100 deaths from airline accidents from 1990 through 2009 to the lack of fatalities in passenger-airline accidents since the 1,500-rule was adopted. Co-pilots used to qualify with 250 hours of flight time, rather than the 1,500 hours required of captains.\n\n“If we vote for this, we will be writing future regulations in blood,” Duckworth said.\n\nDuckworth tried to block the provision but lost on a 14-13 vote. The committee then adopted the provision by voice vote.\n\nLawmakers agreed to try and negotiate a compromise before the legislation reaches the Senate floor because Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has threatened to block the entire FAA bill if the provision is included.\n\nThe training requirement sparks an emotional debate because relatives of the 50 victims of the last fatal crash — Colgan Air Flight 3407 in February 2009 near Buffalo — attend congressional hearings and voting sessions to fight for safety standards.\n\nTen-year-old Summer West of Clarence, N.Y., whose father, Ernie, died in the Colgan crash, told lawmakers before a House vote Tuesday that they and the pilots commanding planes were supposed to protect passengers rather than weaken safety measures.\n\n“My daddy was funny, kind, smart and always protected me. But I couldn’t protect him because I was only 2 years old when he was killed in a plane crash,” Summer said. “But I can protect other daddies now, and make sure my daddy’s death wasn’t all for nothing.”\n\nScott Maurer of Bradenton, Fla., whose 30-year-old daughter, Lorin, died in the Colgan crash, said airlines shouldn’t put profits before safety.\n\n“The system is not broken,” Maurer said. “Short-changing safety is not the way to go.”\n\nInvestigators found Colgan pilots made mistakes that stalled their turboprop plane in a snowstorm. Regulators developed new rules for pilot qualifications, training and fatigue.\n\nIn 2010 legislation, Congress required that airline co-pilots, also known as first officers, get the same 1,500 hours of flight time as captains.\n\nThe Transportation Department regulations finalized in July 2013 made exceptions for military pilots who have flown at least 750 hours, graduates of four-year colleges who have flown at least 1,000 hours and graduates of two-year colleges who have flown 1,250 hours.\n\nRegional airlines, which provide about half the country’s flights, have long argued that training requirements make it difficult to find qualified pilots. Flights to smaller cities are jeopardized if airlines can’t find pilots to fly the planes.\n\nThune said two-thirds of the country’s airports are served exclusively by regional airlines, and the training requirement contributes to their difficulties hiring pilots.\n\nHow pilots get to 1,500 hours is more important than simply reaching that figure, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said.\n\n“Fifteen-hundred hours is not necessarily magic, but however you get whatever training you get is important,” Blunt said.\n\nSen.

Airlines have complained for years about difficulty finding trained pilots to hire. But pilots say airlines would have no trouble finding qualified pilots if they hiked starting salaries.\n\nAs the Sept. 30 expiration date approaches for FAA policy legislation, regional airlines are \"pushing very hard\" against the 1,500-hour rule, Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee said. He said he expects other lawmakers to offer amendments to reduce the requirement when legislation is considered this fall.\n\n\"They've got a number of my colleagues in a panic,\" he said. Carriers threatened to reduce flights to congressional districts, he said.\n\n\"We're going to have to fight to keep that.\"\n\nCongress adopted the requirement that every pilot have at least 1,500 hours flying in 2010 after the last fatal crash of a U.S. passenger airline, the February 2009 Colgan Air flight 3407 that crashed near Buffalo during a snowstorm. The rule, which took effect in August 2013, raised the experience level for first officers from 250 hours to the 1,500 hours that captains must accumulate. FAA made exceptions for former military pilots who have 750 hours and graduates of four-year schools who have 1,000 hours.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board blamed the Colgan crash on the captain's inappropriate response to a warning that the Bombardier Q400 turboprop was going too slow to remain aloft. The pilots lacked training to avoid the aerodynamic stall and were fatigued, the investigation found. The Colgan pilots had 3,379 hours and 2,244 hours of flying experience.\n\nFAA regulations that grew out of the Colgan crash required greater simulator training to avoid aerodynamic stalls and increased rest periods between shifts. Six regional-airline executives told a House hearing in April 2014 that the 1,500-hour rule mistakenly favors quantity of training over the substance of what pilots need to learn.\n\nRelatives of the crash victims who fought for the changes say they are prepared to defend them.\n\n\"Our antenna's up,\" said Scott Maurer of Palmetto, Fla., whose 30-year-old daughter Lorin died in the Colgan crash. \"You've got to keep watching – there are so many snakes in the grass.\"\n\nIn addition to more flight hours, a mandatory retirement age of 65 and a growing need for pilots each contribute to fears of a shortage. Boeing, the plane manufacturer, projected a need for 558,000 new pilots worldwide during the next 20 years, including 95,000 in North America.\n\nA Government Accountability Office report in February 2014 found that airline demand hadn't yet outpaced the supply of pilots. But 11 of 12 regional airlines contacted by GAO reported trouble filling openings.\n\n\"Americans have to brace themselves, especially in the small- and medium-sized communities, for one of two things: withdrawal or reduction of service, or higher ticket prices,\" said Jim Higgins, an associate professor at the University of North Dakota's aviation department, who studied the shortage.\n\nRepublic Airways, which serves American, Delta and United airlines, lost half its stock value in July after announcing a pilot shortage forced it to cut 4% of its flights in April, May and June.\n\n​Bryan Bedford, CEO of Republic Airways, told a House hearing in April 2014 that the rule would fail to improve safety and \"would hasten the growing pilot shortage and imperil air service at communities across the country.\"\n\nIn February 2014, United, Republic, Great Lakes and Silver airlines blamed service cuts at least partially on a shortage of pilots caused by the tougher federal training requirements.\n\n\"Collectively, these new regulations have put many of us in the position of having to park airplanes, cut flights and eliminate cities,\" John Sullivan, CEO of Champlain Enterprises, which operates as CommutAir and flies as United Express, told lawmakers in April 2014.\n\nBut the Air Line Pilots Association, a union with 52,000 members, questions whether such a shortage exists.\n\n\"We reject that out of hand,\" said Capt. Tim Canoll, the union president.\n\nPilots say more people would spend the $150,000 to $200,000 to acquire a commercial license if regional airlines paid more to starting pilots. The five lowest-paying airlines pay first-year pilots less than $21,000 per year, according to the union. To bolster salaries, some regional airlines offer signing bonuses. For example, Endeavor Air – a regional affiliate for Delta Air Lines – offers a $20,000 annual retention payment through 2018.\n\nTo recruit more potential pilots, airlines must show pilot recruits a clear path to a career in aviation that could result from significant training expenses, Canoll said.\n\n“It’s been two years\" since the rule took effect, Canoll said. \"Anyone can accumulate 1,500 hours if they want to within two years.\"\n\nUniversity of North Dakota's Higgins, a former airline pilot, said only one fatal crash in the last 100 in the U.S. involved pilots with fewer than 1,500 hours of flying.\n\n\"It was a really good sound-bite and feel-good measure,\" Higgins said. \"It's exceptionally safe with low-time pilots.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/cox/2015/09/04/airline-pilots/71695524/", "title": "Ask the Captain: A typical day for a pilot", "text": "John Cox\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQuestion: Can you describe a typical day for a pilot and flight crew?\n\n— Submitted by reader Bob Ciesco, The Villages, Fla.\n\nAnswer: Pilots, like every other profession, experience very different days throughout a career. Long-haul pilots may make only a single flight in a day while regional pilots may take off and land eight or more times. Helicopter pilots may make more than 20 takeoffs and landings in a day.\n\nThere really is not a typical day because of the 24-hour, seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year nature of aviation. Some pilots fly overnight, while others work early mornings and still others work the afternoons/evenings.\n\nAll pilots arrive early, make preflight preparations and inspections, and get a weather briefing. Before departure, performance calculations are done, and navigation computers are loaded.\n\nOne of the benefits of the piloting profession is the variety of schedules, destinations and job demands. It is definitely not a routine job.\n\nQ: Our flight was delayed for about 15 minutes because the backup pilot had to be called in from a nearby hotel. How do airlines normally handle situations like this? Is there a set number of pilots available on standby ready to be called upon?\n\n— Mike, Texas\n\nA: All airlines have reserve pilots standing by every day. The response time for a reserve pilot (or flight attendant) varies from airline to airline. If you had only a 15-minute delay, the response was very good.\n\nReserves are needed to accommodate irregularities in the flight operation or if a crewmember becomes ill. Being on reserve is a difficult job, as it is impossible to plan anything because of the possibility of being called to fly on very short notice.\n\nQ: Do pilots prefer to fly long-haul — USA to U.K. for instance — or to fly in-country?\n\n— Mike, England\n\nA: Different pilots prefer different types of flying. For some, long-distance flying to international destinations is most desirable. For others, being closer to home and flying in familiar territory is the choice. There is not a single answer to your question.\n\nMORE:Read previous columns\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/01/03/pilot-fatigue-mandatory-rest-new-faa-rules/4304417/", "title": "New pilot fatigue rules go into effect this weekend", "text": "Nancy Trejos\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNew rules that require pilots to get a minimum amount of uninterrupted rest and limit the number of consecutive hours they can fly will go into effect on Saturday.\n\nAirlines, which have had two years to prepare for the changes, say they are bracing for potential delays and cancellations, especially on days like today when bad weather is already mucking up flight schedules, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Eight of those hours must involve uninterrupted sleep. In the past, pilots could spend those eight hours getting to and from the hotel, showering and eating.\n\nPilots will be limited to flying eight or nine hours, depending on their start times.

Regional carriers typically serve smaller cities rather than hub airports.\n\nThe ALPA today issued a statement applauding the new rules.\n\n\"The new science-based flight- and duty-time rules are a significant victory for safety and the traveling public here in the United States because they represent a long-overdue overhaul of decades-old flight and duty regulations,\" the union said.\n\nBut the union said the new rules were flawed in that they don't apply to cargo pilots.

Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist and associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank, said on Telegram that while the decree \"describes the mobilization as partial,\" it \"sets no parameters of this partiality, either territorial or categoric.\"\n\n\"According to this text, anyone can be called up except for those working in the military-industrial complex who are exempt for the period of their employment. The fact that the mobilization applies only to reservists or those with some particularly necessary skills is mentioned in the address, but not in the decree.\"\n\nRussian human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov said that the decree sets out mobilization \"in the broadest terms.\"\n\n\"The president is leaving it at the Defense Minister's discretion. So in fact it is the Russian Defense Ministry that will decide who will be sent to war, from where and in what numbers,\" Chikov said on Telegram.\n\nFollowing the speech, at least 1,300 people were detained across Russia on Wednesday for participating in nationwide anti-war protests -- with some directly conscripted into the military, according to a monitoring group, after leader Vladimir Putin announced a \" partial mobilization \" of citizens for his faltering invasion of Ukraine\n\nImages and videos show police cracking down on demonstrators in multiple cities, with footage showing several protesters at a demonstration in central Moscow being carried away by the police and authorities in St. Petersburg attempting to contain a crowd chanting \"no mobilization\" outside Isakiivskiy Cathedral.\n\nPolice detained the protesters across 38 cities in Russia on Wednesday, according to figures released shortly after midnight by independent monitoring group OVD-Info. The group's spokeswoman Maria Kuznetsova told CNN by phone that at at least four police stations in Moscow, some of the protesters arrested by riot police were being drafted directly into Russia's military.\n\nOne of the detainees has been threatened with prosecution for refusing to be drafted, she said. The government has said that punishment for refusing the draft is now 15 years in jail. Of the more than 1,300 people detained nationwide, more than 500 were in Moscow and more than 520 in St. Petersburg, according to OVD-Info.\n\nJust over half the detained protesters whose names were made public are women, OVD-Info also said, making it the biggest anti-government protest by share of women in recent history. The watchdog specified the full scale of the arrests remains unknown, however.\n\nNine journalists and 33 minors are also among the detained, it said, adding that one of the minors was \"brutally beaten\" by law enforcement.\n\nThe specter of nuclear weapons\n\nPutin also raised the specter of nuclear weapons in his address, saying he would use \"all the means at our disposal,\" if he deemed the \"territorial integrity\" of Russia to be jeopardized. He also endorsed referenda on joining Russia that Russian-appointed leaders in four occupied regions of Ukraine announced they would hold this week.\n\nvisa.

Could the government ever reinstate the draft? Who can be drafted and why? Here's what to know.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the draft?\n\nThe draft is the mandatory enrollment of individuals of a certain age and gender into the armed forces to fill vacancies that could not be filled by volunteers.\n\nDrafting has occurred during times of conflict and in peacetime, though the first peacetime draft was not enacted until 1940 amid rising international hostilities leading up to World War II, according to the Selective Service System.\n\nThe draft ensured the military was able to quickly fill manpower needs during wartime after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor\n\nMore:Reports: Ukraine bans all male citizens ages 18 to 60 from leaving the country\n\nMore:1969 Vietnam War Draft Lottery: How the draft worked.\n\nCan the US still institute a draft?\n\nDraft induction authority expired in 1973. It would take an act of Congress to reinstate the draft. The president would then be authorized to induct civilians through the Selective Service Administration into the armed forces under an amendment to the Military Selective Service Act.\n\nRegistration with the Selective Service is considered crucial to national security strategy. Mandatory registration resumed in 1980 under President Jimmy Carter.\n\nWhat happens if you get drafted?\n\nIf Congress were to reinstate the draft, the Selective Service would activate and order all personnel to report for duty to open Area Offices. A public, televised and nationally streamed National Draft Lottery to establish the order by year of birth in which registrants receive directives to report for induction would follow.\n\nInductees are given a physical, mental and moral evaluation at a local Military Entrance Processing Station to determine which registrants are eligible for service and which are sent home. Under Defense Department requirements, the first inductees are delivered to the military within 193 days of draft authorization.\n\nRegistrants can claim postponement, deferment or exemption upon receiving an induction notice. Once claims are processed by Local and Appeal Boards, they may be classified as conscientious objectors, dependency hardships, or ministerial and ministerial student deferments.\n\nCan women be drafted?\n\nOnly \"male persons\" are authorized to register for the draft under the Military Selective Service Act.\n\nCongress would have to pass legislation amending the act to extend registration to women. Women make up close to 17% of the armed forces, up from about 2% in 1973.\n\nWhat ages would be drafted?\n\nMale U.S. citizens and immigrants ages 18-25 are required to register with the Selective Service. A male immigrant within that age range must register within 30 days of arriving to the U.S. Individuals within either category must register within 30 days after their 18th birthday.\n\nAbout 17 million draft-eligible men are on file with the Selective Service System.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nReach out to Chelsey Cox on Twitter at @therealco.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/27/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/6960680001/", "title": "Ukraine agrees to meet with Russia Monday; Belarus could join ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, Feb. 27.

General Assembly and the smaller, 15-member Security Council plan to hold emergency meetings on Russia’s invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin’s order to make his nuclear weapons more ready for launch – made Sunday in response to “aggressive statements” by leading NATO powers and economic sanctions by the West – represents an unnecessary and dangerous move, according to the Pentagon.\n\nA senior Defense Department official said Russia is under no threat from the United States and its NATO allies. The Pentagon is confident it can protect the U.S. and its allies, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is heading towards a fifth day of fighting. According to the Associated Press, Russian troops entered Kharkiv on Sunday, where videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across the city and a vehicle burning on the street. Residents were urged to stay inside.\n\nThe troops in Kharkiv arrived after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine, targeting airfields and fuel facilities. Two large explosions rocked an area south of the capital just before 1 a.m. local time. Zelenskyy’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport and the other blast hit an oil depot about 25 miles south of the capital, according to the mayor of Vasylkiv via the AP. Russian forces also blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, according to the Ukrainian president's office.\n\nUkrainian officials said Sunday the civilian death toll has reached 352.\n\nA few things to catch you up on:\n\nTHE NEWS COMES TO YOU: Get the latest updates on the situation in Ukraine.

It was unclear exactly what share of Russia’s estimated $640 billion hard currency coffers will be paralyzed by the move, but European officials said that at least half of it will be affected.\n\nThe move will dramatically raise pressure on the ruble by undermining the financial authorities’ ability to conduct hard currency interventions to prevent the ruble from sinking further and triggering high inflation. The ruble has sharply dived in early Monday trading.\n\nThe Central Bank also ordered a slew of measures to help the banks cope with the crisis by infusing more cash into the system and easing restrictions for banking operations. At the same time, it temporarily barred non-residents from selling the government obligations to help ease the pressure on ruble from panicky foreign investors eager to cash out.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:The enigma of Vladimir Putin: What do we really know about Russia's leader?\n\nDalai Lama pleas for peace in Ukraine\n\nThe Dalai Lama on Monday pleaded for peace and \"mutual understanding,\" and said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"War is outdated – non-violence is the only way.

It will give all U.N. members an opportunity to speak about the war Monday and vote on a resolution later in the week that U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said would “hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the U.N. Charter.”\n\nFrench Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere announced that the Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the humanitarian impact of Russia’s invasion, a session sought by French President Emmanuel Macron to ensure the delivery of aid to growing numbers of those in need in Ukraine.\n\nBoth meetings follow Russia’s veto Friday of a Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops.

Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some,” the embassy said on its website.\n\nFurthermore, embassy officials say that border crossings into neighboring Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova are overwhelmed.\n\n“Some are experiencing extremely long wait times (well over 30 hours in some cases),” the embassy said. “We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross.”\n\nEmbassy officials also offered a series of tips including bringing enough food, water and warm clothing.

That same day, Facebook’s head of security policy had said the company was barring Russian state media from running ads or otherwise profiting on its platform anywhere in the world.\n\nFacebook says it has also refused a request by the Kremlin not to run fact checks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the platform for users inside Russia.\n\nNetBlocks reported earlier that access to Twitter was similarly restricted Saturday.

The call comes after Biden ordered the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from its stockpile to Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday that this third authorization for weapons shipments to Ukraine in less than a year was \"unprecedented.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nUkraine radioactive site in Kyiv struck by missiles, UN nuclear watchdog\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog says missiles have struck a radioactive waste disposal site in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. So far there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike. Grossi said his agency expects to get the results of on-site radioactive monitoring soon.\n\nThe report comes a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was damaged.\n\nSuch facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Grossi says the two incidents highlight a “very real risk.” Grossi said if the sites are damaged there could be “potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nJapanese billionaire to donate over $8 million to Ukraine\n\nJapanese billionaire Hiroshi “Mickey” Mikitani said he will donate over $8 million to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy.”\n\nMikitani, founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc., said Sunday in a letter to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the donation of ¥1 billion (roughly $8.7 million) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence,” the Japan Times reported.\n\nMikitani said he met with Zelenskyy during a visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2019.\n\n“My thoughts are with you and Ukraine people,” Mikitani wrote in his letter. “I believe that the trampling of a peaceful and democratic Ukraine by unjustified force is a challenge to democracy.\n\n“I sincerely hope that Russia and Ukraine can resolve this issue peacefully and that Ukraine people can have peace again as soon as possible,” Mikitani added.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nRussia-Ukraine talks set for Monday\n\nThe office of Ukraine’s president confirmed that a delegation is set to meet with Russian officials as Moscow’s troops continue to target Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said on the Telegram messaging app that the two sides would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border.\n\nABC and CNN, each citing Ukrainian officials, reported the talks would take place Monday, which matches a report from Russian state-owned news agency TASS that said the discussions would take place in the morning.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks.

For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack.

Ukrainian officials have been asking for more of the powerful weapons.\n\nEstonia has also been providing Ukraine with Stingers since January, and had to get U.S. permission in order to do that.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNeutral Switzerland 'probable' to hit Russia with financial sanctions, president says\n\nAfter days of fence-sitting, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday it was \"very probable\" that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union’s lead and sanction Russia and freeze Russian assets in the country.\n\nReuters reported that Cassis, who was interviewed on French-language Swiss public television, said the nation's seven-member Federal Council would meet Monday and review recommendations by finance and economy officials.\n\n\"It is very probable that the government will decide to do so tomorrow, but I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken,\" Cassis said, via Reuters.\n\nSwitzerland, a global financial hub and commodities trading center – has so far resisted calls for it to levy sanctions and possibly freeze Russian assets, especially after the EU and U.S. announced sanctions.\n\n“The civilized, democratic world has to stand up to the biggest threat to European security and stability since the Second World War,” Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for EU external affairs, said on Friday. “It affects not only Ukraine. It affects Europe. Switzerland is part of Europe. So we expect our partner, our neighbor, our ally to follow suit in standing up for defending the principles on which our communities and countries are based.”\n\nThe oft-neutral country's potential move comes as a surprise to some.\n\n\"Switzerland to sanction Russia! Holy crap. A country that was neutral against the literal Nazis. Neutral no more!\" tweeted Paul Massaro, a counter-corruption advisor to the U.S. Congress.\n\nIt was not known immediately how many wealthy Russian elites, especially oligarchs close to Putin, have stashed money in Swiss banks, known for their strong privacy firewalls. But various leaks of banking documents over the years suggest they have a sizable amount invested in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2018, Swiss banks reportedly frozen $1 billion in the accounts of one oligarch alone – Russian metals tycoon Viktor Vekselberg – over fears that they could be fined for doing business with him after Washington levied sanctions against the businessman, the Moscow Times reported at the time.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy urges Americans in Russia to consider leaving 'immediately'\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Sunday that American citizens “should consider departing Russia immediately” because of the dramatic drop-off in airline service in and out of the country.\n\n“An increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,” a security alert posted to the embassy’s website states. “U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.”\n\nThe guidance comes after the EU's move to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Russian airline Aeroflot says it cancelled all flights to Europe.\n\nThe State Department had already advised Americans not to travel to Russia because of its aggression against Ukraine, as well as the potential harassment of U.S. citizens in the country and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUN emergency session scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has voted for the 193-member General Assembly to hold an emergency session on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.\n\nThe vote on Sunday to authorize an emergency meeting was 11 in favor, Russia opposed, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. That was the exact same vote on a resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. But in that case, Russia used its veto and the resolution was defeated.\n\nUkrainian U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asked for the General Assembly meeting to be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the U.S. and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the Korean War.\n\nThat resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUkraine civilian death toll hits 352, officials say\n\nThe civilian death toll from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has risen to 352, including 14 children, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal affairs said Sunday.

FedEx said it was “closely monitoring the situation” and had suspended inbound service to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nBoth companies had already stopped service to Ukraine, after Russian troops invaded the neighboring country. Russian troops have now advanced well into Ukrainian territory, reaching its second largest city and encircling the capital, Kyiv.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMcMaster: Putin got ‘more than he bargained for’\n\nFormer national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday that Ukrainians are doing a “tremendous job” defending the country against Russian military attacks.\n\n“I think Putin got a lot more than he bargained for. He's in a very difficult position. And I think anything we can do, obviously, financially, going after his international criminal enterprise with sanctions and so forth is important. But the support for Ukraine's ability to defend themselves is also important,” McMaster told Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe retired lieutenant general also said the seizure of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “not in the cards for the immediate future,” but acknowledged the next 72 hours are going to be “really critical.”\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nKyiv mayor: 'We are encircled'\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is both filled with pride over his citizens' spirit and anxious about how long they can hold out.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.\n\n“We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said. “Right now we are encircled.\"\n\nWhen Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.\n\nThe mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.\n\nA Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.\n\n“We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,\" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian “saboteurs” were killed Saturday night.\n\nIn the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.\n\n“To be honest, we don't have 100% control,” said Klitschko. “We built this territorial defense in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people.\"\n\n“Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,” he added.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEU closing airspace to Russia\n\nThe top official in the European Union said the bloc will take unprecedented new steps after Russian President Vladimir Putin raised tensions with talk of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe EU will close its airspace to Russian airlines, including \"the private jets of oligarchs,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” she added.\n\nThe EU will also ban pro-Kremlin media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, she said.\n\nThe European Commission's plans followed the announcement earlier in the day that Germany was committing 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on. The shift underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\n\nThe EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases was unprecedented and would use millions of euros to help buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.\n\n– Katie Wadington and AP\n\nOn nuclear deterrence:What is DEFCON? What's nuclear deterrence?

So that means we're not going to put American troops in the air as well. But we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRussian troops stalled outside Kyiv\n\nThe main force of Russian assault aimed at Kyiv remained stalled Sunday about 18 miles from the city’s center, hindered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and Russia’s own problems providing fuel and supplies for its troops, according to a senior Defense Department official.\n\nThere are indications of some fighting inside Kyiv and that Russian troops in Ukrainian military uniforms have appeared there, said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nThe officials described Ukrainian resistance as stiff and creative around Kyiv and Kharkiv. Meantime, fuel shortages and logistics problems for Russian troops are most acute near Kharkiv.\n\nThe war is a major operation for Russia’s military, a complex mission that it does not have recent experience mounting, the official said. It’s unclear if the shortages in materials represent a failure in planning or execution. However, the official said Russian officers are expected to learn and adapt to its logistical problems.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, there are troubling indications that Russia is encircling the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, and could be planning to besiege it, the official said. There are increasing rocket attacks there, imprecise weapons that can kill civilians and damage infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Russian President Vladimir Putin has committed two-thirds of the combat forces he deployed against Ukraine is now inside the country, the official said.\n\nRussia has launched more 320 ballistic missiles into Ukraine during the four-day war. There are some indications that several ballistic missiles have failed to launch.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nU.S.: Putin ‘can be assured’ of tougher sanctions\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Sunday the U.S. will continue to apply stiffer economic sanctions against Russia as Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess what we can do moving forward,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" \"And the Russians can be assured that we will continue to put more and more sanctions as they continue to press more on the Ukrainian government.”\n\nU.S. and Western allies have cut some Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system but stopped short of a complete removal.\n\n“They will feel the pain,” she said, adding there are also actions the U.N. can take.\n\n“We can isolate them.

They are feeling that isolation.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nNATO leader: Russia must make 'serious compromises' in peace talks\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said if peace talks are to succeed, Russia must be willing to make \"serious compromises\" and \"respect the sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nStoltenberg told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Putin's decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert is not a good sign.\n\nIt \"just adds to the very aggressive rhetoric\" of Russia, the NATO leader said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine ambassador: Russia committing ‘war crimes’\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to the United States accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attack on her country.\n\nAmbassador Oksana Markarova said Sunday that Russian troops are using heavy missiles and heavy artillery to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure, as well as hospitals and kindergartens.

The extraordinary step raises the threat of nuclear warfare entering the conflict in Ukraine, a scenario the White House has previously said it has not assessed.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, condemned the action as “unacceptable\" in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nPutin directed the Russian defense minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a “special regime of combat duty” during a meeting with top officials.\n\n“Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,” Putin said in televised comments.\n\nAt the onset of the conflict with Ukraine, Putin warned that any nation that would “hinder us” will face\" such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,” although he did not elaborate what he meant.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n-- Joey Garrison, Associated Press\n\nKyiv eerily quiet after explosions\n\nThe capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports.

The mayor of Vasylkiv, about 25 miles south of the capital, said an oil depot there was hit, according to the Associated Press.\n\nElsewhere, Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv.

But Russia will feel the impact of the decision well before it’s enacted, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“I have great confidence the effects of these measures will be felt immediately in Russia’s financial markets,” the official said.\n\nThe U.S. official suggested some banks that handle energy transactions could be exempted in the SWIFT delisting process. That would help cushion the economic blow to Europe, which relies heavily on Russia for oil and gas.\n\nThe SWIFT system is based in Belgium, where officials will have the final sign-off on the list of barred institutions.\n\nThe U.S. and EU countries also announced new steps to limit the sale of “golden passports,” which allows wealthy individuals become citizens of European countries.\n\n– Rebecca Morin, USA TODAY\n\nZelenskyy says he’s open for talks with Russia\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he’s open for talks with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy said in a video message Saturday that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev offered to help organize such talks. He added that “we can only welcome that.”\n\nZelenskyy also said he and Erdogan “agree that a ban on the passage of Russian warships into the Black Sea is very important today,” adding that “it has been done.” Turkey, however, hasn’t announced any ban for Russian warships to move through Turkish Straits following Erdogan’s talk with Zelenskyy.\n\nZelenskyy said that “Ukrainians’ readiness to protect our state, our solidarity and courage have thwarted the scenario of occupation of our country.”\n\n“The world has seen that Ukrainians are strong, Ukrainians are brave, Ukrainians stand on their land and will not surrender it,” he said.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nGermany to send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, drops opposition to SWIFT sanctions for Russia\n\nIn a significant shift, the German government said Saturday it will send weapons and other supplies directly to Ukraine and supports some restrictions of the SWIFT global banking system for Russia.\n\nGermany’s chancellery announced it will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 “Stinger” surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine “as quickly as possible.”\n\n“The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point. It threatens our entire post-war order,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement. “In this situation, it is our duty to help Ukraine, to the best of our ability, to defend itself against Vladimir Putin’s invading army.”\n\nIn addition, the German economy and climate ministry said Germany is allowing the Netherlands to ship 400 German-made anti-tank weapons to Ukraine.\n\nGermany had long stuck to a policy of not exporting deadly weapons to conflict zones, including Ukraine. As recently as Friday, government officials said they would abide by that policy.\n\nGermany on Saturday also joined the rest of the European Union in voicing support for SWIFT sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and German Economics Minister Robert Habeck announced the decision in a joint statement that indicated there might be limits in how far Germany is willing to go on the issue.\n\n“We are working flat out on how to limit the collateral damage of a disconnection from #SWIFT, so that it hits the right people. What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT,” the officials wrote in a statement.\n\nSWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. It is a global messaging system connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nSWIFT was formed in 1973, and is headquartered in Belgium. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in addition to the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and others, NBC News reported.

That package includes Javelin anti-armor missiles, ammunition and body armor, according to the official. Prior to the invasion, military materiel had been arriving in Ukraine by cargo aircraft. U.S. military aid has continued to flow into Ukraine in the last few days but the official declined to say how it has arrived there.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that “the speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.”\n\n“Russian forces are bypassing major Ukrainian population centres while leaving forces to encircle and isolate them,” the ministry said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook and Associated Press\n\nSnake Island defiance:Ukrainian soldier on Snake Island tells Russian officer 'go (expletive) yourself' before being killed\n\nFleeing to the border: Over 150,000 Ukrainians seek refuge\n\nMEDYKA, Poland – At least 150,000 people have fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighboring countries in the wake of the Russian invasion, the U.N. refugee agency said Saturday.\n\nSome walked many miles through the night while others fled by train, car or bus, forming lines miles long at border crossings. They were greeted by waiting relatives and friends or headed on their own to reception centers organized by neighboring governments.\n\n“The numbers and the situation is changing minute by minute,” said Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. “At least 150,000 people have fled, they are refugees outside of Ukraine. ... At least 100,000 people – but probably a much larger number – have been displaced inside Ukraine.”\n\nThose arriving were mostly women, children and the elderly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy banned men of military age from 18 to 60 from leaving.

A U.S. official told reporters Friday the Pentagon had information suggesting that Moscow had expected a faster advance on Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused an American offer to evacuate, insisting he would stay. “The fight is here,” he said.\n\nSkirmishes reported on the edge of Kyiv suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. A missile struck a high-rise apartment building in the city’s southwestern outskirts near one of Kyiv’s two passenger airports, Mayor Vitali Klitchsko said, leaving a jagged hole of ravaged apartments over several floors. A rescue worker said six civilians were injured.\n\nRussia claims its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets, but civilians have been killed and injured during Europe’s largest ground war since World War II.\n\n– Caren Bohan and Associated Press\n\nTikTok is Russia's newest weapon in arsenal for anti-Ukraine propaganda\n\nIn 2014, Russia flooded the internet with fake accounts pushing disinformation about its takeover of Crimea. Eight years later, experts say Russia is mounting a far more sophisticated propaganda effort as it invades Ukraine.\n\nArmies of trolls and bots stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment. State-controlled media outlets look to divide Western audiences. Clever TikTok videos serve up Russian nationalism with a side of humor.\n\nThe effort amounts to an emerging part of Russia’s war arsenal with the shaping of opinion through orchestrated disinformation fighting alongside actual troops and weapons.\n\nAnalysts at several different research organizations contacted by The Associated Press said they are seeing a sharp increase in online activity by groups affiliated with the Russian state. That’s in keeping with Russia’s strategy of using social media and state-run outlets to galvanize domestic support while seeking to destabilize the Western alliance.\n\nResearchers saw a sudden and dramatic increase in anti-Ukrainian content in the days immediately before the invasion. On Valentine’s Day, for instance, the number of anti-Ukrainian posts created by the sample of Twitter accounts jumped by 11,000% when compared with just days earlier. Analysts believe a significant portion of the accounts are inauthentic and controlled by groups linked to the Russian government.\n\n– David Klepper, The Associated Press\n\nRussian propaganda:TikTok is Russia's newest weapon in arsenal for anti-Ukraine propaganda\n\nTroops from NATO member nations could be deployed to defend Slovakia\n\nSlovakia’s defense minister says up to 1,200 foreign troops from other NATO members could be deployed in his country in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe plan is part of the NATO initiative to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending forces to help protect them. Slovakia borders Ukraine.\n\nDefense Minister Jaroslav Nad said forces from the Netherlands and Germany are among those expected to come. Germany will also provide the Patriot system to boost Slovakia’s air defense.\n\nThe country’s government and Parliament have not yet approved the plan.\n\nNad also said his country’s government has approved sending arms and fuel worth 11 million euros ($12.4 million) requested by Ukraine. The aid will include 10 million liters (2.6 million gallons) of fuel, 2.4 million liters (630,000 gallons) of aviation fuel and 12,000 pieces of ammunition.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy mobilizes Ukrainian reservists and those eligible for service\n\nAfter Russia launched a military invasion into Ukraine early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called up reservists and those liable for service for a full military mobilization.\n\nAs many Ukrainians fled to neighboring countries, the Ukraine State Border Guard Service announced that men ages 18 to 60 were prohibited from leaving the country, ahead of a possible draft to increase the country's military service.\n\nTalk of conscription led to questions in the U.S. about whether the government could ever reinstate the draft. That is highly unlikely in a country where antiwar sentiment has grown in the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress would have to reinstate the draft since induction authority expired in 1973. If approved, the president would then be authorized to induct civilians through the Selective Service Administration into the armed forces under an amendment to the Military Selective Service Act.\n\nEven though there is no draft currently, almost all men and male immigrants aged 18 to 25 are required to register with the Selective Service.

Western officials have long believed that Putin would leverage the symbolic significance and propaganda value of that day to announce either a military achievement in Ukraine, a major escalation of hostilities – or both.\n\nOfficials have begun to hone in on one scenario, which is that Putin formally declares war on Ukraine on May 9. To date, Putin has insisted on referring to the brutal monthslong conflict as a “special military operation,” effectively banning words such as invasion and war.\n\n“I think he will try to move from his ‘special operation,’” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told LBC Radio last week. “He’s been rolling the pitch, laying the ground for being able to say ‘look, this is now a war against Nazis, and what I need is more people. I need more Russian cannon fodder.’”\n\nThroughout the conflict Putin has continuously framed his invasion of Ukraine – a country with a Jewish president – as a campaign of supposed “denazification,” a description dismissed by historians and political observers alike.\n\nWallace added that he “would not be surprised, and I don’t have any information about this, that he is probably going to declare on this May Day that ‘we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilize the Russian people.’”\n\nA formal declaration of war on May 9 could potentially bolster public support for the invasion. It would also, under Russian law, allow Putin to mobilize reserve forces and draft conscripts, which officials say Russia desperately needs amid a growing manpower shortage. Western and Ukrainian officials have estimated that at least 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war since Russia invaded just over two months ago.\n\nRussian battlefield effort ‘anemic’\n\nFollowing a series of military and logistical setbacks, Moscow has concentrated efforts on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which has been on the frontline of the Russia-Ukraine conflict since 2014.\n\nBut the US official on Monday described the Russian war effort there as “anemic.”\n\n“They’ll move in and then declare victory, and then withdraw their troops, only to let the Ukrainians take it back,” the official told reporters at a Pentagon briefing.\n\nThe official said problems that have plagued the Russian military since their initial surge have not been fixed.\n\n“They’re still suffering from poor command-and-control, low morale in many units, less-than-ideal logistics,” the official said.\n\nRussian forces were also keen to avoid risks that could lead to further casualties to their already depleted forces, the official said, describing the ground war in the area as “very cautious, very tepid.”\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces were making significant progress in pushing the Russians back around Kharkiv, at the northwestern tip of the Donbas region, the official said.\n\n“An incredible effort there that, again, hasn’t gotten a lot of headlines and hasn’t gotten a lot of attention, but it’s just another piece of the stiff Ukrainian resistance that they continue to demonstrate,” the official said.\n\nPutin’s other May 9 options\n\nWith less than a week to go before the May 9 Victory Day, Moscow may look at places other than Donbas to make a statement.\n\nOther options include annexing the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, making a major push for Odesa in the south, or declaring full control over the southern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe US has “highly credible” intelligence reports that Russia will try to annex Luhansk and Donetsk “some time in mid-May,” the US Ambassador to OSCE Michael Carpenter said on Monday. There are also indications that Russia could be planning to declare and annex a “people’s republic” in the southeastern city of Kherson.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday there is “good reason to believe that the Russians will do everything they can to use” May 9 for propaganda purposes.\n\n“We’ve seen the Russians really double down on their propaganda efforts, probably, almost certainly, as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield in Ukraine,” Price said at a State Department briefing.\n\nPrice added that it “would be a great irony if Moscow used the occasion of ‘Victory Day’ to declare war, which in itself would allow them to surge conscripts in a way they’re not able to do now, in a way that would be tantamount to revealing to the world that their war effort is failing, that they are floundering in their military campaign and military objectives.”\n\n“I’m quite confident that we’ll be hearing more from Moscow in the lead up to May 9,” Price added. “I’m quite confident that you will be hearing more from the United States, from our partners, including our NATO partners, in the lead up to May 9 as well.”", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Katie Bo Lillis Jennifer Hansler Alex Marquardt Brad Lendon", "Natasha Bertrand", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Jennifer Hansler", "Alex Marquardt", "Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/23/russia-ukraine-invasion-crisis-update/6906567001/", "title": "Russia declares war on Ukraine; explosions reported", "text": "President Vladimir Putin said Russia’s military operation in Ukraine is in response to threats.\n\nHe accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to stop Ukraine from joining NATO.\n\nEditor's note: This page recaps the news on the Ukraine-Russia crisis from Wednesday, Feb. 23.

The not-yet-operational pipeline runs from Russia to Germany.\n\nWednesday’s move, made in coordination with America’s European allies, comes after Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday blocked certification of the natural gas pipeline that runs from Russia underseas to Germany.\n\nBiden said, through Putin’s actions in Ukraine, the Russian leader has “provided the world with an overwhelming incentive to move away from Russian gas and to other forms of energy.\n\nThe company that owns the pipeline, Nord Stream 2 AG, is based in Switzerland and controlled by the Russian-based company Gazprom.

Hua also did not mention efforts by the U.S., France and others to engage Russia diplomatically.\n\nChina-Russia ties have grown closer under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing earlier this month.

The restrictions imposed on the account came amid China’s campaign to clean up the entertainment industry and clamp down on “irrational behavior” exhibited by fans.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has called for a “national rejuvenation” with tighter Communist Party control of business, education, culture and religion.\n\nThe party has since reduced children’s access to online games and is trying to discourage what it sees as unhealthy attention toward celebrities.

The customized airplane was part of the club’s plans to celebrate his 26th birthday in October.\n\nThe stunt drew swift criticism online for its excess. Following the backlash, the account issued a statement last week on its feed urging fans to be “rational” when chasing celebrities for a “harmonious and healthy internet environment.”\n\nWeibo said in a statement Sunday that the group has been banned from posting for 60 days after it was found to have raised funds illegally.\n\n“Weibo firmly opposes such irrational star-chasing behavior and will deal with it seriously,” the statement said.\n\nThe fan club began raising money in April to prepare for the birthday celebrations, according to state-owned media Global Times, with over 1 million yuan ($150,000) raised in the first three minutes of the fundraising activity and 2.3 million yuan ($360,000) in the first hour.\n\nThe club also planned to run advertisements celebrating Jimin’s birthday in newspapers like The New York Times.\n\nIt is not uncommon for K-pop fans worldwide to celebrate the birthdays of their favorite celebrities by taking out advertisements in newspapers and billboards or customizing public transport vehicles with images of their idols.\n\nMany fans also fundraise to donate to charitable causes such as funding education for the underprivileged or sponsoring wild animals in stars’ names as part of such celebrations.\n\nWeibo also said in a separate statement on Sunday that it banned 21 other fan accounts for 30 days for posting “irrational star-chasing” content. The banned fan accounts were mostly centered around K-pop celebrities, such as members of South Korean boy bands NCT and EXO, and girl group Blackpink.\n\nCelebrities in China are often pressured to conform to values espoused by the Chinese government or face the repercussions. Celebrities such as Fan Bingbing and Zheng Shuang have been fined heavily for evading taxes, and popular actress Zhao Wei last week had her name removed from credits of films and TV shows she had starred in without explanation.\n\nChinese singer and actor Lu Han, a former member of popular K-pop group EXO, said Sunday that he would cut ties with Swiss luxury watch brand Audemars Piguet after a video circulated online last week showing its CEO refer to Taiwan as an “ultra-modern, high-tech country.”\n\nChina, which claims Taiwan as its territory, objects to any reference to the self-governing island as a country.

Sam Brown, said on Nevada Newsmakers on Nov. 4 that he has raised more than $1 million in the year's third quarter and partially credits social media for spreading the word of his first-time candidacy and growing his campaign war chest.\n\nIronically, it was getting banned from Twitter for a time that really gave his campaign a bump, he told host Sam Shad.\n\nTwitter had banned Brown's account as a \"spam account' earlier this year, Brown said on a Fox News interview that gave national attention to his ban.\n\nTwitter, however, later restored the account, although Brown said the company did not give a good explanation as to why his was considered a \"spam account\" in the first place.\n\n\"Twitter did me a favor in some sense, censoring me and banning me because there was no real good justification for it,\" Brown told Shad.\n\n\"I'm not one of these politicians who just wants to throw out these mean tweets and make vile points just for the sake of garnering attention,\" Brown said. \"They admitted it was their error. But that brought in a lot of organic social-media attention to my profile, to my candidacy, to my platform, to what we are doing and I think a lot of it came through that.\"\n\nTwitter is considered by many to be the most influential social media when it comes to politics. Brown's Twitter following has grown exponentially in seven months.\n\nNow, his Twitter account's 73,700 followers easily out distances that of GOP rival Adam Laxalt (45,000) and the official U.S. Senate Twitter account of Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto (58,000). However, Cortez-Masto has 91,000 Twitter followers when her U.S. Senate and campaign Twitter accounts are combined.\n\n\"In anticipation of considering this campaign, I started a Twitter (account) in April of this year with 0 followers,\" Brown said. \"Today, I have over 73,000 followers. That's more than any one candidate or politician in this state. And my Instagram has over 13,500 followers — once again — starting at 0.\"\n\nBrown said campaign took off after Fox News appearance\n\nSocial media has created a new style of grassroots campaign for Brown.\n\n\"Well, I think people are seeing that there can be candidates, who have not necessarily grown up through the system and can still represent the needs of the people well, who can be strong leaders and who can be effective at fundraising,\" he said.\n\n\"And people have just attached themselves to this campaign,\" Brown added. \"And when I say people have attached themselves to this campaign, I mean this is a grassroots campaign at its core. We've had over 12,000 donors in Q3 (third quarter of 2021), raised over $1 million.\"\n\n\"People see something here that is different,\" Brown said. \"I'm not your typical establishment Republican. I'm not a Democrat. I am here for the people. I want to lead. I want to listen.\n\nYet Brown's campaign has also been fueled by old-time \"grassroots\" traditions.\n\n\"I'm guessing part of it is word-of-month,\" he said. \"Friends sharing with friends and a lot of people believing in me, you know $10, $100, $200 at a time. Like I said, 12,000 donors. That is not a small number of folks.\"\n\nSome say Brown's big break was a prime-time appearance on The Laura Ingram Show on Fox, although Brown suggested that is a \"misconception.\"\n\n\"I think even I had a misconception about what a Fox News interview would do for you,\" he said. \"You can attribute, to a high level of confidence, just how much money that actually brings in and in general, $30,000 might be on the high end of how much money you'll raise from a Fox interview. So I wouldn't say that was necessarily the thing that made this happen.\"\n\nBrown said he plans to raise about $3 million in total for the GOP primary campaign.\n\n\"We anticipate and are well on our way to raise a primary program of $3 million or more,\" he said. \"That allows us to do what we need to do to beat Adam Laxalt in the primary and I fully anticipate the country (state) will rally around us in the general.\"\n\nMajor Trump ally in Las Vegas endorses Brown\n\nBrown has also received the support of Republican donor and ally of Donald Trump in Don Ahern, a Las Vegas businessman who made his fortune in the rental-equipment sector. Ahern told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he wants Trump to switch his endorsement from Laxalt to Brown.\n\nAhern has emerged as the state's top GOP donor/influencer -- with the death of Las Vegas Sands leader Sheldon Adelson and with the low profile taken by former casino mogul Steve Wynn after sexual misconduct allegations were made against him.\n\n“I love Donald Trump and I believe once he understands the strength of Sam Brown and the weakness of Adam Laxalt, I would hope that he would change his support there,\" Ahern told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nAfter reading Brown's campaign website, however, Shad commented that there are not a lot of differences between Brown and Laxalt on the key conservative issues.\n\n\"When you get down to policy, on broad strokes, (there is) probably not a lot of difference,\" Brown admitted. \"Probably, where you can look and slice out where we are different is, Who is going to work really hard to get out there and represent the people? We the people. It's clearly me.\"\n\nLaxalt has a \"birthright mentality\" when it comes to the Senate race, Brown said.\n\n\"Adam has had the opportunity to run twice across this state and the fact that I've raised $1 million with him and all of his endorsements, it means that people clearly want something different,\" Brown said.\n\n\"They don't want someone who has a birthright mentality to a position in office,\" Brown continued. \"So I don't come with the attachments with special interests that Adam has. My accountability is to the people. It is the people who fund this campaign at an average of $75 at a time.\"\n\n\"And so, all I can go off of are the numbers from Q3 (third quarter of 2021),\" Brown said. \"But 1,500 Nevadans contributed to this campaign and Adam only had about 300 Nevadans contribute to his campaign. So I'm answering to the people. Adam was recruited, endorsed and funded by D.C. and I'm being supported by Nevadans.\"\n\nBrown and his wife moved from Texas to Reno in 2018, according to his campaign website.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/09/09/facebook-google-youtube-twitter-fight-texas-law-trump-censorship/5777157001/", "title": "Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter to fight Texas censorship ...", "text": "Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are targets of new Texas social media censorship law\n\nTexas Gov.

For many, particularly children and young adults, schools and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nBanned books in the news\n\nFact check:James Patterson said white men face 'racism' in publishing. What do book sales say?\n\nWhat is a book ban?\n\nWhen a book is successfully “banned,” that means a book has been removed from school curriculums and/or public libraries because a person or group has objected to its content.\n\nAn attempt to get a book removed is called a challenge. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials (or people appointed by elected officials) who have the power to remove books from the schools and libraries they oversee.\n\nWhy it matters: A book ban is significant because it restricts others’ access to books, and the ideas contained within those books, based on another person’s often ideologically or politically motivated objection.\n\nAre book bans on the rise in the U.S.?\n\nYes. The American Library Association (ALA) keeps track of challenges and bans across the country, and the most recent data is alarming. In 2021, the ALA recorded 729 book challenges targeting 1,597 titles. That’s more than double 2020’s figures and the highest number since the organization began recording data in 2000.\n\nThe actual numbers are likely much higher: Some challenges are never reported by libraries, and books preemptively pulled by librarians out of fear for their jobs are not included.\n\nWhat are the most banned books?\n\nA recent analysis by PEN America found that many challenged books focus on communities of color, the history of racism in America and LGBTQ characters. In fact, one in three books restricted by school districts in the past year featured LGBTQ themes or characters.\n\nHere are the 10 most challenged books of 2021, according to the ALA:\n\n“Gender Queer,” by Maia Kobabe “Lawn Boy,” by Jonathan Evison “All Boys Aren’t Blue,” by George M. Johnson “Out of Darkness,” by Ashley Hope Perez “The Hate U Give,” by Angie Thomas “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,” by Sherman Alexie “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” by Jesse Andrews “The Bluest Eye,” by Toni Morrison “This Book Is Gay,” by Juno Dawson “Beyond Magenta,” by Susan Kuklin\n\nMany books that were historically banned ended up becoming literary classics that are still taught in modern classrooms. Accordingly to the ALA, frequently banned classics include:\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" by Harper Lee\n\nby Harper Lee \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" by JD Salinger\n\nby JD Salinger \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" by John Steinbeck\n\nby John Steinbeck \"The Color Purple,\" by Alice Walker\n\nby Alice Walker \"1984,\" by George Orwell\n\nby George Orwell \"Brave New World,\" by Aldous Huxley\n\nby Aldous Huxley \"Native Son,\" by Richard Wright\n\nby Richard Wright \"Slaughterhouse-Five,\" by Kurt Vonnegut\n\nby Kurt Vonnegut \"A Separate Peace,\" by John Knowles\n\nby John Knowles \"The Lord of the Flies,\" by William Golding\n\nWhat is Afrofuturism? And why should you be reading it? We explain.\n\nWho bans books in the U.S.?\n\nBook banning first made major headlines this year when the McMinn County School Board in Tennessee voted 10-0 to remove Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic memoir “Maus,” about his parents’ experience of the holocaust, from its curriculum.\n\nSince then, there’s been a largely conservative push to remove certain titles from schools and libraries, in some cases with politicians leading the charge, including:\n\nGlenn Youngkin: During his successful run for Virginia governor last fall, the Republican candidate ran a controversial ad featuring a mother who objected to her teenage son being assigned Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” in English class. In April, now Governor Youngkin signed a bill requiring Virginia schools to notify parents when their children are assigned books that contain sexually explicit content.\n\nHenry McMaster: The Republican South Carolina governor supported a school board's decision to remove \"Gender Queer,” calling the book “obscene.”\n\nRon DeSantis: The Republican Florida governor also criticized “Gender Queer” and this year signed into law a bill requiring schools to make all books and materials more transparent so parents can “blow the whistle.”\n\nWhat’s being done to combat book banning?\n\nAmerican Library Association: Every year, the ALA and libraries across the country celebrate Banned Books Week in September. This year’s Banned Books Week runs Sept. 18-24 with the theme \"Books unite us, censorship divides us.\"\n\nFoundation 451: A fundraiser in Florida to buy challenged books and distribute them to students spawned thousands in donations and has morphed into a nonprofit organization. The organization has distributed books at about a dozen events, setting up tables at festivals, churches and local businesses.\n\nNashville Public Library: This Southern library protested banned books this year with a limited edition library card with the special message: \"I read banned books.\" The bright yellow cards are part of the library's Freedom to Read campaign celebrating the \"right to read.\"\n\nMargaret Atwood: Author of the frequently banned dystopian feminist novel “The Handmaid’s Tale,” promoted the auction of a specially commissioned unburnable edition of her book made of Cinefoil by unsuccessfully attempting to incinerate a prototype with a flamethrower.

We value diverse perspectives, are open to new ideas and respect intellectual freedom. So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nNow, book banners are coming for \"Maus,\" a classic of holocaust literature. The serialized comic, completed and published in collected volumes in 1991, made literary history when in 1992 it became the first (and to date only) graphic novel to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nIt was an honor wholly deserved by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, who channeled his Polish-Jewish, Holocaust-surviving parents' experiences into the semi-autobiographical masterpiece in which Jews are represented as mice and Germans as cats.\n\n'It's embarrassing': 'Reading Rainbow' host LeVar Burton fires back at rise in banned books\n\nThe McMinn County School Board in eastern Tennessee voted 10-0 earlier this year to ban the book, citing concerns over \"rough\" language and a nude drawing of a woman, according to the Jan. 10 meeting minutes posted to the district website. The book was part of its eighth grade English and language arts curriculum.\n\nAs news spread about the school board's decision, Spiegelman called the decision \"absurd\" and the U.S. Holocaust Museum said, \"Maus has played a vital role in educating students about the Holocaust through sharing detailed and personal experiences of victims and survivors.\"\n\nThey're right.\n\nFor last September's Banned Books Week, USA TODAY staffers banded together to defend some of the most challenged books in America as compiled by the American Library Association's Office of Intellectual Freedom. \"Maus\" belongs at the top of that list.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculum or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards comprised of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials, that a book can go from challenged to banned in a particular school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is only true for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are their only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society:\n\n'Maus,' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his Holocaust-surviving parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent, lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. While \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry,' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was only assigned one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for each other helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm,' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out,' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that approximately 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and also provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten – disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book, for instance. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia,' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired by the magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World,' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret,' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then –— about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixthgraders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye,' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local paper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He’d already tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it’d been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones the man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis,' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk-rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted individuals, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyoncé once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they are fearful for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming-of-age Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle,' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That short-sightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried,' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affected those who fought. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass,' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions.Through a more contemporary lens readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved,' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird,' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things,' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders,' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later attempts to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries) the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey,' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is only good behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple,' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ individuals, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver,' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace,' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of WWII, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye,' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid's Tale,' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in the New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Katie Wedell\n\n'1984,' by George Orwell\n\nOne of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, I read \"1984\" back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can quite frankly show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. This book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. . As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure that the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons that you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games,' (series) by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a young boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have been outrageously dystopian when Collins originally published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time,' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime,' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter,' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger: Themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent rhetoric. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over like they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/us/book-ban-movement-pen-america-report-reaj/index.html", "title": "At least 50 groups in the US advocated to ban books in the past year ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least 50 groups have recently played a role in the evolving movement to have books removed from schools, a new PEN America analysis shows.\n\nPEN America, a literary and free expression advocacy organization, released Monday its latest analysis of bans on school library books and class curricula that have occurred in the 2021-2022 school year.\n\nJonathan Friedman, the director of PEN America’s free expression and education programs and author of the report, said that in the past decade “there was never organization at this scale or with this kind of momentum” but it’s important to understand that these censorship efforts, more often than not, are led by people who are not parents and who only learned about the books online without reading them but demand officials to remove them from shelves.\n\nThe organization identified 50 groups operating at the national, state, or local level that advocate for bans in K-12 schools and said it appears that the majority of those groups formed in the last year. They range from local Facebook or online groups to more established conservative organizations.\n\n“While we think of book bans as the work of individual concerned citizens, our report demonstrates that today’s wave of bans represents a coordinated campaign to banish books being waged by sophisticated, ideological and well-resourced advocacy organizations,” said Suzanne Nossel, chief executive officer of PEN America.\n\nOne of those groups is Moms for Liberty, a conservative group that came together last year to fight for parental rights in Florida and has since spread across the country. PEN America has identified another seven national groups with numerous chapters, as well as 38 groups operating at the state, regional, or community level that appear unaffiliated with the national groups or with one another, the report says.\n\n“Some of the groups espouse Christian nationalist political views, while many have mission statements oriented toward reforming public schools, in some cases to offer more religious education,” according to the report.\n\nFriedman said some of the groups stem from the “anger fomented against schools during the pandemic” as some people shared their frustration over school closures, mask mandates, or vaccines. Other groups “have been around for a long time and have now moved into putting pressure on schools in new ways or with new success,” he said.\n\nMembers of Moms for Liberty have taken to podiums at school board meetings and rallies to protest mask and vaccine mandates, materials in books and curricula related to race and LGBTQ rights, and critical race theory (CRT), among other issues.\n\nPEN America said the actions of these groups can be “linked directly” to at least 20% of the book bans enacted in the 2021-2022 school year. Those actions included members making statements at a school board meetings, submitting list of books for formal reconsideration, or filing paperwork to challenge books with school districts.\n\nWhile people in America have the right to organize and advocate under the First Amendment, PEN America says it’s concerned with how those tactics are being used with “the end goal of restricting or banning books” and how often schools are giving into the groups’ demands without objection.\n\n“Parents and community members play an important role in shaping what students learn in school but this goes far beyond organic expressions of concern or the normal give-and-take between parents and educators in a healthy school environment,” Nossel said. “These groups have made it their mission to undermine educators, sabotage students’ freedom to read and stoke divisive battles that distract from teaching and learning.”\n\nPoliticians want to ban more books. Austin’s library system is celebrating them instead\n\nAs part of its report, PEN America released an updated number of book bans. From July 2021 to June 2022, the group says, there were 2,532 book bans directed at 1,648 different titles.\n\nAbout 41% of those were books that tell stories related to LGBTQ people or that have a queer lead or prominent secondary character, the report says. Another 40% of the titles have main characters who are people of color, while 21% of titles directly address issues of race and racism, the report said.\n\nThe findings are similar to those released last week by the American Library Association, which said efforts to censor books in the US are on track to surpass last year’s count.\n\nThe ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom has tracked 681 attempts to ban or restrict “library resources” in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries nationwide between January 1 and August 31.\n\nBook banning efforts are inspiring readers to form banned book clubs\n\nThe group tracked 729 book challenges in 2021 based on direct reports to the ALA, news coverage and public records. The ALA has said it was the highest number of attempted book bans since the organization began compiling its list of the most challenged books.\n\nThe organization has been collecting data about banned books since 1990, but it has published a list of the most-challenged books since at least 2001.\n\n“The unprecedented number of challenges we’re seeing already this year reflects coordinated, national efforts to silence marginalized or historically underrepresented voices and deprive all of us – young people, in particular – of the chance to explore a world beyond the confines of personal experience,” said ALA President Lessa Kananiʻopua Pelayo-Lozada.", "authors": ["Nicole Chavez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/08/11/wellington-colorado-residents-respond-to-a-possible-book-ban-at-public-library/65398100007/", "title": "Wellington residents respond to a possible book ban at public library", "text": "Extra chairs and palpable tension filled the board room of Wellington's community center Tuesday night as residents walked through the doors of the town's public library and into its Board of Trustee's meeting.\n\nThe room quickly filled with roughly 40 people, many of whom were there to comment on a list of books some residents want banned from Wellington Public Library.\n\nThough a book ban wasn't officially on the board's agenda Tuesday, a list of public records requests from Wellington residents in recent months was made publicly available ahead of the meeting. Among those requests was an inquiry by Christine Gaiter — the wife of Trustee Jon Gaiter — asking when 14 book titles were purchased and made available for checkout. Some of the books on the list were popular titles like E.L. James' \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" Stephen Chbosky's \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" and Toni Morrison's \"The Bluest Eye.\"\n\nThe request gained traction on a Facebook page, Wellington Town Conversations, where several residents speculated there would be an effort to ban books from the library.\n\nTheir suspicions were confirmed at Tuesday's meeting, where multiple people asked for several books to either be banned or made less accessible at the library.\n\nWellington News:Despite community pleas, Wellington won't get another school resource officer\n\nIn her comments Tuesday, Christine Gaiter did not call for an outright ban. She asked the Board of Trustees to remove a list of 19 books from the shelves of the public library and put them where children would not be able to access them without permission from an adult.\n\nThe list Christine Gaiter shared with the Board of Trustees is available at the end of this story.\n\n\"My issue is that these books go into too much graphic detail of a sexual act,\" she said. \"They are not appropriate for children. The library should be a safe place for families and kids.\"\n\nChristine Gaiter also asked the board to develop a review process that every library book has to go through before it's put on the shelf.\n\n\"The library is not being inclusive of my Christian ethics,\" she said. \"There are Christians in this town that think like me. You don't have to agree with us, but I do ask that you respect us and include our views in your decision-making process.\"\n\nMany of the eight public comments in favor of limiting or banning books echoed sentiments she shared around protecting children from adult themes like depictions of rape and sexual assault.\n\nChristine Gaiter used definitions from Wellington's land use code for sexually-oriented businesses to justify her request, saying she believes the books meet the code's definition of adult entertainment and materials that should be in an adult bookstore.\n\nUnder Wellington's land use code, a sexually-oriented business is defined as \"any business where individuals appear in a state in such a manner as to intentionally display specified anatomical areas or encourages specified sexual activities.\" The code goes on to exclude performances that include nudity and \"taken as a whole, contain serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\"\n\nEleven people spoke out against efforts to ban or restrict the books, including parents, teachers and a librarian. Many of them expressed disbelief that the conversation was happening in their town.\n\n\"The issue of banning books is directly before us tonight,\" said Heather Zadina, a Wellington resident who spoke out against removing the books from the library. \"Is this how we want to be known?\"\n\nZadina spoke about her teenage daughter and how she sees her role as a parent as being there to answer questions her daughter might have while reading. Other parents in the room said they'd rather read the books with their children and discuss the difficult topics and that it's their right to have that option.\n\n\"We don't live in a vacuum, these things happen to people whether we like it or not,\" Zadina said. \"Turning a blind eye doesn't prevent them. We're telling victims their voices are not to be heard.\"\n\nAnother resident who spoke out against removing the books was Lauren Reisfeld, an assistant media manager at the Wellington Public Library. Reisfeld said she spoke Tuesday night outside of her capacity as a town employee, but rather as a concerned resident.\n\n\"Access is one of the most critical things libraries bring to the world today,\" Reisfeld said. \"Access to resources for people who are in bad situations. Libraries need to be able to provide these books to certain people.\"\n\nShe went on to say that if the board were to ban these books, it would open the door for anyone to remove books they might find distasteful. \"This could lead us down a path I don't think anyone wants to go down.\"\n\nTrustee Jon Gaiter was the only board member to speak about the potential book ban, saying some of the issues residents raised were concerning to him personally.\n\n\"We need to set up a time to discuss these issues so our library's role is clear and defined,\" he said.\n\nSome Wellington residents questioned whether Jon Gaiter should be allowed to take action on the issue, considering it was brought forth by his wife and could be considered a conflict of interest. The board did not say whether it would officially take action on the issue.\n\nWellington News:Wellington receives $1.8 million to make downtown areas safer\n\nFor some, the effort to ban books is another sign of Wellington's growing pains\n\nSeveral Wellington residents spoke about pervasive divisions in the town illustrated by the possible book ban as well as a series of citizen-led petitions the board recently gave approval to begin gathering signatures. Those petitions include one to limit elections to in-person voting and paper ballots only and another to ban marijuana sales in the town of Wellington after voters in November narrowly approved a repeal of the town's previous ban on dispensaries.\n\nOne petition looks to prohibit the town from giving monetary donations to individuals or nonprofit organizations, while another looks to repeal sections of the town's municipal code that dictate permit requirements for water usage and seeks to ban the town from limiting water usage or engaging in water conservation efforts. Christine Gaiter's name is listed on that petition, but she didn't speak about it during her public comment Tuesday night.\n\nWellington is one of Northern Colorado's rapidly growing towns, having almost doubled in population over the last decade. Residents on either side of the book issue alluded to watching their beloved town change and with it, experience growing pains impacting residents' abilities to come together.\n\n\"I've lived in Colorado for 71 years. I love this state but I've seen a lot of problems over the last several years,\" said John Walsby.\n\nWhat books do people want banned, restricted at Wellington Public Library?\n\nThe titles listed below were provided to the Coloradoan by Christine Gaiter and come from a list she said she shared with Wellington's Board of Trustees. This comprehensive list does not match the list of titles on Gaiter's public records request.\n\nGaiter said she selected these titles from a list of books she found online after hearing in the news parents were trying to remove these titles from public school libraries. Gaiter said she then searched for titles available at the Wellington Public Library.\n\n\"Speak,\" by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\n\"Shout,\" by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\n\"The Testaments,\" by Margaret Atwood\n\n\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" by Stephen Chbosky\n\n\"Looking for Alaska,\" by John Green\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" by E.L.

On Monday, the ALA released its list of the most challenged titles\n\nThe majority of books were called inappropriate because some people considered them to be sexually explicit, have sexually explicit images or include sexual references. Some books dealt with the LGBTQ experience, and one was challenged for allegedly promoting \"an anti-police message,\" the ALA said.\n\nHere's the ALA's top 10 list of 2021's most-challenged books:\n\nThe organization has been collecting data about banned books since 1990, but it has published the list since at least 2001. The lists are based on media stories and reports sent to the ALA by libraries and schools.\n\nALA President Patricia Wong said last year the organization tracked the highest number of attempted book bans since her organization began compiling its list of the most challenged books.\n\nLast year, there were 729 challenges to library, school and university materials and services. That's up from 156 and 377 challenges reported to the ALA in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nBut a challenge doesn't mean a book is removed from library shelves or classrooms. It's an \"attempt to remove or restrict materials, based upon the objections of a person or group\" and many times those efforts are unsuccessful, the ALA said.\n\nWhile the ALA supports parents' decisions over their child's reading and believes they should not have those choices dictated by others, Wong said students' access to books should not be restricted.\n\n\"Young people need to have access to a variety of books from which they can learn about different perspectives. So, despite this organized effort to ban books, libraries remain ready to do what we always have: make knowledge and ideas available so people are free to choose what to read,\" Wong said in a statement.\n\nCriticism switched from racial justice to gender identity\n\nParents went from taking issue with books that mostly dealt with racism and racial justice in 2020 to a greater focus on books that discuss gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nThe most-challenged book of 2021 was \"Gender Queer\" by Maia Kobabe, which discusses the non-binary author's journey with her own identity. Kobabe's book has been banned or challenged from school libraries in at least a dozen states.\n\nThe most-challenged book of 2021 was \"Gender Queer\" by Maia Kobabe.\n\nKobabe previously told CNN he wants people who are calling \"Gender Queer\" pornography to read the whole book.\n\n\"Read the whole thing and judge for yourself, don't just go based on the one or two tiny clips you've seen on social media,\" Kobabe said.\n\nThree other books included in the 2021 list -- \"All Boys Aren't Blue,\" \"Lawn Boy,\" and \"The Bluest Eye\" -- were the subject of a lawsuit filed earlier this year by two students in Missouri.\n\nThe students sued their school district in February over the decision to remove a total of eight books from school libraries. The district argued the novels were banned because they discuss issues surrounding race, gender and sexual identity, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"What is at stake when we ban these books are actual lives who need to read their story...\" author George M. Johnson told CNN.\n\nFor George M. Johnson, the author of \"All Boys Aren't Blue,\" the numerous challenges to their book and its inclusion on the ALA's list signal how important their work for students and teens.\n\n\"Banning my book won't stop me from existing, my story from existing, or future generations of kids of like me existing,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"What is at stake when we ban these books are actual lives who need to read their story and about characters like them so they too know they can exist and thrive in this world,\" they added.\n\nThe list, Johnson said, is empowering them to write even more stories.", "authors": ["Nicole Chavez"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/us/banned-book-clubs-cec/index.html", "title": "Book banning efforts are inspiring readers to form banned book ...", "text": "(CNN) When Joslyn Diffenbaugh learned about efforts in Texas to remove certain books from school libraries and classrooms, she was surprised by the titles that were being challenged.\n\nAn avid reader, the 8th grader from Kutztown, Pennsylvania, said she had read several of the books in question. Among the titles that had come under attack in recent years were \"The Hate U Give,\" a novel about a young Black girl who grapples with racism and police brutality, and \"All American Boys,\" a novel about two teenagers -- one Black and one White -- who contend with similar issues.\n\nThose books had been eye-opening for Diffenbaugh, exposing her to realities that she might not otherwise have encountered. That some parents and politicians were trying to limit other young people's understanding of such issues as racism was concerning to her.\n\n\"The reason these books are being banned are the reasons why they should probably be read,\" the 14-year-old said she was thinking at the time.\n\nThe recent wave of book challenges inspired Diffenbaugh to join forces with the local Firefly Bookstore and start the Banned Book Club. Since January, she and other young people in her area have been meeting every other week to discuss classic and contemporary titles that have been contested.\n\nThe community is one of several banned book clubs that have formed in response to a growing push from the right to control what titles young people have access to. And it points to an ironic effect: The more certain books are singled out, the more people want to read them.\n\nOne club hopes readers find themselves in banned books\n\nBook banning -- or at least, book banning attempts -- appears to be having a resurgence.\n\nThe American Library Association recorded 729 challenges to library, school and university materials and services in 2021, the most since the organization began tracking those attempts in 2000. While that might seem low overall considering the approximately 99,000 K-12 public schools in the US, the ALA says it's likely an extreme undercount\n\nIn recent months, conservative local and state officials have taken aim both at specific titles and broad categories of books that deal with race, gender or sexuality . And while attempts to remove those books from library shelves or classrooms haven't all been successful, the efforts themselves have garnered interest in banned books from readers across the country.\n\nThat was the impetus for the Banned Books Book Club , a project from the company Reclamation Ventures, which also runs the newsletter Anti-Racism Daily. Nicole Cardoza, the company's founder and CEO, said that young readers of the newsletter had increasingly been asking for resources on how they might engage with books being targeted for removal.\n\n\"This conservative pushback is actually generating a lot of interest in books that might not be something the average student is being exposed to otherwise,\" she said. \"[We want to] help connect more people to the stories that matter most -- that reflect marginalized experiences that they might not hear otherwise.\"\n\nMany of the books that have been challenged recently center Black or LGBTQ characters, and Cardoza said she hopes that members of the Banned Books Book Club might find parts of themselves reflected in the books that are chosen. The club, which launched in early April and plans to meet virtually once a month, is reading \"The Hate U Give\" as its first pick.\n\n\"The Hate U Give\" by Angie Thomas is the first pick for the Banned Books Book Club, a new project from the company Reclamation Ventures.\n\n\"The book has been around for a while and it reflects a teenage experience and relationship to police brutality, which has been such a strong conversation of the past couple of years,\" Cardoza said. \"We thought it was a really great way to center the intention around the book club.\"\n\nBeyond that, the team has a list of 20 or so books that it hopes to cover over the next two years, including \"Gender Queer\" by Maia Kobabe and \"Cinderella is Dead\" by Kalynn Bayron for their explorations of queer and non-binary experiences. They want such books to be available to anyone, which is why the project also includes a banned books library through which readers can access discussion guides and request free copies of titles.\n\nOther clubs have been talking about censorship\n\nFor some banned book clubs, recent book banning attempts have been a springboard for wider discussions around censorship.\n\nThe Banned Book Club at Firefly Bookstore read George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" as its first pick. While the satirical novella, which makes a pointed critique of totalitarianism, isn't one of the books currently being challenged in the US, it was banned in the Soviet Union until its fall and was rejected for publication in the UK during its wartime alliance with the USSR. And it faced challenges in Florida in the '80s for being \"pro-communist.\" That history made for some thought-provoking conversations.\n\nJoslyn Diffenbaugh, an 8th grader from Kutztown, Pennsylvania, started a banned book club after reading about banning efforts around the country.\n\n\"It taught a lot because it had references to different forms of government that maybe some adults didn't like their kids reading about, even though it was run by pigs,\" Diffenbaugh said. \"I really thought it shouldn't have been banned for those reasons, or at all.\"\n\nTeenagers at the Common Ground Teen Center in Washington, Pennsylvania, formed a banned book club soon after a Tennessee school district voted to remove \"Maus\" from an eighth grade curriculum. But while the graphic novel about the Holocaust was the catalyst for the club, says director Mary Jo Podgurski, the first title they chose to read was, fittingly, \" Fahrenheit 451 \" -- the 1953 dystopian novel about government censorship that itself has been challenged over the years.\n\n\"Obviously this whole idea of taking away books that they wanted to read or that they thought they should read sparked a nerve in them,\" said Podgurski, an educator and counselor who oversees the Common Ground Teen Center.\n\nHunter Jenkins, left, and Rowan Curry are members of the Common Grounds Teen Center Book Club.\n\nThe young people at the center take turns choosing a book and facilitating the discussion, while Podgurski helps guide the conversations. They talk about the message of the book, and why some might have found it objectionable. Since reading \"Fahrenheit 451,\" the club has also discussed \"Animal Farm\" and \"1984,\" which has been challenged for its political themes and sexual content. So far, the young readers at the Common Ground Teen Center have been puzzled as to why those books were once deemed inappropriate.\n\n\"I often wonder, do adults understand what kids have in their phones?\" Podgurski said. \"They have access to everything. Saying 'don't read this book' shows that you're not understanding teen culture. Young people have access to much information. What they need is an adult to help them process it.\"\n\nThey see value in reading banned books\n\nThe Banned Book Club at King's Books in Tacoma, Washington, has long understood the value in reading banned books. Though recent headlines have attracted new interest in the club, the group has been meeting monthly for more than a decade.\n\nDavid Rafferty, who has been coordinating the club since 2014, said he first joined because he was looking for a space to engage with deeper subjects that might not come up in casual conversation. While many book challenges today take aim at young adult novels that depict the harsh realities of racism or that grapple with gender identity, the Banned Book Club at King's Books has discussed titles that faced pushback for all kinds of reasons.\n\nOne of the first books that Rafferty read through the club was Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" which has been challenged for decades over concerns that it contributes to racial stereotypes . The meaningful conversations that came out of that meeting turned him into a regular member.\n\n\"It does use a racial slur -- the N-word -- fairly often and casually,\" Rafferty said. \"We've gotten into some interesting discussions about whether or not that was more used at the time and whether [Twain] is trying to reflect the time, whether or not the book itself was racist.\"\n\nMore recently, the club has read \"The Color Purple,\" which has been banned for its depictions of homosexuality and sexual assault, as well as \"The Call of The Wild,\" which has been challenged for its depictions of animal cruelty and violence. But as Rafferty sees it, it's better to read and discuss than to avoid tough subjects altogether.\n\n\"People want to shield their children from certain topics like sexual assault, sexual explicitness, profanity, racism, LGBTQ [issues],\" he said. \"My argument is that children and teenagers are going to be dealing with us in some form or another, and the books give them a chance to experience it or learn about it before they actually have to deal with it directly. So when they do have to deal with it, they can deal with it better.\"\n\nThe teenagers in banned book clubs agree. Lizzy Brison, a member of the club at the Common Ground Teen Center, said she understands why some books might merit extra care and caution when it comes to younger readers. But she feels removing them from shelves is a step too far.\n\n\"They're protecting what they think is innocence but in reality, they're just limiting children to what they can access with their own identity,\" Brison, who is in 10th grade, said. \"It's gonna be uncomfortable to help a child through that process. But it's going to be worth it in the end, because your child will end up knowing who they are and where they belong in the world.\"\n\nDiffenbaugh, too, has a desire to better understand the world around her. So she plans to keep reading.\n\n\"You're going to come across people who are of a different race. You're going to come across people who may have a different gender identity. It's a way that you can understand them more as people,\" she said. \"All these books that are being banned are about present issues. If we can read them now, we have that knowledge for the future.\"", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/06/26/lgbtq-books-access-school-bans/7532933001/", "title": "LGBTQ books are being banned from schools.

To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here .\n\nThe book banning boom continues.\n\nAlready, the number of attempts this year to censor books in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries is on track to eclipse 2021's record count , the American Library Association said on Friday. The ALA cataloged 681 attempts between January 1 and August 31; the 2021 tally was 729.\n\nFurther, PEN America, a literary and free expression organization, identified in a report released on Monday at least 50 groups at the national, state or local level that have advocated for book bans in recent months.\n\nMany of these efforts seek to pull books with LGBTQ characters or themes -- think Maia Kobabe's \" Gender Queer \" or George M. Johnson's \" All Boys Aren't Blue \" -- and are part of a broader, conservative-led movement to chisel away at the rights and status of LGBTQ Americans.\n\n(Notably, the aforementioned groups also target titles that grapple with race and racism, including Toni Morrison's debut novel, \" The Bluest Eye .\")\n\nA CNN analysis this year of data gathered by the American Civil Liberties Union found that, through July 1, lawmakers across dozens of mostly Republican-controlled states had introduced at least 162 anti-LGBTQ bills -- a record -- that would together limit classroom instruction about LGBTQ-related topics and bar transgender athletes' participation in school sports, among other things.\n\nTo further parse the campaign against books that tell LGBTQ stories, I spoke with Anthony Michael Kreis , a law professor at Georgia State University whose interests include civil rights and anti-discrimination. During our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, we talked about how today's book banning efforts fit into a long US history of marginalizing certain groups and can disadvantage young people in the long run.\n\nWhat do you make of the ongoing attempts to restrict books with LGBTQ protagonists or themes?\n\nI think that we're seeing a relaunch of an old story, which is that sexual minorities are \" groomers \" and predatory and that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherently sexual.\n\nThis story is being repackaged, but it's also being weaponized in a way I think is a bit different now.\n\nIn the 1990s, for instance, these narratives and themes were used largely to scare people into rejecting LGBTQ rights and in particular nondiscrimination laws. One thing that's different now is that, with social media being so prevalent and with the various ways we can interact with one another, we're not necessarily seeing a broad allegation against the entire LGBTQ community. It's an allegation targeted directly at individuals -- a great degree of hatefulness is being projected at individuals in a way I don't think we've really seen before.\n\nSo, you could be a teacher in a small town in Virginia or in a big city such as Chicago or Atlanta and suddenly you might have an account with a million followers targeting you and saying that you're something you're objectively not.\n\nCould you give me more examples of past instances of this kind of anti-LGBTQ animus? I'd argue that there are sonorous echoes between the 1970s and today, for instance.\n\nIn the 1970s in particular, there was a major movement from social conservatives to keep gay and lesbian teachers out of classrooms. There was a major statewide initiative in California . There was, of course, Anita Bryant in Florida\n\nThe animus that was driving those campaigns was, We need to keep gays and lesbians out of classrooms precisely because they're an inherent danger to our children. They're predatory. They're recruiting.\n\nIn many respects, what's happening now isn't a new invention.\n\nIn important ways, we can detect backlash dynamics, right? People are mobilizing against hard-won LGBTQ equality.\n\nWhen minority groups and people who challenge the status quo gain a foothold, there will often be calls to oppose that progress. I think that we're seeing those dynamics now.\n\nWhat concerns do you have about how book bans might affect young people?\n\nWell, tolerance is something we usually learn in our early school years. We reflect on who we are by engaging with the world, and we learn from others. So, suppressing a particular viewpoint or suppressing a particular group's identity inhibits that natural educational process.\n\nOften throughout US history, schools have been very contentious spaces. People fought desegregation in public schools because they feared that children in integrated schools would learn that there are more similarities than differences across people and then there would be friendships and marriages that would destabilize the social order.\n\nI think that we're seeing another iteration of that now. There's a fear that if kids grow up seeing that sexuality or gender expression exists on a spectrum and that there's nothing wrong with that, we'll have a society that just accepts that. So, schools become the first line of defense because of how informative those early years are not only for how children think but also for how society evolves.", "authors": ["Analysis Brandon Tensley"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA stellar nursery where stars are born, interactions between galaxies and a unique view of an exoplanet are just some of the new cosmic images were shared Tuesday.\n\nAfter decades of waiting, it’s finally time for the world to see the first images taken by the most powerful space telescope ever – the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nDevelopment of the world’s premier space observatory began in 2004, and after years of delays, the telescope and its massive gold mirror finally launched on December 25.\n\nThe images are worth the wait – and they will forever change the way we see the universe.\n\nPresident Joe Biden released one of Webb’s first images on Monday, and it is “the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,” according to NASA. The rest of the high-resolution color images made their debut on Tuesday.\n\nThe space observatory can investigate the mysteries of the universe by observing them through infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nWebb will peer into the very atmospheres of exoplanets, some of which are potentially habitable, and it could uncover clues in the ongoing search for life outside of Earth.\n\nThe telescope will also look at every phase of cosmic history, including the first glows after the big bang that created our universe and the formation of the galaxies, stars and planets that fill it today.\n\nNow, Webb is ready to help us understand the origins of the universe and begin to answer key questions about our existence, such as where we came from and if we’re alone in the cosmos.\n\nThe first images\n\nThe first image, released on Monday, shows SMACS 0723, where a massive group of galaxy clusters act as a magnifying glass for the objects behind them. Called gravitational lensing, this created Webb’s first deep field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies.\n\nThe image of SMACS 0723 is \"the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,\" according to NASA. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nSome of these distant galaxies and star clusters have never been seen before. The galaxy cluster is shown as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe image, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera, is composed of images taken at different wavelengths of light over a collective 12.5 hours. Deep field observations are lengthy observations of regions of the sky that can reveal faint objects.\n\nWebb’s other primary targets for the first image release included the Carina Nebula, WASP-96 b, the Southern Ring Nebula and Stephan’s Quintet.\n\nWebb’s study of the giant gas planet WASP-96 b is the most detailed spectrum of an exoplanet to date. The spectrum includes different wavelengths of light that reveal new information about the planet and its atmosphere. Discovered in 2014, WASP-96 b is located 1,150 light-years from Earth. It has half the mass of Jupiter and completes an orbit around its star every 3.4 days.\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope captured a spectrum of WASP-96 b. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nWebb’s spectrum includes “the distinct signature of water, along with evidence for clouds and haze, in the atmosphere surrounding a hot, puffy gas giant planet orbiting a distant Sun-like star,” according to NASA.\n\nThe observation demonstrates “Webb’s unprecedented ability to analyze atmospheres hundreds of light-years away,” according to NASA.\n\nIn the future, Webb will capture actual images of known exoplanets while also searching for unknown planets, said Knicole Colón, Webb deputy project scientist for exoplanet science at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, during a news conference. And the spectrium of WASP-96 b is “barely scratching the surface of what we’re going to learn.”\n\nColón anticipates that scientists will determine just how much water is in the exoplanet’s atmosphere.\n\nThe Southern Ring Nebula, also called the “Eight-Burst,” is 2,000 light-years away from Earth. This large planetary nebula includes an expanding cloud of gas around a dying star. Webb helped reveal previously hidden details about the nebula, which is a shell of gas and dust released by the dying star. The nebula’s second star can be seen in the Webb image, as well as how the stars shape the gas and dust cloud.\n\nNASA\n\nThe second star is surrounded by dust while the brighter star, at an earlier stage of evolution, will release its own cloud of gas and dust later on. As the two stars orbit one another, they effectively “stir” the gas and dust, resulting in the patterns seen in the image.\n\nThe insights from images like this could help astronomers to unlock how stars change their environments as they evolve. Multi-colored points of light in the background represent galaxies.\n\nThe space telescope’s view of Stephan’s Quintet shows the way galaxies interact with one another. This compact galaxy group, first discovered in 1877, is located 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus. Four of the five galaxies in the group “are locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters,” according to a NASA statement.\n\nNASA\n\nIf you’ve ever watched “It’s a Wonderful Life,” you’ve seen Stephan’s Quintet. Now, Webb has revealed the galactic grouping in a new mosaic which is the telescope’s largest image to date.\n\n“The information from Webb provides new insights into how galactic interactions may have driven galaxy evolution in the early universe,” according to NASA.\n\nThe Stephan’s Quintet image provides a rare glimpse into how galaxies can trigger star formation in one another when they interact, as well as outflows driven by a black hole at a new level of detail.\n\nThe gravitational dance between these galaxies can be seen through tails of gas, dust and stars and even shock waves as one of the galaxies pushes through the cluster.\n\nLocated 7,600 light-years away, the Carina Nebula is a stellar nursery, where stars are born. It is one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky and home to many stars much more massive than our sun.\n\nNow, its “Cosmic Cliffs” are revealed in an incredible new Webb image.\n\nNASA\n\nWebb’s ability to see through cosmic dust has revealed previously invisible areas of star birth within the nebula, which could provide new insight on the formation of stars. The earliest stages of star formation are harder to capture – but something Webb’s sensitivity can chronicle.\n\nWhat looks like a landscape in the image is really a massive gaseous cavity with “peaks” reaching 7 light-years high.\n\n“The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image,” according to NASA. And what looks like “steam” rising off the “mountains” is hot, energetic gas and dust.\n\nThe targets were selected by an international committee, including members from NASA, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:50 - Source: CNN 'I'm a little verklempt': Analyst breaks down stunning new Webb telescope images\n\nA long future of observation\n\nThe mission, originally expected to last for 10 years, has enough excess fuel capability to operate for 20 years, according to NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy.\n\nThese will be just the first of many images to come from Webb over the next two decades, which promises to fundamentally alter the way we understand the cosmos.\n\nWhile some of what Webb could reveal has been anticipated, the unknowns are just as exciting to scientists.\n\n“We don’t know what we don’t know yet,” said Amber Straughn, Webb deputy project scientist for communications at NASA Goddard. “I think it’s true that every time we launch a revolutionary instrument into space, like with Hubble, we learn things that completely surprise us but do cause us to sort of change our fundamental understanding of how the universe works.”\n\nHubble’s 31 years have yielded a wealth of discoveries that couldn’t be anticipated, and the scientific community views Webb and its capabilities in the same way.\n\nWhen comparing Webb’s first images to other breakthroughs in astronomy, Webb program scientist and NASA Astrophysics Division chief scientist Eric Smith compared it to seeing Hubble’s images after the telescope was repaired and everything snapped into focus.\n\n“A lot of people sometimes see pictures of space and they think it makes them feel small,” Smith said. “When I see these pictures, they make me feel powerful. A team of people can make this unbelievable instrument to find out things about the universe revealed here, and just seeing that pride in the team, and pride in humanity, that when we want to, we can do that.”\n\n“The universe has (always) been out there,” said Jane Rigby, Webb operations project scientist at NASA Goddard. “We just had to build a telescope to go see what was there. Yeah, very similar feeling of, maybe, people in a broken world managing to do something right and to see some of the majesty that is out there.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/world/neptune-james-webb-space-telescope-new-images-scn/index.html", "title": "James Webb Space Telescope captures strikingly crisp images of ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nNew images released Wednesday from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope are revealing Neptune, and the planet’s hard-to-detect rings, in a fresh light.\n\n“It has been three decades since we last saw these faint, dusty rings, and this is the first time we’ve seen them in the infrared,” said Heidi Hammel, a Neptune expert and interdisciplinary scientist on the Webb project, in a news release.\n\nIn addition to several crisp, narrow rings, the Webb images show Neptune’s fainter dust bands. Some of the rings haven’t been observed since NASA’s Voyager 2 got the first photographic proof of the existence of Neptune’s rings during its flyby in 1989.\n\nDark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, Neptune is the most distant planet in our solar system. The planet and its neighbor Uranus are known as “ice giants” because their interiors are made up of heavier elements than the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, which are richer in hydrogen and helium.\n\nIn the new images, Neptune looks white, as opposed to the typical blue appearance it has in views captured at visible wavelengths of light. This is because gaseous methane, part of the planet’s chemical makeup, doesn’t appear blue to Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam).\n\nIn this image by Webb's Near-Infrared Camera, a smattering of hundreds of background galaxies, varying in size and shape, appear alongside Neptune. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nAlso visible in the images are methane-ice clouds – bright streaks and spots that reflect sunlight before it is absorbed by methane gas. It’s also possible to spot a bright, thin line circling the planet’s equator, which could be “a visual signature of global atmospheric circulation that powers Neptune’s winds and storms,” according to the release.\n\nWebb also captured seven of Neptune’s 14 known moons, including its largest moon, Triton, which moves around the planet at an unusual backward orbit. Astronomers think Triton was perhaps an object in the Kuiper Belt – a region of icy objects at the edge of the solar system – that fell into Neptune’s gravitational grasp. Scientists plan to use Webb to further study Triton and Neptune in the coming years.\n\nLocated 30 times farther from the sun than Earth, Neptune moves through its solar orbit in the remote, dark region of the outer solar system. At that distance, the sun is so small and faint that noon on Neptune is similar to a dim twilight on Earth, the news release said.\n\nWebb is a more than 10-year mission run by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nCompared with other telescopes, the space observatory’s massive mirror can see fainter galaxies that are farther away and has the potential to enhance scientists’ understanding of the origins of the universe.

It looks white in the image due to the processing of the infrared image.\n\nEuropa, one of Jupiter's moons, is visible to the left of the planet. The shadow of the moon also makes a cameo left of the Great Red Spot.\n\nJupiter, center, and its moon Europa, left, are seen through the Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument.\n\n\"I couldn't believe that we saw everything so clearly, and how bright they were,\" said Stefanie Milam, Webb's deputy project scientist for planetary science based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in a statement.\n\n\"It's really exciting to think of the capability and opportunity that we have for observing these kinds of objects in our solar system.\"\n\nSome of the telescope's other perspectives of Jupiter revealed some of the planet's faint rings .

Their work is part of an international collaboration for Webb’s Early Release Science program.\n\nWebb photos were the result of over 20 years of work\n\nThe first photo from the Webb telescope, labeled SMACS 0723, was released by President Joe Biden on July 12. It shows a dizzying array of galaxies never before seen by humans.\n\n“That image is just kind of scratching the surface of what Webb is going to do,” Rieke said.\n\nIndeed, the pictures that soon followed were just as dazzling, showing in vivid detail various nebulae, galactic clusters and a black hole, all representing various stages of the universe’s history.\n\nThe release of the remarkable photos, which have astonished the scientific community and the world at large, holds special significance for Rieke. The images represent the culmination of over 20 years of work in infrared imaging.\n\nRieke and her team were responsible for developing and testing the NIRCam, the primary imager for the Webb telescope. The NIRCam is what makes the Webb so special, allowing scientists to see crucial wavelengths of light that can reveal even more of the universe than can be observed in visible light.\n\nMore:She's honoring her father by getting young girls outdoors, just like he did for her\n\nHow Rieke got involved with the James Webb Telescope\n\nRieke has had a lifelong love for science and outer space, from her early years growing up in Michigan and reading science fiction books to taking her first college classes in cosmology.\n\nAfter getting her undergraduate and master's degrees in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, she established herself as a leading scholar in infrared astronomy, instrument development and public policy related to space exploration.\n\nShe developed groundbreaking research on infrared observations of the center of the Milky Way galaxy and worked on the Hubble Space Telescope, the predecessor to the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nRieke came to the University of Arizona in 1976 as a postdoctoral fellow. Today she is a Regents Professor of astronomy teaching postdoctoral students at the university’s Steward Observatory in Tucson. The Regents Professor title is the university's highest recognition of academic merit.\n\nRieke first got involved with the Webb telescope project in 1998 when the idea was just being formulated. She was part of a committee that discussed everything the telescope would comprise.\n\nIn 2002 she and her team submitted a proposal for the NIRCam, one of four imaging devices on the telescope, to NASA. In 2007 Rieke helped lead her team in building the NIRCam, which was delivered to the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland in 2013.\n\n'It was nerve-wracking for the first 20 years'\n\nDespite having contributed to the Hubble Space Telescope, Rieke said the long and arduous work on the Webb telescope was a lot of pressure. It was, she says, literally a leap into the unknown.\n\n“It was nerve-wracking for the first 20 years when we weren't sure that everything was going to work,” she said.\n\nThe exultation of seeing the first images have given way to even more pressure. Everyone wants to know what the images signify.\n\n“The pressure now is to analyze them quickly and to get on with why you got involved in the first place and to actually reap the benefit of having done all this,” Rieke said.\n\nMore:The case for losing yourself in the NASA photos, the perfect antidote to doomscrolling\n\nHow far can the Webb Telescope see?\n\nFor most space objects, the term light-years is used to describe their distance from Earth. (One light-year is about 6 trillion miles.) Rieke likes to frame the concept differently: What we are seeing from the Webb telescope is equivalent to looking back in time.\n\n“It can see objects that might have formed a hundred million years after the Big Bang,” Rieke said.\n\nThat means the Webb Telescope is offering an intimate look into the very beginnings of the universe, something not previously possible.\n\nRieke’s NIRCam, and the other imaging devices on the Webb telescope, work by by capturing images of infrared energy given off by objects in space. Infrared light is not visible to the human eye. Humans can only see a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum (visible light).\n\nMore: This Tempe scientist-teacher will ride on SpaceX's first private flight\n\nWhat has the James Webb telescope discovered?\n\nOne image that Rieke points out is of the Carina Nebula, one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky. It's over 7,600 light-years from earth. According to Rieke, the image of Carina shows intimate details of the star formation process.\n\nAnother image shows never-before-seen details of Stephan’s Quintet, a visual grouping of five galaxies over 290 million light-years away.\n\n“If you talk to an astronomer, you will discover that each of these images has a different story to tell,” she said.\n\nWhat will the Webb telescope reveal next?\n\nWhile Rieke waits for the next images, expected to come in September, she is excited about what the Webb telescope may reveal in the coming years. The telescope is expected to be operational for at least 20 years.\n\n“There's going to be so much to learn about the universe,” Rieke said.\n\nRieke and her team have laid out a program in which they will survey a small patch of sky, exposing the photos for several weeks at a time. Their goal is to peer back to the beginnings of the universe.\n\n“What we want to do is indeed find these distant galaxies, the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang,\" Rieke said. “And to be able to prove that is the tricky part. So we're still thinking through how to use our data best to show that we have, in fact, found the very first galaxies.”\n\nIs there life on other planets?\n\nWith so much interest and awe around the Webb telescope's images, Rieke hears the question: Will we find life on other planets? She says it's a common topic in her field but not one that can be answered just yet.\n\n“People would very much like to be able to say that they found life somewhere else,” Rieke said. “But right now that’s very difficult.\n\n\"With Webb, probably the best we can do is we'll be able to say there's a planet orbiting some star and that planet's characteristics, including its atmosphere, match those of Earth. That's not the same thing as saying there's life there, but you should be able to find a place very much like home.\n\n“It could happen this year, or it may take several years. People have picked out promising targets, but it takes a while to measure them and to analyze them. But I think it's within our capabilities to do it.”\n\nWhere is the Webb telescope now?\n\nFor more information on where the James Webb telescope is, events, observation schedules and facts visit https://jwst.nasa.gov.\n\nYou can connect with Arizona Republic Culture and Outdoors Reporter Shanti Lerner through email at shanti.lerner@gannett.com or you can also follow her on Twitter.\n\nSupport local journalism like this story by subscribing today.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/22/nasa-james-webb-telescope-new-images-jupiter/7866601001/", "title": "New James Webb Telescope images show off Jupiter's auroras, moon", "text": "The James Webb Telescope has taken some of the clearest images beyond the Milky Way, but its most recent photos took a very detailed look at the king of our solar system – Jupiter.\n\nThe images, released by NASA on Monday, were taken using the telescope's near-infrared camera, which has three infrared filters \"that showcase details of the planet\" that can't be seen by the human eye.\n\nThe first image released is a collection of images taken from Jupiter against the darkness of space.

It is one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky and home to many stars much more massive than our sun.\n\nWebb's study of the giant gas planet WASP-96b will be the first full-color spectrum of an exoplanet. The spectrum will include different wavelengths of light that could reveal new information about the planet, such as whether it has an atmosphere. Discovered in 2014, WASP-96b is located 1,150 light-years from Earth. It has half the mass of Jupiter and completes an orbit around its star every 3.4 days.\n\nThis test image was taken by Webb's Fine Guidance Sensor over a period of eight days at the beginning of May. It shows how Webb can capture detailed images of very faint objects.\n\nThe Southern Ring Nebula, also called the \"Eight-Burst,\" is 2,000 light-years away from Earth. This large planetary nebula includes an expanding cloud of gas around a dying star.\n\nThe space telescope's view of Stephan's Quintet will reveal the way galaxies interact with one another. This compact galaxy group, first discovered in 1877, is located 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus. Four of the five galaxies in the group \"are locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters,\" according to a NASA statement.\n\nThe targets were selected by an international committee, including members from NASA, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThese will be the first of many images to come from Webb, the most powerful telescope ever launched into space. The mission, originally expected to last for 10 years, has enough excess fuel capability to operate for 20 years, according to NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy.\n\n\"Webb can see backwards in time just after the big bang by looking for galaxies that are so far away, the light has taken many billions of years to get from those galaxies to ourselves,\" said Jonathan Gardner, Webb deputy senior project scientist at NASA, during a recent news conference. \"Webb is bigger than Hubble so that it can see fainter galaxies that are further away.\"\n\nThe initial goal for the telescope was to see the first stars and galaxies of the universe, essentially watching \"the universe turn the lights on for the first time,\" said Eric Smith, Webb program scientist and NASA Astrophysics Division chief scientist.\n\nSmith has worked on Webb since the project began in the mid-1990s.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/16/world/webb-images-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "title": "Webb telescope's first photos reveal unseen aspects of the universe ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's Wonder Theory newsletter.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more\n\n(CNN) Astronomers have captured the first direct image of an exoplanet with the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nThe exoplanet, or planet outside of our solar system, is a gas giant about six to 12 times the mass of Jupiter. The planet, called HIP 65426 b, is about 15 to 20 million years old -- just a baby planet when compared to cEarth, which is 4.5 billion years old.\n\nIt's located about 385 light-years away from Earth.\n\nThe planet can be seen in four different bands of infrared light as taken by Webb's different instruments. Webb sees the universe in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye -- and makes it the perfect space observatory to reveal details about distant worlds.\n\n\"This is a transformative moment, not only for Webb but also for astronomy generally,\" said Sasha Hinkley, associate professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, in a statement.\n\nHinkley led the observations within an international collaboration.\n\nThe exoplanet was first discovered in 2017 using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and its SPHERE instrument, located in Chile. The instrument took images of the planet then through short infrared wavelengths, but Webb's ability to see longer infrared wavelengths can shed light on new details.\n\nScientists are analyzing Webb's data of HIP 65426 b and a forthcoming study will be submitted to journals for peer review.\n\nThe exoplanet is about 100 times farther from its host star than Earth is from the sun, which allowed Webb and its instruments to separate the planet from its star. Some of Webb's instruments are armed with coronagraphs, or masks that can block starlight, enabling the telescope to capture direct images of exoplanets.\n\nStars are much brighter than planets and in this case, HIP 65426 b is more than 10,000 times fainter than its host star in near-infrared light.\n\n\"Obtaining this image felt like digging for space treasure,\" said Aarynn Carter, analysis lead for the images and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in a statement. \"At first all I could see was light from the star, but with careful image processing I was able to remove that light and uncover the planet.\"\n\nAnd the space observatory only began making scientific observations this summer.\n\n\"I think what's most exciting is that we've only just begun,\" Carter said. \"There are many more images of exoplanets to come that will shape our overall understanding of their physics, chemistry, and formation. We may even discover previously unknown planets, too.\"", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}]}

The video, circulating on social media, shows a seemingly distressed inmate on the edge of a roof at a building at Elmore Correctional Facility, while a group of prison staff look at him from the ground. An officer walks across the roof and drags the inmate back from the edge, then appears to punch him several times. Officer Ell White has been placed on mandatory leave pending investigation, a spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in an email. The prison system said Jimmy K. Norman, a 44-year-old inmate, “had climbed on top of the facility chapel, prompting Officer White and other correctional officers to attempt to escort Norman off the roof.” The Law Enforcement Services Division of the Alabama Department of Corrections is investigating the incident and response by staff, the prison system said. The U.S. Department of Justice has an ongoing civil lawsuit against Alabama over conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from staff and other incarcerated men and calling the system one of the most understaffed and violent in the country, violating the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Nearly every single Alaskan got a financial windfall amounting to more than $3,000 Tuesday, the day the state began distributing payments from its investment fund that has been seeded with money from the state’s oil riches. The payments, officially called the Permanent Fund Dividend, amounted to $2,622 – the highest amount ever. Alaska lawmakers added $662 as a one-time benefit to help residents with high energy costs. A total of $1.6 billion in direct deposits began hitting bank accounts Tuesday, and physical checks will arrive later for those who opted for them. Residents use the money in various ways – buying big-screen TVs, vehicles or other goods; using it for vacations; or putting it in savings or college funds. In rural Alaska, the money can help offset the enormous costs of fuel and food, like $14 for a 12-pack of soda, $4 for a celery bunch and $3 for a small container of Greek yogurt. “We’re experiencing record high inflation that we haven’t seen since the first PFD was paid in 1982,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a video. The timing of the checks couldn’t have come at a better time for those living on the state’s vast western coast, which was devastated over the weekend by the remnants of Typhoon Merbok. Damage to homes and infrastructure was widespread along 1,000 miles of coastline.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Wildfires torching areas of the state are threatening the Sonoran Desert’s iconic saguaro cacti, in turn threatening the lives of the birds and other wildlife that depend on them. To help replace the many saguaros burned in wildfires, the Tucson Audubon Society is launching a three-year restoration and replanting project that will bring approximately 14,000 saguaros to southern Arizona. According to the Tucson Audubon, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats, 100 species of animals use saguaros, including bats, birds, mammals and insects, while 14 species of birds nest in saguaro cactus cavities, including elf owls, pygmy owls and desert purple martins, among others. Saguaros are like apartment buildings of wildlife activity. Bats feed on the nectar of the flowers sprouting at the top of the saguaro, while in other parts of the plant, bird species live inside cavities carved by other birds. Then, as food sources become scarce later in the summer, animals and insects will feed on the saguaro’s fruit, according to the National Park Service. The entire project will receive an initial investment of $300,000 that will be given to the organization over the next three years from the Wildlife Conservation Society. The project also will receive U.S. Forest Service grants for about $209,000 for post-burn fire recovery in areas torched during the Bighorn fire that occurred in the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Bush fire that occurred in the Tonto National Forest in 2020.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The owner of an alternative-meat purveyor is accused of biting a human nose after a Razorbacks football game. Beyond Meat Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey was arrested over the weekend after a physical altercation in a parking garage following a University of Arkansas football game. Ramsey, 53, was charged with terroristic threatening and third-degree battery Saturday, according to booking records at the Washington County Jail. He was released Sunday on $10,000 bond. According to the preliminary campus police report obtained by local Arkansas television station KNWA/Fox 24, a road rage altercation saw Ramsey punch through the back windshield of another man’s Subaru in the parking garage after the vehicle made contact with the front tire of Ramsey’s car. According to the preliminary report, once the Subaru owner got out of the vehicle, Ramsey punched him repeatedly and bit his nose, “ripping the flesh on the tip of the nose.” The man also claimed Ramsey threatened to kill him. A responding police officer found “two males with bloody faces” at the garage just outside Razorback Stadium after the game against Missouri State. Occupants of both vehicles got out to help separate the two men. Ramsey was named Beyond Meat’s COO in December after spending three decades at Tyson Foods.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Supervisors in the city voted Tuesday for a trial run allowing police to monitor in real time private surveillance cameras in certain circumstances, despite strong objections from civil liberties groups alarmed by the potential impact to privacy. San Francisco, like many places across the country, is struggling to balance public safety with constitutional protections. The ability to monitor in real time was requested by San Francisco Mayor London Breed and supported by merchants and residents who say police officers need more tools to combat drug dealing and retail theft that they say have marred the city’s quality of life. It is temporary and will sunset in 15 months. The vote was 7-4, with some supervisors astonished that the governing board of politically liberal San Francisco would consider granting more powers to law enforcement in a city that celebrates its activism. Others pushed back, saying they were tired of sophisticated criminal networks taking advantage of San Francisco’s lax attitude toward retail theft and other property crimes. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, a privacy advocate who successfully passed legislation in 2019 to ban the use of facial recognition software by San Francisco police and other city departments, said they worked hard to negotiate safeguards, including strict reporting requirements when live monitoring was used.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: An attorney for a state lawmaker has asked El Paso County prosecutors to dismiss a felony charge that he voted outside the district he lives in and represents in 2020, citing incorrect information presented to a grand jury before his indictment. Dan Kaplan, an attorney for Democratic state Sen. Pete Lee, filed a motion to dismiss Tuesday, saying the wrong residency information was provided to prosecutors by the state Office of Attorney Registration, The Colorado Sun reports. The office told prosecutors of the mistake last week, and the El Paso County District Attorney’s Office is reviewing the case, spokesman Howard Black said. Lee, whose website says he practiced law for 25 years, chairs the state Senate Judiciary Committee. He was indicted in August. “We believe that the erroneous information would have resulted in no indictment being issued,” said Lee, who previously denied any wrongdoing. The felony charge carries a possible penalty of one to three years in prison and a possible fine of up to $100,000. Lee’s next court hearing is set for Oct. 18. Lee is not seeking a second term in November’s election after being elected to represent his El Paso County district in 2018. He previously served in the House.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Two parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre and the daughter of the school’s slain principal testified Wednesday of the fear and pain they have suffered from being targeted with threats by those who believe the lie that the shooting was a hoax. David Wheeler, Jennifer Hensel and Erica Lafferty are among those suing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for promoting the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his media platforms, including his Infowars web show. The plaintiffs, who gave often emotional testimony, say Jones’ promotion of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his show led the them being threatened by deniers of the shooting, including some who claimed their loved ones never existed. They say they’ve endured death threats and in-person harassment, video recording by strangers and abusive comments on social media. Some families moved to avoid harassment. “There are days when grief is just so awful,” said Hensel, whose 6-year-old daughter, Avielle Richman, was among those slain. “Then you add on the idea that people think you made all this up for money or that your child didn’t exist. That compounds everything.” One of the jurors wept as Hensel testified and was comforted by another panel member.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A judge ruled Monday that the Port of Wilmington’s financially ailing operator must pay a ship loading company more than $28million – an amount that piles onto a string of hefty bills already weighing on a company with operations that generate thousands of jobs in the state. The ruling - a $21.5 million payment, plus interest - comes four years after Delaware privatized the port through a 50-year lease with Gulftainer, a shipping and logistics company based in the United Arab Emirates. As state officials negotiated the lease in early 2018, they also pressured Gulftainer and Murphy Marine Services – a local ship loading company already doing business at the port – to combine operations, according to court documents. The companies obliged but ultimately could not agree on a price that Gulftainer’s local subsidiary, GT USA Wilmington, should pay to take over the smaller operation. At the time, Murphy Marine wanted roughly $26 million. Gulftainer officials saw the company as far less valuable. The dispute quickly became hostile, and the next month Murphy Marine filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, claiming Gulftainer’s officials had carried out “bulldogged” efforts to strip it of millions of dollars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A 44-year-old man was arrested after allegedly using paint to vandalize the Washington Monument on Tuesday evening, WUSA-TV reports. According to a statement from the United States Park Police, the man defaced an area at the base of the monument. The National Mall landmark is temporarily closed. National Park Service conservators are working on restoring the monument but say that process could take several weeks. Locals and tourists came out to the monument to see the vandalism. Reactions to the painted message were mixed. “No matter what people think and feel, they have no right to destroy historical property like this,” one woman said. “I don’t know how someone could just walk up and completely vandalize the Washington Monument, of all things,” a man said. “Not that I support this, but I understand that sometimes you got to make a statement,” one woman said. Mike Litterist of the National Park Service said crews were on site Wednesday morning to begin the cleanup process. Park Police identified the man arrested as Shaun Ray Deaton, of Bloomington, Indiana. Deaton was charged with trespassing, tampering and vandalism. Police said it was an initial criminal charge, and as the investigation continues, there may be additional charges.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz refused to step down Monday, rejecting a motion by his attorneys who accused her of being biased against their client and prejudicing the jurors who will decide if he should die for murdering 17 people four years ago. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer denied the motion, saying only that it was legally insufficient. Scherer last week chewed out lead defense attorney Melisa McNeill and her team outside the jury’s presence, accusing them of being “unprofessional” when they unexpectedly rested their case after only about 25 of the 80 witnesses they had told her and prosecutors they intended to testify had been called. The defense said in court documents filed last week that those comments and ones the judge later made to the jury were “the zenith of the cumulative disdain” they allege Scherer has shown throughout the case toward Cruz and themselves. The defense had no obligation to call all its proposed witnesses or notify the judge or prosecution when they planned to rest, legal observers have said. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Scherer’s comments didn’t rise to the level of demonstrating bias against Cruz. They cited a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says a judge’s “expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance and even anger” against the defense are not grounds for stepping down.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: If approved by Congress after a three-year federal review wraps up this fall, mounds built by Muscogean people who were forcibly removed from their homeland 200 years ago would serve as the gateway to a new Ocmulgee National Park and Preserve, protecting 54 river-miles of floodplain where nearly 900 more sites of cultural or historic significance have been identified. Efforts to expand an existing historical park at the mounds site are in keeping with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s “Tribal Homelands Initiative,” which supports fundraising to buy land and requires federal managers to seek out Indigenous knowledge about resources. “This kind of land acquisition represents the best of what our conservation efforts should look like: collaborative, inclusive, locally led, and in support of the priorities of our country’s tribal nations,” Haaland said at last weekend’s 30th Annual Ocmulgee Indigenous Celebration. In an era when some culture warriors see government as the enemy, years of coalition-building have eliminated any significant opposition to federal management in the reliably Republican center of a long-red state. Hunting will still be allowed, even encouraged, to keep feral hogs from destroying the ecosystem. Georgia’s congressional delegation is on board, and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has been welcomed as an essential partner.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Maui County Council is pushing a resolution that would allow counties to set higher minimum wages than the state, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Maui leaders endorsed the idea from council member Gabe Johnson, who pointed to variances in the cost of living from one area to another in advocating for the move. Three other county councils would have to approve before the resolution could be considered in the Legislature next year, according to the news outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The University of Idaho’s plan to build the nation’s largest research dairy and experimental farm cleared a big hurdle Tuesday. Gov. Brad Little and two other statewide-elected officials on the Idaho Land Board approved the university’s plan to use $23 million to buy roughly 640 acres of farmland in south-central Idaho, the heart of the state’s dairy industry. That would be the main focus of the school’s proposed Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. The dairy industry – Idaho’s is the third largest in the nation – faces a range of challenges with greenhouse gas emissions from animals, land and water pollution, and waste systems from dairies that can have thousands of cows that produce tons of manure. University of Idaho President Scott Green said the school hasn’t been able to do the large-scale research the industry needs to find solutions for those and other complex problems. If CAFE succeeds as envisioned, the operation would include an experimental farm and 2,000-cow research dairy in Minidoka County. Classrooms, labs and faculty offices would be constructed in Jerome County near where Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 93 intersect. A food processing pilot plant with a workforce training and education facility would be located at the College of Southern Idaho campus in Twin Falls County.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A jury has awarded $363 million to a woman who alleged that a now-shuttered suburban Chicago plant that sterilized medical equipment exposed residents to a toxic industrial gas and gave her breast cancer. After a five-week trial, the Cook County jurors on Monday awarded Sue Kamuda $38 million in compensatory damages for the past and future loss of a normal life, emotional distress, disfigurement and shortened life expectancy, plus $325 million in punitive damages. Kamuda, 70, developed breast cancer in 2007 despite having no predisposition to it, her lawyers said. She is the first of more than 700 people seeking damages from Oak Brook-based Sterigenics to go to trial over health claims over the plant’s releases of ethylene oxide gas. Those lawsuits have been filed against Sterigenics since 2018, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published research showing people living near the plant in the DuPage County village of Willowbrook faced some of the nation’s highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution. Sterigenics, the former plant’s most recent owner, was ordered to pay Kamuda $220 million in punitive damages; parent company Sotera Health was directed to pay $100 million and Griffith Foods, the current name of the plant’s original owner, $5 million.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of fatal overdoses last year in the city soared, eclipsing the number of people who died in shootings and other methods to become the leading cause of death in cases examined by the coroner’s office, according to new data. In its annual report examining trends among the decedents it takes in, the Marion County Coroner’s Office recorded 799 people last year died from accidental drug intoxication. The alarming statistics surpassed the number of people examined by the office who died from heart disease - long at the top of the list - blunt force trauma and firearms for the second year in a row. When accounting for people who died by suicide from an overdose or with an undetermined manner of death, the number of people climbs to 826. While the coroner’s office does not examine every death in the county, meaning some “natural” deaths are not included in the report, officials say the skyrocketing number of overdoses illustrates the worsening drug crisis in the county. “It’s unfortunate that these deaths are rising at such a significant rate,” said Alfarena McGinty, chief deputy coroner. The majority of deaths are linked to the highly lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl, the report shows, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. Fentanyl has increasingly been cut in other street drugs in the past few years.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Concerns about air quality and workplace safety at a correctional facility have led a labor union to file a grievance and the facility to conduct air quality testing. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union Council 61, which represents workers in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging unsafe working conditions at the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex building. In the complaint, filed Aug. 29, the union alleges mold and asbestos in the building are adversely affecting the health of workers and residents. It poses an emergency health risk that officials are not taking seriously, union President Rick Eilander said. Pictures submitted to OSHA as part of the complaint show apparent mold growing on air vents and on floors and pipes. The images also show a pipe leaking a blue and yellow liquid. Eilander wrote in the complaint that the images were taken in the basement and first floor of building 65/66 of the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex. Jerry Evans, the director of the Fifth Judicial District Department of Correctional Services, said given the alleged mold is located in an unoccupied part of the building, it does not pose a direct health risk to employees or residents of the facility.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state law enforcement oversight board reprimanded a sheriff’s deputy who used his Taser on a 12-year-old boy with autism while the boy was handcuffed and hogtied in the deputy’s vehicle but chose not to revoke his law enforcement certification. Former Jackson County Deputy Matthew Honas was found to have used excessive force against the boy and terminated from the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department in March. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training said Feb. 23 that Honas tied up the boy, who had run away from foster care, in a way that threatened his ability to breathe properly. Honas was not wearing a body camera, but the encounter was captured on his in-car camera. Honas knew the boy, identified as L.H., was autistic and had struggled with him during a previous encounter, the commission said. Honas “struggled with, shoved, elbowed, applied pressure points, carried, pulled, ‘hog-tied’ and ultimately tased L.H.,” the commission said. The commission said Honas used the Taser on the boy without warning as he was sitting in the patrol vehicle with his feet outside the vehicle. At the time, L.H. was handcuffed behind his back, with the handcuffs connected to shackles on his ankles. Among other things, Honas also refused help from other available officers, did not call a transport van, used profanity and threatened to use his Taser on the boy again, the commission said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A new website highlights how archaeological sites across the state have contributed knowledge about Kentucky’s history, officials said. Discover Kentucky Archaeology, at archaeology.ky.gov, was launched by the Kentucky Heritage Council/State Historic Preservation Office in partnership with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, a statement from the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet said. It includes information on more than 100 prehistoric and historic archaeological sites across 64 counties. The site was launched in September, which is celebrated as Kentucky Archaeology Month. Prehistoric sites include a Native American rockshelter in the Daniel Boone National Forest, and historic sites include Saltpeter Cave, a frontier-era niter mine in Carter County, the statement said. Each archaeological site includes a summary, findings, a focus on “what’s cool” and links to related materials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Three small insect-eating raptors called Mississippi kites have been released by Louisiana State University’s wildlife hospital. The release Friday in Baton Rouge was timed so that the birds, which are known for their aerobatics as they chase and grab insects while flying, can migrate to South America, where they winter in Brazil and Argentina. Two flew into nearby trees, but one – brought to the Wildlife Hospital of Louisiana in 2020 as a nestling with a broken leg – excited veterinary students by soaring for a bit before landing, Dr. Mark Mitchell, the hospital’s director, said Friday. He said it almost seemed as if a bird that had taken wing only in a flight cage was saying, “Now I know what these things on my sides are for.” The three had been living in the same flight cage and were held close to each other, then released simultaneously in hopes they would stay together over a journey of 5,000 to 9,000 miles, Mitchell said. The bird brought in as a nestling apparently had fallen from its nest in July 2020, Mitchell said in an interview. He was named Burreaux after quarterback Joe Burrow, who won the Heisman Trophy while at LSU and now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state of Maine and a fishing group are appealing a federal judge’s decision that new rules intended to protect rare whales must stand. The judge earlier this month denied a request from fishermen to stop federal regulators from placing the new restrictions on lobster fishing. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340. Gov. Janet Mills and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association said this week that they’re appealing that decision. Lobstermen have long contended the new rules are based on flawed data and are too punitive to the fishing industry. The fishermen sued the National Marine Fisheries Service in the lawsuit. The fishing group is “escalating its fight to save Maine’s lobstering heritage from a plan that the agency itself admits is not needed for the species to survive,” said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the lobstermen’s association. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and have declined in population in recent years. The state and the fishermen have appealed their case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nPrincess Anne: A historic inn where President George Washington reportedly once stayed is on the market. The historic Washington Inn & Tavern, the centerpiece of the Eastern Shore town of Princess Anne, is said to have housed the late president, said Town Manager Clayton Anderson. Built in 1744, before America’s independence from Great Britain and during the reign of King George II, the structure is brimming with history. Now, the town of Princess Anne has put the famed Washington Inn & Tavern up for sale, with a current listing of $1.25 million. Situated in the the Somerset County seat, the two-story colonial structure is located in an area prioritized for economic and community development. Throughout the years, the inn has served as a catalyst for business growth in a district committed to historic preservation, community growth and economic expansion, according to Anderson. The inn was purchased by the town in 2013 after it was found to be in a state of disrepair. Through a public-private partnership among Princess Anne, the state of Maryland and investors, the building underwent significant renovations. Restored to its full glory, it later reopened in 2016. Established public-private agreements require the town to sell the property by 2023, according to a news release this August.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A man will be sentenced to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to vandalizing the “Bewitched” statue by dousing the tourist attraction with red paint over the summer. The 32-year-old resident was originally sentenced to a year in jail, but a Salem district court judge suspended the sentence on conditions the man repay the cost of repairing the damage inflicted on the bronze statue, The Salem News reports. The statue depicts actor Elizabeth Montgomery – as lead character Samantha Stephens in the 1960s sitcom – sitting on a broomstick in front of a crescent moon. In June, a prosecutor said the man was “going through a rough time and wanted to do something to get arrested” and was held on bail. His attorney said he had been living in a shelter for two weeks since his marriage ended and had been looking for a new job. He was also charged with disorderly conduct, which will be dismissed after 30 days. The statue was erected in the city famous for the 1692 witch trials in 2005, despite protests from some who said it trivializes the tragedy of the trials.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city sued the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday over population estimates from last year that show it lost an additional 7,100 residents, opening another front against the agency in a battle over how Detroit’s people have been counted in the past two years. Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters that the city wants the Census Bureau to reveal how it produced its population loss estimates for Detroit. Duggan claimed the bureau was going against its own policy by refusing to divulge to Detroit the way the estimates for the city were calculated and not allowing challenges this year. The lawsuit appears to be the first litigation to challenge population results since the release of 2020 census data, which traditionally has formed the foundation of the annual population estimates. The Census Bureau’s refusal this year to consider evidence that the 2021 population estimates were wrong perpetuates racial inequality and threatens the city’s reputation, Detroit said in its lawsuit. “The Bureau’s failure to consider evidence of its inaccurate 2021 estimate costs the City and its residents millions of dollars of funding to which they are entitled while threatening the City’s historic turnaround by advancing the narrative that Detroit is losing population,” the lawsuit said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A federal grand jury has indicted a man accused of threatening to kill a U.S. senator. Brendon Daugherty was being held in the Sherburne County Jail, in Elk River, on charges of threatening to murder a U.S. official and interstate transmission of a threat. Court records do not identify the senator other than to say it was not someone who represented Minnesota. According to the indictment, Daugherty left two threatening voicemail messages at the senator’s field office in June. Field office staff contacted U.S. Capitol Police. FBI agents spoke with Daugherty at his Coon Rapids home Sept. 2. He told the agents that he made the calls because the senator was “doing a bunch of stupid (expletive) with gun control” and that he wants politicians to “feel a little bit pressured,” the Star Tribune reports. According to court records, the 35-year-old Daugherty was convicted in October 2018 of two felony counts for threatening to burn down a Pearl Vision store in Maple Grove and harm the employees. Daugherty was angry that he owed $80 for replacement glasses, according to charges.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has been awarded a $5.8million grant for the construction of an Advanced Workforce Training Center. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced that the department’s Economic Development Administration is awarding the $5.8 million grant to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for the construction of the Advanced Workforce Training Center. The grant is funded by the American Rescue Plan’s Indigenous Communities Program, a press release said. “Workforce development is a primary focus for our Tribe,” Chief Cyrus Ben said in the press release. “We have undertaken many projects to help our community members prepare to face a challenging and ever-evolving job market. This Workforce Training Center is a key component of our strategy to increase the skills of our Tribal members, whether they choose a career on or outside of our Tribal lands.” Anna Denson, project manager of economic development, said the planning process took more than a year. “As of today, our National Center for construction education and research offers HVAC, electrical and industrial maintenance to tribal employees with very little room, but the goal is to expand with the new center,” Denson said.\n\nMissouri\n\nHartville: A small hamlet in the Ozarks has found itself in the middle of everything. Officials from the nation’s capital unveiled a marker Wednesday designating a spot in tiny Wright County as the center of population in the United States. Dignitaries from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau officially debuted the red granite marker in Hartville. With a population of 594 residents in 2020, the county seat is located 14.6 miles from the actual spot calculated following the 2020 census. Bypassed by interstate highways and railroads, Hartville doesn’t have a big tax base or large industry. The local school, a nursing home, the gas station and the Dollar General store are the largest employers. The nation’s population center is calculated every 10 years after the once-a-decade census shows where people are living. The heart of America has been located in Missouri since 1980. Previously located in Plato, in the neighboring county, it moved only 11.8 miles southwest from 2010 to 2020. It is the smallest distance shift in 100 years and second-smallest in U.S. history. To calculate the center of the U.S., the Census Bureau figures out which spot would be “the balance point” if the 50 states sat on an imaginary, flat surface with weights of identical size – each representing the location of one person – placed on it.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The state’s fishing economy has proven resilient amid the impacts of drought, but a new study suggests 35% of its cold water habitats could become unsuitable for trout by 2080, costing the state an estimated $192 million in annual revenue. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the University of Montana contributed to the new study titled “Socioeconomic resilience to climatic extremes in a freshwater fishery,” which ran in the journal Science Advances this month, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. “Trout fisheries have enormous cultural, economic and ecological importance in Montana and worldwide, yet even Montana’s resilient trout fisheries could be vulnerable to future climate change,” Timothy Cline, a USGS scientist and the paper’s lead author, said in a news release. The authors used Montana FWP’s recreation monitoring data to analyze how climate change affected 3,100 miles of the state’s rivers between 1983 and 2017. They found that the concentration of anglers doubled overall within that 34-year time period, and severe drought conditions, which drive stream flows down and water temperatures up, significantly affected how that fishing pressure was distributed across the landscape.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Regents at the University of Nebraska are poised to consider allowing beer sales permanently for Husker events at Pinnacle Bank Arena, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The NU Board of Regents plans to vote on the exemption next week.\n\nNevada\n\nTonopah: A sprawling southern Nevada county that embraced misinformation about electronic voting machines is set to conduct its midterm election this fall using hand-counted paper ballots, a county official confirmed Tuesday. “This is very locked in,” said newly appointed Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf, a 2020 election denier, of his plans to implement the old-fashioned process in a county with roughly 33,000 active registered voters. Nye, the largest county by area in Nevada and the third-largest in the United States, has been at the forefront of the Republican Party’s push to ditch electronic voting – an ongoing effort fueled by ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election. Now, less than 50 days before the midterm election, the rural county remains committed to that disinformation campaign despite warnings from experts who say counting ballots by hand could invite more error and fraud. All active registered voters will still receive a mail-in ballot for the general election, Kampf, the county’s top voting official, said in a presentation Tuesday to Nye’s five-member Board of Commissioners. But at the polls, according to Kampf, those casting their votes in person this fall will now fill out paper ballots instead of using a touch screen, although one voting machine will be available at every voting site for people with disabilities and “special needs.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is using $5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to support homeless shelters this winter. The funds, approved earlier this month by the Executive Council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, will provide one-time grants to support shelter providers, including short-term cold weather shelters, to address pandemic-related increased costs and anticipated demand as the winter months approach. In a request for the funds, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette wrote that the state contracts with 19 shelter providers for 791 emergency shelter beds, but the health department does not fund temporary cold weather shelters. She wrote that preliminary data for the 2022 Point-in-Time count for New Hampshire shows 1,605 people experiencing homelessness, an increase of 7.6% from 2021. The federal funds will provide $4 million in grants to the existing shelters under contract with the department and $1 million to each county, municipality, nonprofit or coalition to assist with cold weather shelters.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRidgewood: Will students make it to class more alert and on time if high school starts 45 minutes later? The school district’s parents and teachers were more skeptical than students about any positive outcomes of a later school day start in a 24-page report by K-12 Insights that was presented to the Ridgewood Board of Education on Monday. The report analyzed the results of a district survey distributed in May to parents, students, teachers and community members seeking input about a proposed move of the high school start time from 7:45 to 8:30 a.m. The later starting time is the subject of a nationwide educational debate. Multiple studies indicate it’s not video games, computers and cellphones that keep adolescents up late at night – it’s a temporary, puberty-induced shift in teen circadian rhythms that causes them to be “dazed and confused” in the mornings but dissipates in their early 20s. California has taken the lead and introduced a statewide mandate this fall to start high school classes no earlier than 8:30 a.m. and middle school no earlier than 8 a.m. New Jersey has introduced a similar bill. So far, only a few districts, including Tenafly, Princeton and South Orange/Maplewood, have adopted the later start time.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A politician and Trump supporter who was removed and barred from elected office for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot Jan. 6, 2021, is attempting to appeal that decision to the state Supreme Court. Cowboys for Trump co-founder and former county commissioner Couy Griffin on Tuesday notified the high court of his intent to appeal. The ruling against Griffin this month from a Santa Fe-based District Court was the first to remove or bar an elected official from office in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol building that disrupted Congress as it was trying to certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory. Griffin was previously convicted in federal court of a misdemeanor for entering the Capitol grounds Jan. 6, without going inside the building. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Griffin has invoked free speech guarantees in his defense and said his banishment from public office disenfranchises his political constituents in Otero County. He was barred from office under provisions of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that anyone who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution can be barred from office for engaging in insurrection or rebellion. The provisions were put in place shortly after the Civil War.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An inmate who jumped into the East River from a jail barge has died, the city Department of Correction announced Wednesday. Gregory Acevedo, 48, was pronounced dead about 11 p.m. Tuesday, 11 hours after he climbed a fence at the Vernon C. Bain Center and jumped into the water, officials said. “Mr. Acevedo’s tragic passing is an immense loss,” Correction Commissioner Louis A. Molina said in a statement. Acevedo had been in custody on a robbery charge since Feb. 27. Police officers pulled him from the water after his jump Tuesday and took him to a hospital, where efforts to revive him failed. He was the 15th person to die this year who was a New York City jail inmate or who had just been released. “Once again, their system failed,” Acevedo’s attorney, Warren Silverman, told the New York Post. “I mean, he shouldn’t have been able to get to any position where he could have harmed himself, and clearly they dropped the ball, as usual.” The state attorney general’s office and the city Department of Investigation conduct separate investigations. The city medical examiner’s office will determine the cause. The Bain Center is a 625-foot barge that was supposed to be temporary when it opened as a jail in 1992. It is docked in the East River near Rikers Island, the city’s main jail complex.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has made one more pitch to host the 2027 World University Games, as the committee evaluating North Carolina’s bid visited the region Tuesday. A panel of the International University Sports Federation visited the Executive Mansion, where Gov. Roy Cooper presented its members with an official bid book. The other finalist is Chungcheong province, South Korea. A final announcement is expected in November. North Carolina’s proposal would cover the “University Hub” region designated as including Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary and Greensboro. There are more than 130 colleges, universities and community college statewide. The summer World University Games attracts 7,000 athletes from ages 18 to 25 from more than 150 countries and 600 universities. The nearly two-week event features 15 required sports, including swimming, track and field and basketball, as well as optional sports proposed by the local host city. The state has set aside $25 million to support the games if North Carolina is named the host.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A driver charged with fatally striking a teenager allegedly told investigators he purposely hit the teen with his SUV after they had a political argument, according to court documents. Cayler Ellingson, 18, was struck and killed following a street dance in McHenry early Sunday. The driver accused of striking Ellingson in an alley, Shannon Brandt, 41, is charged in Foster County with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death. Jail records from Stutsman County, where Brandt was being held, show he posted $50,000 bond Tuesday and was released. His attorney did not immediately return a call for comment. Brandt told investigators he left the scene after striking Ellingson, returned briefly, called 911 and then left again, according to a probable cause affidavit. The court document said Brandt told investigators he had been drinking alcohol before striking Ellingson, thought the teen was calling people to do him harm after they argued, and felt threatened. Ellingson was rushed to a hospital in Carrington, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators arrested Brandt at his home in Glenfield later Sunday. Officials said he consented to a chemical breath test that showed his blood alcohol content was above 0.08%, the legal limit to drive.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A conservative podcaster who embraces ex-President Donald Trump’s discredited claims of a stolen 2020 election is eligible to run for Ohio secretary of state this fall, the state’s high court ruled Tuesday. Terpeshore “Tore” Maras, who calls President Joe Biden “resident not president” and embraces aspects of the QAnon conspiracy in her “Tore Says” podcast, will appear on ballots as an independent. She faces Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Democratic challenger Chelsea Clark. The Ohio Supreme Court split 4-2 in its ruling, with Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, a Republican, joining the court’s three Democrats, Justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer dissenting, and Justice Sharon Kennedy not participating. The decision marks the latest twist in Maras’ roller-coaster bid to seek the office overseeing Ohio elections. She previously met the deadline to run as a Republican candidate for the ballot back in February but fell short of the required valid signatures. LaRose’s office later cleared her to run as an independent, but a Republican official – acting in his capacity as an Ohio voter – filed a challenge, asserting a number of her signatures were invalid. A judge ruled in the official’s favor, and LaRose’s office upheld that decision and invalidated her candidacy.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWynnewood: Joe Exotic is suing a songwriter who revealed in media interviews that Exotic was lip-syncing the catchy tune “I Saw a Tiger” in a music video seen in the Netflix documentary about his life. He accuses songwriter Vince Johnson of copyright infringement for releasing an album in 2020 featuring that song and four others. The former zookeeper was convicted at trial in 2019 of hiring two men to kill his chief critic, Carole Baskin, and of crimes involving his animals. He became well-known worldwide a year later after Netflix released “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” He was ordered in January to serve 21 years in federal prison after an appeals court threw out his original sentence. He claims he is innocent and is seeking a new trial on newly discovered evidence and other grounds. His attorney, John M. Phillips, filed the lawsuit Monday seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and a permanent ban on further “unauthorized use” of his songs. In the lawsuit, he goes by the name Joseph Maldonado. In interviews, Johnson said he began writing songs for the zookeeper in 2013. He said a bandmate, Danny Clinton, who died in 2019, was the singer. “I had no idea he was going to Milli Vanilli the songs,” he told Vanity Fair for an article about his involvement.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Thousands of families who expected their children to start tuition-free, state-provided preschool this month remain in limbo because of staffing shortages that caused delays getting contracts to nearly 250 involved preschools. The Early Learning Division, which has overseen the Preschool Promise program since its 2016 inception, took over contracting duties from the Oregon Department of Education this year and has struggled to get contracts inked. It has yet to send paperwork to most of the 248 preschools in the program that serves families living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Many facilities new to the program or those expanding services are hesitant to accept children enrolled in Preschool Promise until they have a signed contract and payment for the care is assured, the newspaper reports. The agency now says the preschools chosen to serve an estimated 6,381 children must open no later than Oct. 30. It could not say when all contracts would be signed. The total number of children marks an expected increase of more than 2,000 slots from last year. “It’s super hard on families,” said Molly Day, director of Early Learning Multnomah, one of 16 regional hubs that helps coordinate Preschool Promise enrollment.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMiddletown: A prosecutor announced charges in juvenile court Tuesday against 10 students in connection with alleged hazing of high school football players that prompted cancellation of the team’s season. Dauphin County prosecutors said two Middletown players will face attempted sexual assault charges, and eight others face other counts in connection with hazing that authorities said targeted at least six players from ages 14 to 17. “This investigation did not involve just hazing or ‘boys will be boys’ conduct,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Jennifer Gettle said in a news release from the office of District Attorney Fran Chardo. “Rather, two of these individuals committed repeated sexual assaults and encouraged others to participate under the guise of hazing.” Superintendent Chelton Hunter earlier said that team members had been in the high school turf room used for heat acclimation practice sessions when an Aug. 11 cellphone video showed “a group of students restraining two of their teammates and using a muscle therapy gun and another piece of athletic equipment” to poke their buttock areas. The players remained fully clothed, and no penetration appeared to have occurred, he said, calling the video difficult to watch and the acts “completely unacceptable, offensive, and highly inappropriate.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nWoonsocket: Former Mayor Susan Menard, whose body was found Monday in her home, was “a strong leader” who was especially good to the city’s senior citizens, the current mayor recalled Wednesday. “She certainly had her own style, but the people of the city of Woonsocket certainly liked and enjoyed her leadership, electing her to seven terms,” Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt said in an interview. The Woonsocket police went to Menard’s residence Monday after a neighbor called and said he hadn’t seen Menard or the man who also lived in the house for “a couple of weeks,” police said. Officers forced their way in through a rear window and found two bodies in separate rooms, Woonsocket Police Chief Thomas F. Oates III said Tuesday, but they were decomposed, and the medical examiner needed to identify the remains. The state Medical Examiners office said Wednesday morning that it had identified one of them as Menard. The identity of the second person, described as a man in his 70s, has not yet been confirmed, and the causes of death for both are still being investigated, the office said. The police saw no evidence that a crime had been committed, Oates said. “She was and is the longest-serving mayor in the city’s history,” Baldelli-Hunt said, noting that Menard was also the city’s first woman to be elected mayor and first female City Council president.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Seven mothers have given up their babies in South Carolina so far in 2022, more than any year since the state passed its safe haven law more than two decades ago. The babies were all given up at hospitals, according to data from the Department of Social Services obtained by The State newspaper. Daniel’s Law allows babies younger than 2 months old to be turned over to the state at safe places like hospitals, fire stations, police departments or churches if someone is there. Before 2022, the most babies given up in a year was six, in 2016 and 2019. Four babies have been adopted, while the last three are currently in the Family Court system, DSS spokesperson Danielle Jones said. The agency isn’t guessing why 2022 has been the busiest year for Daniel’s Law. The babies turned over to the state have been twins in Anderson County, a boy in Greenville County, a girl in Spartanburg County, a boy in Dorchester County, a boy in Greenwood County and a girl in Lexington County. The General Assembly passed Daniel’s Law in 2001 after a newborn boy was found abandoned at an old dump in Allendale County, alive but covered in fire ant bites, by a mother who never told her parents she was pregnant or went to the doctor and who gave birth in her bathroom.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem is facing a lawsuit after her office refused to release expense records on five out-of-state trips this year to a liberal watchdog group. American Oversight, an organization that files open records requests and litigation against Republican officials, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Noem, who is in the midst of a reelection campaign and eyeing a bid for the GOP’s 2024 presidential ticket. It alleges that the governor’s office did not follow the state’s open records law by claiming that releasing the records would create a threat to the governor’s safety. In May, the organization had requested expense records, including lodging and travel, for 2022 trips Noem had taken to a Las Vegas hunting convention, a pair of Republican Party events in Wyoming and New York, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and a campaign event for Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee in Utah. American Oversight also said that South Dakota’s Department of Labor and Regulation has not responded to its records request for legal expenses associated with negotiating a $200,000 settlement agreement with a former state employee, Sherry Bren. She had filed an age discrimination complaint after she was pressured to retire by Marcia Hultman, Noem’s labor secretary. Hultman began asking for Bren’s retirement in the weeks after Noem’s daughter, Kassidy Peters, completed her real estate appraiser licensure – a process in which Noem took a hands-on role.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University will be the host campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University annual meeting in 2023, the Clinton Foundation said Tuesday. Chelsea Clinton, the foundation’s vice chair, made the announcement at the Clinton Global Initiative’s two-day meeting of international dignitaries in New York. The initiative aims to create partnerships among political, business and philanthropic leaders. According to a news release, next year’s gathering at Vanderbilt will allow students to collaborate with leaders, innovators and experts on solving “humanity’s most pressing problems,” ranging from social to economic to environmental challenges. “Our university and the Clinton Foundation share the beliefs that collaboration brings out the best in humanity and that diverse perspectives and open dialogue are needed to drive innovation and discovery,” Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, said in a statement. More than 11,000 students have participated in the Clinton Global Initiative University program, coming from 163 counties and all 50 states. Previous hosts include the University of Chicago, Howard University, and member schools of the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: Alarmed parents converged on a high school Tuesday after a classroom shooting report that ultimately proved to be false. The siege at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio began about 1 p.m. Tuesday after police received a call of a possible shooting in progress at the school, according to a police statement. The school was placed on lockdown as police entered and began clearing the campus but found no evidence of an active threat or shooting. “Our department and San Antonio Police Department established there was no shooting, but then we had to do a methodical search room by room with our strike teams,” said Chief Johnny Reyes of the San Antonio Independent School District police. “We went to the place where they said the shooting had occurred, and we were able to quickly establish that no shooting had happened.” Instead, some students were found to have had an altercation, but they denied having or displaying a weapon at any point, Reyes said. But frightened students already had made alarming telephone calls to their parents, who descended en masse on the school where 29 school district officers and 58 city police officers were on hand. One man shoved his fist through a window in an effort to gain entry to the school, lacerating his arm. Others were handcuffed and detained after physically struggling with officers.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A family has reached a $3 million settlement with the city in a lawsuit filed after officers shot a 13-year-old boy with autism, leaving him badly wounded after responding to his mother’s 911 call for help when he had a breakdown. The September 2020 shooting drew widespread scrutiny and was one of several around the U.S. in recent years that have fueled questions how police respond to calls involving people with mental illness. The boy, Linden Cameron, now 15, survived but suffered life-changing injuries and emotional trauma that still “haunt him and his family,” said family attorney Nathan Morris in a statement Tuesday announcing the settlement. Cameron’s family accepted the settlement to avoid more emotional trauma that would have come over years spent waiting for the lawsuit to reach trial, Morris said. A separate probe by prosecutors to determine if criminal charges will be filed against the officer is ongoing and could have delayed the family’s lawsuit even longer, he said. “There are mixed emotions by the family,” Morris said. “It is a huge relief to be done with this case, but at the same time we would liked to take this case forward to shine light on some of the issues.” After the shooting, Salt Lake City began providing training for police, fire and dispatch officers about how to best engage with people who have sensory needs like Cameron. That training will continue, said Salt Lake City spokesman Andrew Wittenberg.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Mandatory testing for lead in drinking water – and repairs to keep that water safe – has been completed at 98% of the state’s schools and child care centers, the Vermont Health Department said Wednesday. The state passed a law in 2019 requiring schools and child care facilities to test their drinking and cooking water for lead, a highly toxic metal. Roughly 1 in 5 taps had elevated lead levels out of the more than 15,000 taps tested between June 2019 and December 2021. Lead exposure can slow children’s growth, impair development and learning, and cause behavioral problems. Lead was more frequently found in water fixtures, rather than plumbing, which made fixes both easier and less expensive. The state provided funding to reimburse schools and child care centers for remediation costs, 90% of which cost less than $500. “We take very seriously our responsibility to protect and promote the health and safety of children in early care and education programs,” said Commissioner Sean Brown of the Agency of Human Services’ Child Development Division. “Collaborative efforts like this help ensure that children in Vermont have positive, safe learning environments in which they can grow and develop.”\n\nVirginia\n\nMartinsville: A marker has been dedicated in front of the old Henry County Courthouse recognizing the Martinsville Seven, a group of Black men executed in 1951 over an alleged rape. “Here in 1949, six all-white, all-male juries convicted seven Black men of the rape of a white woman. All seven men were sentenced to death. On appeal, NAACP attorneys submitted the first petition to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that capital punishment had been disproportionately applied against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment. Despite international attention and petitions for clemency, the Commonwealth of Virginia executed the men in Feb. 1951, the most executions for a rape in U.S. history,” the marker says. The old Henry County Courthouse is now the Martinsville-Henry County Heritage Center and Museum, inside which a display recounts the day in 1949 when Ruby Floyd told police she had been raped. Francis Grayson, Frank Hairston Jr., Howard Hairston, James Hairston, Joe Hampton, Booker Millner and John Taylor were arrested and confessed. The defense argued the encounter was consensual, and the confessions were coerced, but all seven men were found guilty and sentenced to death. The NAACP failed in its appeal, and over just four days, the seven were put to death by the electric chair in Richmond.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Next year voters will decide whether the city should set up a public developer to create affordable housing. The Seattle Times reports the City Council unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to allow King County Elections to put the proposed Initiative 135 on the ballot of a special election to be held Feb. 14, 2023. If I-135 passes, it would create a public development authority, called the Seattle Social Housing Developer, to construct homes and take over existing properties using government and philanthropic funding to create renter-governed housing. Those who favor the initiative say housing would be protected from rental market forces in one of the nation’s most expensive cities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Walmart and CVS Pharmacy have settled with the state of West Virginia for a combined total of $147 million in a lawsuit over the companies’ roles in contributing to the oversupply of prescription drugs that fueled the opioid epidemic in the country’s most impacted state, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday. Walmart and CVS were two lawsuits that were part of a larger trial that was pushed back to June of next year along with Kroger and Walgreens. Morrisey recently announced a settlement with Rite Aid for up to $30 million to resolve similar litigation. The lawsuits allege the pharmacies’ contributions to the oversupply of prescription opioids in the state have caused “significant losses through their past and ongoing medical treatment costs, including for minors born addicted to opioids, rehabilitation costs, naloxone costs, medical examiner expenses, self-funded state insurance costs and other forms of losses to address opioid-related afflictions and loss of lives.” It brings the total settlements by the state in opioid lawsuits to $875 million, including $296 million with manufacturers, $400 million with wholesalers and $177.5 million involving pharmacies.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels has called on Gov. Tony Evers to halt all paroles in the state, even though a governor can’t unilaterally order them to stop, and some paroles are mandated by law. Michels has been hitting Evers as being soft on crime, accusing the Democrat in a letter Monday of sympathizing with and coddling “brutal, convicted criminals.” Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said it would be illegal to do as Michels wants and called the request “an uninformed stunt to score political points by someone who has no regard or appreciation for the laws of our state.” Michels and Evers are knotted in a tight contest in the battleground state that polls show is about even. Michaels, who is endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump and is the co-owner of the state’s largest construction company, has been attacking Evers over his parole policies and his response to violent protests in Kenosha two years ago that followed the shooting of Black man Jacob Blake by a white police officer. Wisconsin’s parole commission, which operates independently of the governor, has granted about 460 discretionary paroles not required by law, something that both Republican and Democratic governors before Evers also routinely granted.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Rockslides have seemingly been ramping up in the Tetons, mountain guides say, and scientists are pointing to climate change as a likely culprit, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. The anecdotal increase in rockfall in the mountain range comes as warmer temperatures take their toll on glaciers, which long covered the Tetons. Simeon Caskey, head of the physical science branch at Grand Teton National Park, told the newspaper that so-called weathering is behind much of the rockfall, with shifting water and ice leading to changes in the geologic structure of the area. “We’ve seen from some studies in the Alps that rockfall is happening more frequently at higher elevations as a result of climate change and increased temperatures and increased extreme rainfall events,” he said, calling that European mountain range an “appropriate analogue for what’s happening in the Tetons.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/25/business/mideast-summary-03-25-2022-intl/index.html", "title": "Europe can't live without Russian gas. Can this tiny Middle East ...", "text": "Abu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\n“It’s always nice to be wanted,” Qatar’s energy minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said in jest during an exclusive interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson on Thursday. “Everyone in Europe is talking to us,” he said.\n\nQatar, one of the world’s top suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has been thrust into the limelight as European states rush to find alternatives to the Russian gas that has powered their economies for decades, as Moscow presses on with its brutal war in Ukraine.\n\nBut Kaabi warned the transition will be difficult. Replacing Russian gas supply to Europe is “not practically possible” just yet, he said. Qatar’s current gas capacity won’t satisfy European demand, he said – but it could in the future.\n\nThe European Union depends on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas. This week, German economy minister Robert Habeck left the Qatari capital Doha with an understanding to have Qatar supply it with gas. Germany currently has no terminals to receive direct shipments of LNG from Qatar, but it plans to build two.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and his counterpart at the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on Friday announced a joint task force aimed at finding alternative supplies of lLNG and reducing overall demand for natural gas moving forward.\n\n“Europe has been a destination for us, and is an important market for us,” the Qatari minister, who is also president and CEO of QatarEnergy, said. “And we will be supplying Europe.”\n\nQatar has invested $28 billion into expanding its giant North Field and expects gas capacity to rise by more than 60% in four years, he said. After that, around half of its capacity is expected to go to Europe. “Our plan is we want to be 50% east of Suez, 50%, west of Suez,” he said, referring to the Egyptian waterway. Around 80% of Qatar’s gas currently goes to Asian buyers, many of whom have signed long term contracts that don’t allow a diversion of supplies to other buyers.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the role Qatar can play in Europe’s efforts to wean itself off Russian gas:\n\nWhat can Qatar do to help reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian gas now?\n\nRussia has the world’s biggest reserves of natural gas, almost double those of Qatar, and its gas supplies account for 40% of the European Union’s usage. Analysts said it’s virtually impossible to replace Russian gas for the time being.\n\n“There is basically no spare LNG in the world market,” said Robin Mills, CEO of Dubai-based energy consulting firm Qamar Energy. Qatar’s own divertible LNG is limited “and bidding for that will drive up prices.”\n\nThe only way Qatar can replace Russian gas imports to Europe is by diverting cargoes from other customers who have signed long term contracts, such as those in Asia, something it hasn’t been willing to do. By doing so it may incur compensation claims from those buyers.\n\nContractually divertible gas gives the seller the flexibility to redirect shipments to the highest value market in response to changing market conditions.\n\nAs Europe tries to reduce its reliance on hydrocarbons, emerging economies in Asia, like China and India, may be more attractive destinations for Qatari gas, said Yousef Alshammari, a senior research fellow at London’s Imperial College.\n\nThe US could also emerge as a gas supplier to Europe.\n\nThe White House said Friday that the US will work toward supplying Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas in 2022 in partnership with other nations.\n\n“It’s a big opportunity for the US,” said Kaabi. “I think, definitely the US is going to be, you know, one of the largest suppliers, if not the largest supplier [to Europe] at some point,” he said.\n\nWould replacing Russian gas with Qatari energy face logistical issues?\n\nRussia’s gas supply to Europe is delivered via pipelines. There are no gas pipelines from Qatar to Europe so the Gulf nation’s energy would have to shipped to Europe in liquefied form.\n\n“Liquefaction of natural gas is energy intensive, which emits carbon and that offsets climate benefits” of using natural gas, said Alshammari. “It will be hard for European policymakers as they set ambitious climate agendas and net-zero targets.”\n\nEuropean nations will also need infrastructure to support those shipments, which could take time to build, said Karen Young, senior fellow at Washington’s Middle East Institute. Moving to Qatari gas may be easier for countries that already have that infastructure, like the United Kingdom and Spain, she said.\n\n“The problem is that Europe is jumping into an LNG market that cannot accommodate its immediate need for immense volumes,” said Nikos Tsafos of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. “Of course, Qatar could send more gas to Europe, but it hasn’t yet despite incredibly high prices in Europe, which suggests that its flows to Asia might be stickier than we think.”\n\nMore U.S. LNG is headed to Europe.

The trip is expected to be heavily dominated by discussion of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: US-UAE relations have been strained of late amid a reluctance by President Biden’s oil producing Middle East allies to increase crude production to help dive down oil prices. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also been calling on more assistance from the US to help ward off attacks from Yemen’s Iran-allied Houthi rebels.\n\nIran’s foreign minister says Riyadh sending mixed messages on normalization\n\nIran has received contradictory statements from Saudi Arabia on the renewal of bilateral relations, the foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said during a news conference in Beirut on Thursday.\n\nBackground: Iraq, which is brokering talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Baghdad, had said the fifth round of talks would start on March 16. But Iran unilaterally suspended talks after Saudi Arabia earlier this month executed 81 men, some of whom were Shiites. Iran is majority Shiite.\n\nWhy it matters: Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are locked in proxy conflicts throughout the Middle East, started direct talks last year to try to contain tensions but the talks haven’t progressed much. Any progress could significantly help de-escalate tensions in the region.\n\nDubai ruler’s ex-wife gets custody of children\n\nA senior British judge awarded Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, the ex-wife of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, sole responsibility for looking after their children. The judge concluded that the sheikh inflicted “exorbitant” domestic abuse against his ex-wife. A statement issued on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed said he loved his children and would always provide for them. “He maintains his denial of the allegations made in these contentious proceedings,” it said.\n\nBackground: The dispute between the royals began shortly after Haya fled to Britain in April 2019, following the discovery she was having an affair with a bodyguard. In December, Sheikh Mohammed was ordered to pay Princess Haya more than $728 million in one of the largest divorce settlements ever handed down by a UK court.\n\nWhy it matters: The ruling caps the end of an expensive three-year custody battle at the High Court in London between Sheikh Mohammed and his former wife. The rulings appear not to have affected relations between Britain, Dubai and the UAE.\n\nWhat’s trending\n\n\n\nRegional: #Saudi_League\n\nSaudi Arabia qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time since 2006, meaning the Gulf state will compete at its sixth finals.

At least one of the boys played for Wren, he revealed later in a 911 call.\n\nSome of the boys left and went to the Chastain home in Piedmont, where 17-year-old Matthew Chastain and his parents, Nikki and Mark Chastain, regularly hosted them for weekend hangouts and sleepovers.\n\nMore boys came over later, according to case notes and interviews provided to The Greenville (S.C.) News and the Anderson (S.C.) Independent Mail by the Anderson County Sheriff's Office through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nAccording to deputies' investigative files, this is the account of what happened.\n\nMark and Nikki Chastain had spent part of that Friday on Lake Hartwell before returning home between 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Nikki Chastain estimated that she drank four beers that day and her husband had six.\n\nAs the hours slipped into early Saturday morning on Sept. 8, 2018, there were at least six 17- and 18-year-old boys at the Chastain home: Matthew and five friends, including Brandon Tyson, whom his friends called Brad. They gathered around a fire pit outside while Mark and Nikki stayed inside. The teens also had access to the Chastains' nearby garage, which had been converted to a \"man cave.\"\n\nEventually, the Chastains went upstairs to bed, retiring to separate rooms because Mark snores.\n\nListen to the 911 call:Teen's frantic 911 call captures moment teen was fatally shot\n\nBack downstairs, Matthew Chastain told his friends he was going to take a shower, according to statements the teens gave investigators.\n\nDeadly chaos erupted just moments later, Chastain told deputies. Before the sun rose, 17-year-old Brandon Tyson was fatally shot, and his friend's father, Mark Chastain, admitted pulling the trigger.\n\nMark Chastain told investigators that he acted in self-defense because he feared for his life and the lives of his family.\n\nQuestions remain for the family of Brandon Tyson\n\nFor Tyson's family, questions remain.\n\nTyson had ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms before he was shot, according to investigators. His family wonders where he got them. Toxicology reports show Tyson tested positive for marijuana and psilocin, a psychedelic compound that is found in so-called \"magic mushrooms,\" according to investigators.\n\nDr. Henry Millwood, an emergency-room physician who did not treat Tyson, said hallucinogenic mushrooms can alter a user's perception of lights, shapes, movements and time. He said such mushrooms can affect the user in as little as 20 minutes and for up to eight hours.\n\nMillwood said a user can develop a tolerance for them, needing more over time to produce the same effects, and he said one concern about using them is the \"potential of getting the wrong mushrooms.\" While some are \"relatively harmless,\" he said, it can be hard for users to distinguish between those and the mushrooms that can cause brain dysfunction and other serious health risks.\n\n2017:Magic mushrooms are the safest recreational drug, study says\n\nBecause of the intensity of Tyson's reaction, investigators wonder how many he ate and whether the mushrooms he ingested were laced with something else. They may never know.\n\nTyson behaved erratically and was uncontrollable after he ate them, his friends told investigators. It's not clear how much time passed between when Tyson ingested mushrooms and when his behavior became erratic. It's also not clear how much time passed before one of the teens called 911.\n\nOne of his friends described Tyson acting like a \"wild animal.\" The teens told investigators that Tyson was storming through the house and yard, throwing and breaking things, punching people and bleeding after bashing glass.\n\nTheir description doesn't square with the image that Jeremy and Nikki Tyson have of their son, a senior in high school who they say was just two credits shy of graduating when he died.\n\nHe'd had trouble, yes, his parents said. Nikki Tyson said they had \"grounded him from everything\" in late June after she searched his phone and found Snapchat messages with references to fights, drinking and drugs. The day before he died, Brandon met with an investigator at the Sheriff's Office to share what he knew about an alleged assault that he'd said someone else committed, according to an incident report. Tyson's mother said she took him to meet with the investigator that day. That case has been closed, and no charges were filed, records show.\n\nBut Brandon was also the boy who had volunteered at NewSpring Church, a 6-foot-4 runner, a baseball player and a coach to younger children, his parents said. He had dreams of being an underwater welder and had a plan to train at Tri-County Technical College.\n\nHis handwritten business plan, including his projected salary after college, is still on the desk in his upstairs bedroom, a time capsule of youth that looks much the way it did the day he died, according to his mother. His sports trophies gleam in one corner, and his size 15 boots, shoes and sandals are lined up along the edge of his bed. His Texas Longhorns comforter is neatly tucked.\n\nHis mom grew up in Texas and raised him a Longhorns fan. Brandon and his mom were supposed to go to a Texas Longhorns game Nov. 17, a present she had promised for his senior year.\n\nInstead, Nikki Tyson went with the rest of her family and scattered some her son's ashes along an end zone in the Longhorns' Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium.\n\nNo criminal charge has been filed against Mark Chastain or anyone else after the investigation by the Sheriff's Office and a meeting about the case with prosecutors at the 10th Judicial Circuit Solicitor's Office. Deputies and prosecutors met to discuss the case in November. The case was further reviewed in late February, investigators said.\n\nSolicitor David Wagner said in an interview this month that prosecutors never had the file on Tyson's death in their office, but he said he was familiar with the facts of the case. He said a second round of toxicology testing done on samples taken from Tyson's body \"discovered mushrooms,\" confirming he had ingested them before he died.\n\n\"The people who were there that night say he had just gone ballistic,\" Wagner said. \"The physical evidence, statements and 911 call here showed one thing: He was acting like he was out of his mind. Everything added up to self-defense, and South Carolina's castle doctrine says the shooter has a right to defend himself in his own home.\n\n\"The witnesses said Brandon was behaving totally out of character. This is an extremely sad case, and my heart goes out to the families involved. You may never know the things that drugs can be laced with. I'd love to know where those mushrooms came from. If you can stop that source, maybe you can prevent another family from having to go through this.\"\n\nTyson's parents filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Mark Chastain on Oct. 31, saying he owed a duty of care to the teenager he knew. Chastain instead made a decision to retrieve a gun from an upstairs bedroom and then searched for their son until he found and shot him, the lawsuit alleged. Chastain filed a counterclaim Jan.15, alleging that the Tysons were negligent in supervising their son and suing them for damages done to his home.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled March 15, according to court records. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.\n\nReached by phone Tuesday, Mark Chastain said, \"My attorney has advised me not to say anything. I wish I could. There's a lot of wrong information out there. I've just been told not to say anything. It was just a bad situation, and I wish I could say more.\"\n\nThough the Anderson County Sheriff's Office considers the case closed, the Sheriff's Office conducted interviews related to the investigation as recently as March 5, according to case records. Tyson's parents have asked the State Law Enforcement Division to review the case, they said, but as of Friday, they had not received a response from South Carolina's top law-enforcement agency.\n\n'Felt like the whole house was falling down'\n\nCrickets chirped in the background as Matthew Chastain was interviewed by Jeff Finley, a detective with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office. It was about 4:30 a.m. on Sept. 8. The sounds of pre-dawn are captured in the background of the recorded interview.\n\nChastain, 17, recounted an interaction that he said he and Tyson had a few hours earlier. Chastain said Tyson said, \"Hey, I'm going to take some 'shrooms.\"\n\n\"I was like, 'I don't know if that's really a good idea,'\" Chastain told the investigator. \"He kind of convinced me into taking them. I've got a lot of stuff going for me. I don't really want to be doing too much of that. I try to keep my mind focused on the things it needs to be focused on. I took them anyways, like I shouldn't have.\"\n\nChastain said the mushrooms were in a bag, and he said he ate a hard stem \"that looked like a straight-up mushroom.\"\n\nNone of the other boys there that night said they ate them.\n\nChastain said that before the shooting that he had gone upstairs to take a shower. He was still in the bathroom, he said, when suddenly \"it felt like the whole house was falling down.\"\n\nIt is unclear how Tyson arrived at the Chastains' house that night. His mother, Nikki, said he had no vehicle or cellphone when she dropped him off at a different friend's house earlier in the day. When investigators asked the other teens how Brandon Tyson got there, some said they had \"no clue\" and others said he \"just showed up.\"\n\nWhat Mark Chastain told investigators about the day Brandon Tyson died\n\nMark Chastain told Staff Sgt. Erik Russell, an investigator with the Sheriff's Office, that he had gotten into bed when his son Matthew came running into the bedroom.\n\nNikki Chastain also went downstairs amid the commotion.\n\n\"I feared for everybody's life,\" Mark Chastain, who was injured, said during an interview at his hospital bedside the morning of the shooting.\n\nChastain, bloodied, had a bite mark on his cheek, a chunk of flesh missing. The injury required at least two surgeries, according to statements included in the case file.\n\nChastain said that when he went downstairs before the shooting, Tyson bit him.\n\n\"When he did that, I ran upstairs to get the gun,\" Chastain told Russell.\n\nChastain said he retrieved the .38 Smith and Wesson revolver from a sock drawer. He also went into a bathroom and looked at his face, according to investigators. A bloody towel was part of the evidence that was collected.\n\nBack downstairs with the gun, Mark Chastain fired at least two shots at Brandon Tyson, according to case records. Shots can be heard on the 911 call's recording.\n\nOne shot near Tyson's neck left a superficial wound.\n\nChastain told investigators that Tyson tried to throw a wooden two-by-four at his wife. Jeff Finley, one of the Sheriff's Office detectives, described the wood as a \"homemade Jenga block.\"\n\nMark Chastain told investigators that he then fired another shot. That shot, which hit the right side of Tyson's head, was fatal.\n\nTyson was rushed to the hospital when deputies arrived at the Chastain home after receiving the 911 call from one of the teens. Tyson was shot sometime after 2 a.m. Sept. 8. He died at the hospital shortly before 4 a.m. His parents didn't know anything had happened to him, they said, until a coroner knocked on the door of their Anderson County home around 7:15 a.m.\n\n\"One way or another, we're going to have to get your blood,\" to test it, investigator Russell told Mark Chastain at the hospital.\n\nChastain's blood-alcohol content upon testing was 0.074 percent, according to Finley. A person with a .08 percent blood-alcohol content is legally considered to be impaired in South Carolina. Chastain also tested positive for marijuana.\n\nRussell asked Chastain in the hospital whether he was sure it was him who shot Tyson and that it wasn't someone else in the home.\n\n\"You did it? You're certain?\" Russell asked him.\n\n\"100 percent,\" Chastain answered.\n\nLater, at his home during a November re-enactment of the shooting for Sheriff's Office investigators, Chastain filled in other details. Chastain said he went downstairs before the shooting to find broken glass and Tyson punching windows. Chastain said he knew there were \"a couple of boys in here\" at the time and that he and the boys were all screaming at Tyson. He said he didn't remember which boys were present.\n\n\"He knocked me really hard in the head,\" Chastain said of Tyson.\n\nPhotos taken by Sheriff's Office investigators right after the shooting show five surviving boys at the home, but they give no indication of where each boy was on the property at the time of the shooting.\n\n'It doesn't mean we'll stop looking for answers'\n\nBrandon Tyson's parents said they still have so many questions about his death, whether what happened to him was thoroughly investigated, and what information they don't know about their son's final hours.\n\nTheir family has created a blog, Justice 4 Brandon, and is seeking information about where he was between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Sept. 7, 2018.\n\nBrandon's father, Jeremy, said they also question whether all of the injuries their son had when he died were self-inflicted. Jeremy Tyson said his son had \"blood all over him\" and that his injuries included a skull fracture, a broken nose and a broken jaw.\n\nAs to the bite that Chastain had on his cheek, Jeremy Tyson said he believes his son \"would only do this in self-defense.\"\n\nSheriff's Office investigators acknowledge they did not test all the teens at the Chastain home for gunshot residue and that they did not confiscate or search their cellphones. Investigator Andy Tribble said the deputies don't always test people for gunshot residue anymore, especially in a case where witnesses' versions of what happened are similar. Investigator Finley said deputies didn't take the teens' phones because they didn't have probable cause to believe they contained video or other information relevant to the shooting.\n\nAnderson County Sheriff Chad McBride said he stands behinds his agency's investigation. He said the blog created by Tyson's family has at times included misinformation and \"conspiracy theories\" that have no merit.\n\n\"Nobody wants to lose a child,\" McBride said. \"It's sad, and it's difficult. Our hearts break for them.\"\n\nNikki Tyson said she continues to hope that a grand jury or another investigative agency will review her son's death \"more deeply.\"\n\n\"Just because they close the case, it doesn't mean we'll stop looking for answers,\" she said. \"The truth is the truth.\"\n\nFollow Nikie Mayo on Twitter: @NikieMayo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2020/12/16/phoenix-police-fatally-shoot-ex-nfl-football-player-ekom-udofia/3921583001/", "title": "Video: Phoenix police fatally shoot ex-NFL football player Ekom Udofia", "text": "Phoenix police released video showing officers shooting a former NFL player at least 10 times and deploying stun bags, pepper balls and a dog on him before he died Nov. 30.\n\nIn a critical incident briefing posted on Monday, the Phoenix Police Department identified the man who was killed as 33-year-old Ekom Udofia, a former football player with the NFL and Stanford University.\n\nCritical incident briefings are media packages produced by police that provide more information about a police shooting.\n\nThe briefing included body-worn camera video showing Udofia approaching police officers while they yelled repeatedly for him to drop his weapon, later identified as a BB gun, before they shot him multiple times.\n\nThree officers shot at Udofia during the incident, firing at least 10 shots in total as well as several other less-lethal munitions.\n\nUdofia later died of his injuries.\n\nVideo shows multiple rounds of bullets, stun bags, pepper balls\n\nPhoenix police received a call around 2 a.m. Nov. 30 reporting that a man was behaving erratically near traffic at Indian School Road and 23rd Avenue, according to police department spokesperson Sgt. Mercedes Fortune.\n\nThe 911 caller told dispatchers that the man appeared to be under the influence of drugs and was jumping into traffic, audio from the call shows.\n\nTwo officers responded to the area and found Udofia near the roadway with what looked like a gun, Fortune continued.\n\nIn body-worn camera video partially obscured by the police vehicle's front doors, Udofia can be seen slowly walking toward the front bumper of the police car illuminated by its headlights.\n\nBoth officers can be seen with their guns drawn and pointed at Udofia. Both repeatedly demand he put down his weapon.\n\n\"Please drop the gun, dude!\" one officer yelled. \"Please, please do not make me shoot you!\"\n\nAs Udofia continued to approach the car, the officer yelled, \"Dude, I got to shoot him, bro!\"\n\nThe two officers asked him to drop the gun for at least 30 seconds before they fired their weapons, shooting at least five times. Udofia dropped to the blacktop in front of the vehicle. The officers continued to yell at Udofia, who was slowly rolling on the ground barefoot, to throw the gun away. Udofia can be heard screaming.\n\nOther officers then arrived on the scene. Footage shows one of them shoot Udofia, still lying on the ground, with stun bags and baton rounds.\n\nAfter about six minutes, one of the four officers can be heard yelling, \"He still got that gun in his hand?\"\n\nThen, Fortune said, Udofia pointed his weapon at the officers from the ground. This action cannot be seen clearly in the footage.\n\nPolice then shot Udofia with live rounds at least six more times.\n\nAs Udofia laid on the ground, one of the officers then shot at the back of his head and torso with multiple pepper balls and yelled, \"Move away from the gun!\"\n\nA police dog can be seen biting Udofia's leg and dragging him away from his BB gun across the asphalt.\n\nUdofia was taken to the hospital where he died, Fortune said.\n\nFortune identified the officers who shot Udofia as Ryan Hoffrichter, Lance Wisuri, Nathaniel Hansen and Steve Mead. Three of them were assigned to the Cactus Park Precinct, and one of them was assigned to the Canine Unit of the Tactical Support Bureau. Each of the officers had between two and 21 years of service.\n\nNone of the officers were injured.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department will conduct both internal and criminal investigations into their actions. Once complete, the criminal investigation will be sent to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office to determine if any of the officers should be charged in Udofia's killing.\n\nLaw enforcement have shot at least 48 people in Maricopa County in 2020, including at least 22 by the Phoenix Police Department, according to The Arizona Republic's analysis.\n\nScottsdale football star remembered as 'soft-spoken,' struggled with mental health\n\nUdofia was from a Nigerian family in Scottsdale, Arizona. Before playing football as a public policy major at Stanford University between 2005 and 2009 and briefly continuing on to the NFL to play with the Bengals and Saints, he was a sports star at Chaparral High School, according to people who knew him then.\n\n“He was smart, respectful, a team player, all the things you would want from a player,” said Ron Estabrook, former head coach at Chaparral when Udofia played there. “I remember sitting in his parents’ living room when Stanford was recruiting him. They recruited his older brother, too.”\n\nMesa Mountain View High school assistant football coach Tony Tabor, who was defensive line coach at Chaparral when Udofia played as a nose guard, remembered how the athlete started as a sophomore on Chaparral’s 13-1 state championship team in 2002.\n\nUdofia earned All-American honors and was rated one of the best linebackers in the country during his high school career, according to Stanford University.\n\nTabor said he last saw Udofia eight years ago, when he asked him to talk to his Scottsdale Desert Mountain High School football team. He went to Udofia’s birthday party that same year.\n\n“When I saw him eight years ago, he was the same kid I always knew,\" Tabor said. \"Super soft-spoken. Never swore. He never showed hostility. He’d put a helmet on the football field and chew you apart. But when he was not on the field, he’d lead the devotion before a meal.”\n\nAccording to court documents, Udofia had struggled with his mental health in recent years and had been arrested and placed on probation for crimes like disorderly conduct and indecent exposure. However, records from earlier in November show that he was successfully completing his probation requirements, including finding employment and complying with the Maricopa County Mental Health Court.\n\n\"Additionally, he does not view himself as a bad person and believes he needs more help with his mental health than jail time,\" court documents said. \"His criminal history has all been mental health related and he is in a good place now.\"\n\nBoth Udofia's former coaches had not seen Udofia for several years but were surprised and pained to hear about his death.\n\n“The kid was a great kid,” Tabor said. “It killed me to hear that. It was just the nicest family you ever met in your life. I don’t know if something happened to him, if something snapped.\"\n\n“It was not like him, contrary to the kid I knew,” Estabrook said. “I would say he was going to be a successful person in life. That would have been my prediction at the time.”\n\nReach the reporter at emily.wilder@arizonarepublic.com or on Twitter @vv1lder.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/10/news-around-states/40583661/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: A towering “Baby Trump” protest balloon was knifed and deflated by someone during President Donald Trump’s Saturday trip to Alabama, organizers said. The incident occurred during Trump’s visit to watch the University of Alabama football game. The balloon, which is more than 20 feet tall, was set up in a nearby park. Jim Girvan, the organizer of a group that “adopts” out the Trump balloons for protests, said a man charged the balloon with a knife and cut an 8-foot-long gash in the back. In a news release, Tuscaloosa police said Hoyt Deau Hutchinson, 32, was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal mischief. The orange, diaper-clad, cellphone-clutching caricature of the president is often taken to Trump appearances as a way to protest him. “Baby Trump” first rose over London when local activists brainstormed a way to troll Trump. Now, several groups raise money to bring balloon replicas across the U.S. It is unclear whether Hutchinson has an attorney who could comment.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: State officials said they need another 10 years to reduce air pollution by half in Fairbanks, but the deadline is Dec. 31. The Daily News-Miner reported that U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan proposed a bill to push the deadline as late as December 2028 to comply with smoke pollution standards. Representatives under Sullivan said state officials requested the bill. The state Department of Environmental Conservation said in a state implementation cleanup plan that 2029 is the earliest Fairbanks could reach federal air quality standards. State officials said a five-year extension could be requested if they do not meet the clean air quality deadline. Officials said a new plan for clean air must be developed if the request is denied. Officials said they are already developing that plan.\n\nArizona\n\nKingman: Mohave County in northwestern Arizona is officially on the record as a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” in support of gun rights. The county Board of Supervisors’ unanimous vote last Monday followed similar actions by some state, county and local governments to take a public stance on the issue. The resolution said in part the board won’t authorize county spending or other resources for “enforcing laws that unconstitutionally infringe on the people’s right to keep and bear arms.” Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar and GOP state legislators Sonny Borrelli and Leo Biasiucci spoke in favor of the resolution that County Supervisor Hildy Angius called a nonbinding “statement of fight.” Mohave County Democratic Party Chairperson Mary McCord Robison urged the board to delay consideration of the resolution, which she called divisive and redundant.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The U.S. Senate has confirmed a former Arkansas solicitor general as federal judge in Little Rock. President Donald Trump nominated 40-year-old Lee Philip Rudofsky for the U.S. District Court in eastern Arkansas. The Senate approved the pick Thursday on a party-line vote. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that Democratic Sen. Patty Murray from Washington argued against Rudofsky’s confirmation, saying he supported abortion restrictions when he was a solicitor general and opposed LGBTQ rights. Rudofsky had said he would follow Supreme Court precedent. Arkansas Republican Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton backed Rudofsky’s confirmation. Rudofsky served as Walmart’s senior director of global anti-corruption compliance. He clerked for judges in Massachusetts and Alaska. Federal district judges can serve for life and earn $210,900 annually.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg will soon be staring down at pedestrians in the heart of San Francisco where an artist is painting a massive mural of the Nobel nominee. SFGate reported Friday that Argentine muralist Andres Iglesias, who signs his art with the pseudonym Cobre, is set to finish the artwork in Union Square sometime this week. Iglesias told SFGate he is donating his time to complete the work and that he hopes the mural helps people realize “we have to take care of the world.” He also painted a mural of Robin Williams in downtown San Francisco that has since been demolished. Cobre said he had been searching for a building downtown for a new mural when he was approached by environmental nonprofit One Atmosphere.\n\nColorado\n\nAspen: Researchers continue to study a series of destructive avalanches in Colorado last winter. Some of the avalanches from March 1-14 caused unprecedented damage, destroying a home and a mining structure dating to 1881. Brian Lazar with the Colorado Avalanche Information Center told an audience in Carbondale on Wednesday nobody alive had seen avalanches that severe in Colorado. The center recorded nearly 1,000 avalanches but Lazar suspected the real number was closer to 5,000. The center documented 87 avalanches at or above D4, or fourth-strongest on a D1-D5 scale. Officials documented 24 D4 avalanches in Colorado over the previous nine years. The Aspen Times reported some mountains got up to 12 feet of snow.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new group has been charged with finding ways to improve recycling efforts in Connecticut and lower costs for cities and towns. House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz’s Blue Ribbon Panel on Recycling is scheduled to hold its first meeting Tuesday at the Legislative Office Building. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities in March said municipalities across the state have seen municipal recycling move from being a revenue generator for their communities to a growing expense as the market price for recyclables has collapsed. In January 2018, China stopped accepted lower-grade recyclables, leaving many communities in the U.S. without a market. The conference gave the example of Bridgeport, where recycling shifted from a $129,000 revenue generator to a nearly $400,000 expense. And North Haven had gone from paying no cost to $70 per ton.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The sound of engines revving briefly filled Wilmington’s Hilltop neighborhood Saturday afternoon when members of the Pagan Motorcycle Club gathered to remember a man who was shot and killed by a Wilmington police officer 13 years ago. About 30 members gathered near the steps of a home in the 1400 block of W. Sixth Street, where Derek J. Hale was shot to death by Lt. William Browne during an investigation of the motorcycle club. Browne was cleared of wrongdoing by the state Attorney General’s office in 2007. The group’s motorcycles filled the block, arranged in two long lines between parked cars as the club’s leader, Paul Fitzwater, shared a few words with the motorcyclists and residents looking on from their porches. After less than 10 minutes, their engines roared and the group left. Hale was a decorated Marine who had served two tours in Iraq. He had a son and a daughter. In 2010, Wilmington settled a lawsuit filed by Hale’s widow, Elaine. She agreed to drop a federal lawsuit against Wilmington after she received $875,000 from the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: On Nov. 19, the district will say one of its hardest goodbyes, to beloved panda Bei Bei, WUSA-TV reported. The 4-year-old panda will leave the Smithsonian National Zoo for China as part of the panda diplomacy program between the U.S and China. An agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association requires all cubs born at the zoo to move to China when they turn 4. Bei Bei will play in his outside habitat for the last time on Nov. 19 between 7 and 8 a.m. before he makes his way to Dulles Airport for a long flight. To give his many adoring fans time to bid Bei Bei farewell, the Smithsonian National Zoo is holding a series of public events from Nov. 11 through Nov. 18. Panda Cam 1 will focus exclusively on Bei Bei for the duration of his “goodbye week.” Through Nov. 17 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., patrons can visit Bei Bei in his outdoor habitat and write a postcard that will get sent to China with Bei Bei. At 11 a.m., panda keepers will be on hand to answer any Bei Bei questions. Bei Bei was born on Aug. 22, 2015, and was given his name, which means ‘precious’ or ‘treasure’, five weeks after his birth by Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan, the first lady of China. Bei Bei will be accompanied by one panda keeper and a veterinarian on his nonstop flight to Chengdu, China, and the team will monitor him throughout the flight, and make sure he has a ready supply of his favorite treats.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Shark experts said the coast of Florida is starting to heat up with great white shark activity. OCSEARCH, a research group, said the annual migration to warmer waters off the Florida and Carolinas coasts is underway. The Palm Beach Post reported that eight great white sharks tagged by the Utah-based research group were spotted from New Jersey to Florida in the last week. Three other sharks that had been tagged were detected Wednesday in waters on North Carolina beaches, and two more sharks – Helena and the 2,076-pound Unama’ki – made their presence known with toothy grins just west of Key West in September. Unama’ki had been tagged off Nova Scotia in September. She’s 15-feet, 5-inches long. It’s not unusual for great whites to call southern waters home during winter and sightings are common near popular fishing and diving spots in Florida through spring.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service is giving visitors an inside look at the life of Union soldiers occupying a captured Confederate fort on the Georgia coast during the Civil War. Veterans Day weekend events at Fort Pulaski National Monument include reenactors taking on the roles of troops in the 48th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The regiment was stationed at Fort Pulaski east of Savannah for a year after it was seized from Confederate troops in 1862. The Union soldiers stayed ready for a counterattack that never came. Weekend visitors will see how the soldiers performed drills, as well as cannon and weapon firing demonstrations. Exhibits throughout the park include photographs of the 48th New York Volunteers during their time at Fort Pulaski.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Navy said it is considering a new plan to use double-wall tanks to upgrade a fuel storage facility in Honolulu. Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday that the Navy updated its initial proposal to reinforce tanks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. The Navy said if the upgrade cannot be completed it will relocate the fuel in 20 tanks that sit atop the Southern Oahu Basal Aquifer. A 2014 leak of 27,000 gallons of fuel at the facility threatened Oahu’s drinking water and prompted calls for improvements. The Navy’s Sept. 9 proposal had favored single-wall tank upgrades with added monitoring features. The plan was rejected by a Honolulu City Council committee last month and was opposed by the Board of Water Supply.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A panel of lawmakers is looking at making changes to Idaho’s only independent performance evaluations agency, possibly by having staffers focus more on legislative budgets and less on whether state programs are working properly. The Office of Performance Evaluations does deep-dive research and auditing of state agencies and programs, looking for ways the state can fix any problems and become more efficient. Often the reports have uncovered big issues, such as increasing delays in the parole process, rapidly growing caseloads for child welfare workers and problems with the monitoring of state contracts worth millions of dollars. Rep. Wendy Horman, the House vice-chair of the legislative budget-writing committee, said her committee needs more staffers available to quickly research and answer questions about the impact of state budgeting decisions. But House Minority Leader Mat Erpelding said the right solution would be to add more resources to the budget-writing committee, not to cannibalize another office.\n\nIllinois\n\nOlympia Fields: A suburban Chicago post office has been named in honor of Robert Martin, an original member of the famed all-black Tuskegee Airmen who flew scores of missions in World War II. U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, who introduced legislation in February to name the post office for Martin, called him “an American hero.” Martin’s children attended the unveiling of a plaque in their father’s honor at the post office. He lived in Olympia Fields from 2008 until his death at age 99 in July 2018. Martin was born in Dubuque, Iowa, on Feb. 9, 1919. Before the war, Martin earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He was a captain when he was discharged from the Army in 1945. He then worked as an electrical engineer in Chicago until retiring in 1988. Martin received his wings in 1944 and was commissioned a second lieutenant, then flew with a squadron based in Italy. On his 64th mission, Martin was shot down by enemy gunfire near Zagreb, Yugoslavia, in March 1945. He spent a month behind enemy lines with partisans in a secret Yugoslavian camp before the Allied advance allowed him to return to his base in Italy.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:The Veterans Day Council of Indianapolis has canceled the annual Veterans Day Parade because of the possibility of inclement weather, The American Legion, Department of Indiana said Friday. “The projected freezing temperatures and possible snowfall/freezing rain could not only create a dangerous situation for all involved, but it could also hinder operations to clear the roads along the parade route,” the group wrote in a press release. The National Weather Service said that along with bitterly cold temperatures, there is a chance of rain and snow before 11 a.m. Monday, and that rain is likely between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. There is also a 40% chance of snow Monday night, the weather service said. The annual Veterans Day Service will still take place, but it has been moved indoors to the Indiana War Memorial’s Pershing Auditorium, according to the release. It will begin at 11 a.m. Monday. The Veterans Day Breakfast, scheduled for 8-10 a.m. in the Murat Arabian Room at 502 N. New Jersey St., will not be affected by weather, the release said\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Iowa Appeals Court has ruled against a convicted killer who said he “died” during a medical emergency and thus fulfilled his life sentence. Wapello County court records said Benjamin Schreiber has been serving the life term since being convicted in 1997 of beating a man to death. Schreiber said his heart stopped five times on March 30, 2015, at a hospital where he had been taken from the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison. Schreiber filed for release in April 2018. A district judge found little merit in Schreiber’s argument, saying his filing confirmed he was still among the living. The appeals court affirmed that ruling Wednesday, saying: “Schreiber is either alive, in which case he must remain in prison, or he is dead, in which case this appeal is moot.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The city will add the state’s first electric buses to its public transit fleet in hopes of saving hundreds of thousands of dollars and reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. The first bus is expected to hit the road this month, and an additional 10 should come into service next year, KCUR reported. The city’s transit director, Mike Tann, won a $2 million federal grant that allowed the city to purchase four new electric buses from manufacturer ProTerra. Tann also bought seven smaller electric buses from a company called Custom Coach Works, and those vehicles will replace aging buses that look like old trolleys and run downtown Wichita routes. Wichita Transit has also remodeled its bus barn and placed0 charges for 14 buses. Transit workers will plug in buses to charge overnight, which should prepare buses to run for about 150 miles by morning. The agency estimates each electric bus will run for 12 years and save the city $462,000 in that time compared to its diesel counterpart. Tann estimated every diesel bus in the fleet will be replaced by an electric- or hydrogen-powered bus as early as 2027.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Officials have removed drought declarations for all 120 counties in the state. A Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet news release said recent rains have eliminated precipitation deficits and improved stream flows and soil moisture levels. Statewide drought declarations were issued Oct. 3, but officials said precipitation since then has helped ease the moderate to severe drought conditions. State climatologist Stuart Foster said October finished as the third-wettest on record.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Nearly $10 million in 2010 oil spill money is rebuilding a barrier island bird rookery off Louisiana. Work on Queen Bess Island had to wait for this year’s nesting season to end in August and must finish by late February or early March before the next nesting season. Queen Bess Island was the first spot where brown pelicans were returned to Louisiana after the pesticide DDT wiped out Louisiana’s state bird in the 1960s. Today, the island supports Louisiana’s third-largest brown pelican nesting colony, with about 15% to 20% of all nests in the state. But its usable nesting area is now down to about 5 acres. The island also was heavily hit by oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, but that has been cleaned and birds are back. Plans call for 30 acres of pelican habitat and 7 acres for terns and skimmers, smaller birds that nest on gravel. The $9.8 million contract with New Orleans-based Pontchartrain Partners LLC. is only part of the project. Engineering, design, operation, maintenance and monitoring will be adding up to nearly $7 million more, said Chuck Perrodin, spokesman for the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. Many pelicans have stayed in the area despite the construction work, and biologists said that’s a good sign, WVUE-TV reported.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine troopers are preparing to issue traffic citations via computers in their cruisers. The motorist gets a printout of the citation, which is electronically sent to court. Trooper Anthony Keim, the first to test the “e-citation program,” said it’s easier to type out the ticket than to write out a ticket by hand. It will be rolled out to all state police cruisers in December. But it comes with a cost of about $1,000 per cruiser. That’s a problem for smaller departments but some of them are hoping grants might eventually cover those costs.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A Maryland lawmaker said legislation is being considered to resolve a long-running lawsuit in federal court over program disparities between four historically black colleges and traditionally white colleges. Del. Charles Sydnor, a Baltimore County Democrat, said Friday he is working with other lawmakers on proposals for a settlement of at least $577 million. That’s the amount that an attorney representing the HBCUs has recommended. Sydnor spoke at a news conference to discuss a rally this week calling for a fair resolution. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has offered to settle the lawsuit for $200 million over 10 years. House Speaker Adrienne Jones has urged Hogan to settle the case for $577 million. Hogan responded that lawmakers could find ways to reach the higher amount in the upcoming budget process.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNeedham: A solider killed in World War II has been laid to rest after his remains were recently identified. WCVB-TV reported a memorial service was held Saturday at St. Joseph Church in Needham for U.S. Army 1st Lt. Joseph Edward Finneran. He was buried with full military honors in Mount Benedict Cemetery in Boston’s West Roxbury neighborhood, alongside his mother. The 22-year-old was shot down north of Bucharest, Romania, on Aug. 1, 1943, during a bombing mission. He was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and other military honors. Finneran’s unidentified remains had been kept inside a military cemetery in Belgium for 70 years, along with other Americans killed during “Operation Tidal Wave.” The Pentagon last month announced it had accounted for Finneran using anthropological and DNA analysis.\n\nMichigan\n\nBowne Township: Quick-thinking hunters in central Michigan rescued two deer who became locked in battle. WOOD-TV reported that insurance agent Mark Johnson spotted the rutting bucks in a field with their antlers entangled. He figured the eight-point bucks would die from exhaustion or starvation if they stayed stuck. Video of Wednesday’s rescue on WOOD-TV’s website showed Johnson’s friend, Brad Lyons, deploying a specialized branch saw to cut part of an antler. That enabled the bucks to pull away and run off. The rescue came a week before the opening of firearms deer season. Johnson, Lyons and another acquaintance who showed up to help are hunters and in other circumstances, the bucks would have been prized trophies. What they got from the encounter instead was a good story to tell and a chunk of sawed-off antler.\n\nMinnesota\n\nFergus Falls: Gov. Tim Walz headed to Fergus Falls for the 17th annual Governor’s Deer Hunting Opener. Walz spoke at the Big Buck Brunch on Friday to kick off the event. He met later with local fourth- and fifth-graders to talk about the importance of outdoor education. The governor was scheduled to head into the woods in Austin on Saturday morning for the opening of Minnesota’s firearms deer season. It was Walz’s first Governor’s Deer Hunting Opener, a tradition that began under Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Walz is known mostly as a pheasant hunter. The governor bagged a rooster Saturday in mostly wet and windy conditions. The Star Tribune reported that Walz was joined by Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan, state Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen, Explore Minnesota Director John Edman, members of Pheasants Forever, as well as local elected officials and Austin Mayor Tom Stiehm. Nearly 500,000 hunters are expected to participate in Minnesota’s 2019 deer season. According to a 2011 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report, all hunting-related expenditures in Minnesota totaled $725 million annually, with deer hunting helping to support 3,760 jobs.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: A monument is being rededicated in a national park on a Civil War battlefield. A ceremony is scheduled for Monday at Vicksburg National Military Park. The Vicksburg Post reported the monument underwent a $75,000 restoration funded by the state and promoted by a group called Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park and Campaign. Work included masonry repairs, testing of the monument’s lightning suppression system and thorough cleaning. It was done by the National Park Service’s Historic Preservation Training Center. The monument was dedicated on Nov. 12, 1909, and honors the state’s 32 infantry units, 17 artillery units, and 37 cavalry units that served in the Confederate Army during the 1863 Vicksburg Campaign of the Civil War.\n\nMissouri\n\nEminence:A herd of seven wild horses that was causing problems at a state park has been rounded up and adopted. The Springfield News-Leader reported that visitors to Echo Bluff State Park in Eminence were feeding the horses, raising concerns that someone might be seriously injured. That didn’t happen, but one of the horses chewed up a park visitor’s motorcycle seat. Missouri Wild Horse League secretary Carolyn Dyer said several cars received paint damage from horses in the park lodge’s parking lot. One of the horses even seemed to figure out how to press the button to open the lodge’s front door with its nose. Dyer said all seven of the wild horses in the park found homes with Missouri horse lovers.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Wildlife authorities are investigating the poaching of a mule deer buck in southwest Montana. KECI-TV reported that Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks game warden Justin Singleterry said the case involves a 4-by-4 buck that was found poached east of Corvallis in the Bitterroot Valley. An investigation determined the buck was killed on location and then discarded down a steep embankment. Nothing was taken from the deer and its meat was left to waste. A member of the public reported the deer poached last Thursday. The deer might have been killed days before it was discovered.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Wildlife officials are urging owners of small pets – even those in cities – to be vigilant in protecting them from coyotes. Coyotes are common throughout Nebraska, including in some urban areas where there are creek bottoms, green space with tall grass and agricultural fields. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission cautioned people against approaching or feeding a coyote. It also suggested not leaving pet food outside and keeping an eye on pets outside, even if they’re out for just a few minutes. Pets should be kept on a leash and not allowed to roam at night. The commission said most interactions people experience with coyotes are between coyotes and dogs because of the territorial nature of both animals. Coyotes typically avoid people, so attacks on humans are rare.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A 67-year-old man who became one of the longest-serving inmates in Nevada history after he was convicted of murdering a woman at a Lake Tahoe casino in 1971 has been released from prison. Michael Anselmo spent 47 years behind bars. His Nov. 1 release came more than a decade after a Nevada Supreme Court justice who previously prosecuted him as Washoe County district attorney recommended he be given the possibility of parole. Anselmo initially was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in 1972 in the killing of a 22-year-old co-worker at Cal Neva Lodge at Crystal Bay on Tahoe’s north shore. His sentence was commuted in 2005 at the urging of Justice Bob Rose to allow for possible parole. Rose told fellow members of the Pardons Board that, in those days, a convicted murderer could expect to serve 20 to 30 years. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that Anselmo did not have a constitutional right to parole. He was finally granted parole for the murder charge in June 2018 but remained imprisoned to complete his sentence for a 1976 escape attempt.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A plaque commemorating a New Hampshire man who was piloting one of the planes that was hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, is missing from the Portsmouth tree where it had been chained for 17 years. The plaque honors Tom McGuinness, the co-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11, which was hijacked by terrorists and crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. A year after McGuinness’ death, his widow planted a maple tree in front of the Thomas J. McIntyre Federal Building in Portsmouth and installed the plaque. Seacoastonline.com reported it appears a bolt that connected the plaque to a chain was cut. City and federal officials don’t know what happened. Police were unaware the plaque was missing until asked about it by the news organization.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: Some residents have been getting an early Thanksgiving surprise. A gaggle of 40 to 60 wild turkeys has been aggressively terrorizing residents daily in a 55-and-older community in Ocean County. Holiday City residents said the turkeys are blocking doorways, pecking at cars and behaving aggressively when they are shooed away. The wild turkeys can sometimes weigh between 16 and 24 pounds and run up to 20 mph. The township has received dozens of complaints but said its animal control is powerless in capturing or stopping the birds because they are not licensed to trap wildlife. A spokesman for the state’s Department of Environmental Protection said the agency is aware of the issue but does not have further comment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRehoboth: The Navajo Nation honored the life of a police officer who died from a medical problem while on duty. Friends, colleagues and tribal officials paid tribute to Sgt. Lamar Martin during a funeral on Friday in Rehoboth. A press release from the Navajo Nation said relatives described Martin as a great family man who loved his wife and children, enjoyed outdoor activities and liked reading books and comic books. His fellow officers recalled him as a mentor and leader who didn’t hesitate to share the expertise he gained in 22 years with the Navajo Police Department. Martin was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and New Mexico National Guard. He’s survived by his wife and five children.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is facing calls to create a $1 billion fund for climate change projects ranging from mass transit to aid to municipalities when fossil fuel plants close. A coalition of environmental and labor groups called NY Renews is asking Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo to include such a fund in his budget proposal. They said the money should come from New York’s general fund, and said additional revenue is needed to address climate change. Coalition members in an Oct. 28 letter to Cuomo said the fund could also support direct investments in renewables, environmental justice community projects and energy efficiency efforts for low-income families. Supporters said the fund will help New York fulfill a sweeping climate change law that passed this year. That law called for zero-emissions statewide by 2050.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: A University of North Carolina system investigation about the former interim chancellor of East Carolina University determined he “probably consumed” between seven and 10 drinks over several hours while visiting popular student bars in Greenville. The system released late Friday a report from a law firm it hired to investigate events involving Dan Gerlach in late September and anonymous emails sent to university leaders about him. Videos and photos on social media showed Gerlach “interacting with college-aged young adults and taking selfies.” Gerlach was placed on administrative leave, then resigned Oct. 26 as another video surfaced. The report found the emailed allegations largely false. The law firm did find Gerlach ultimately drove a short distance home after visiting the bars. Gerlach didn’t respond to a text on Saturday seeking comment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state will receive federal help for farmers and ranchers who struggled with an early blizzard and wet harvest conditions. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the secretarial disaster designation on Friday. Gov. Doug Burgum requested the help last week to help make federal loans available to farmers and ranchers. To qualify for a secretarial designation, a county must have experienced a minimum 30% production loss of at least one crop because of a natural disaster. In North Dakota, 47 of the state’s 53 counties report meeting that threshold.\n\nOhio\n\nAshland: A law enforcement official said he has persuaded bishops of an Amish sect to install blinking lights on buggies to make them more visible to motorists. The Ashland Times-Gazette reported Ashland County Chief Deputy Sheriff Carl Richert has been working with local Amish and Mennonite communities for years to make their buggies and wagons easier to spot. Richert said the community that agreed to install blinkers is more liberal and modern than other sects. He said he has warned community leaders that if they don’t begin using reflective tape and lights on their buggies the Ohio Legislature could pass laws mandating them. A local Amish buggy maker has ordered about 200 battery-powered blinking lights and anticipates community members will generally be willing to use them.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The state’s 35 tribal nations with casinos have rejected arbitration in a dispute with the state over whether existing gaming compacts automatically renew at the end of the year. The Tulsa World reported that the tribes said in a letter to state Attorney General Mike Hunter that they remain unified in the belief the compacts renew. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt has said the 15-year-old compacts expire at the end of the year and wants to renegotiate them to give the state a larger share of casino revenue. The tribes pay fees of between 4% and 10% of a casino’s net revenue and receive exclusive rights to operate casinos in the state. The fees generated nearly $139 million for the state last year. Stitt spokeswoman Baylee Lakey said the governor is disappointed the tribes declined arbitration. Hunter’s office declined comment.\n\nOregon\n\nCanyonville: Someone shot a bald eagle to death in western Oregon, and the police want to find out who did it. Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife troopers are seeking tips from the public. The troopers responded on Wednesday to a report that a bald eagle was seen dead in Lower Cow Creek, in Douglas County. A photo showed the bird face-down in the water. They determined it was shot one to two days before being found. A reward of up to $2,500 is offered for information leading to a conviction. The killing, or possession of a bald eagle or its parts, is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of up to $100,000.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHempfield Township: Officials said three trains were involved in a derailment in western Pennsylvania, prompting cancellation of rail service between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, but no injuries were reported. Three Norfolk Southern Corp. trains were involved in the derailment around 2:30 p.m. Friday just west of the Georges Station Road bridge in Hempfield, about 3 miles east of Greensburg. Norfolk Southern said one westbound train struck the rear of another, and derailed cars hit part of an eastbound train. A total of 11 rail cars transporting 50 shipping containers derailed, blocking lines that carry freight and passengers between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Norfolk Southern said in a statement Saturday that cranes, excavators, loaders and other heavy equipment were being used to clear the tracks, and service restoration was expected late Saturday night.\n\nRhode Island\n\nExeter: State Police said a single-engine Rockwell International 112A airplane experienced mechanical problems shortly after taking off from T.F. Green Airport in Warwick at 4:45 p.m. Saturday. The pilot was heading to Long Island, New York, but had to make an emergency landing on Interstate 95 near Exeter. State Police said the pilot changed the plane’s direction to avoid landing in the highway’s busier southbound side, potentially saving lives. The plane landed safely in the northbound lane. The pilot and his passenger were not injured. State Police didn’t name the pilot but said he’s a New York resident with eight years of flying experience. They’ve also turned over the plane to the National Transportation Safety Board for their review.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: It’s about to look a lot more like Christmas at the Statehouse. The Columbia Garden Club said the state Christmas tree will arrive in front of the Statehouse on Tuesday morning. First lady Peggy McMaster will speak along with members of the club after the tree arrives. Then the garden club will start decorating. The garden club said in a statement that the tree will be fully trimmed and the lights turned on Nov. 24 at the end of the annual Governor’s Carolighting ceremony. South Carolina has put up a Christmas tree in front of the Statehouse for more than 50 years.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Officials said South Dakota has sold nearly 26,000 fewer hunting licenses this year, which has cost the state more than $1 million in lost revenue. State Department of Game, Fish and Parks official Heather Villa told the Rapid City Journal that the long winter, flooding and a decline in the pheasant population could be to blame. However, she acknowledged that the drop in license sales could also be a continuation of a decades-long decline in hunting, trapping and fishing. The department generally gets about half its budget from license revenue, and it adopted a resolution last month to examine the recruitment, retention and reactivation of hunters, anglers and trappers. Gov. Kristi Noem has created a live-trap giveaway and set a bounty on certain predators to encourage hunting.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Mitsubishi Electric said it is talking with a potential buyer for its Memphis plant. Mitsubishi Electric general manager Joe Durante told The Commercial Appeal the company expects the third-party prospective buyer would hire at least some current Memphis workers. He said the possible buyer has a U.S. presence, but declined to identify it. The facility opened in 2013, creating buzz as a high-tech game-changer for manufacturing in Memphis. The 212-employee plant opened with more than $45 million in state and local tax incentives, and included the company’s head office for its U.S. transformer business. Durante declined to disclose current Memphis employment totals. Durante said the Japanese company came across the possible buyer while exploring ways to increase Memphis sales through a joint venture, technology sharing or a sale.\n\nTexas\n\nTurkey: A newly released report has found a September plane crash in est Texas occurred when the pilot’s crop-duster stalled out after dumping hundreds of gallons of pink water during a couple’s gender reveal celebration. One passenger suffered minor injuries when the plane crashed Sept. 7 near Turkey, about 260 miles northwest of Dallas. A National Transportation Safety Board report released Thursday said the pilot dumped about 350 gallons of pink water from the aircraft, which then stalled and crashed. Gender reveal parties for expecting parents have grown in popularity but mishaps can be deadly. Last month, an Iowa woman was killed when a homemade device that was meant to spray colorful powder into the air instead exploded like a pipe bomb.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah principal and teacher have returned to work from a week of paid leave after school district officials completed an investigation into a student dressed as a Nazi for a Halloween parade. The Davis County School District announced Friday the two Creekside Elementary employees have been reinstated but did not specify why they were placed on leave. Online photos showed a boy wearing a swastika on the sleeve of a long-sleeve dark brown shirt. Officials said the school district does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portrays or promotes hate in any form. District officials said it cannot discuss further details of the investigation. The student’s name or what disciplinary action was taken was not released. The United Jewish Federation of Utah called the costume “intolerably offensive.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Young people were in the forests of Vermont participating in a two-day youth deer hunting weekend. Anyone 15 years old or younger who successfully completed a hunter education course could participate if they obtained a hunting authorization and obtained a free youth deer hunting tag. The young hunter must be accompanied by an unarmed adult over 18 years of age who holds a Vermont hunting license. Youth deer hunting weekend is intended to ensure that young hunters get the quality training they need for lifelong participation. Vermont’s 16-day rifle deer hunting season begins Nov. 16.\n\nVirginia\n\nBristol: The state has received 18 requests for funding under a new pilot program that will dole out millions of dollars to reclaim abandoned coal mines. The Bristol Herald Courier obtained grant requests submitted for the federal government’s Abandoned Mine Land Pilot Program. The 18 requests ask for more than $24 million in funding; $10 million is to be awarded. The proposals range from outdoor recreation to agricultural uses. The Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy administers the program in Virginia. A department spokeswoman said the projects will be screened for eligibility. An advisory council will then recommend projects to the federal government for final approval. Clinch River Hemp Co. submitted the largest funding request. It wants $4.11 million for a project aimed at remediation by cultivating hemp.\n\nWashington\n\nIllia: The Nez Perce Tribe and Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission released 37 wild steelhead into the Snake River below Lower Granite Dam in hopes of boosting the number of spawning steelhead. The Lewiston Tribune reported the fish, known as kelts, were captured at the dam as they tried to return to the ocean after spawning in their natal streams. They were held for one or two years at Dworshak National Fish Hatchery to allow them to regain strength, and they were released Tuesday, ready to spawn again. Steelhead are unique among anadromous fish – fish that migrate from the sea to reproduce – in that they don’t necessarily die after spawning. Still, it’s rare for female steelhead to make it as far as the Lower Granite Dam to spawn a second time. Less than a half-percent of Snake River steelhead are able to make the repeat trip on their own, said Doug Hatch, a fisheries scientist with the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission at Portland, Oregon. The repeat spawners have on average about 5,000 eggs. Wild Snake River steelhead are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and this fall’s steelhead run is shaping up to be one of the worst on record. The kelt program is listed as one of the emergency responses that could be implemented when fish numbers are alarmingly low. The National Marine Fisheries Service said this week that steelhead numbers have declined steeply since a robust return recorded in 2014.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s Ethics Commission has determined that a panel of teenagers is subject to the state’s open meetings law. According to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the commission’s Open Governmental Meetings Committee determined Thursday that the Charleston Youth Council falls under the law’s requirements of advance public notice of meetings and agendas, restrictions on closed-door sessions and other provisions. Charleston Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin’s council aims to help seven to 13 city teens between 14 and 18 years old develop leadership skills and understand local government. They will attend city council meetings, perform community service and advise Goodwin on how Charleston can improve relations with its youth. The ethics panel was divided, with concerns about imposing onerous requirements on teenagers and other worries about creating a loophole that government entities might exploit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is proposing raising state employees’ minimum wage to $15. Evers’ administration released its 2019-21 state employee compensation plan Friday. It called for raising all permanent state workers’ minimum wage to $15 an hour beginning June 7, 2020. It also called for a 2% across-the-board salary increase in each year of the biennium and raises for prison guards. Their starting wage would increase from $16.65 to $18.22 an hour. According to Evers’ administration, the entire package is expected to cost $84.15 million. The plan is subject to legislative approval. The Legislature’s finance committee has authorized money to cover the 2% raises and the prison guard raises.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The Park County Animal Shelter in Cody began a three-week quarantine last Monday after a litter of kittens came in carrying the disease feline parvo. None of the shelter’s dozens of cats can leave and no more can enter during the quarantine. The outbreak has killed at least 15 kittens, including all nine in the infected litter. Shelter manager Valerie Swensrund told the Cody Enterprise a vaccine nearly eradicated the disease but some people have stopped vaccinating their cats. The virus damages the intestines, bone marrow and lymph nodes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/07/1968-york-pa-race-riots-black-marine-returned-home-find-tension/753988002/", "title": "1968 York race riots: Black Marine returned home to find tension", "text": "It was 1968 and Joe Mincer, just a few years past returning to York after a stint in the Marine Corps, was wondering about his hometown.\n\nHis service had taken him to the Far East and this country's deep South. He had seen the best of the country – the service, long integrated at the time, serving as a model for how the country could get past the legacy of its original sin, slavery.\n\nAnd he had seen the worst, in the deep South, Albany, Georgia, to be specific, a place in which Jim Crow reigned and African-Americans remained second-class citizens, facing oppressive discrimination and being targeted by white police for abuse.\n\nJust a few years after returning from the service, he was living in York when the city began to tear itself apart, the result of a variety of offenses, not the least of which was the brutality the black community felt at the hands of the police.\n\nHe was kind of surprised by it. He expected it to be different when he returned home.\n\n\"I thought York would be better,\" he said as he sat on the porch of his York home on a recent hot morning. \"It wasn't.\"\n\n***\n\nLike many returning servicemen, Joe had experienced a world that was quite different from the one in which he grew up.\n\nBack then, a lot of African-American students in the city schools were encouraged – or in some instances steered – to join the armed forces as an alternative to seeking higher education. There were unintended consequences.\n\nOne of those young men was Bobby Simpson, now executive director of the Crispus Attucks Community Center. \"A lot of guys went to the service, and when they got back, York was worse than before,\" Simpson said. \"And it pissed them off.\"\n\nThat was among the contributing factors in the riots in 1968 – and in 1969. A large number of young men who had served their country – some with distinction in the war in Vietnam – were not going to take their hometown's dismal treatment of African-Americans lying down. They were going to fight.\n\n\"Some of these guys had been victimized before going into the military,\" said Jeff Kirkland, who has done extensive research into the history of York's black community. \"They had experienced racism and discrimination, and when they got back, they found things hadn't changed. They were not ready to accept the status quo.\"\n\nIt had been simmering for years. Fifty years ago, it boiled over.\n\nA group of black youths gathered July 11, 1968, at Penn Park for a demonstration, a peaceful assembly called to protest the oppression and discrimination that was a fact of life in their community. The police viewed it as a disorderly gathering and skirmished with the protesters.\n\nWhen a police car was struck with a rock, an officer fired a shot into the air. The next few days, police and black youth clashed in the streets. Rocks and bottles gave way to gunfire, as some of those leading the African-American community were former servicemen and were familiar with firearms and their use.\n\nYork riots:50 years ago: First summer of rioting erupted in York, Pa.\n\nYork riots:York's race riots were a war that left dozens injured and two people dead\n\nYork riots:What has - and hasn't - changed in York since the race riots?\n\nIt ended, miraculously, with no casualties. But the tensions continued. In August, a white man named Chester Roach who lived above a meat market in South Penn Street, opened fire on a group of black youths with a shotgun for making, in his belief, too much noise. He wounded 10, touching off more unrest that resulted in the meat market being torched. On Sept. 21, a fight broke out after the William Penn-Cedar Crest football game at Small Field. Police broke it up by using canines to attack black youths. That fall, the Ku Klux Klan rallied in York, attracting a large crowd.\n\nThat was all prelude to the summer of 1969 and the deadly race riots. Peter Levy, a York College professor who has written a book about the civil unrest in the 1960s, titled, \"The Great Uprising: Race Riots in Urban America During the 1960s,\" concluded that York \"experienced the twenty-sixth most severe riot or urban revolt out of over 500 that occurred in the nation between 1963 and 1972. Adjusted for population, York’s revolt may have been the most severe of the era.”\n\nJoe Mincer reflects on that and concludes that a lot of young black men who served in the military had seen enough.\n\n\"They had served their country, and when they got home, this is what they faced?\" he said, shaking his head.\n\n***\n\nJoe Mincer was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, spending just the first month and a half there before his family migrated to York in search of steady and lucrative work in the town's factories.\n\nThe family settled on Freys Avenue, a narrow street just east of downtown, near Broad Street. Joe went to York City Schools, attending the Aquilla Howard School on East King Street, an all-black school that housed six grades in four classrooms. When he was in the sixth grade, his mother fell ill and wound up in York Hospital, and Joe went to live with kin in Delta.\n\nIt was a vastly different world, rural and almost exclusively white, save for a few black tenant farmers. He was one of only three African-American students at Delta Elementary.\n\nThe family lived out in the country, and he and his brother had to walk about a mile to catch the school bus – which turned out to be fortunate, in a way. Walter Miller had a dairy farm across the road from the bus stop, and Joe and his brother worked there.\n\nJoe earned $20 a month to drive the manure spreader and muck out the stalls as the cows were milked, the odor of the excrement often sending him running out of the barn to throw up. He also worked inside the silo, shoveling the corn meal as it flowed into the structure, yelling \"Stop!\" when the feed reached his chest so he could climb atop it.\n\nHe made friends, and it was a pretty good life. The people seemed friendly, and he had no problems. He recalled he had developed some strong abs through the physical labor, and his friends would challenge him, saying if they could make him grunt by punching him in the stomach, he'd have to give them 50 cents. If he didn't make a sound, they had to fork over a quarter. He made a few dollars that way.\n\nHe moved back to York with about two months to go in the eighth grade, placed in a remedial class. He was reading books that he had already read in grade school, and when he mentioned it, the teacher told him he didn't have much longer to go before entering high school. The teacher would sometimes leave the room, and Joe wound up running the class, helping the other kids with their reading.\n\nAt York High, he was enrolled in what was called the commercial curriculum, classes that offered instruction in office skills. He thought of attending college, but that seemed like a far-off dream. There was no way his family could afford it.\n\nHe was on the football team, a running back and outside linebacker, on a team that wasn't very good. His senior year, the team won one game.\n\nHe graduated in 1960 and was kind of aimless for a while. He hung out with some guys who got into some trouble and who got him into some trouble. That convinced him he needed to get away from his hometown.\n\n***\n\nHe and a buddy, Martin Doweary, decided to enlist in the service together. They went to the Air Force first, but that branch said it would be 90 days before they could join. The Army recruiter said it would take between 60 and 90 days. The Marine Corps recruiter told them 30 days, and they signed up, shipping out for basic training at Parris Island a month later.\n\nThey went in on the buddy system, guaranteed that they would serve together in the same unit for at least their first year. It turned out, at the end of basic training, that Martin was assigned to the infantry and Joe to ordnance supply at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, a result of his clerical training at York High.\n\nHe agreed to a transfer to Japan. On the way, during a stop in Hawaii, his commanding officer told him his orders had changed and he would be going to Okinawa.\n\nAt that time, American involvement in Vietnam was just starting to heat up. His unit returned from winter training to learn that they were being shipped out. They weren't told where they were going. It was top secret. They all thought they were going to 'Nam.\n\nThey sailed on a troop ship to the coast off Laos. They expected to make landing. But then, for reasons he's not sure about, the boat turned back and returned to Okinawa. Some of the guys on the boat were upset; they wanted to get into combat. Joe wasn't crazy about the idea. \"If we were told to go, I was ready to do my job to the best of my ability,\" he said. \"But they sent us back.\"\n\nUp until then, his experience in the service was good. At that point, the armed services had been integrated for 15 or 16 years, and black Marines were treated just like white Marines. There is something about the military, particularly the Marines, that fosters that kind of atmosphere. When your life depends on the guy next to you, as it might one day, it doesn't matter whether that guy is black or white – or green, for that matter. All that matters is that he is a soldier.\n\n***\n\nJoe never did serve in Vietnam. When he returned to Okinawa, he got word his mother was sick and had two weeks to live. He was granted emergency leave and came home. His mother hung on for another 11 months, and Joe wound up transferred to the Marine Air Station in Cherry Point, North Carolina.\n\nThere, he learned that a white Marine who had lower scores on evaluations than Joe had been awarded a promotion. Joe believed the promotion should be his, and he went to the first sergeant and lodged a complaint, saying he would request a \"mast,\" a hearing, with the commandant of the Marines if he was denied promotion.\n\nHe got the promotion.\n\nAnd a transfer to Albany, in southwest Georgia, the deepest of the deep South.\n\nWhere he got a taste of southern hospitality.\n\nThe town had a history. In 1961, a coalition of local black leaders and ministers organized protests against what was, essentially, American apartheid, the Jim Crow laws that stripped African-Americans of basic rights. The protests, which drew the attention and participation of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., were met with heavy opposition.\n\nKing was arrested and jailed twice in Albany. The protests were not successful, but they did draw attention to the moral bankruptcy of Jim Crow and those who sought to enforce it. (For example, the local newspaper then referred to African-Americans using the N-word in supposedly fair and balanced news stories.)\n\nJoe was concerned, but not too worried. He was a Marine, serving his country. Certainly, white folks could see past his skin color and see that he was just an American.\n\nWell, no.\n\nThere were a number of documented cases in which southern law enforcement targeted African-Americans. Joe said he experienced it himself. One night, he and a couple of buddies were driving through town when they approached a stoplight. A white cop pulled them over before they even got to the light and ticketed the driver for running the light. When the driver protested, saying he hadn't even gotten to the intersection when the cop pulled him over, the cop said the town had to collect fines to pay for the trouble stirred up by a man he called \"Martin Luther Coon.\"\n\nAnother time, Joe said, a white woman who had been beaten by her husband reported that it was two black men who had beaten her and tried to rape her, saying they had come from the Marine base. The Klan gathered and prepared to exact the kind of twisted justice served at the end of a rope. The CO at the base confiscated the weapons of all of the black Marines, fearing a shoot-out. Joe recalled that some of his white comrades offered their weapons so the black soldiers could defend themselves. The Klan backed down.\n\nThen there was the time Joe and two buddies went off the base to meet some women. On the way back, riding in a white Cadillac owned by a sergeant from the base, they got into a fender bender with a white motorist and soon several police cars converged on them, the cops exiting their cruisers with their guns drawn.\n\nThe cops found a bottle of whiskey in the car and accused the driver of drunken driving. The driver was sober, but the cops insisted that he was drunk and cuffed him, but not before he could hand the keys to the other guy. One of the cops said something to the guy and, not understanding, the guy said, \"Huh?\"\n\nThe guy was arrested for resisting arrest. Joe started to say something, but then he was put under arrest.\n\nThe cops gave them a choice – pay the fines, which would have totaled $1,450 – or hand over whatever money they had, save $25 so they could get back to their base, and they'd be free to go. They opted to do that.\n\nJoe was stunned. \"Because I left at 18, I never really had any problems that bad in York,\" he said. \"It was a different experience.\"\n\nAnd then he returned home. He expected things to be different in his hometown.\n\nBut he soon learned that York wasn’t much better than Albany. In some ways, it was worse.\n\n***\n\nHe was able to get a job at the now-defunct Bendix plant on East Market Street. But many returning black veterans had a hard time finding work or decent housing. And then there was the York City Police Department, which was run in the manner of Bull Connor, the notoriously racist commissioner for public safety in Birmingham, Ala., who used canine patrols and fire hoses to break up civil rights protests.\n\nJoe said he witnessed it firsthand, once seeing the police arrive on his street, led by a notoriously racist cop who had a rep in the black community for his brutality, to arrest one of his neighbors for an unknown offense. One of the men put his hands out to be cuffed, and the cop reached into his pocket for his blackjack and bludgeoned the young man. Another cop released a dog, but in an ironic twist, the dog went after the cop, biting his leg, since he had been the aggressor in the confrontation. Another irony: Joe's stepfather had a German shepherd named Roscoe that he sold to the police department for $50 a few years before. Many of the dogs the police deployed against the black community were sired by Roscoe.\n\nThere were tales of young black men being taken into custody and instead of being driven to the police station, they were taken to the parking lot behind Small Field and beaten.\n\nNot all of the cops were bad people, or racists, Joe recalled. But enough of them were to create a besieged atmosphere – a sense that the black community was under the rule of an occupying force.\n\n\"I was expecting to see something different when I came home,\" Joe said. \"In some ways, it was worse than Albany.\"\n\nIn early July 1968, Joe and his family were in Rhode Island visiting his brother when his brother asked him, \"What's going on in York?\" The riots had made the news.\n\nJoe returned home to find the city under siege.\n\nHe recalled police pointing rifles at his car as he tried to give a cousin a ride home to the Parkway projects, the police officer taking aim at his wife and infant daughter in the front seat. He thought the cop was going to shoot, but another cop stopped him, recognizing Joe and vouching for him.\n\nThe '68 riots were a precursor. There were meetings of the state Human Relations Commission that resulted in recommendations to reform the police department and to address discrimination in housing and employment.\n\nNothing was done.\n\nA year later, in 1969, it happened again, the streets becoming a battleground, this time with fatal results for York City Police Officer Henry Schaad and a black minister's daughter, Lillie Belle Allen.\n\n***\n\nNow 76 and retired from Caterpillar, Joe reflects on his experience in the service and what it was like to come home after serving his country and witnessing the violence perpetrated against his community.\n\n\"Things were different in the service,\" he said. \"Then, you get home and see nothing's changed here. Or it got worse. What did they expect to happen?\"\n\nAlso of interest, a gallery of photos below:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/07"}]}

It’s not like that.\n\n\"You don’t have some immediate pass out into oblivion.\"\n\nRodgers did say after taking ayahuasca \"you have some incredible reactions\" and later joked that on the field maybe \"the medicine just started spinning up inside me\" again after the celebration as the Packers went on to defeat the Bears, 27-10.\n\nWhat is ayahuasca and is it illegal in the United States?\n\nAccording to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, ayahuasca is a liquid-based psychedelic that can cause a person to hallucinate. The active chemical in ayahuasca is dimethyltryptamine (DMT).\n\nDMT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, which means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute the drug.\n\nBut ayahuasca has been used for centuries for religious and therapeutic purposes in South American countries like Peru. That is where Rodgers said he first experienced ayahuasca during the 2020 offseason.\n\nAaron Rodgers says ayahuasca and marijuana shouldn't be labeled as drugs\n\nOn Tuesday's show when McAfee asked Rodgers about ayahuasca and referenced it as a drug, he stopped the host.\n\nHe said labeling ayahuasca, like marijuana, or other plant-based substances, as a drug is a \"manipulative word\" that adds biases to them as opposed to medicines such as aspirin or cough medicine made from pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"Ayahuasca is not a drug,\" Rodgers emphatically said. \"It has properties in it that have hallucinogenic abilities. But it's not a drug. We're talking about plants here.\n\n\"It’s a very important point to make. This is how words are created in society to create a certain bias against certain things. I do think it's important to go on this ridiculous tangent how words are used to create bias. Those biases create fears and those fears prevent people from doing their own research or having their own idea and truth in a situation.\"\n\nPreviously:Aaron Rodgers says taking ayahuasca helped improve mental health and spurred MVP seasons\n\nWeek 3 NFL power rankings:Bills, Chiefs remain 1-2, but Dolphins among two new teams in top five\n\nSign up for our NFL newsletter:All the NFL news you need to know delivered right to you!\n\nDuring his COVID-19 controversy last year, Rodgers called upon people to take their health into their hands and said through his research he presented a 500-page report to the NFL hoping homeopathic treatments he took in place of the COVID-19 vaccines would constitute as being vaccinated.\n\nRodgers said he'll likely be called to take ayahuasca again\n\nRodgers said if he's \"called\" again to take ayahuasca, he would do it again.\n\n\"I don't think that was the last time,\" Rodgers said.\n\nThe Packers' four-time MVP quarterback later said \"it's more of an intuitive feeling\" that someone knows when it's time to \"sit with the medicine again.\"\n\n\"Once you sat with the medicine one time you kind of know what that feeling is that more lessons to be learned. ... Some people sit 100 straight days and still feel called years and years down the road to keep on doing it.

Each was appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., after McCarthy retracted his choices.\n\nWho is on the Jan. 6 committee? And what experiences do they bring to the table?\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson\n\nHow he got here: Rep. Bennie Thompson, a 74-year-old Democrat from Mississippi, is the committee chairman.\n\nThompson called Jan. 6 a “horrible day” and one that is “still almost surreal that it even occurred.”\n\nWhat to know: “We have to get it right,” Thompson, the only Democrat in the Mississippi delegation, said in 2021.\n\nMore:Jan. 6 committee awaits Trump records: a breakdown of the notes, call and visitor logs already released\n\nPelosi appointed Thompson as chairman after he worked with Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., on legislation to create an independent, bipartisan commission to investigation Jan. 6. That legislation died in the Senate last year.\n\nThompson sued Trump after the Capitol riot, accusing the former president of inciting the deadly assault and conspiring with his lawyers and extremist groups to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nThe lawsuit named Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and other groups, including the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, as defendants.\n\nThompson, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, also called on fellow lawmakers to remove anything bearing the Confederate flag emblem from the House.\n\n“Continuing to display a symbol of hatred, oppression, and insurrection that nearly tore our union apart and that is known to offend many groups throughout the country would irreparably damage the reputation of this august institution and offend the very dignity of the House of Representatives,” Thompson said on the House floor in June 2021.\n\nQuotable: \"Obviously, there is not a second in the day that the president of the United States is not on record somewhere,\" Thompson said in March of missing White House call logs from Jan. 6, 2021. \"Having a record of what the president was doing on that day is absolutely vital to the work of the committee.\"\n\nRep. Liz Cheney\n\nHow she got here: Rep. Liz Cheney, 55, of Wyoming is the vice chair of the panel and one of the two Republicans on the select committee. Cheney was originally the only Republican Pelosi appointed when she named her picks to sit on the panel.\n\nMore:McCarthy said he would urge Trump to resign after Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to new audio\n\nMore:Jan. 6 committee wants to talk to Loudermilk about Capitol tour given the day before attack\n\nWhat to know: The Wyoming representative and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney has been a fierce critic of the Republican party since the Jan. 6 attack, not only condemning Trump for his role in the attack but also voting to impeach him shortly after.\n\nCheney, who was the third highest ranking Republican in the House, was ousted from GOP leadership after continually lambasting the former president’s actions and the Republicans who remain loyal to him.\n\nShe faces a Trump-backed challenger, Harriet Hageman, in a GOP primary this August.\n\nQuotable: After the vote to remove Cheney from leadership, she vowed to “do everything I can to ensure that the former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.”\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger\n\nHow he got here: Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, 44, of Illinois was a recent addition to the committee by Pelosi after McCarthy pulled his five appointees from sitting on the panel.\n\nMore:GOP censures Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, calls Jan. 6 riot 'legitimate political discourse'\n\nMore:Will McCarthy, Jordan talk to the Jan. 6 committee? Panel faces dilemma in coaxing defiant GOP\n\nWhat to know: Kinzinger, like Cheney, has been an outspoken and critical member of the GOP. He was one of the ten Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the insurrection on Jan. 6.\n\nPelosi said in a statement that Kinzinger “brings great patriotism to the committee’s mission: to find the facts and protect our democracy.”\n\nThe Illinois Republican has also condemned several members of his own party and was one of the 11 House Republicans who voted to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., from her committees due to her previous incendiary social media posts.\n\nKinzinger was also the first GOP member to call for the resignation of fellow Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz after reports implicated the Florida Republican in a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations.\n\nKinzinger will not seek reelection.\n\nQuotable: \"We have failed to understand or address the disease that led to that coup attempt,\" Kinzinger wrote in a January opinion piece. \"What happened last Jan. 6 was a vicious symptom of a cancer that’s been growing for far too long, one that has been fed by anger, fear and hopelessness.\"\n\nRep. Elaine Luria\n\nHow she got here: Virginia Rep. Elaine Luria, 46, is another Democrat Pelosi tapped to serve on the select committee.\n\nLuria, a retired Navy commander, pitched herself to Pelosi to serve on the committee, feeling personally motivated to be on the panel, according to the Washington Post.\n\nMore:The Jan. 6 committee got a boost from a ruling on a confidential memo. What's next?\n\nWhat to know: Shortly after the insurrection, Luria told USA TODAY that she noticed groups of eight to 15 apparent Trump supporters walking through Capitol office buildings and through the underground tunnels connecting surrounding office buildings in the days leading up to the riot.\n\nWhile on the Jan. 6 committee, Luria has criticized the Justice Department's delay in pressing criminal charges against those who have defied congressional subpoenas, such as former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino.\n\n“The Department of Justice must act swiftly,” she said at a March committee meeting. “Attorney General (Merrick) Garland, do your job so that we can do ours.”\n\nQuotable: “We cannot allow those who seek to destroy our country from within to prevail,” Luria said in a statement in January announcing her reelection bid on the anniversary of the attack. “We need representatives and leaders who will uphold and strengthen our laws and institutions, not side with those who try to tear them down.”\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin\n\nHow he got here: Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, 59, who garnered national attention when he served as lead House impeachment manager for Trump’s second impeachment, also serves on the committee.\n\nWhat to know: A constitutional law professor, Raskin drafted the article of impeachment against Trump after the Jan. 6 attack before leading the prosecution for House Democrats.\n\nHis son, Tommy, died less than a week before the impeachment hearings. Raskin told the Washington Post in December that his 25-year-old son's suicide – heartbreaking as it was – gave him a renewed sense of purpose to go after the perpetrators of the insurrection.\n\nRaskin has been vocal about the committee's mission to find evidence. Soon after former Trump aide Steve Bannon was held in contempt for defying a congressional subpoena, Raskin warned other non-cooperative Trump aides that \"nobody has the right to blow off the Congress of the United States.”\n\nQuotable: “I know that I have a responsibility to do whatever I can to preserve American democracy, which is fragile in a lot of ways. I feel that strongly, and I know Tommy felt that strongly and would feel that strongly,” Raskin told the Washington Post in December. “And so as I’ve gotten stronger and stronger, I know that this is a political and personal mission that I can never back down from, ever.”\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy\n\nHow she got here: Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, 43, is also among the members on the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nWhat to know: Murphy, who is not seeking reelection, is a centrist in the Democratic caucus who co-chairs the Blue Dog Coalition.\n\nIn March, Murphy told Jonathan Capehart of The Washington Post that the goal of the committee is, in part, to protect the integrity of free and fair elections.\n\n\"When we got to January 6th, the courts had already settled the cases. We cannot find ourselves in a situation where elected leaders find whatever loophole they can to try to hold on to power, because that makes us no better than any autocracy in this world,\" she said.\n\nMurphy also called some of the evidence discovered during the investigation \"shocking and deeply, deeply disturbing.\"\n\nQuotable: \"I have learned some shocking things, because we're looking at not just what happened on that day and of the people who are household names and their roles in this incident. We are also looking at the organizations and folks at the local and state level who had a role in trying to overturn a free and fair election.\"\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar\n\nHow he got here: Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., 42, said he was “honored to have been selected” to serve in a July statement. Aguilar also described Jan. 6 as “one of the darkest days in our country’s history.”\n\nWhat to know: The California congressman is the only Latino representative on the committee. Aguilar said he and other Latinos who may have experiences in countries fraught with political turmoil can understand the fragility of democracy.\n\n“Some of the campaigns and some of the political rhetoric in other countries really does sound shockingly familiar to the language that (Trump) used,” Aguilar said in January, according to NBC News.\n\n\"The attack on the Capitol and our democracy left five dead, more than 140 police officers injured, and members and staff traumatized. We owe them—and we owe the American people — a fair, thorough and evidence-based investigation into what happened that day so that we can ensure it never happens again,” Aguilar said in a recent statement.\n\nAguilar also said the committee's role is to inform the public of what happened in January 2021, according to the NBC report.\n\nQuotable: “If we put together a report that is fact-based, my belief is that the country will pay attention and people will hear the warnings signs for democracy that we are pointing to.”\n\nRep. Adam Schiff\n\nHow he got here: Similar to Raskin, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., 61, rose to prominence leading Trump's impeachment – in this case the first impeachment when the then-president tried to pressure Ukraine to go after a political rival.\n\nWhat to know: Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement last year that the Jan. 6 panel's duty is to “investigate the events leading up to and during the violent insurrection, and to determine how to best protect our fragile democracy moving forward.”\n\n“We will have a full accounting of that deadly day, and we will endeavor to do so with bipartisan sobriety,” Schiff added.\n\nQuotable: “I'd like to think, as (poet) Amanda Gorman so eloquently said, that we're not broken, we're just unfinished. Because if we're no longer committed to a peaceful transfer of power after our elections, if our side doesn't win, then God help us,” Schiff said during a July 2021 committee hearing.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren\n\nHow she got here: Along with both committee members Schiff and Raskin, California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren ,74, was also involved in prosecuting one of Donald Trump's impeachment trials.\n\nWhat to know: The House Administration Committee, which Lofgren chairs, has held hearings focused on the reaction to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nLofgren shared that she was “honored” to be asked to serve on the committee, saying in a statement that she will serve with a “profound commitment to our constitution and to finding the truth.”\n\nQuotable: \"Well, we haven't heard all of it yet, but I will say it's - there was chilling calculation in how to install as president someone who lost the election,\" Lofgren told NPR in January about the evidence the committee had reviewed. \"That's a grave threat to our system of government, which, after all, is founded on the American people selecting their own government. It's a very stunning and sobering picture that has emerged.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/09/january-6-committee-hearing-live-updates/7529743001/", "title": "January 6 hearing recap: Panel presents Capitol attack evidence", "text": "Rep.

It was carnage.” She also recalled seeing Officer Brian Sicknick, who died the next day, turn ghostly white after being sprayed with chemicals.\n\n• Rep.

Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. said, which he called \"the culmination of an attempted coup.\"\n\nTrump rebuked Jan. 6 panel as biased after first hearing\n\nFormer President Donald Trump derided the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack as biased in a statement posted to Truth Social shortly after the panel's first hearing concluded.\n\n\"So the Unselect Committee of political HACKS refuses to play any of the many positive witnesses and statements, refuses to talk of the Election Fraud and irregularities that took place on a massive scale, and decided to use a documentary maker from Fake News ABC to spin only negative footage,\" he wrote. \"Our Country is in such trouble!\"\n\nThe former president's claims of election fraud are unfounded.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nFact check:Joe Biden legally won presidential election, despite persistent contrary claims\n\nWhen is the next Jan. 6 committee hearing?\n\nThe next hearing of the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol will be Monday at 10 a.m.\n\nTwo more have been announced as well: Wednesday, also at 10 a.m and next Thursday (June 16) at 1 p.m.\n\nSeveral more hearings are expected to be announced in the coming days.Thursday's hearing was the first in a series of public hearings over the next few weeks.\n\nWho's watching?:Jan. 6 committee's long-awaited hearings promise revelations.

The America I grew up in, I thought we were more united about good and bad, right and wrong.\"\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nNew evidence: Donald Trump didn't mind the idea of hanging Mike Pence\n\nOne new revelation that surfaced in this hearing: Direct quotes from Donald Trump expressing approval of threats by supporters to hang Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nIn previewing future testimony, committee member Liz Cheney said: \"You will hear that President Trump was yelling and, quote, 'really angry at advisors who told him he needed to be doing something more' and aware of the rioters' chants to 'hang Mike Pence'.\"\n\nShe added: \"The President responded with this sentiment: 'Maybe our supporters have the right idea.' Mike Pence, quote, 'deserves it'.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported last month that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told colleagues that Trump \"had said something to the effect of, maybe Mr. Pence should be hanged.\"\n\nTrump was angry at Pence for his refusal to throw out the electoral votes that elected President Joe Biden; Pence said he lacked the legal authority to do such a thing.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nThe witnesses:Who were the witnesses at the Jan. 6 committee hearing? Here's who testified about the Capitol riot\n\n‘I was slipping in people’s blood,’ Capitol Police officer says\n\nA Capitol Police officer who was injured during the attack on Jan. 6, 2021 described what she saw as a “war scene” that caused her breath to catch into her throat as she saw what was going on.\n\n“It was something like I had seen out of the movies,” said Caroline Edwards. \"I couldn’t believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. They were bleeding. They were throwing up.”\n\n“I saw friends with blood all over their faces,” Edwards said. “I was slipping in people’s blood. I was catching people as they fell. It was carnage. It was chaos.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nGallery:Chilling images from the Capitol riot: Jan. 6 insurrection in photos\n\nFor one attendee, Jan. 6 committee is compelling, but little hopes of change\n\nAt a DC watch party, Zak Sabim from Virginia listened to the hearing \"because I think right is right and wrong is wrong.\" He said he found the committee's evidence compelling.\n\n\"You have to document it. If it's not appreciated now. Hopefully people in the future will appreciate it,\" he said.\n\nBut Sabim also said he sees America as too polarized now for the committee to achieve any outcomes. The Capitol attack has become like a \"soap opera\" for Sabim.\n\n\"I feel like there's been a couple seasons I missed out on,\" he said \"It seems like something if you're a Democratic voter, you probably know all the cast of characters.\"\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nThe hearings:Who will be Jan. 6 hearing's most avid viewer? Donald Trump, with a team ready to hit back.\n\nProud Boys membership tripled; then they organized for Jan. 6\n\nMembership in the \"western chauvinist\" group the Proud Boys nearly tripled after then-President Donald Trump told them in a debate to \"stand back and stand by,\" according to testimony.\n\nThen, when Trump urged Twitter followers to show up for a rally on Jan. 6, “Be there, will be wild!” Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio created a social media group to organize its members to show up on Jan. 6.\n\nThe group was called a “Ministry of Self Defense,” according to Department of Justice Documents shared in the hearing.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nWho are the Proud Boys? They joined the Wisconsin Proud Boys looking for brotherhood.

But Edwards, who suffered a concussion, said she returned to the police line where she served outside the House clashing with the mob over bicycle racks for more than a half-hour with Sicknick.\n\n“All of a sudden, I see movement to the left of me and I turned and it was Officer Sicknick with his head in this hands,” Edwards testified Thursday. “And he was ghostly pale, which I figured at that point that he had been sprayed and I was concerned.”\n\n“My cop alarm bells went off because if you get sprayed with pepper spray, you're going to turn red,” she added, holding up a sheet of paper. “He turned just about as pale as this sheet of paper.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nEdwards describes blacking out after rioters ripped down first barricade\n\nCapitol Police officer Caroline Edwards described her injuries during the Jan. 6 attacks after rioters ripped down the first barricade moments after she told her sergeant that “we're going to need a few more people down here.”\n\nEdwards said that after the first barricade came down, she and other officers started grappling over the bike racks “to make sure that we can get more people down and get our CPU units time to answer the call.” But she said that she felt a back rack come on top of her head, and her foot caught the stair behind where she was standing.\n\n“My chin hit the handrail and then — I at that point I blacked out — but my back of my head clipped the concrete stairs behind me,” Edwards said.\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nLeaders of Proud Boys and Oath Keepers met in a parking garage\n\nLeaders of the ‘western chauvanist’ Proud Boys and the extremist militia group Oath Keepers met in a parking garage the night before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nNick Quested, a documentary filmmaker, testified that he and his crew went to pick up Enrique Tarrio from jail before meeting with Stewart Rhodes.\n\nThe crew “drove down into the parking garage and filmed the scene of Mr. Tarrio and Mr. Rhodes and certain other individuals in that garage,” Quested said.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nCommittee airs film about Trump's inspiration to Proud Boys, other extremist groups\n\nThe committee produced video clips from a documentary about the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other white nationalist groups who participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol – and Trump's incitement of them.\n\nThe film replayed Trump's infamous 2020 presidential debate comment about the Proud Boys – \"stand back and stand by\" – and his tweet encouraging people to travel to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. Many violent offenders said they believed they were acting at Trump's behest.\n\n\"We have obtained substantial evidence showing that the president's December 19th tweet, calling his followers to D.C. on January 6th, energized individuals from the Proud Boys and other extremist groups,\" said committee chairman Bennie Thompson.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Nick Quested testified about his filming of the Proud Boys,\n\n- David Jackson\n\nProud Boys:Who are the Proud Boys? Far-right group has concerned experts for years\n\nHouse panel outlines hearing subjects\n\nRep.

And I think that that's what he felt.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nInvestigation remains ongoing, even as hearings begin\n\nMore information continues to pour into the committee investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol attack is continuing, even as public hearings are ongoing.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., told the public to expect additional information to be included in the final report disclosed to the public because the committee’s investigation remains ongoing.\n\nCheney also said that the Department of Justice has been working with cooperating witnesses and so far has only disclosed some of the information it has identified.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nAdviser Jason Miller: Donald Trump didn't believe evidence he had lost\n\nA Donald Trump political adviser whose videotaped testimony popped up at the Jan. 6 hearing said the committee did not broadcast his remarks in full.\n\nIn the hearing video, Miller testified that an aide told Trump he simply did not have the votes to win the 2020 election.\n\nOn Twitter, Miller said the video was cut off before his next remarks, which were about how Trump did not believe the analysis.\n\nHe provided a transcript:\n\n\"Q: Okay. And what was the President's reaction then when Matt said to him, 'hey, we've looked at the numbers, you're going to lose'? A: I think it's safe to say he disagreed with Matt's analysis.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHead Oath Keeper:Vegas parking valet, Yale law graduate, unhinged Oath Keepers leader: Who is Stewart Rhodes?\n\nFor some DC watch party attendees, the hearing is personal\n\nTwo attendees, Whitney Williams and Raleigh Lancaster, both DC natives, say the hearing is more personal to them since they were close by when protestors breached the Capitol.\n\n\"This isn't really a place where this happens,\" says Lancaster. \"I've just never seen anything like this before.\"\n\nWilliams is retired, and is barely involved in politics. But because the attack was at her doorstep, \"it's so important,\" for her. She says she never listens to congressional hearings but tonight's hearing is different.\n\n\"It'd be a sad day for America,\" says Lancaster, if nothing comes out of the hearing.\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nCheney to Republicans: ‘Your dishonor will remain’\n\nIn the final remarks of her opening statement, Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney condemned the members of her party who have chosen to look the other way on the events of Jan. 6 and the efforts that led to it.\n\n“Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible,” she said. “There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain.”\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nCommittee shows video detailing timeline of Capitol attack\n\nAfter opening remarks, the hearing turned to a video of the Jan. 6 attack, detailing minute-by-minute how the attack unfolded led by Trump’s speech outside the White House beforehand.\n\n“I hope Mike is going to do the right thing,” Trump is shown saying. ” I hope. Because if Mike does the right thing, we win the election.”\n\nThe video detailed involvement of the far-right organization Proud Boys.

Michael Flynn, attorney Sidney Powell, and advisor Rudy Giuliani, among others, to discuss “having the military seize voting machines and potentially rerun elections,” according to Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.\n\nThe meeting that ran late into the evening took place on Dec. 18, according to Cheney. The president met with the group alone before “White House lawyers and other staff discovered the group was there and rushed to intervene.”\n\nThe next day, Trump tweeted that there would be a big protest in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6th. “Be there, will be wild!” he told his followers.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nMore:What we don't know about Jan. 6: What Trump's family told the committee, whether attack was organized\n\nIvanka Trump accepted DOJ’s finding of no election fraud\n\nIvanka Trump, former President Donald Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, said she accepted the Justice Department’s finding of no fraud sufficient to overturn the 2020 – in contrast to her father.\n\nIvanka Trump said she trusted the finding because she respected then-Attorney General William Barr, who said he resigned in part rather than fight to overturn the election. Her conclusion contrasted to her father’s continued efforts to overturn election results.\n\n“It affected my perspective,” Ivanka Trump said. “I respect Attorney General Barr, so I accepted what he was saying.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nIvanka's take:House Jan. 6 panel shows Ivanka Trump opposing claims of 2020 election fraud, in contrast to former President Donald Trump\n\nCheney: Trump had 7-part plan to overturn the presidential election\n\nRep.

Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said testimony from a more than a half-dozen Trump aides that Thursday’s hearing will highlight will show that Trump ignored pleas from his staff to call off the riot because he supported it.\n\n\"In the hearings to come, President Trump believed his supporters at the Capitol, and I quote, “were doing what they should be doing,’ Cheney said. “This is what he told his staff as they pleaded with him to call off the mob.\"\n\nCheney said that evidence will also show Trump was angry at advisor who told him that he needed to be do something more even though he was aware of threats to hang Vice President Mike Pence\n\n\"The attack on our Capitol was not a spontaneous riot,” Cheney said, pointing to intelligence about the attack beforehand.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nBarr opposed Trump’s claims 2020 election was ‘stolen’\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr told the House panel investigating the Capitol attack he resigned in December 2020 from the Trump administration rather than challenge the election results.\n\nBarr, who has said publicly the Justice Department found no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, said he met with then-President Donald Trump on Nov. 23, Dec. 1 and Dec. 14 to make it clear he didn’t agree with putting out the election was stolen.\n\n“I told the president it was bull----,” Barr said in a videotaped deposition played at the hearing. “I didn’t want to be a part of it and that’s one of the reasons that went into me leaving when I did.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nPolice officers and widows of officers who died are in attendance\n\nU.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, D.C.

Bennie Thompson, will open Thursday’s hearing saying efforts to undermine the Constitution and thwart the will of the American people aren’t over, according to excerpts of his remarks.\n\nThompson, D-Miss., will say \"our democracy remains in danger\" and must be protected through the investigation of the Capitol attack. He said a series of hearings this month won’t just look backward at what happened Jan. 6, 2021, but also forward to protect the rule of law.\n\n“We can’t sweep what happened under the rug,” Thompson will say. “We must confront the truth with candor, resolve and determination.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWho's on the panel:Meet the members of the January 6 House select committee ahead of first public hearing Thursday\n\nOpen minds but no high expectations at a DC watch party\n\nAt a watch party in the Taft Memorial Carillon hosted by the non-profit progressive consumer group Public Citizen, a couple hundred of attendees are anxiously and excitedly waiting for the long awaited Jan. 6 hearing.\n\nGlenn Daigon, from North Bethesda MD, says he doesn't want to be too excited or disappointed with how the hearing turns out: \"I don't see this as a slam dunk either way.\"\n\nBut he would like to see at least some \"indictments and convictions.\" He says if there's no accountability for the Capitol attack, \"there's no point\" in the hearings.\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nWhat is Donald Trump doing during the hearing?\n\nDon't expect former President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence to testify –but Trump is expected to watch, according to people who have spoken with him in recent days.\n\nTrump, a prolific and mercurial watcher of television news during his four years in the White House wants to know what the special House committee, packed with political opponents, will bring out to show to the American people, particularly since he has no allies on the committee to tip him off ahead of time, said two people who have talked with him recently and spoke on condition of anonymity about private conversations.\n\nThe original panel would have included GOP allies of Trump but House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy removed all five of his choices after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of them.\n\n- Chelsey Cox\n\nTrump tuned in:Who will be Jan. 6 hearing's most avid viewer?

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, questioned the panel’s legitimacy and again asked its members to share the information amassed on him before he agrees to testify.\n\n“While some courts have recognized the Select Committee’s investigation as having a legitimate legislative purpose, it does not necessarily follow that the Select Committee’s subpoena to me is in furtherance of a legitimate legislative purpose,” Jordan writes in the letter, sent the day of the committee’s first public hearing.\n\nJordan is one of five GOP members subpoenaed by the select committee, alongside Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania; Andy Biggs of Arizona; Mo Brooks of Alabama; and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California. Jordan has until Saturday to comply with the subpoena.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nGet the latest politics news in your inbox:Sign up for our On Politics newsletter\n\nHouse GOP Leader McCarthy declines to address 2020 election legitimacy\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Thursday declined to say clearly whether President Joe Biden rightfully won the 2020 election.\n\n“We’ve asked this question a long time,” McCarthy said to reporters during a press conference. “Joe Biden is the president. I think you can look that there’s a lot of problems still with the election process.”\n\nMcCarthy, who said Thursday he has answered the questions many times before, has shifted his views since the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection attempt. He suggested days after the attack that Trump resign, but has refused to cooperate with a subpoena from the committee investigating that day.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nBiden calls Jan. 6 attack a ‘flagrant violation of the Constitution’ ahead of primetime hearing\n\nPresident Joe Biden called the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol “a clear, flagrant violation of the Constitution” Thursday, hours before a House committee investigating the insurrection holds its first public hearing.\n\n“A lot of Americans are going to see for the first time some of the details that occurred,” Biden said, giving unprompted remarks on the hearing at the beginning of a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Los Angeles at the Summit of Americas.\n\n“I think these guys broke the law and tried to turn around the results an of election.

I'm not going to make a judgment on that.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nMore:Menendez: Mexico's president tried to ‘blackmail’ Biden to invite ‘dictators’ to Americas summit\n\nBill Barr met with committee about Trump’s election fraud claims\n\nA week before the first public hearing of the House Jan. 6 committee, former attorney general Bill Barr met with the panel about Trump’s claims of election fraud during the 2020 presidential election. Trump’s claims are seen by some as a catalyst for the attack on the Capitol.\n\nBarr’s meeting focused on material in his book, \"One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General.\" Though he left the Trump administration weeks before the insurrection, Barr was still the nation’s top law enforcement officer during and after the presidential election.\n\nAfter a Justice Department investigation into the fraud claims, Barr told the Associated Press in December 2020 that the agency hadn’t “seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”\n\n- Chelsey Cox\n\nFirst 2 witnesses are injured Capitol Police officer, documentarian\n\nTwo witnesses spoke at the first hearing. One was Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards, who suffered a traumatic brain injury when the mob pushed her to the ground after breaking through a fence of bicycle racks outside the Capitol.\n\nShe was the first of 140 officers injured that day, according to the committee. Other officers have recalled hearing her pleas for help.\n\nThe other witness was an acclaimed British documentarian, Nick Quested, who filmed around the Capitol during the attack. The day before the riot, Quested also filmed the leaders of two far-right groups – Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who are each charged with seditious conspiracy – meeting in a parking garage near the Capitol, according to the New York Times.\n\nMore:Who invaded the US Capitol on Jan. 6? Criminal cases shed light on offenses\n\nWhat Republicans are saying: Some blast committee as illegitimate, partisan\n\nHouse Republicans have blasted the committee as illegitimate, partisan and a sham because of how it was set up.\n\nThe heart of the complaint is that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., refused to seat GOP Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio on the panel. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., then pulled his nominees rather than have her vet them. Pelosi then appointed nine members – including GOP Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois – rather than the 13 authorized.\n\nFederal courts have upheld the panel’s authority repeatedly. But Republicans argue the one-sided appointments mean there will be no meaningful cross-examination of witnesses or alternate views presented during hearings.\n\nWhat we don't know about Jan. 6:What Trump's family told the committee, whether attack was organized\n\nBiden plans to watch hearings\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to watch some of Thursday’s hearing despite hosting the Summit of the Americas in California, according to White House chief of staff Ron Klain.\n\nBiden waived executive privilege to give the committee access to Trump administration documents as part of the investigation.\n\n“These are important hearings,” Klain told MSNBC's \"Deadline: White House\" on Wednesday. “He believes in executive privilege generally, but there is no executive privilege to overthrow the government of the United States. There is no executive privilege to protect plans on an insurrection.”\n\nWhat kind of evidence does the committee have?\n\nThe panel collected more than 100,000 documents and more than 1,000 witnesses cooperated in the inquiry. Pictures and thousands of hours of video from security cameras and body-worn cameras on police officers illustrate how the violent mob smashed its way into the Capitol.\n\n“People have gotten information in snippets over the course of a year plus, but the fact is that we’re going to tell the story in a coherent thread through the hearings,” said a committee member, Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va. “It was a tragic event for our country that there were villains that day, of course. But there were people who were heroic, who through their actions really prevented a much worse outcome.”\n\nMore:After Jan. 6, lawmakers want to clarify that vice presidents have ceremonial role in counting votes\n\nMore:What we don't know about Jan. 6: What Trump's family told the committee, whether attack was organized\n\nMore:Prosecutors charge former Proud Boys leader, 4 others with seditious conspiracy in Jan. 6 attack\n\nMore:Who has been subpoenaed so far by the Jan. 6 committee?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/cnn-poll-january-6-trump/index.html", "title": "CNN Poll: January 6 hearings haven't changed opinions much, but ...", "text": "(CNN) After the eight public hearings held by the House Select Committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, the American public's views on the state of democracy and the threat posed to it by that event have changed little, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nAt the same time, a public consensus has emerged that former President Donald Trump acted at least unethically in trying to hold on to his office after the 2020 election (79% feel he acted either unethically or illegally, including 45% who believe his actions were illegal), that he encouraged political violence in his public statements ahead of January 6 (61%) and that he could have done more to stop the attack once it had begun (77%).\n\nAll told, the poll finds that 69% of Americans consider the January 6 attack to be a crisis or major problem for American democracy. That's up slightly since earlier this year, when 65% said the same. More broadly, 54% say they see American democracy as under attack, about the same as the 52% who felt that way earlier this year.\n\nAlthough there was little movement on each of these questions, partisans appear to be moving in opposite directions. While Democrats are becoming more likely to say democracy is under attack (55% now, up from 46% earlier this year) and that the January 6 attack is a major problem or a crisis (96% now, up from 91%), Republicans are now less likely to feel that way than earlier this year, before the select committee's hearings. Just 36% of Republicans now say that January 6 was a crisis or major problem, down 7 points since February, and 54% feel American democracy is under attack, down from 66% earlier this year.\n\nRoughly 4 in 10 overall have been closely following news about the select committee's hearings (41%), with attention concentrated among Democrats (55% of Democrats are following at least somewhat closely, compared with 40% of independents and 28% of Republicans).\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Jennifer Agiesta", "Cnn Polling Director"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/politics/january-6-public-hearings-explainer/index.html", "title": "January 6 hearing: We're about to learn a lot more about the ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here\n\nWashington (CNN) More than 500 days removed from the violent attack on the US Capitol, the committee investigating it is ready to show its work.\n\nThe House select committee will hold its first public hearing this week, on June 9 at 8 p.m. ET. Sources told CNN this hearing will be a broad overview of the panel's 10-month investigation and set the stage for subsequent hearings, which are expected to cover certain topics or themes.\n\nWhile the setup of the hearings has been a work in progress and evolving, sources note, the presentations will likely feature video clips from January 6, as well as some of the roughly 1,000 interviews the committee has conducted behind closed doors.\n\nIn recent days, new information about the insurrection has also emerged. The New York Times reported Friday that former Pence chief of staff Marc Short warned Pence's lead Secret Service agent the day before the attack that there could be a threat to the then-vice president. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN that The New York Times' account of the conversation was accurate.\n\nIn the meantime, here's what we're expecting from the committee's hearings.\n\nWill there be new information?\n\nYes, at least according to an advisory from the committee released last week.\n\n\"The committee will present previously unseen material documenting January 6th, receive witness testimony, preview additional hearings, and provide the American people a summary of its findings about the coordinated, multi-step effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and prevent the transfer of power,\" the panel said.\n\nWhat can people expect?\n\nCommittee members have teased that the hearings could be focused on former President Donald Trump's direct role in undermining the election results.\n\nBroadly, the panel has been working toward a thesis that Trump's obsession with the election loss and his peddling of false claims about the results is what laid the groundwork for the violent and deadly riot at the Capitol.\n\nAhead of the hearing, Rep. Liz Cheney , one of just two Republicans on the committee, has asserted that the attack was part of an \"extremely well-organized\" conspiracy.\n\n\"It is extremely broad. It's extremely well organized. It's really chilling,\" Cheney told CBS \"Sunday Morning\" when asked if the attack amounted to a conspiracy, adding: \"I have not learned anything that has made me less concerned.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. David Cicilline told CNN Saturday that \"disturbing\" new evidence would be presented at the upcoming hearings, stressing the significance of this process.\n\n\"There will be, I think, substantial evidence that really demonstrates the coordination and the planning and the effort, despite the fact that they understood that Donald Trump lost the election and even once the insurrection began and the violence began, there were ongoing efforts to persuade the former President to stop the violence and call on folks to go home, and he refused to do it,\" Cicilline told CNN\n\nThe lawmaker added: \"I think the American people are going to learn facts about the planning and execution of this that will be very disturbing.\"\n\nFormer Virginia Rep. Denver Riggleman, who worked as a technical adviser for the House select committee, similarly said Sunday that people will be \"absolutely surprised\" by what will be presented.\n\nWhat witnesses might appear?\n\nCNN has learned that two people directly tied to former Vice President Mike Pence are among those who have received invitations to appear. Former Pence chief counsel Greg Jacob and former federal Judge J. Michael Luttig have received outreach from the committee about their possible testimony.\n\nIn addition to Luttig and Jacob, CNN has learned Short is expected to be called to testify.\n\nAll three men have already been interviewed privately by committee investigators. In some cases, their testimony has already been used by the committee as part of court filings and subpoena requests of other potential witnesses in their investigation.\n\nHow will the hearings compare to Trump's impeachment proceedings?\n\nOne source close to the committee told CNN that the panel has drawn on experiences from Trump's two impeachment proceedings. Those hearings have served as a model of both what to do and not to do.\n\nA key difference to typical committee proceedings is that the January 6 hearings will not feature the voices of prominent Trump supporters in Congress.\n\nThe panel's only two Republican members, Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, are both outspoken critics of Trump.\n\nHow is Trump preparing?\n\nThe former President has made it clear he is looking for cover from his closest allies around the upcoming public hearings.\n\nRead this report from CNN's Melanie Zanona, Zachary Cohen and Ryan Nobles. Trump's team has communicated to some of his most loyal acolytes on Capitol Hill that the former President wants people vigorously defending him and pushing back on the select committee while the public hearings play out, according to GOP sources familiar with the request.\n\nBut part of the challenge for Republicans — especially after they decided to boycott the select committee — is that they have little insight into what the investigation has uncovered and what might be revealed in the public hearings, making it harder for them to settle on a precise strategy.\n\nHow should Americans approach these hearings?\n\nWith as little emotion as possible, journalist Bob Woodward told CNN\n\n\"I think we need to say: 'This is what we know. This is what we don't know.'

If the Department of Justice looks at it, and assume that there's something that needs further review, I'm sure they'll do it,\" Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson said when asked whether the committee would refer Trump or others to the department.\n\nPressed again on whether the committee would ever make a formal referral to the Justice Department, the Mississippi Democrat said, \"No, that's not our job. Our job is to look at the facts and circumstances around January 6, what caused it and make recommendations after that.\"\n\nWhile Thompson drew the distinct line, his statement drew quick reactions from members of the committee, revealing the panel is split over how to handle a potential referral of the former President and his associates for prosecution. The committee this month is holding a series of hearings that are designed to show Trump was at the center of a conspiracy to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election results and the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nRep.

He has resisted talking further with the committee after previously sitting for a closed-door interview on April 13.\n\nThe committee said in its subpoena letter that it has obtained evidence that Cipollone is “uniquely positioned to testify” but he has “declined to cooperate” past that interview, leaving the panel with “no choice” but to issue the subpoena. During recent public hearings, members of the panel have publicly pressured Cipollone to testify. The committee is now taking the step to issue a subpoena in an effort to force his formal cooperation.\n\nMississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, the panel’s chairman, and Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the panel’s vice chair, said that “the Select Committee’s investigation has revealed evidence that Mr. Cipollone repeatedly raised legal and other concerns about President Trump’s activities on January 6th and in the days that preceded.”\n\n“While the Select Committee appreciates Mr. Cipollone’s earlier informal engagement with our investigation, the committee needs to hear from him on the record, as other former White House counsels have done in other congressional investigations,” the pair continued. “Any concerns Mr. Cipollone has about the institutional prerogatives of the office he previously held are clearly outweighed by the need for his testimony.”\n\nCipollone will probably agree to a transcribed interview with the January 6 committee – limited to specific topics to avoid the privilege issues, a lawyer familiar with his thinking told CNN. Whether any testimony would be taped or live would also need to be worked out.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who’s also a member of the committee, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on “AC360” on Wednesday that the panel is willing to work through privilege issues with Cipollone to facilitate his testimony.\n\n“I hope that he does comply,” she said. “We recognize that there could be some communication between him and the president that is legitimately privileged, and we’re willing to work through those.”\n\nLofgren said there are “quite a few things that he could tell the committee that would not be subject to privilege.”\n\nWitnesses who have testified before the panel have repeatedly mentioned Cipollone as someone who can shed light on key events inside the Trump White House leading up to, on and after January 6, 2021.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:48 - Source: CNN Hear John Dean's direct message to ex-Trump White House lawyer\n\nNot long after the rioters broke into the US Capitol, Cipollone rushed into then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’ office demanding a meeting with Trump, Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson told the January 6 committee this week.\n\n“I remember Pat saying to him something to the effect of, ‘the rioters have gotten to the Capitol. We need to go down and see the President now,’” Hutchinson said in a videotaped interview.\n\n“And Mark looked up at him and said, ‘He doesn’t want to do anything, Pat,’” she said.\n\nCipollone, Hutchinson added, emphasized to Meadows the need for action to control the situation to Meadows. She said Cipollone “very clearly said this to Mark – something to the effect of, ‘Mark, something needs to be done or people are going to die and the blood’s going to be on your f**king hands. This is getting out of control. I’m going down there.’”\n\nMeadows then handed his phones to Hutchinson and walked out of his office with Cipollone, Hutchinson told the committee.\n\nCheney tweeted Wednesday before the subpoena was announced that “as we heard yesterday, WH counsel Pat Cipollone had significant concerns re. Trump’s Jan 6 activities. It’s time for Mr. Cipollone to testify on the record. Any concerns he has about the institutional interests of his prior office are outweighed by the need for his testimony.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Ryan Nobles Annie Grayer", "Zachary Cohen", "Ryan Nobles", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/12/jan-6-live-updates-trump-capitol/10028871002/", "title": "Jan. 6 hearing focuses on extremist groups, Trump's role: Day 7 recap", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Jan. 6 committee investigating the Capitol attack focused its seventh hearing Tuesday on how former President Donald Trump summoned protesters to Washington and directed a mob he allegedly knew was armed to the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHere's what happened at Tuesday's hearing:\n\nGOP lawmakers met with Trump about overturning election: Several Republican members of Congress met Dec. 21 with Trump and top advisers to discuss what role Vice President Mike Pence could play in overturning election results.

What was covered? Committee members connected the dots from a Dec. 18, 2020, meeting in the Oval Office to events on Jan. 5 and 6, 2021. Live and recorded testimony showed how the December meeting among Trump, attorney Sidney Powell, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and other members of the former president's inner circle who helped him promote unsubstantiated election conspiracies, resulted in plans to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's victory.\n\nWho testified? Witnesses were Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesperson for the Oath Keepers, and Stephen Ayres, an Ohio man criminally charged for his actions during the Capitol riot.\n\nWitnesses were Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesperson for the Oath Keepers, and Stephen Ayres, an Ohio man criminally charged for his actions during the Capitol riot. What is already known? Trump invited protesters to Washington for a rally near the White House against election fraud. Trump was notified the morning of Jan. 6 that members of the crowd were carrying rifles and pistols, and he directed the crowd to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol. The Justice Department charged nearly 800 people after the siege at the Capitol, including seditious conspiracy charges against at least 11 members of the Oath Keepers and five members of the Proud Boys.\n\nTrump allies discussed Executive Order 13848 as they sought to overturn election. What is it?\n\nEvidence presented Tuesday by the Jan. 6 committee revealed that former President Donald Trump’s lawyers and allies suggested invoking an executive order for foreign interference in American elections, despite no evidence of such interference.\n\n“He was very interested in hearing particularly about the CISA findings and the terms of 13848 that apparently nobody else had bothered to inform him of,” Powell said in a deposition.\n\nPowell was referring to Executive Order 13848, which would grant the president emergency powers in the event of foreign interference in American elections.\n\nThat executive order was cited in a different draft executive order, pushed for by Trump’s outside advisers like lawyer Sidney Powell and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. It was never implemented, but would have commanded the secretary of defense to seize all voting machines. Powell would have been appointed special counsel to investigate election fraud under the draft executive order.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nCommittee schedules next Jan. 6 hearing for July 21\n\nThe select committee investigating the violent Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, has set its eighth hearing.\n\nIt will begin at 8 p.m. Thursday, July 21 and will focus on how Trump spent the 187 minutes between the end of his “Stop the Steal” rally and the three hours of Capitol violence before he issued a tweet urging his supporters to go home.\n\nCommittee members said additional testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone will also be shared during the next hearing.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nThompson, Raskin put Jan. 6 in historical perspective\n\nMembers of the House Jan. 6 committee closed their seventh hearing on Tuesday by framing President Donald Trump’s actions as unprecedented in American history.\n\n“The Watergate break in was like a Cub Scout meeting compared to this assault on our people and our institutions,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the committee’s chairman, said government has held strong through centuries of turmoil.\n\n“I am from a part of the country where had it not been for the federal government and the constitution, my parents and many more Americans like them would have continued to be treated as second-class citizens,” said Thompson, D-Miss.” The freedom to be able to vote without harassment, travel in relative safety and dine and sleep where you choose is because we have a government that looks over the wellbeing of its citizens.”\n\nThompson said the Jan. 6 attack was another test of the strength of the federal government, and he blamed Trump for sending the mob rather than stopping it.\n\n“It was an attack on our democracy, on our constitution,” Thompson said. “A sitting president with a violent mob trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power from one president to another – It still makes my blood boil to think about that.”\n\nStill to come: Committee to walk through Jan. 6 ‘minute by minute'\n\nAt the next hearing of the Jan. 6 committee, members plan to walk through the events of Jan 6, 2021, “minute by minute,” Rep.

He also said he would not have stayed at the Capitol as long as he did had the former president told his supporters to leave earlier.\n\nAyres said he thought the election was going to be overturned on Jan 6.

Bailey\n\nOath Keepers are ‘dangerous militia,’ group’s former spokesperson says\n\nIn testimony before the Jan. 6 committee Tuesday, former Oath Keepers spokesperson Jason Van Tatenhove described the group as a “dangerous” and “violent” militia.\n\n“I think the best illustration for what the Oath Keepers are happened January 6, when we saw that stack military formation going up the stairs of our Capitol,” he said.\n\nVan Tatenhove said that the Oath Keepers is largely driven by the ego of its founder and leader Stewart Rhodes, a Yale law school graduate who will stand trial in September for seditious conspiracy in relation to his involvement with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nWho is Stewart Rhodes:Vegas parking valet, Yale law graduate, unhinged Oath Keepers leader\n\nBrad Parscale connects Trump rhetoric to rioter’s death on Jan. 6\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in text messages after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot that he felt guilty for his role in getting Trump elected and that it was Trump’s rhetoric that led to death of a rioter that day.\n\n“A sitting president asking for civil war,” Parscale said in text messages to former White House press secretary Katrina Pierson revealed Tuesday by the committee investigating the attack. “This week I feel guilty for helping him win.”\n\nParscale said in another message: “Yeah. If I was Trump and knew my rhetoric killed someone.\"\n\nPierson tried to comfort Parscale in the exchange, saying “it wasn’t the rhetoric” that led to a woman dying at the Capitol.\n\n“Yes it was,” Parscale said.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nTrump incited supporters against Pence\n\nAccording to evidence, former President Donald Trump revised his planned speech to protesters at his Jan. 6 rally at the Ellipse to include references to former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAn email showed Trump instructed a speech writer to “REINSERT THE MIKE PENCE LINES. Confirm Receipt.”\n\nThe message was sent after Trump called Pence a “wimp” for refusing to comply with a scheme to alter the results of the 2020 presidential election by tampering with Electoral College electors. The Jan. 6 committee has outlined the plan, invented by former Trump lawyer John Eastman, over a series of hearings.\n\nProtesters sought out Pence as they ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to evidence.\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nGOP lawmakers met with Trump about overturning election results\n\nSeveral Republican members of Congress met with former President Donald Trump, adviser Rudy Giuliani and chief of staff Mark Meadows in the Oval Office to discuss what role Vice President Mike Pence could play in overturning election results.\n\nAccording to White House visitor logs, members in attendance included: Brian Babin, R-Texas; Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Louie Gohmert, R-Texas; Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.; Andy Harris, R-Md.; Jody Hice, R-Ga.; Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; and Scott Perry, R-Pa.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who at the time had been elected to Congress from Georgia but not sworn in, was also in attendance.\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla. and committee member, said in the hearing that several of the representatives in attendance later requested pardons.\n\n– Katherine Swartz\n\nRepublican congresswoman feared for safety from Trump supporters\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., told other members of Congress on Jan. 5, 2021, that she was concerned about members’ safety surrounding the next day’s vote to certify the election.\n\n“I’m actually very concerned about this because we have who knows how many hundreds of thousands of people coming here,” Lesko said. She said without evidence the leftist group Antifa would be there before raising concerns about Trump supporters.\n\n“We also have quite honestly, Trump supporters who actually believe that we are going to overturn the election, and when that doesn’t happen — most likely doesn’t happen — they are going to go nuts,” Lesko said.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nCipollone: Mike Pence should get Medal of Freedom\n\nFormer White House counsel Pat Cipollone said that former Vice President Mike Pence had no legal power to do anything related to the certification of the 2020 election except for what he did.\n\nCipollone told the committee that he suggested Pence should be awarded \"the presidential Medal of Freedom for his actions.\"\n\n– Merdie Nzanga\n\nKylie Kremer, rally organizer, knew Trump would order march to Capitol\n\nThe House select committee revealed never-before-seen text messages on Tuesday showing those who were behind the rally ahead of the Jan. 6 riot knew that President Donald Trump would call for a march to the Capitol.\n\nIn a series of messages obtained by the panel, Kylie Kremer, the organizer of the \"Stop the Steal\" rally, was speaking to Mike Lindell, CEO of MyPillow and a Trump confidante.\n\nOn Kylie Kremer:This mother-daughter duo planned the Jan. 6 rally. Now the House committee wants to hear from them, too.\n\nTwo days before the riot, Kremer said in the text messages how Trump is “going to have us march there,” meaning the Capitol. He then told Lindell to keep that information to himself because the president, during his rally speech, would \"unexpectedly\" instruct his supporters to go to the Capitol.\n\n“The evidence confirms that this was not a spontaneous call to action, but rather was a deliberate strategy decided upon in advance by the president ,” Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a member of the committee, said.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nBannon, on Jan. 5: ‘All hell is going to break loose tomorrow’\n\nOn Jan. 5, Trump and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon spoke twice. After their initial call, Bannon said on his podcast, “All hell is going to break loose tomorrow.”\n\n“It’s all converging and now we’re on, as they say, the point of attack,” Bannon said. “Right, the point of attack tomorrow. I’ll tell you this. It’s not gonna happen like you think it’s gonna happen. It’s gonna be quite extraordinarily different. And all I can say is strap in.”\n\nThe committee revealed Trump and Bannon briefly spoke over the phone again for six minutes and the contents of the phone call are unknown.\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\nEx-Trump press secretary Katrina Pierson messaged Meadows with Jan. 6 concerns about Jan. 6\n\nKatrina Pierson, a former Trump spokesperson, told the Jan. 6 committee that she directly raised concerns with former chief of staff Mark Meadows about some of the speakers scheduled to talk at the former president’s rally on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nPierson primarily raised concerns over far-right conspiracy theorists Alex Jones and Ali Alexander because of their inflammatory rhetoric.\n\n“I probably mentioned to him that they had already caused trouble in other capitals, or at previous events,” she said.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nOath Keepers formed alliances\n\nThe committee presented evidence from white supremacist, pro-Trump and anti-government groups showing their intent to join forces in protesting the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nKelly Meggs, indicted leader of anti-government group the Oath Keepers, outlined the plan in a Dec. 19, 2020, Facebook post.\n\n“Well we are ready for the rioters, this week I organized an alliance between Oath Keepers, Florida 3%ers, and Proud Boys. We have decided to work together and shut this sh*t down,” read the post.\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nRaskin connects Flynn, Stone to Oath Keepers, Proud Boys\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said Tuesday that Michael Flynn and Roger Stone both had connections to the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, showing photos of Flynn with members and pointing to communications between Stone and group leaders.\n\nThe committee showed a photos of Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, with an indicted member of the Oath Keepers, Robert Minuta, and one of the group’s leaders, Stewart Rhodes.\n\nStone communicated with top group leaders via an encrypted group chat called “Friends of Stone,” Raskin said.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\n‘Nonaligned groups were aligning’ security expert says\n\nA former homeland security leader in Washington, D.C., told the committee that the department had received intelligence of violent groups on the far-right uniting and planning to come to the nation’s capital.\n\n“These nonaligned groups were aligning,” said Donnell Harvin, a professor at Georgetown Unviersity and the former chief of homeland security and intelligence for the government of the District of Columbia.\n\n“All the red flags went up at that point,” Harvin said, “knowing that you have armed militia collaborating with white supremacy groups, collaborating with conspiracy theorist groups online, all towards a common goal.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWho is Stephen Ayres?\n\nOne of two witnesses soon expected to testify before the Jan. 6 Committee is Stephen Ayres, one of many rioters who were arrested for illegally entering the Capitol on Jan. 6. He has also been charged with obstruction of justice for attempting to stop the certification of electors.\n\nIn an affidavit filed by the FBI related to his arrest, Ayres specifically referenced Trump’s Dec. 19 tweet saying there will be a “Big protest in D.C.” Ayres made several posts on Facebook leading up to Jan. 6 asking where Trump’s supporters will be. He also live-streamed the Capitol attack on Facebook at several points.\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\nTrump’s tweet organized extremists around a single day\n\nPrior to former President Donald Trump’s tweet on Dec. 19 calling his supporters to the Capitol on Jan. 6, there was no plan or single day that his supporters planned to come.\n\n“People talked about going to D.C. when the election was over … after it was announced he was going to be there on the 6th, then anything else was shut out and it was just going to be on the 6th,” Jody Williams, former owner of far right website TheDonald.win, said in video testimony.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin said Trump’s tweet created a “laserlike focus” on Jan. 6, mobilizing his followers over a singular date and plan that allowed for the mob mentality and widespread violence of the riot.\n\nAfter Trump’s tweet, posts on Twitter and far-right websites focused their violent rhetoric around the that date. Followers wrote about the tunnels beneath the Capitol complex, suggestions for targeting members of Congress, with followers saying they were “ready to die for their beliefs.”\n\n– Katherine Swartz\n\nEx-Twitter staffer: Trump stuck ‘a flag in DC on January 6th for his supporters to come and rally’\n\nA former Twitter employee who spoke to the Jan. 6 committee said Trump’s tweet on Dec. 19, “was essentially sticking a flag in DC on January 6th for his supporters to come and rally.”\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” tweeted Trump on Dec. 19. The Twitter employee said reactions to Trump’s tweet made it “very clear that individuals were ready, willing and able to take up arms.” Trump appeared as a leader of their cause, according to the Twitter employee.\n\nUsers responded to Trump’s tweet with “locked and loaded\" and “stand back, stand by.” The reactions to Trump’s tweet made the Twitter employee “absolutely” concerned that gatherings on Jan. 6 would turn violent.\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\nTwitter ‘relished’ being Trump’s favorite\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee spoke with a former employee of Twitter who worked on the platform’s moderation team throughout 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn a taped testimony, the anonymous person, whose voiced was changed to protect their identity, said Twitter had considered adopting stricter content rules as a result of the former president telling the Proud Boys to “stand back, and stand by” during one of the 2020 presidential debates.\n\n“My concern was that the former president for seemingly the first time was speaking directly to extremist organizations and giving them directives,” the employee said. “We had not seen that sort of direct communication before, and that concerned me.”\n\nTwitter did nothing in the months leading up to Jan. 6, however.\n\nThe employee said Twitter’s leaders “relished” being Trump’s favorite social media platform, and that any other user would have been permanently banned “a long time ago.”\n\nTrump was eventually banned on Jan. 8.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump supporters aimed for Jan. 6 protests after his tweeted invitation\n\nHours after former President Donald Trump tweeted his invitation for protests in Washington on Jan. 6, 2020, his supporters began organizing.\n\nA committee member, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said Women for America First had applied for a rally permit Jan. 22 and 23 – several days after President Joe Biden’s inauguration. But hours after Trump’s tweet Dec. 19, 2020, the group changed the permit to Jan. 6 for the rally where Trump spoke.\n\nAli Alexander, leader of the advocacy group Stop the Steal, registered the web site wildprotest.com, with comprehensive information about protest events in Washington with times, places, speakers and details about transportation, Raskin said.\n\n“Trump’s purpose was to mobilize a crowd,” Raskin said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nGiuliani, Herschmann traded insults\n\nMore provocative prerecorded testimony presented by the Jan. 6 committee showed different sides of the Trump faction siding with or against the former president’s election fraud claims.\n\nTrump’s former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell backed his fraud allegations, while White House counsel Pat Cipollone and adviser Eric Herschmann sought proof backing the claims.\n\nA meeting between Trump’s advisers grew heated as Giuliani accused Cipollone and Herschmann of not acting aggressively enough, even once calling them the P-word.\n\n“Excuse the expression, but that's almost certain the word was,” Giuliani said.\n\nHerschmann, who said he’d had it with Giuliani after Giuliani screamed insults at him, told the attorney “either come over of sit your effin’ ass back down.”\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nTrump tweet: ‘Be there - will be wild’\n\nUnwilling to admit that his efforts to win back the White House had failed, former President Donald Trump on Dec. 19, 2020 took to Twitter to mobilize his followers, said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\n\n“How do you mobilize a crowd in 2020?” Raskin asked. “With millions of followers on Twitter, President Trump knew exactly how to do it.”\n\nTrump sent out an “explosive invitation” to protest on Jan. 6, telling his supporters to “be there - will be wild” and repeating false claims of election fraud. His supporters responded “immediately,” Raskin said.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nDec. 18 meeting was marked by insults, verbal attacks\n\nThe Dec. 18 meeting in which Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn met to discuss overturning the election ended with the three Trump allies insulting people and verbally attacking the White House counsel, two former White House staffers said in videotaped testimony.\n\n“It was not a casual meeting,” said Derek Lyons, a former White House staff secretary. “At times there were people shouting at each other, hurling insults at each other. It wasn’t sort of people sitting around on the couch just chit-chatting.”\n\nPat Cipollone, former White House counsel, said, “I remember the three of them were really sort of forcefully attacking me verbally,\" and he, Lyons, and lawyer Eric Herschmann were asking \"one simple question, as a general matter, ‘Where is the evidence?’”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nGiuliani escorted out of White House after heated meeting\n\nRudy Giuliani had to be escorted out of the White House at the end of a heated meeting among former President Donald Trump, the team of attorneys pursuing baseless claims of election fraud and White House lawyers.\n\nFormer White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson captured the moment in a photograph the committee showed Tuesday. Rep. Jamie Raskin, R-Md., said the photo showed then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows escorting Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, off the grounds to “make sure he didn’t wander back into the mansion.”\n\n“The west wing is UNHINGED,” Hutchinson said in a text message that night, according to the committee.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nTrump advisers drafted order for Pentagon to seize voting machines\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s outside advisers, including lawyer Sidney Powell and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn drafted an executive order Dec. 16, 2020 – two days after the Electoral College voted to say Joe Biden won the election – to have the Defense Department seize voting machines.\n\nA committee member, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., quoted from the draft order: “Effective immediately, the Secretary of Defense shall seize, collect, retain and analyze all machines…”\n\nRaskin said the executive order, which wasn’t implemented, also called for Powell to be appointed special counsel to investigate election fraud.\n\nFormer Attorney General Bill Barr called the allegations voting machines were being manipulated “nonsense” and refused to seize voting machines.\n\n“I told him that it was crazy stuff and they were wasting their time on that and it was doing a grave disservice to the country,” Barr said in videotaped testimony.\n\nFormer White House counsel Pat Cipollone opposed Powell’s appointment.\n\n“I was vehemently opposed,” Cipollone said. “I didn’t think she should be appointed to anything.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFormer Overstock.com CEO among Trump’s confidantes\n\nAlong with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and attorney Sidney Powell, former White House counsel Pat Cipollone was shocked to find Patrick Byrne, the former CEO of Overstock.com, alone with Trump in the Oval Office.\n\n“I walked in, I looked at him and I said ‘Who are you?’ And he told me,” Cipollone testified. “I had never heard of who this guy was.”\n\nByrne, Flynn, Powell and others met alone with Trump for at least 10-15 minutes without White House staff’s knowledge.\n\n“I don’t think any of these people were providing the president with good advice, so I didn’t understand how they had gotten in,” Cipollone said.\n\n– Katherine Swartz\n\nRaskin describes heated White House meeting between outside and internal advisers\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described a heated meeting between Trump’s outside advisers and White House advisers. The meeting included Sidney Powell, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former CEO of overstock.com Patrick Bryne, all conspiracy theorists who have made false claims the election was stolen.\n\nThe group of outside advisers “were able to speak with the president by himself for some time,” according to Raskin. White House officials were apparently unaware this meeting was happening, and when they found out, a “heated and profane clash,” ensued between the two groups.\n\nThe clash included “personal insults, accusations of disloyalty to the president, and even challenges to physically fight,\" said Raskin.\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\nWhite House general counsel slams Sidney Powell\n\nOne of the jaw-dropping moments from Tuesday’s hearing was how Trump wanted to seize voting machines in the aftermath of losing the 2020 election.\n\nFormer White House lawyer Pat Cipollone explained in taped testimony how the president had an unplanned meeting with outside advisors, including Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, about the plan.\n\n\"It's a terrible idea for the country,\" he said. \"That's not how we do things in the United States.\"\n\nThe committee showed a draft of an executive order by Trump that would have empowered the secretary of defense to seize voting machines, and appoint a “special counsel” who could charge people with election crimes. Trump had considered Powell for the position of special counsel, according to the panel.\n\nMany will recall Powell as the face of the campaign’s efforts to overturn the election, including false claims that foreign governments had interfered in the 2020 contest.\n\n“I was vehemently opposed,” Cipollone said. “I didn’t think she should be appointed to anything.”\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHutchinson: John Ratcliffe feared Trump election challenges could 'spiral out of control'\n\nIn testimony to the Jan. 6 committee, former Mark Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson said that Trump’s director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told her he thought that the former president’s challenges to the election could “spiral out of control” and become potentially “dangerous.”\n\nRatcliffe, a Republican, also previously served as a Texas U.S. representative from 2015 to 2020.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nLife after the White House: Trump administration officials say Dec. 14 was key date\n\nMultiple White House officials told the House Jan. 6 committee that they believed the Trump administration's days were numbered after the Electoral College votes were cast on Dec. 14.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, senior adviser Ivanka Trump and deputy press secretary Judd Deere all said in recorded testimony that Dec. 14, 2020, was a key date in the conclusion of the Trump administration.\n\nTrump’s legal challenges of the 2020 election results all had failed, and the Electoral College had met to cast electoral votes that delivered Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nMcEnany said after Dec. 14 that she “began to plan for life after the administration.” Ivanka Trump agreed that Dec. 14 was an important day for the end of the administration, saying “I think it was my sentiment probably prior as well.”\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nRaskin: Meeting described as 'craziest meeting of Trump presidency'\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said during Tuesday's hearing that former President Donald Trump's advisers visited him on Dec. 18. The meeting was described as \"unhinged, not normal,\" and the \"craziest meeting\" of Trump's presidency.\n\nRaskin also said there has never been a time when a president asked a crowd to gather at the Capitol to fight the \"certification of electoral results.\"\n\n– Merdie Nzanga\n\nMeadows told Cipollone that Trump would make a ‘graceful exit’\n\nFormer White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the Jan. 6 committee in prerecorded testimony that Mark Meadows, former Trump chief of staff under the Trump administration, insisted Trump would participate in the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nMeadows was said to assure both Cipollone and former Attorney General Bill Barr that Trump would agree to a “graceful exit” by conceding the 2020 presidential election around Nov. 23, 2020.\n\n“I will say that that is a statement and a sentiment that I heard from Mark Meadows,” Cipollone said.\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nEugene Scalia told Trump to concede following legal defeats\n\nEugene Scalia, then-secretary of labor to Trump and son of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, advised former President Donald Trump to concede the election following a series of legal losses.\n\nIn videotaped testimony to the Jan. 6 Committee, Scalia said he spoke to Trump on Dec. 14 – the same day electors met in each state to certify Biden’s victory – and told him he “thought that it was time for him to acknowledge that President Biden had prevailed in the election.”\n\nSince legal processes in dozens of states had been shot down by judges and no evidence of widespread fraud had been found, Scalia told Trump it was time to accept he had lost the election.\n\nInstead, four days later, Trump called out to his supporters over Twitter to protest at the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n– Katherine Swartz\n\nPat Cipollone said he thought Trump should concede\n\nFormer White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said he though the process for deciding the 2020 election had ended by mid-December, just after the Electoral College met to cast formal votes for president.\n\n“Did I believe she should concede the election at a point in time?” Cipollone asked the Jan. 6 committee in a videotaped interview. “Yes I did.”\n\nHe pointed to comments from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Dec. 15, 2020, saying that the process had already played out, and added, “That would be in line with my thinking on these things.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\n‘Three rings of interwoven attack’ leading up to Jan. 6\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., outlined “three rings of interwoven attack,” that were a part of Trump's efforts to overturn the election which resulted in the Capitol being attacked.\n\nIn the inner ring, Raskin described Trump’s internal efforts of trying to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to reject certain electoral votes, effectively overturning the election and keeping Trump in office, which “would have been a fundamental and unprecedented breach of the Constitution,” said Raskin.\n\nIn the middle ring, Raskin said Trump put a target on Congress’ back, which encouraged far-right extremist groups “to coordinate a massive effort to storm, invade, and occupy the Capitol.”\n\nAnd the outer ring was the fruition of Trump’s efforts on the day of the Capitol attack, as “thousands of enraged Trump followers thoroughly convinced by the Big Lie,” converged upon the Capitol, said Raskin.\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\nMurphy: Trump tweet was a ‘call to action’\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., who is co-leading Tuesday’s hearing, outlined how Trump used social media as a bullhorn to summon his most radical supporters to help overthrown the 2020 election.\n\nThe former president, Murphy said, had “called for backup” in a Dec. 19 tweet in order to pressure Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress.\n\n“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted at the time. “Be there, will be wild!”\n\nMurphy said the message was more than just a “call to action” but also served as a “call to arms” for his loyal base to help Trump steal the election.\n\n“It’s clear the president intended the assembled crowd on Jan. 6 to serve his goal,” she said.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump not ‘an impressionable child,’ Cheney says\n\nThe vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, took direct aim at former President Donald Trump by arguing that his own White House advisers and Justice Department officials told him he lost the 2020 election and yet he willfully refused the accept that conclusion.\n\n“The strategy is to blame people his advisers called ‘the crazies’ for what Donald Trump did,” said Cheney, R-Wyo. “This, of course, is nonsense. President Trump is a 76-year-old man. He is not an impressionable child. Just like everyone else in our country, he is responsible for his own actions and his own choices.”\n\nCheney argued Trump had access to more detailed information than almost anyone else.\n\n“No rational or sane man in his position could disregard that information and reach the opposition conclusion,” Cheney said. “Donald Trump cannot escape responsibility by being willfully blind.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nCheney: Trump orbit changed approach to committee\n\nIn her opening remarks, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said that witnesses and lawyers in former President Donald Trump’s orbit have changed their approach to the Jan. 6 committee investigating the Capitol attack since it began its hearings.\n\nBefore the hearings began, the approach taken by Trump allies was to “deny and delay,” Cheney said. Now, Trump’s allies and former members of his administration agree the committee has turned up several truths.\n\n“Today, there appears to be a general recognition that the committee has established key facts, including that virtually everyone close to President Trump, his Justice Department officials, his White House advisors, his White House Counsel, his campaign, all told him the 2020 election was not stolen.”\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nCassidy Hutchinson on pardons:Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows sought pardons related to Jan. 6 attack, testimony reveals\n\nCheney: Cipollone testimony 'met our expectations'\n\nRep. Liz Cheney said during her opening statement on Tuesday that former White House lawyer Pat Cipollone’s testimony before the House Jan. 6 committee had “met our expectations.”\n\nThe committee had issued a subpoena for Cipollone to speak to the committee, and he appeared before the committee last week.\n\n“Mr. Cipollone’s testimony met our expectations,” said Cheney, the committee’s vice chair and its top Republican. “We will save for our next hearing President Trump’s behavior during the violence of Jan. 6.”\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nWho is Jason Van Tatenhove?\n\nTuesday's hearing will focus on whether Trump and his allies coordinated with violent extremist groups to incite a mob to breach the U.S. Capitol. One witness set to testify in today’s hearing is Jason Van Tatenhove, former national media director for the Oath Keepers, a violent alt-right extremist organization that was present at the Capitol attack.\n\nVan Tatenhove is expected to testify about how Stewart Rhodes, founder and leader of the Oath Keepers, started and kept the organization running through far-right conspiracy theories and propaganda. Van Tatenhove was a spokesperson for the Oath Keepers from 2014 to 2017, and he has since had no affiliation with the group.\n\nThe Department of Justice Department has charged several members of the Oath Keepers with seditious conspiracy and obstruction in connection with the Capitol attack and their attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election.\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\nWho are the Proud Boys? Who are the Oath Keepers?\n\nThe Proud Boys is an extremist group started in 2016 whose members describe themselves as promoting “Western chauvinism.” The group was founded by Miami native Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, who also served as the Florida state director for Latinos for Trump.\n\nFounded in 2009 by Elmer Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers is a paramilitary group that actively recruits law enforcement and military veterans. The group’s members have been involved in armed standoffs with the federal government and have shown up armed to public events saying they are security.\n\nThe Department of Justice has charged members of both groups, in separate cases, with seditious conspiracy, the most serious charges that have come out of the events of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nPat Cipollone testimony to be shared\n\nThe Tuesday hearing is the first since former White House lawyer Pat Cipollone testified Friday behind closed doors. Video recordings of his testimony will be shared during the Tuesday hearing, continuing a format the committee has used throughout the first six hearings.\n\nHe is considered a key witness because of his access and involvement with the former president, especially during Trump's final months in office. Cipollone testified for more than eight hours Friday.\n\n\"He was aware of every major move, I think, that Donald Trump was making to try to overthrow the 2020 election and essentially seize the presidency,\" committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\n- Candy Woodall and Bart Jansen\n\nThe attack, extremists, Trump:Jan. 6 hearing to focus on Trump mob. A breakdown of the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and the attack.\n\nMurphy and Raskin will lead today’s hearing\n\nReps. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., will lead today’s proceedings into the role former President Donald Trump had in summoning far right extremist groups the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn social media posts ahead of the hearing, both Raskin and Murphy emphasized former Trump’s tweet on Dec. 19 as a key moment in mobilizing the extremist groups.\n\n“When he sent this tweet, Trump became the first president in American history to call for a protest against the peaceful transfer of power,” Raskin said on Twitter.\n\nMurphy said on Twitter that Trump’s tweet “activated domestic extremist groups” and that some members of Congress “amplified that message, all leading to the attack on January 6th.”\n\n– Katherine Swartz\n\nSteve Bannon offers to testify, but contempt trial won't be delayed\n\nThe hearing comes a day after Trump ally Steve Bannon asked a federal court to delay his contempt trial for defying a committee subpoena.\n\nBannon offered to testify, after refusing since the subpoena was issued in September.

After a dispute with his security detail, he never went.\n\n\"You'll never take back our country with weakness,\" Trump told the crowd. \"You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\"\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nWhat Trump did on Jan. 6:On Jan. 6, Trump was out of public view as aides urged him to act. A breakdown of those 187 minutes.\n\nCapitol Police were bracing for extremist groups\n\nCapitol Police released a special assessment Jan. 3, 2021, anticipating members of the Proud Boys and other groups were expected and would target Congress, according to the Jan. 6 committee's vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.\n\n\"President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\" Cheney said at the June 9 hearing. \"The attack on our Capitol was not a spontaneous riot.\"\n\nA White House aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, testified June 28 that she kept hearing about Oath Keepers and Proud Boys while planning for the Jan. 6 rally when Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was around.\n\n\"Things might get real, real bad on January 6th,\" Hutchinson quoted former chief of staff Mark Meadows as telling her.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nWhat has the committee already covered?\n\nThroughout the first six public hearings, the Jan. 6 committee has sought to prove the former president oversaw and coordinated “a sophisticated seven-part plan to overturn the presidential election and prevent the transfer of power,” according to committee's vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.\n\nIt's an investigation that gained momentum in June, most notably with its star witness Cassidy Hutchinson. The former top White House aide testified June 28 and described how Trump knew some of his angry supporters were armed as he directed them to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe committee held six hearings in June.

Richard Shelby of Alabama, came to a bipartisan agreement after months of negotiations.\n\nThe money would go to the National Guard after it was deployed in Washington, D.C., for the Jan. 6. riot and to beef up Capitol security to prevent future attacks.\n\n“We have the responsibility to take care of the Capitol Police in the wake of their incredible service on Jan. 6, and to reimburse our National Guard for costs incurred protecting the Capitol. We have the responsibility to pay for costs we have already incurred as a result of the pandemic.

Nearly $71 million of that is in response to the Jan. 6 attack and would support paying for overtime, hiring more officers, offering hazard pay, and giving out retention bonuses. More than $31 million would go to backfill overtime.\n\nThe department was not only understaffed on Jan. 6, but later investigations showed the department also was ill-prepared with tactical gear.

The agreement would provide roughly $521 million to reimburse the National Guard.\n\nThe Architect of the Capitol would receive $300 million to upgrade the complex, including windows, doors, new security cameras and more.\n\nIt also would provide $1 billion for Afghan refugee assistance and 8,000 new Afghan Special Immigrant Visas. In June, the Biden administration agreed to relocate thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military as interpreters and translators while their visa applications are vetted.\n\nThat money would be split among federal agencies to, among other assistance, provide housing, transportation and other services for Afghan refugees.\n\nMore:Biden administration will relocate thousands of Afghan interpreters who worked with US military\n\nIf the Senate passes the bill, it will head to the House for final approval.

All of which Eastman replied “fifth.”\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nDOJ renews call for Jan. 6 committee transcripts\n\nThe Justice Department has renewed its request for witness transcripts amassed by the special House committee investigating the Capitol attack, saying that the information is “not just potentially relevant to our overall criminal investigations but are likely relevant to specific prosecutions that have already commenced.”\n\nThe request, made public in Thursday court filings related to the government’s prosecution of members of the Proud Boys extremist group who stormed the Capitol, echoed an earlier call for witness testimony that has been so far rebuffed by the panel.\n\n“As you are aware, grand jury investigations are not public and thus the Special Committee does not and will not know the identity of all the witnesses who have information relevant to the Department’s ongoing criminal investigations,” the June 15 Justice letter stated.\n\nThe letter was signed by Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., overseeing the sprawling Jan. 6 criminal inquiry, along with the chiefs of Justice’s National Security and Criminal divisions.\n\n“Moreover, it is critical that the Department be able to evaluate the credibility of witnesses who have provided statements to multiple government entities in assessing the strength of any criminal prosecution and to ensure that all relevant evidence is considered during the criminal investigation.\n\n“The Select Committee’s failure to grant the Department access to these transcripts complicates the Department’s ability to investigate and prosecute those who engaged in criminal conduct in relation to the January 6 attack on the Capitol,” the Justice letter stated.\n\n- Kevin Johnson\n\nLuttig: Trump a ‘clear and present danger’ to democracy\n\nRetired judge Michael Luttig warned the House committee Thursday former President Donald Trump continues to threaten American democracy not because of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, but because he and his allies plan to challenge the 2024 results if they lost that election.\n\nLuttig said Trump and his allies are executing their blueprint for 2024 in plain sight of the American people.\n\n“Today, almost two years after that fateful day in January 2021, still Donald Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy,” Luttig said. “I don’t speak those words lightly. I would have never spoken those words ever in my life, except that that’s what the former president and his allies are telling us.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nPence started his day in prayer, ended with Bible verse\n\nJacob said his Christian faith sustained him through the day, and as he waited in a secure location amidst the violence, he read through Daniel 6, about a man of God who refuses orders from a Pagan king he cannot follow and does his duties consistent with his oath to God, saying he “felt that’s what had played out that day.”\n\nShort also texted Pence the Bible verse 2 Timothy 4:7 at 3:50 a.m. after the two departed the Capitol: “I fought the good fight, I’ve finished the race, I’ve kept the faith.”\n\n- Katherine Swartz\n\nShort: House GOP Leader McCarthy worried Trump didn’t take riot seriously\n\nAfter Vice President Mike Pence evacuated the Senate as a mob ransacked the Capitol, his chief of staff, Marc Short, contacted senior government officials such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\n\n“He indicated that he had had some conversation” with Trump or someone else at the White House, Short said of McCarthy. “He’d expressed frustration at not taking the circumstances as seriously as they should at that moment.”\n\nWhile in seclusion, Pence called Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller about his safety and to address the situation, according to a committee member, Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif. Aguilar asked a Pence staffer whether Trump ever called to ask about Pence’s safety.\n\n“He did not,” said Greg Jacob, Pence’s counsel. Pence and his wife reacted to the lack of contact “with frustration,” Jacob said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nMembers of Congress, former Pence staffer among those watching in hearing room\n\nDemocratic Reps. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, and Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas are among the members of Congress watching the hearing in the Cannon Caucus room today.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges, U.S. Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, and D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone also watched from the row of seats behind the witnesses. Sandra Garza, the longtime partner of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick – who suffered two strokes and died after Jan. 6 – also sat with the officers.\n\nPence’s former Homeland Security Advisor Olivia Troye sat besides Gonnell. House Chaplain Margaret Kibben watched from the back of the room, seated beside the lawmakers in attendance.\n\n– Dylan Wells\n\nAide: Pence didn't want people seeing him 'fleeing' from the Capitol\n\nVice President Pence had a simple reason for refusingto leave the U.S. Capitol after rioters broke into the building looking for him.\n\nPence \"did not want to take any chance that the world would see the vice president of the United States fleeing the United States Capitol,\" attorney Greg Jacob said.\n\nInstead, Pence waited out the insurrection at a secure location within the U.S. Capitol.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nTrump didn’t call Pence to check on his safety\n\nWhile in a secure location within the Capitol complex, Pence made several different calls to others to check on their safety. But Rep. Pete Aguilar questioned Greg Jacob if Trump called Pence to make sure he was safe.\n\n“He did not,” replied Jacob.\n\nJacob said Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence were frustrated they never received a call.\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nMob was 40 feet away from Pence’s hiding spot\n\nAs Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., told a witness that Vice President Pence was only 40 feet away from the mob while in hiding, Pence’s former homeland security advisor, Olivia Troye, sat in the background and shook her head.\n\n“Mr. Jacob, you were there,” Aguilar said to witness Greg Jacob, Pence’s general counsel. “Does it surprise you to see how close the mob was to the evacuation route that you took? Forty feet is the distance from me to you roughly.”\n\n“I could hear the din of the rioters in the building while we moved, but I don’t think I was aware that they were as close as that,” Jacob replied.\n\n- Erin Mansfield, Dylan Wells\n\nProud Boys witness says the group would have killed Pence and Pelosi\n\nA recent court filing from the Department of Justice states that a confidential informant from the Proud Boys told the FBI that “the Proud Boys would have killed Mike Pence if given a chance.”\n\n“Anyone they got their hands on they would have killed, including Nancy Pelosi,” the Proud Boys member told the FBI.\n\n- Katherine Swartz\n\nTrump called Pence ‘wimp’ on Jan. 6\n\nWhite House officials said during a call the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, former President Donald Trump called Vice President Mike Pence a \"wimp\" and accused him of lacking the courage to make the right decision.\n\nTrump placed the call surrounded by family and aides in the Oval Office. “At some point it started off at a calmer tone and then became heated,” said Eric Herschmann, a White House lawyer.\n\n“The conversation was pretty heated,” said Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and senior adviser. “It was a different tone than I’d heard him take with the vice president before.”\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who served as Pence’s national security adviser, said Trump questioned Pence’s courage, “like you’re not tough enough to make the call.”\n\nNicholas Luna, who served as Trump’s personal assistant, said he remembered the word “wimp.”\n\n“I don’t remember if he said you are a wimp, you’ll be a wimp,” Luna said. “Wimp is the word I remember.”\n\nPence had gathered with aides at his residence for a prayer before he presided over counting Electoral College votes. Pence left the room for the call, but returned grim.\n\n“I would say he was steely, determined, grim,” said Greg Jacob, Pence’s counsel.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump’s tweet disparaging Pence was “like pouring gasoline on the fire.”\n\nSarah Matthews, former Deputy White House Press Secretary, told the Jan. 6 Committee that Trump’s tweet saying Pence “didn’t have the courage” to reject the electors was “like pouring gasoline on the fire.”\n\n“It was clear that it was escalating and escalating quickly,” said Matthews, describing the riot outside the Capitol as it started to ramp up. “So then went that tweet, that Mike Pence tweet, was sent out. I remember us saying that was the last thing that needed to be tweeted at the moment.”\n\n“The situation was already bad. And so it felt like he was pouring gasoline on the fire by tweeting that,” said Matthews. One minute after that tweet, rioters opened the East Rotunda door and breached the Capitol crypt.\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nTrump knew rioters breached Capitol before tweeting about Pence\n\nTwo staff members testified to the committee that Chief of Staff Marc Meadows went to the dining room off the Oval Office to tell Trump about violence on the Capitol.\n\nTrump then tweeted at 2:24 p.m. – once the Capitol had already been breached – that “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done” in his refusal to send electoral votes back to states to recertify.\n\n- Katherine Swartz\n\nJayapal: 'Thanks to Mike Pence ... and Congress'\n\n“Donald Trump was absolutely engaged in a conspiracy to overturn an election and it failed thanks to Mike Pence and thanks to Congress,” Washington Democrat Rep. Pramila Jayapal told USA TODAY of her top takeaway from today’s hearing thus far.\n\nJayapal was one of the members trapped in the gallery on Jan. 6 and is watching the hearing today in the Cannon Caucus room.\n\n“I’m just shaking my head that we have somebody in office who was saying to the Vice President, well, I'm not going to be your friend if you don't do something that's completely unconstitutional,” Jayapal said.\n\n- Dylan Wells\n\nPence aides had angry phone call over White House claims\n\nCommittee members heard evidence of how Pence and his aides objected when the White House put a false statement that the vice president agreed with Trump that he had the authority to throw out electoral votes.\n\nVice presidential chief of staff Marc Short called Trump communications aide Jason Miller to say Pence did not agree with Trump at all.\n\nBoth men told the committee that the phone call was tense.\n\nShort reportedly told Miller that the call broke protocol and questioned \"the process for putting out a statement for a meeting when only two people were in the room.\"\n\nMiller told Short that the statement came out the way Trump wanted it to.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nPence and aides prayed ahead of “challenging” day\n\nVice President Mike Pence and his aides started the morning of Jan. 6, 2021 with a prayer because it was going to be an important day.\n\n“We would’ve just asked for guidance and wisdom, knowing that the day was going to be a challenging one,” Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, told the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nShort said the prayer also included Greg Jacob, Pence’s general counsel, and Chris Hodgson, Pence’s legislative affairs director.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nLee: ‘I will never forget that shot.’\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, told reporters that the events of Jan. 6 replay in her mind when she attends the House committee hearings.\n\n“I see members in various states of shock and sheer fear. And I remember that shot. I will never forget that shot,” Lee said.\n\nThe committee has focused on the actions of former Vice President Mike Pence, who despite pressure from Trump and his allies, refused to reject a slate of electors while presiding over Electoral College votes. Lee called Pence’s decision “stoic.”\n\n\"I think he realized that he was now in the eye of a historic storm. He was either going to be honorable, or he was going to be dishonorable,” said Lee, who was Speaker Pro Tem in the after the insurrection. “I think he prides his faith and his integrity. I hope that’s what came out on (Jan. 6).\"\n\n- Chelsey Cox\n\nPence’s team “shocked and disappointed” by Trump claim he and veep were in agreement\n\nPence and Trump had a disagreement about Pence’s authority to reject election results in a private Oval Office meeting. When the New York Times reported on the meeting, Trump’s office released a statement denying the article, claiming that he and Pence “are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.”\n\nThis statement was “categorically untrue,” Jacob said, as Pence and his office had consistently rejected the idea he had authority to reject election results.\n\nJacob said Pence’s office had no prior knowledge of the statement and were “shocked and disappointed” by it.\n\n- Katherine Swartz\n\nPence’s Chief of Staff was concerned for Pence’s safety in the days before Jan. 6\n\nAs the rift between Trump and Pence grew due to their disagreements about Pence’s ability to overturn the election, Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, became concerned for Pence’s safety.\n\nShort was worried enough to consult the Secret Service.\n\n“The concern was for the Vice President’s security, and so I wanted to make sure the head of the Vice President’s secret service was aware that likely, as these disagreements became more public, that the President would lash out in some way,\" he said in a videotaped deposition the committee played Thursday.\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nPence aide warned election may be “decided in the streets”\n\nGreg Jacob, lawyer to Vice President Mike Pence, said he told Trump lawyer John Eastman that following his plan of action may have created an unwinnable standoff between Trump and Pence.\n\nJacob said if the issue went to the Supreme Court but the Supreme Court decided not to take it up, it would have left the country in a state of limbo, something he called a “constitutional jump ball.”\n\n“That situation may well have to be decided in the streets,” Jacob said he told Eastman. “Because if we can’t work it out politically, we’ve already seen how charged up people are about this election, and so it would be a disastrous situation to be in.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nJohn Eastman denies discussing election with Ginni Thomas\n\nLawyer John Eastman said in a social media post Thursday he never discussed the 2020 election with Ginni Thomas or her husband, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, but that she had asked for an update about election litigation.\n\nHis statement came after a report in the Washington Post that Eastman exchanged emails with Ginni Thomas. But Eastman said the report was based on selective leaks from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and created a “false impression.”\n\n“We have never engaged in such discussions, would not engage in such discussions, and did not do so in December 2020 or anytime else,” Eastman said in his post on Substack. “As you can see for yourselves, she invited me to give an update about election litigation to a group she met with periodically.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nEastman flipped whether Pence should reject electors on the eve of Jan. 6\n\nOn the eve of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, John Eastman flipped on whether Pence should carry out his debunked legal theory that the vice president could reject electoral votes submitted by states.\n\nJacob said Eastman, in a Jan. 4 meeting, recommended that Pence not execute the strategy, only to suddenly change his position one day later.\n\n“I'm here to request that you reject the electors in the disputed states,” Eastman said on Jan. 5, according to Jacob’s account.\n\nThe flip came as Trump ramped up his pressure campaign against Pence to reject the election results. In a tweet that same day, Trump falsely said that Pence has the theory to “reject fraudulently chosen electors.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCommittee: Trump 'dialed up' pressure on Pence as Jan. 6 approached\n\nAs part of its multi-media presentation, the committee played a series of videos demonstrating how Trump applied the screws to Vice President Pence as the counting of electoral votes approached.\n\nAt a politically rally on Jan. 4, 2021, Trump told screaming supporters he hoped Pence \"comes through for us\" and throws out electoral votes – a video the committee played twice.\n\nWhile calling Pence \"a great guy,\" Trump pointedly added that: \"Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him as much.\"\n\nAround the same time, aides like Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman made public statement in which they urged Pence to act, even though they knew the vice president lacked the legal authority over the casting of electoral votes.\n\nTwo days after Trump's rally, Pence again made clear he would not carry out the president's demands – and the attack on the U.S. Capitol took place.\n\nTrump \"dialed up the pressure as Jan. 6. approached,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., a committee member.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nPence “never budged” in position that he could not overturn the election\n\nWhen Pence was first introduced to Eastman’s theory that he could reject electors, his “first instinct was that there was no way any one person” could have that power, according to Pence’s former legal counsel, Greg Jacob.\n\nMarc Short, former Chief of Staff to Pence, told the Jan. 6 committee that Pence was “very consistent” in making clear he could not overturn the election to Trump.\n\nAsked if Pence ever wavered in his position, Jacob said, “The Vice President never budged from the position I had described as his first instinct, which was that it just made no sense from everything that he knew and had studied about our Constitution, that one kind of person would have that kind of authority.”\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nCongressman, witness point to Al Gore’s acceptance of his loss in 2000\n\nStakeholders pointed to how then-Vice President Al Gore presided over the electoral count in the 2000 presidential election he lost to George W. Bush without raising any questions or objections about the process.\n\n“He never suggested that he could simply declare himself the winner of the 2000 election when he presided over the counting of the electoral votes,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.\n\nGreg Jacob, Pence’s former counsel, said he explained to Trump lawyer John Eastman: “Back in 2000 you weren’t jumping up and saying that Al Gore had the authority to do this. You would not want Kamala Harris to be able to have that kind of authority in 2024, when I hope Republicans win the election.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nPaul Ryan: Pence doesn’t have 'any greater authority' over results\n\nFormer Pence Chief of Staff Marc Short testified that former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., spoke to both himself and Pence about the joint committee, and all were in agreement that the vice president has no greater authority over election results.\n\nShort also told the committee that Pence consulted with former GOP Vice President Dan Quayle, who agreed with Pence that the role in the joint session is purely ceremonial, not authoritative.\n\n- Katherine Swartz\n\nLuttig: Eastman’s scheme ‘constitutional mischief’\n\nRetired federal appeals judge Michael Luttig told the panel former President Donald Trump’s advisers got “wrapped around the axle” by lawyer John Eastman’s historical evidence about the vice president’s role in counting Electoral College votes.\n\nBut Greg Jacob, Pence’s counsel, said no vice president in 230 years of the country’s history acted as Eastman proposed. Luttig said he would have tried to prevent Thomas Jefferson, John Adams or Richard Nixon from following Eastman’s plan.\n\n“I would have laid my body across the road before I would have let the vice president overturn the 2020 election on the basis of that historical precedent,” Luttig said. “This is constitutional mischief.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nEastman didn’t believe his own debunked legal theory, committee says\n\nJohn Eastman, Trump’s attorney who pushed the false notion that Pence could decide the winner of the 2020 election, didn’t believe the theory would hold up in the Supreme Court, according to testimony from Pence legal counsel Greg Jacob.\n\nEastman acknowledged to Jacob before Jan. 6 that the nation’s high country would likely reject the theory by a 9-0 vote, Jacob recalled.\n\n“Dr. Eastman never really believed his own theory,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif, one of the House committee members.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nSean Hannity 'very worried' in the hours before insurrection\n\nThe committee is presenting reams of evidence that people very close to Trump were very dubious about the idea that Pence could simply award the election to him – and worried about the ramifications.\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity, for example, sent White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows a series of texts reflecting concerns that the White House legal team might resign over Trump's pressure on Pence.\n\n\"I'm very worried about the next 48 hours,\" Hannity texted on Jan. 5, 2021, a day before the insurrection.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nGiuliani privately admitted Pence couldn’t overturn election before speaking at Jan 6 rally\n\nIn a deposition, former Trump impeachment lawyer Eric Herschmann described a call between him and Rudy Giuliani on the morning of Jan. 6.\n\n“We had an intellectual discussion about Eastman’s - I don’t know if it’s Eastman’s theory per se but the VP’s role and he was asking me my view, analysis, and other practical implications of it.” said Herschmann. “And when we finished, he said like I believe you’re probably right.”\n\n“I think he thought, were it done, it was something he’d have to consider if he was sitting on the bench. But he’d probably come down on that and you know, couldn’t interpret it or sustain the argument long term.”\n\nHours later, Giuliani spoke at the ellipse to Jan. 6 protestors, telling them “Every single thing that has been outlined, as the plan for today, is perfectly legal.”\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nHerschmann: “You’re going to cause riots in the streets”\n\nTrump’s counsel John Eastman told White House counsel Eric Herschmann he saw ambiguities within the 12th Amendment that allowed Pence to stop the certification of votes, thus deciding who would be the next president.\n\n“Are you out of your f’ing mind?” Herschmann said to Eastman, saying voters wouldn’t tolerate this and it would cause riots in the streets.\n\nIn response, Eastman told Herschmann that there’s been a history of violence in the country to protect democracy and the republic, so it was necessary for Pence to not certify election results.\n\n- Katherine Swartz\n\nAdvisors said Pence did not have power Trump claimed\n\nAdvisors to President Donald Trump were aware that Vice President Pence did not have the power to overturn the results of the 2020 election, witnesses told the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nMarc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, said White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told him “a couple times” before Jan. 6, 2021 that Pence didn’t have the power. Short added, “Mark had told so many people so many different things that it was not necessarily something that I would accept as, ‘OK, that’s resolved.’”\n\nJason Miller, an aide to Trump, said White House Counsel Pat Cipillone thought the plan to have Pence affect the election “was nutty and at one point had confronted (Trump lawyer John) Eastman basically with the same.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\n‘No idea more un-American’: Pence lawyers says historic precedence, text refuted Trump scheme to reject results\n\nGreg Jacob, former legal counsel for Pence, said he and other attorneys reviewed the text of the Constitution,the intent of founding fathers and historic precedent, determining the vice president has no authority to choose the next president.\n\n“There is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person would choose the American President,” Jacob said.\n\nJacob said no vice president in 230 years ever claimed to have such a power that the vice president can reject the electoral votes submitted by states.\n\nJacob recounted what he told Jon Eastman, the attorney pushing the theory to Trump: “If you were right, don't you think Al Gore might have liked to have known in 2000 that he had authority to just declare himself president of the United States?”-\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nLuttig: “The language of the 12th amendment is that simple”\n\nAfter long testimony, Senior Investigative Counsel John Wood asked retired Federal Judge Michael Luttig if the 12th amendment was as complicated as John Eastman, made it out to be.\n\n“Judge Luttig, at the risk of oversimplifying for the non-lawyers who are watching,” said Wood. “Is it fair to say that the 12th amendment basically says two things happen: the vice president opens the certificates and the electoral votes are counted. Is it that straightforward?”\n\n“The language of the 12th amendment is that simple,” said Luttig.\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nLuttig: Vice President Pence had no power to strike down electoral votes.\n\nRetired federal judge Michael Luttig is citing numerous legal rulings to knock down the pro-Trump claim that Vice President Mike Pence had any authority whatsoever to throw out electoral votes.\n\n\"There was no historical precedent,\" Luttig said.\n\nBasically, the vice president has no power at all when it comes to congressional counting of electoral votes, Luttig said, including recognition of seven slates of alternative electors put up by the Trump people.\n\n\"There was no basis in the Constitution or the laws of the United States AT ALL for the theory espoused by Mr. (John) Eastman,\" Luttig said at one point. \"At all. None.\"\n\nLuttig is not just any retired federal judge, by the way – he was once a rising conservative star who came very close to winding up on the Supreme Court.\n\nPresident George W. Bush had Luttig on his short list, though he ultimately picked John Roberts and Samuel Alito for high court vacancies.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nTrump lawyers wanted Pence to not count Arizona’s electoral votes\n\nA day before the Electoral College met to cast their votes on Dec. 14, 2020, Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro sent a memo to Rudy Giuliani that Pence is charged with “making judgements about what to do if there are conflicting votes.”\n\nChesebro wanted Pence to not count Arizona's votes (which JBiden won) in the joint session of Congress, “because there are two slates of votes.”\n\nA group of Trump supporters in Arizona and other states had proclaimed themselves “the true electors for the state,” thus creating a group of official electors chosen by the state, and a group of “fake electors,” Cheney said in the hearing.\n\n- Katherine Swartz\n\nPence ‘first instinct’ said he did not have power over 2020 election\n\nA lawyer for Vice President Mike Pence said Pence had an immediate response to the idea that he could sway the 2020 election — that there is no way that the framers of the Constitution intended for him to have that power.\n\nGreg Jacob, Pence’s general counsel, recounted Pence’s reaction and described the conversation that came before Jacob put together a legal memo for Pence that explained the obscure line in the Constitution describing the vice president’s role as well as the Electoral Count Act that laid out the process of counting votes.\n\n“The vice president’s first instinct when he heard this theory was that there was no way that our framers – who abhorred concentrated power, who had broken away from the tyranny of George the third – would ever have put one person – particularly not a person who had a direct interest in the outcome because they were on the ticket for the election – in a role to have decisive impact in the outcome of the election,” Jacob said.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nPence started asking about his authority to count electors in early December\n\nGreg Jacob, Pence’s former counsel in the vice president’s office, said he was first asked by Pence about the vice president’s role in the process to count electoral votes in early December.\n\nJacob recalled that Pence brought up former Vice President Al Gore using his gavel to strike down some Democratic lawmakers who objected to results in the 2000 election.\n\nJacob said that both he and Pence concluded that the vice president – in accordance with the Electoral Count Act of 1887 and the U.S. Constitution – lacks any role other than counting the votes certified by the Electoral College. He said the vice president does not have the authority to decide the presidency.\n\n“There is no justifiable basis to conclude that the vice president has that kind of authority,” Jacob said.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nPence lawyer: Eastman knew election scheme violated Electoral Count Act\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s counsel, Greg Jacob, told the committee that John Eastman admitted his scheme to have Pence single-handedly overturn the election violated the Electoral Count Act.\n\nThe 1887 statute sets the rules for how Congress counts votes in presidential elections. Jacob told the committee during his deposition Eastman conceded his argument was contrary to historical practice, would likely be rejected unanimously by the Supreme Court and violated the Electoral Count Act in four ways.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump held an Oval Office meeting Jan. 4 to pressure Pence, but the vice president refused to buckle. Committee investigators asked if Eastman ever acknowledged in front of Trump that his proposal would violate the law.\n\n“I believe he did on the Fourth,” Jacob said in a videotaped deposition played Thursday.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar: Trump knew there was violence at the Capitol when he tweeted at Pence\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pete Aguilar from California said former President Donald Trump knew the Capitol was breached when he tweeted at former Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n“You’ll also hear President Trump knew there was a violent mob at the Capitol when he tweeted at 2:24 p.m. that the Vice President did not have the quote, courage to do what needed to be done.” Trump tweeted then that Pence lacked the courage to “do what should have been done and protect our country and constitution.”\n\n“Let me be clear,\" said Aguilar. \"Vice President Pence did the right thing that day. He stayed true to his oath to protect and defend the constitution.”\n\n- Kenneth Tran\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar: Trump “latched on to a dangerous theory and would not let go”\n\nIn his opening statement of the hearing, Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said that January 6th was not an isolated incident, that for weeks leading up to the attack Trump committed “illegal scheme and deception.”\n\nAguilar said the committee’s evidence proves that Trump knew he lost the election and then attempted to circumvent “the country’s most fundamental civic tradition: the peaceful transition of power.”\n\n“The president latched on to a dangerous theory and would not let go because he was convinced it would keep him in office,” Aguilar said.\n\n- Katherine Swartz\n\nAide says Pence told Trump “many times” he could not reject electoral votes\n\nVice President Mike Pence’s Chief of Staff told the committee that Pence had communicated directly to Trump that he did not have the legal or constitutional authority to reject electoral votes and thereby hand Trump the presidency.\n\nMarc Short said in a videotaped interview with the committee that Pence had not only written a letter to Trump saying he had no such legal authority, but communicated the same thing to Trump “many times” and “very consistently.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nPro-Trump rioters: Hang Mike Pence!\n\nThe committee played chilling videos of Jan. 6 rioters threatening Mike Pence when they learned he had refused to throw out electoral votes – a demand made by their patron, Donald Trump.\n\n\"I'm hearing reports that Pence caved!\" one rioter said during a profane rant.\n\nAnother tape showed demonstrators chanting a harrowing theme: \"Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCommittee chair calls Pence rejection of Trump scheme ‘courageous’\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the Jan. 6 House Committee, kicked off the third hearing Thursday, saying testimony will reveal a pressure campaign waged by former President Donald Trump to reject the electoral votes confirming Joe Biden’s election victory.\n\n“Donald Trump wanted Mike Pence to do something no other vice president has ever done. The former president wanted Pence to reject the votes and either declare Trump the winner or send the votes back to the states to be counted again.\n\n“Mike Pence said no. He resisted the pressure. He knew it was wrong. We are fortunate for Mr. Pence’s courage.”\n\nThompson added: “When Mike Pence made it clear that he wouldn't give into Donald Trump's scheme, Donald Trump turned the mob on him.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nThompson: Committee wants to question Ginni Thomas\n\nThe chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., told reporters Thursday the committee wants to question Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, over her contacts with a lawyer who developed a plan to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe committee had earlier discussed pursuing Ginni Thomas because of text exchanges with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about fighting results of the 2020 election.\n\nGinni Thomas:House Jan. 6 panel discusses seeking testimony from Ginni Thomas about texts with Mark Meadows, but makes no decision\n\nBut the committee recently obtained emails between Ginni Thomas and John Eastman, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump who developed the plan for Vice President Mike Pence to single-handedly tip the election in favor of Trump, according to The Washington Post.\n\n“We think it’s time that we, at some point, invite her to come talk to the committee,” Thompson told reporters, according to Axios reporter Andrew Solender.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump raised money for ‘election defense’ and gave millions to his allies\n\nA fundraising committee affiliated with former President Donald Trump raised millions of dollars for an “Official Election Defense Fund,” but the Jan. 6 committee said in its hearing Monday that it found no evidence that fund existed.\n\nMost of the money went to a leadership fund called Save America that gave millions to Trump allies. For example, nonprofits affiliated with advisor Kellyanne Conway and chief of staff Mark Meadows received $1 million each. Campaigns for candidates running to unseat Trump foes in Congress received $5,000 each.\n\nE. Danya Perry, who served as an assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 2002 to 2013, said the case has the building blocks of a “pretty clear cut” case of wire fraud, a subject that is “bread and butter for federal prosecutors.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhere did Trump's 'Election Defense Fund' money go?:Trump raised millions to fight election fraud before Jan. 6. Here's how that money was spent.\n\n'1776 Returns' detailed plans to occupy buildings near Capitol\n\nA document allegedly given to Proud Boys Chairman Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio prior to the Jan. 6 insurrection lays out detailed plans to occupy more than half a dozen buildings surrounding the U.S. Capitol and describes tactics to be used by occupiers as they \"Storm the Winter Palace.\"\n\nThe full document titled \"1776 Returns,\" attached as an exhibit in a court filing Wednesday by Tarrio's co-defendant Zachary Rehl, was described by one former federal prosecutor as \"an absolutely devastating piece of evidence.\"\n\nPatrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago who has practiced criminal law for 40 years, said the \"1776 Returns\" document is a bombshell for prosecutors, assuming it can be verified. \"The authors are clearly planning multiple, multiple felonies; they're saying how they're going to do it, and it's all in service, apparently, to a broader crime, which is the sedition.\" he said.\n\nRead more on the document here.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nPence in Cincinnati, Ohio, as Jan. 6 hearing focuses on him\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Cincinnati on Thursday alongside Gov. Mike DeWine for a roundtable with members of Ohio's natural gas and oil industry.\n\nOn the same day, the House Jan. 6 committee is expected to examine how former President Donald Trump pressured Pence to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe roundtable won't be open to the public. It will be hosted by the Ohio Oil and Gas Energy Education Program. Pence will also be in town to raise money for Rep. Steve Chabot's reelection campaign at the home of Nancy and David Aichholz, according to an invitation sent out by the GOP.\n\n– Scott Wartman, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nPence in Ohio: Mike Pence in Cincinnati today as Jan. 6 committee looks at how Trump pressured him\n\nWhat time is the Jan. 6 hearing on Thursday?\n\nThe hearing is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch the Jan. 6 hearing\n\nUSA TODAY will livestream the hearings here on USATODAY.com. The hearings have also been televised on C-Span and cable news networks.\n\nTrump lawyer: Pence was calm when told about lack of election fraud\n\nAlex Cannon, a Trump campaign lawyer, described a stoic Vice President Mike Pence compared to other Trump aides in response to the lack of election fraud.\n\nCannon found no evidence of enough voter fraud to change the election. At one point during a November 2020 meeting at the White House, Pence asked Cannon for an update.\n\n“I don’t remember his exact words, but he asked me if we were finding anything, and I said that I was not personally finding anything sufficient to alter the results of the election,” Cannon said. “He thanked me. That was our interaction.”\n\nWho has the Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed?:Who has been subpoenaed so far by the Jan. 6 committee?\n\nOne Trump lawyer to another: Get a great criminal defense lawyer\n\nIn a promotional tweet Tuesday for the hearing, the committee released video of Eric Hershmann, one of Trump’s lawyers, who described warning Eastman the day after the riot he should find a \"great\" defense lawyer.\n\nEastman had contacted Hershmann to chat about Georgia election results because he couldn’t reach other Trump aides. Hershmann questioned Eastman's sanity and told him the only phrase he wanted to hear from Eastman from then on was \"orderly transition\" to the Biden administration.\n\n\"Eventually he said, ‘Orderly transition,'\" Hershmann said. \"I said, ‘Good, John. Now I’m going to give you the best free legal advice you’re ever getting in your life. Get a great f-ing criminal defense lawyer. You’re going to need it.’ Then I hung up on him.”\n\nHow Trump's PAC spent money:Trump raised millions to fight election fraud before Jan. 6. Here's how that money was spent.\n\nWho is testifying? Former Pence counsel Greg Jacob\n\nGreg Jacob, Pence's counsel who researched the vice president's power to reject electors when Congress counts presidential votes, told Eastman in an email Jan. 6, 2021, at 2:14 p.m. that his advice was \"essentially entirely made up,\" according to court records.\n\nIn an Oval Office meeting with Trump on Jan. 4, Pence stressed his “immediate instinct that there is no way that one person could be entrusted by the Framers to exercise that authority,” according to Jacob.\n\nAs the mob ransacked the Capitol two days later and Pence evacuated the Senate chamber, Jacob emailed Eastman to say \"thanks to your bull----, we are now under siege,\" according to court records.\n\nBill Barr and Donald Trump:Bill Barr's complicated relationship with Donald Trump: From vital advocate to damning witness\n\nWho is Michael Luttig? Retired judge to testify\n\nEastman clerked for Michael Luttig, a retired judge for the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals who was rumored as a potential Supreme Court nominee during President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nThe same day Trump pressured Pence and Jacob in the Oval Office, Pence’s personal lawyer, Richard Cullen, called Luttig to ask about Eastman. Luttig tweeted his disagreement with Eastman’s argument the morning of Jan. 5.\n\n“The only responsibility and power of the Vice President under the Constitution is to faithfully count the electoral college votes as they have been cast,” Luttig said. \"The Constitution does not empower the Vice President to alter in any way the votes that have been cast, either by rejecting certain of them or otherwise.\"\n\nJan. 6 committee hearing schedule:Here's what to expect at upcoming Jan. 6 hearings\n\nPence's former chief of staff Marc Short says he sided with Constitution over Trump\n\nMarc Short, Pence's chief of staff, told the committee the vice president was proud of what was accomplished during the four years of the Trump administration, but sided with the Constitution in the election showdown.\n\n\"I think he was proud to have stood beside the president for all that has been done,\" Short said in a videotaped deposition. \"But I think he ultimately knew that his fidelity to the Constitution was his first and foremost oath.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}]}

But after Circuit Court Judge Melissa Phinn ordered that Syed’s conviction be vacated, his shackles were removed and he left wearing a white shirt with a tie. His mother and other family representatives left with him.\n\nPhinn ruled that the state violated its legal obligation to share exculpatory evidence with Syed’s defense. She ordered him released from custody and placed in home detention with GPS location monitoring. She also ordered the state to decide whether to seek a new trial date or dismiss the case within 30 days.\n\nThe move came after prosecutors said they no longer have faith in their original case – something that many followers of “Serial” have been saying for years.\n\nThe first season of the podcast, spanning 12 episodes, spawned investigations into Syed's conviction, books, documentaries and national media attention. The podcast concluded with host, Sarah Koenig, saying she was unsure who killed Hae Min Lee, Syed's ex-girlfriend.\n\nThat ambiguity captured national attention as Koenig examined glaring problems with both Syed's defense and the prosecution's case, exploring shoddy cellphone data, inconsistent timelines, ignored witnesses and other possible suspects.\n\nSyed was sentenced to a lifetime in prison, plus 30 years after he was convicted of the 1999 murder. He has maintained his innocence since age 17.\n\nDespite public attention, legal representation, and mass advocacy pushing to overturn Syed's conviction, multiple appeals were denied and it took prosecutors admitting errors years later to reach this point.\n\nExperts say the vast majority of prisoners don't have such opportunities, making their struggle even more difficult.\n\nLAST WEEK:Prosecutors move to vacate Adnan Syed's 'Serial' conviction\n\nEARLIER THIS YEAR:Effort to exonerate Adnan Syed may get boost with DNA testing\n\nSyed's case, and the doubts around it, captured national attention\n\nThe true-crime frenzy around Syed is one of the most high-profile examples of podcasts, TV shows and media reports casting serious doubts about previously obscure convictions. But until recently, Syed remained in jail with few legal options left.\n\nThat changed when Baltimore’s state’s attorney filed a motion to vacate the conviction judgment against him Wednesday, saying a lengthy investigation uncovered new evidence that could undermine his 2000 murder conviction.\n\nSyed had already been fighting his conviction for years when a family friend and lawyer connected him with Koenig, the future host of what would become \"Serial.\"\n\nKoenig essentially revived the case in 2014, tracking down old friends of Syed and Lee, sorting through thousands of documents and court hearings, and ultimately developing an investigation that appeared to uncover multiple problems with Syed's trial.\n\nDeirdre Enright, a law professor and founder of the Innocence Project at the University of Virginia School of Law, said Syed would have had few options to try and overturn his conviction without the public attention.\n\n\"Adnan Syed would be nowhere if Sarah Koenig hadn't stepped in and turned him into a national spectacle,\" Enright said. \"Like most, he would have been on his own.\"\n\nA 2021 Maryland law allowing for people convicted of crimes as juveniles to seek new sentences after 20 years in prison also helped move his case forward, said Enright, who was featured on several episodes of \"Serial.\"\n\nProsecutors said a yearlong investigation into Syed's case revealed two alternate suspects and \"significant reliability issues\" with evidence used to convict him.\n\nProsecutors asked for a new trial, at the minimum. The state is awaiting DNA analysis to decide whether they want to pursue a new trial or drop the case, Marilyn Mosby, state’s attorney for Baltimore City, said at a press conference following the hearing.\n\n“We’re not yet declaring that Adnan Syed is innocent,” she said. “But we are declaring that in the interest of fairness and justice, he is entitled to a new trial.”\n\n'Unfortunate ... not uncommon': Syed's lengthy process to overturn conviction\n\nThe long battle Syed faced isn’t unique, said Amanda Vicary, chair and professor of psychology at Illinois Wesleyan University.\n\n“It's unfortunate, but it's not uncommon at all that even people who are actually innocent may be in prison for 20 years before they find someone to represent them and before all of the appeals and everything make their way through the court system,” Vicary said.\n\nIn the U.S., 375 people have been exonerated by DNA testing since 1989 in various types of cases, according to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit focused on freeing innocent people and preventing wrongful convictions. On average, those people served an average of 14 years per person before they were released.\n\nSyed was granted new DNA testing in 2022 with procedures that weren't available when he was put on trial over 20 years ago. Most of the testing yielded inconclusive or non-useful results, the motion filed Wednesday says. Prosecutors are awaiting additional DNA analysis.\n\n'I FEEL FREE':Teen framed for 1985 murder becomes 3,000th person exonerated\n\nErica Suter, director of the University of Baltimore’s Innocence Project Clinic, thanked Syed's supporters and the court after the hearing for \"doing the right thing.\"\n\n“When prosecutors do not do their duty, when they do not disclose evidence as they are supposed to, the result can be that innocent people like Adnan waste decades of their lives for crimes they did not commit,\" she said.\n\nDespite his long wait to overturn his conviction, Syed has been given chances most people in the criminal justice system have not, experts say, along with a heavy dose of publicity.\n\nOne avenue to seek an overturned conviction is through a post-conviction lawyer, something Syed has employed. But once someone's been convicted, it's difficult to hire one, especially for those without money or family.\n\n“Once you go to prison, you don't get a lawyer – you're on your own,” Vicary said.\n\nWithout a post-conviction lawyer, the other viable option to overturn a conviction is to seek help from organizations like the Innocence Project – but even UVA's, which has more staff than others, has a waiting list of hundreds, according to Enright.\n\nAllowing outside influence into a courtroom directly conflicts with American judges' code of conflict. But in a case broken wide open to the public, like Syed’s, public influence may be all but unavoidable.\n\n“They might not want to admit it, or they may not even be consciously aware of it, but I think it would be hard to say that (public attention is) not affecting things in some way,” Vicary said.\n\nEXONERATIONS:They're out of prison, but still fighting to prove their innocence: 'I feel like I'm not free'\n\n'Serial' ushered in a new era of true crime but left victims behind\n\nWhen Koenig came to Enright with the idea of turning \"Serial\" into a full-length podcast, the law professor's first thought was that no one would care.\n\n\"I've been doing these cases for years ... I was like, 'nobody cares about that,'\" Enright said. \"That's why I have to keep doing this.\"\n\nBut to Enright's surprise, she was proven wrong – and happily so. \"Serial\" is one of the most celebrated podcasts of all time: it's widely cited as the most listened-to podcast in the world with over 300 million downloads, according to \"This American Life,\" which produced the podcast.\n\nAmericans have had a fascination with true crime for hundreds of years, beginning in the 1800s when newspapers started hiring crime reporters and printing sensational trials on their front pages, said Adam Golub, a professor of American Studies at California State University, Fullerton.\n\nAnd there's \"no question\" that \"Serial\" inaugurated a new cycle of that fascination, Golub said.\n\n\"What something like 'Serial' did is it turned all of us into de facto jurors or investigators – we get to be these armchair experts on these crimes who then feel like we can make up our own mind about it,\" he said.\n\nBut Serial – and many other true-crime productions – overwhelmingly focuses on the perpetrator and not the victim.\n\n\"This is really about the murder of someone,\" he said. \"Hae Min Lee has kind of been overshadowed by all of this.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Lee's brother Young Lee spoke to the court, saying he feels betrayed by prosecutors since he thought the case was settled.\n\n“This is not a podcast for me. This is real life,” he said.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Lee's family said they continue to \"have questions in its pursuit of justice.\"\n\n\"For 22 years the family and the world have been told that Adnan Syed murdered Hae Min Lee. Now the Court and prosecutors have a different view,\" the statement reads. \"They are disappointed that today’s hearing happened so quickly and with virtually no notice, and they do not understand why the court acted the way it did and why the prosecutor’s office has made the recommendation they did.\"\n\nOPINION:Who's to blame for wrongful convictions?

That means the Fed is likely to deliver a third consecutive mega interest rate hike when it concludes its policy-making meeting on Wednesday, and consumers should expect their costs to head even higher and job losses to mount as economic growth grinds to a halt.

Early Wednesday, the storm threatened to strengthen from a Category 3 into a Category 4 storm as it lashed the Turks and Caicos Islands. About 80% of Puerto Rico remained without power early Tuesday, though officials said they were making progress restoring parts of it. Water service was cut to more than 837,000 customers – two-thirds of the total on the island, officials said.

According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\n\"This conduct cannot be brushed aside and dismissed as some sort of good-faith mistake,\" James said at a news conference in New York.\n\n\"The statements of financial condition were greatly exaggerated, grossly inflated, objectively false, and therefore fraudulent and illegal,\" she added. \"And as a result of that we are seeking relief, and Mr. Trump, the Trump Organization, his family -- they should all be held accountable.\"\n\nTrump and his children, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump, are named as defendants in the lawsuit. Allen Weisselberg , former CFO for the Trump Organization, and Jeff McConney, another longtime company executive, are also named.\n\nJames said she believes state and criminal laws may have been violated and referred the matter to the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe US attorney's office declined to comment.\n\n\"These acts of fraud and misrepresentation were similar in nature, were committed by upper management at the Trump Organization as part of a common endeavor for each annual Statement, and were approved at the highest levels of the Trump Organization -- including by Mr. Trump himself,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nAs part of the lawsuit, James is seeking $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds and to permanently bar Trump and the children named in the lawsuit from serving as the director of a business registered in New York state. She is also seeking to cancel the Trump Organization's corporate certificate, which, if granted by a judge, could effectively force the company to cease operations in New York state.\n\nJUST WATCHED Maggie Haberman breaks down New York AG's lawsuit against Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Maggie Haberman breaks down New York AG's lawsuit against Trump 02:23\n\nTrump previously called James a \"renegade prosecutor\" who he said is running a \"vindictive and self-serving fishing expedition.\" The Trump Organization called her previously allegations \"baseless\" and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nResponding to Wednesday's announcement, Trump attorney Alina Habba said in a statement to CNN: \"Today's filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law -- rather, it is solely focused on advancing the Attorney General's political agenda. It is abundantly clear that the Attorney General's Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place.\"\n\nWeisselberg's attorney, Nicholas Gravante, declined to comment.\n\nThe civil lawsuit comes as Trump is under increasing legal pressure as prosecutors are taking investigative steps that move ever closer to his inner circle.\n\nTrump is facing numerous criminal investigations from federal and state prosecutors involving the accuracy of his company's financial statements, interference in the 2020 presidential election, and his handling of classified documents after leaving office. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAG alleges that Trump lied 200+ times about the value of his assets\n\nJames alleges that the former President and his company made \"scores of fraudulent, false, and misleading representations\" over a 10-year period, according to the lawsuit, which specifically highlighted what it called \"200 false and misleading valuations\" of Trump's assets.\n\n\"The financial statements in question were issued annually; each contained a significant number of fraudulent, false, and misleading representations about a great many of the Trump Organization's assets; and most played a role in particular transactions with financial institutions,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\"The number of grossly inflated asset values is staggering,\" the suit adds.\n\nAccording to James, Trump's businesses prepared statements of financial condition every year to submit to banks and other financial institutions. The statements showed the financial position of the Trump businesses, James said, and were relied upon if the Trump Organization wanted to apply for loans.\n\nEach statement was personally certified as accurate by Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., or Weisselberg, James told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nTrump \"made known\" that \"he wanted his net worth reflected on those statements to increase,\" James said, \"a desire Mr. Weisselberg and others carried out year after year in their fraudulent preparation of those statements.\"\n\nAs an example of allegations Trump inflated valuations to increase his own profits. James highlighted what she says happened with 40 Wall Street, a property known as The Trump Building in New York City's financial district, which is referenced dozens of times in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump's company obtained appraisals for the property in 2010 and 2012, which found that it was worth $200 million and $220 million respectively, according to the lawsuit. But Trump's company repeatedly claimed that the property was worth a lot more in its official financial statements, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn 2011, Trump's company said the property was worth $524 million. He said it was worth $527 million in 2012, and $530 million in 2013, according to the lawsuit, which argued that there was not a valid basis for these inflated valuations, and that Trump falsely claimed these numbers came from \"professionals.\"\n\nDuring Wednesday's news conference James also said that Trump inflated the square footage of his Trump Tower triplex apartment in order to misrepresent the value at over $300 million.\n\n\"Mr. Trump represented that his apartments spanned more than 30,000 square feet, which was the basis for valuing the apartment. In reality, the apartment had an area of less than 11,000 square feet, something that Mr. Trump was well aware of,\" James said.\n\nShe added: \"Based on that inflated square footage, the value of the apartment in 2015, in 2016, was $327 million. To this date, no apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount.\"\n\nThree-year investigation\n\nThe announcement is the latest development in what has been a three-year investigation led by James into the Trump Organization's finances.\n\nIn January, James' office said it found \"significant\" evidence indicating the Trump Organization used false or misleading asset valuations in its financial statements to obtain loans, insurance and tax benefits. The following month, Trump's long-time accounting firm resigned.\n\nJames' launched her investigation in 2019 after Trump's former fixer and personal attorney Michael Cohen testified before Congress alleging that Trump inflated the value of certain assets to obtain loans and insurance and undervalued others to gain tax benefits.\n\nCohen told CNN's Victor Blackwell on \"Newsroom\" Wednesday that the allegations in James' lawsuit represent a \"complete destruction\" to Trump's image as a wealthy self-made businessman.\n\n\"It's like a nuclear bomb exploded. The man has a fragile ego, which we all know. His entire life is predicated on his net worth and him portraying himself as this wonderful businessman, this massive success, this incredibly wealthy guy. And what do we know? We know that it's not true,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'The system protects the rich': Michael Cohen addresses new fraud lawsuit against Trump Replay More Videos ...

To bring a criminal case, prosecutors would need evidence of Trump's state of mind and whether he intended to mislead or defraud anyone when he made statements embellishing the value of his properties.\n\nBragg's office interviewed bankers, Trump Organization employees and Trump's longtime accountant but it does not have a key insider cooperating with the investigation. One of the issues that gave Bragg pause from moving forward earlier this year was the lack of an insider who could tie Trump to the valuations, CNN has reported.\n\nAG: Trump's oldest children 'knowingly participated'\n\nEric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. \"knowingly participated\" in the alleged fraudulent schemes, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe alleged scheme \"required the participation of Mr. Trump and his children,\" the lawsuit said, adding that the children were \"aware of the true financial performance of the company.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, for instance, alleges that Eric Trump was involved in an approach to appraising properties in Las Vegas in a way that lowered their value for tax purposes while inflating their value on Trump financial statements.\n\nIt also quotes testimony from Trump Jr. as it describes how the value of Trump Park Avenue was allegedly inflated on Trump financial statements. An appraisal of the property by an outside firm in 2010 for a loan took into account how some of the units were rent-stabilized, lowering their value, according to James' complaint. Yet, Trump financial statements put a value on the units roughly six times higher than what the appraiser had concluded, the lawsuit said.\n\nAnd the lawsuit pointed to Ivanka Trump's involvement in securing a loan for purchasing the Doral golf course in Florida and Chicago properties in 2012 -- loans that James claims were extended in part because of financial statements allegedly containing misrepresentations.\n\n\"On each of those transactions with Deutsche Bank, Ms. Trump was aware that the transactions included a personal guaranty from Mr. Trump that required him to provide annual Statements of Financial Condition and certifications,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nFamily was deposed by AG's office\n\nIn April, after a protracted legal fight to enforce subpoenas for Trump and his adult children's depositions, lawyers with James' office saying they were nearing the end of the investigation and needed the Trumps' testimony before making a decision.\n\nLast month, Trump did not answer questions and asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when deposed by the attorney general's office. Eric Trump, who runs the business on a daily basis, also invoked his Fifth Amendment right in 2020 in response to more than 500 questions.\n\nSince Trump and Eric Trump declined to answer questions, if the case goes to trial, the jury can draw an \"adverse inference\" against them for not answering questions. That could result in a higher judgment against them or the company if they're found liable.\n\nIvanka Trump and Trump Jr. both answered questions during interviews that spanned more than seven hours, sources told CNN.\n\nJames noted that Trump and Weisselberg invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege during her news conference.\n\n\"When asked under oath if he, Mr. Trump, continued to review and approve the statements after becoming president of the United States in 2017, Mr. Trump again invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to answer,\" James said Wednesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell", "Tierney Sneed", "Marshall Cohen", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/21/new-york-ag-letitia-james-sues-donald-trump-accuses-fraud/8070811001/", "title": "Trump, family members sued by New York AG Letitia James ...", "text": "New York Attorney General Letitia James on Wednesday accused former President Donald Trump of massive fraud in a civil lawsuit following a three year inquiry into the finances of the family business.\n\nJames said Trump \"falsely inflated his wealth by billions of dollars\" to enrich himself and his family and the lawsuit seeks to effectively shutter the former president's namesake business, the Trump Organization.\n\n\"Mr. Trump thought he could get away with the art of the steal, but today, that conduct ends,\" James said. \"There aren't two sets of laws for people in this nation: former presidents must be held to the same standards as everyday Americans.\"\n\nJames said she has referred some of the allegations to federal authorities, including the Manhattan U.S Attorney's Office and the IRS for possible criminal investigation.\n\nWeisselberg pleads guilty:Allen Weisselberg, Trump Organization CFO, pleads guilty in tax case.

If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?”\n\nProsecution vs. politics:Can AG Garland pursue Trump probes without influencing the midterms?\n\nJames' investigation was launched more than three years ago after former Trump attorney Michael Cohen told federal lawmakers that the former president regularly inflated the value of his properties and net worth to get better insurance and loan rates.\n\n\"It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,\" Cohen told the Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nIn May, the attorney general signaled the inquiry was nearing an end and that investigators had amassed substantial evidence that could support legal action, such as a lawsuit, against Trump, his company or both.\n\nThe attorney general's action is related to one of several investigations targeting the former president:\n\nTrump is in the midst of challenging the seizure of tranches of classified documents from his Mar-a-Lago, Florida, estate, as part of a federal inquiry into possible obstruction, the mishandling of government records and violations of the Espionage Act.\n\nTrump on Jan. 6, 2021:A breakdown of the 187 minutes Trump was out of view on Jan. 6 as aides urged him to act\n\nSeparately, former Trump administration officials have been called to testify before a federal grand jury investigating attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nAnd in Atlanta, a local district attorney is conducting a wide-ranging criminal probe that includes Trump's efforts to pressure Georgia officials to reverse President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory there.

James said she's also made referrals to federal law enforcement authorities.\n\nHere's what to know about the new case James has brought:\n\nIn 200-plus instances, James said, Trump embellished value of his assets\n\nAccording to the schemes alleged by James, the financial statements compiled by Trump -- which were offered to banks and other entities Trump was doing business with -- include values of assets that were blatantly contradicted by internal records or otherwise falsified.\n\n\"All told, Mr. Trump, the Trump Organization, and the other Defendants, as part of a repeated pattern and common scheme, derived more than 200 false and misleading valuations of assets included in the 11 Statements covering 2011 through 2021,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nJames characterized one of the episodes as a \"two sets of books\" scenario: \"one internal set of records reached one conclusion regarding market value, but the figure presented on Mr. Trump's Statement was considerably higher.\"\n\nJames claims that Trump reaped a \"substantial\" financial benefit by putting forward faulty information in his financial statements, including $150 million in the form of favorable interest rates he obtained from the banks that James said his team misled.\n\nThe alleged schemes touch a variety of Trump properties, including golf courses, hotels and Mar-a-Lago\n\nJames said the misrepresentations on Trump's financial statements affected \"most if not all of\" his and his company's \"real estate holdings in any given year, including several of Trump's highest profile business ventures.\n\nTrump valued his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida as high as $739 million when the property was likely worth about a tenth of that, James alleged, while accusing Trump of further boosting the resort's value by tacking on a \"brand premium.\"\n\nUS accounting principles prohibit such premiums and the Trump financial statements \"expressly claim to exclude brand value,\" James said.\n\nIncluded in the 2011 valuation of Trump's Westchester golf course in New York was the notion that new members would pay $200,000 in initiation fees, even though Trump instructed the club to reduce or waive those fees in a bid to increase club membership numbers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'The system protects the rich': Michael Cohen addresses new fraud lawsuit against Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'The system protects the rich': Michael Cohen addresses new fraud lawsuit against Trump 01:55\n\nThe defendants are accused of skewing the worth of the Trump Park Avenue property, by putting a value on several units that was roughly six times more than what an outside firm calculated in an 2010 appraisal. James pointed to testimony from Donald Trump Jr., one of the defendants, that indicated the company was aware that the units were rent stabilized, which is the reason the appraiser had put them at the much lower value.\n\nOther Trump ventures -- including his Doral golf resort in Florida, the Old Post Office property he leased for a hotel in Washington, and Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago -- are implicated in the lawsuit, with James saying that loans were extended for those properties because of inaccurate representations the Trump team made to banks.\n\nJames also claimed that the Trump financial statements describes profits from real estate properties as being part of Trump's liquid assets when they were in fact cash held by a real estate trust, Vornado Partnerships, in which Trump had a minority stake. Doing so contradicted both US accounting principles (known as generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP), according to the complaint.\n\n\"In some years these restricted funds accounted for almost one-third of all the cash reported by Mr. Trump,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nTrump's statements falsely claimed he had outside help for valuing assets, lawsuit says\n\nThe lawsuit said that \"no outside professionals were retained to prepare any of the asset valuations\" that were presented in his annual financial statements, despite representations on those statements that the evaluations were done with \"outside professionals.\"\n\n\"To the extent Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization received any advice from outside professionals that had any bearing on how to approach valuing the assets, they routinely ignored or contradicted such advice,\" the complaint said.\n\nJeffrey McConney -- a Trump Organization executive and a defendant in the lawsuit -- was asked by the attorney general's office in a 2020 interview about the references to outside professionals on the Trump financial statements, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"After that interview, the Trump Organization changed the wording for the 2020 Statement, omitting any representation that any particular valuation was reached in consultation with 'outside professionals' and instead listing outside professionals as merely one factor that may have been 'applicable' in some unspecified manner,\" James' complaint said.\n\nMcConney has not responded to a request for comment from CNN.\n\nWhat penalties does Trump face, if the lawsuit is successful\n\nJames said that the conduct justifies canceling the Trump Organization's corporate certificate, which would effectively force the company to cease operations in New York state.\n\nShe is also seeking a financial penalty of what she estimated is $250 million in ill-gotten gains.\n\nAdditionally James said Trump and his threree eldest children -- Trump Jr., Eric and Ivanka -- should be barred from serving as officers at any New York registered business. The lawsuit wants to impose several limits on what Trump's businesses can do going forward, with proposals to bar them for the next five years from acquiring real estate in the state and from applying for loans from New York chartered banks.\n\nShe also seeks the replacement of the current trustees of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee the Trump Organization's financial dealings for the next five years.\n\nTrump responds with attacks on James\n\nTrump has been railing against James on social media since the lawsuit was unveiled Wednesday.\n\n\"I never thought this case would be brought,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, accusing James of filing the wide-ranging lawsuit to reverse \"her really bad poll numbers.\"\n\nTrump's hostility towards James has stretched for years, including when he was President and she was spearheading several lawsuits challenging the policies of his administration.\n\nHis personal attorney Alina Habba said in a statement that the lawsuit was \"neither focused on the facts nor the law,\" but rather \"on advancing the Attorney General's political agenda.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Maggie Haberman breaks down New York AG's lawsuit against Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Maggie Haberman breaks down New York AG's lawsuit against Trump 02:23\n\n\"It is abundantly clear that the Attorney General's Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place,\" Habba said. \"We are confident that our judicial system will not stand for this unchecked abuse of authority, and we look forward to defending our client against each and every one of the Attorney General's meritless claims.\"\n\nWhat's next in the lawsuit\n\nJames' complaint is a civil lawsuit, meaning it could take years for the case to work its way through the legal process in the New York state court system before it even goes to trial.\n\nThe process will likely include months and months of litigation over what shape that trial should take -- or if the case even warrants going to trial at all.\n\nJames' office and the defendants could settle the lawsuit, though James resisted that route in recent months when the Trump Organization, according to sources, offered to settle to ward off the lawsuit even as they denied any wrongdoing. James' office made it clear it isn't interested in the deal, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nHowever, at her news conference announcing the lawsuit, James said that her office's \"doors were open.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for Trump's criminal exposure?\n\nBy launching a civil investigation against Trump, the New York attorney general's office faced a lower burden of proof than what would have been necessary to bring a criminal case against Trump.\n\nTo mount a criminal case, prosecutors would need evidence of Trump's state of mind and whether he intended to mislead or defraud anyone when he approved the statements mischaracterizing the value of his assets.\n\nA criminal investigation by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is\"active and ongoing,\" Bragg said in a statement Wednesday. But those investigators, as CNN previously reported, have not secured a key insider from Trump's world who could tie Trump to the allegedly false valuations.\n\nThe district attorney's office has brought charges against Trump companies and former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Weisselberg agreed to a plea deal earlier this year.\n\nJames also said she was referring the conduct to federal investigators at the Manhattan US Attorney's Office and at the Internal Revenue Service. Her complaint cited federal law that the alleged conduct could have \"plausibly\" violated, including bank fraud and false statements to financial institutions.\n\nThe US attorney's office declined to comment. An IRS spokesperson said that the agency receives \"potential criminal activity from a variety of sources every day,\" adding that its agents \"review information received for further criminal investigation. The agency \"doesn't confirm the existence of investigations until court documents are publicly available,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nRegardless of where those referrals go, James' lawsuit adds another battle line to the multi-front legal war Trump is fighting. Several of his former White House deputies have testified or have been subpoenaed in the Justice Department's criminal investigation into the plots around the 2020 election. Documents from his White House that were seized by the FBI at his Florida home in August are the subject of a DOJ criminal investigation as well, though limits have been placed on that probe while a third-party review of those materials proceeds.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/business/nightcap-fed-powell-volcker-inflation/", "title": "Jay Powell just went full Volcker | CNN Business", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York (CNN Business) Earlier this year, the idea of the Fed raising rates by three-quarters of percentage point wasn't on the menu. But in just a few months, that sizable jump has become the norm, and it's almost certainly sealed Jay Powell's status as the Paul Volcker of the 2020s.\n\nHere's the deal: The Federal Reserve made history today, approving its third consecutive 75-basis-point interest rate hike. Once again, the Fed is trying to wring inflation out of the economy by using the most powerful and broad lever it has — controlling how much it costs for businesses and people to borrow money.\n\nThe benchmark lending rate is now the highest it has been since the global financial crisis of 2008, my colleague Nicole Goodkind reports\n\nSo, here's what you need to know:\n\nOne of Powell's biggest critics, Senator Elizabeth Warren, was quick to fire off a tweet decrying the \"extreme\" hike, which the Fed itself expects will push unemployment up to 4.4% from 3.7% currently — amounting to more than 1 million jobs.\n\n\"Chair Powell just announced another extreme interest rate hike while forecasting higher unemployment,\" Warren tweeted. \"I've been warning that Chair Powell's Fed would throw millions of Americans out of work — and I fear he's already on the path to doing so.\"\n\nPowell doesn't like to say words like \"layoff\" or \"job cuts.\" But he's not unsympathetic to what he euphemistically calls \"softening of labor market conditions.\" He just thinks that the short-term pain of a recession would be preferable to the longer-term pain of entrenched inflation.\n\nTo set the labor market up for sustained strength, he said, we have got to get inflation behind us. \"I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't.\"\n\nSTEP BACK\n\nTo understand the Fed, it helps to understand Powell.\n\nIn his role as the central bank chief, he's made no secret of his admiration for Paul Volcker, whose name is practically synonymous with fighting inflation at all costs, even if it crashes the economy into a recession. That's exactly what Volcker's Fed did — twice — in the early 1980s.\n\nDuring congressional testimony in the spring, Powell described Volcker as a hero, calling him \"the greatest economic public servant of the era.\"\n\n(Fun fact: The 6-foot-7 Volcker was also known in DC by his nickname, \"Tall Paul\")\n\nAt least twice in the past month, Powell has publicly invoked the title of Volcker's 2018 biography \"Keeping At It.\" In his now notoriously blunt Jackson Hole speech last month, Powell declared that \"we must keep at it until the job is done.\" And again Wednesday: \"We want to act aggressively now and ... keep at it until it's done.\"\n\nPart of the reason Volcker is remembered so favorably by Powell and others is that it required a savvy mind and an iron stomach to a) understand the problem of rampant inflation, and b) implement the painful shock therapy of interest rate hikes that cost millions of people their jobs. Volcker's plan worked, but it really sucked for a while. There was indeed some pain, to borrow Powell's euphemistic phrasing.\n\nInflation is now the highest it's been since Volcker ran the Fed, and the central bank itself is facing a crisis of credibility after not moving fast enough to keep rising prices in check.\n\nCredibility was a big concern for Volcker as well.\n\n\"Volcker's mantra, one he told me again and again through 2008-9, was that in a crisis the only asset you have is your credibility,\" Austan Goolsbee, an economist who advised the Obama administration, wrote in 2019 just after Volcker died at age 92.\n\nBottom line: Powell continues to draw from the Volcker playbook, which means he's unlikely to waver on the Fed's target rate of 2% inflation, lest the central bank's credibility take another blow. Only time will tell whether that 40-plus-year-old playbook still applies in an economy that's fundamentally different from the one Volcker confronted.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY 5.2 million\n\nCongrats, rich people — you ranks are multiplying. Thanks to gains in the stock market and soaring home prices, the world got another 5.2 million millionaires last year, nearly half of whom are in the United States. It's the largest increase in millionaire numbers for any country in any year this century, according to Credit Suisse, which published its annual global wealth report this week.\n\nThe total number of millionaires stood at 62.5 million at the end of 2021. Aggregate global wealth jumped nearly 10% to a total of $463.6 trillion at the end of last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the pandemic has pushed about 100 million people into extreme poverty, raising that global total to 711 million in 2021, according to the World Bank.\n\nLAWSUITS PILE UP\n\nDonald Trump, who is already facing several criminal investigations from federal and state prosecutors over matters including his company's financial statements, interference in the 2020 election, and his handling of classified documents, was just hit with another bombshell accusation of an expansive, decade-long fraud.\n\nHere's the deal: The New York state attorney general filed a lawsuit against the former president, three of his children and the Trump Organization, the culmination of a three-year investigation into the family and its namesake company.\n\nThe lawsuit is more than 200 pages long, and it includes accusations of fraud that touched all aspects of the Trump business. Let's break down some of its key points:\n\nThe Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals, the suit alleges. It highlights \"200 false and misleading valuations\" of Trump's assets.\n\n\"The statements of financial condition were greatly exaggerated, grossly inflated, objectively false, and therefore fraudulent and illegal,\" James said.\n\nDefendants in the lawsuit include the former president; his children, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump; Allen Weisselberg, the former CFO for the Trump Organization; and Jeff McConney, another executive.\n\nJames has referred the matter to the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nShe is seeking $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds and to permanently bar Trump and the children named in the lawsuit from serving as the director of any business registered in New York state. She is also seeking to cancel the Trump Organization's corporate certificate, which, if granted by a judge, could effectively force the company to cease operations in the state.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in every case against him. He's previously called James a \"renegade prosecutor\" who he said is running a \"vindictive and self-serving fishing expedition.\"\n\nIn response to the latest lawsuit, a Trump attorney reiterated his disdain for James, saying the filing \"is neither focused on the facts nor the law -- rather, it is solely focused on advancing the Attorney General's political agenda, adding that \"absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place.\"\n\nWeisselberg's attorney declined to comment.\n\nHere's just one of the 200 examples laid out by James' lawsuit:\n\nDown in Manhattan's Financial District, there's a property called 40 Wall Street, known as The Trump Building.\n\nAppraisals of the property in 2010 and 2012 valued it at $200 million and $220 million respectively, according to the lawsuit. But Trumps's company repeatedly claimed the property was more than double that value in official financial statements.\n\nTrump also lied about the square footage of his Trump Tower triplex apartment to inflate the value at over $300 million, James alleges. While claiming the apartments spanned more than 30,000 square feet, the actual measurement was less than 11,000 square feet, she said.\n\n\"Based on that inflated square footage, the value of the apartment...was $327 million. To this date, no apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount,\" James said.", "authors": ["Analysis Allison Morrow", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/politics/charging-trump-fundraising-election-lies-high-bar/index.html", "title": "Charging Trump for fundraising off election lies would face high bar ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) While the House January 6 committee is making its case to the American public that then-President Donald Trump ripped off donors with false fundraising pitches after the 2020 election, prosecutors would face higher hurdles if they were to pursue a criminal fraud case in court.\n\n\"Is it a grift? Yeah, it's a grift. But is a grift always illegal? Not necessarily,\" said Paul Pelletier, a former federal prosecutor who previously led the Justice Department's fraud section.\n\nOne state attorney general, New York's Letitia James, has already said she will investigate the committee's allegations of fraud and potential misconduct. \"The new details revealed tonight related to January 6 are disturbing,\" James tweeted hours after the committee's findings were made public this week. \"It's my duty to investigate allegations of fraud or potential misconduct in New York. This incident is no exception.\"\n\nDuring its hearing on Monday , the committee outlined a startling set of financial figures, alleging Trump had raised $250 million off false claims that the election was stolen. Much of that money was raised through dozens of daily email blasts sent between the election and January 6, 2021, with many donations coming in amounts of $20 or less, the committee said.\n\nDonors were encouraged to contribute to a so-called \"Official Election Defense Fund,\" which did not exist and was simply a term used for marketing, the committee said. Most of the money ultimately went toward a PAC, called Save America, formed less than a week after the election, that distributed it to other political ventures. Some of the funds landed with the company that organized the January 6 rally and even to the Trump family business, the committee said.\n\n\"The big lie was also a big ripoff,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, one of the Democrats on the panel.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who's the committee's chair, told CNN on Tuesday that there was still a question as to whether Trump and his family were themselves trying to benefit from the fundraising.\n\n\"Obviously, quite a bit of the money went to the Trump Hotel. It went to non-profits associated with people who work for the President. And obviously, this was not the intent that a lot of the fundraising emails were being sent. So clearly, they were misled at best. And in some instances, they were just patently untrue,\" Thompson said.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has already promised, in a speech marking the one-year anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, that the Justice Department will examine the financing behind the insurrection.\n\nA high bar to clear\n\nYet if the federal prosecutors were to pursue a case, they'd need to answer many unknowns that the House left unanswered in its short presentation on Monday -- and think through the implications of charging a fundraising operation for a sitting president running for reelection.\n\n\"In a normal situation, could you get people charged criminally? Of course,\" said Adav Noti, legal director of the Campaign Legal Center, a non-profit government watchdog. \"This is not a normal situation. We're talking, at the time, the sitting president of the United States. That's not a run-of-the-mill decision for the Department of Justice to make.\"\n\n\"Did people who gave that money think they were putting it into a perpetual account that could be drawn on by the campaign organizers for whatever they wanted? Maybe the donor wouldn't care about that, but the law cares,\" said Noti.\n\nAs in all investigations, any potential criminal case would turn on the evidence, former prosecutors say.\n\n\"There are two big complications off the bat\" with bringing a criminal case based on the fundraising emails, said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor who's a CNN senior legal analyst. \"What does the fine print say, and you have to tie the fraud specifically to whoever you want to charge.\" In the case of Trump, he could be layers removed from the person who wrote and sent the fundraising email, Honig said.\n\nProsecutors would also face questions of whether there are victims willing to be witnesses in the case, and who, if anyone, intended to use the fundraising effort as a bait and switch.\n\nA fine-print disclosure on Trump's fundraising blasts stating that the money may go to a \"recount account\" only if a donation reached nearly $10,000 could further complicate a possible case.\n\nOther former public integrity prosecutors and white-collar attorneys agreed the possibility of a wire fraud criminal investigation looks clear -- but bringing a case may not be as simple as it seems.\n\n\"I think the legal jeopardy for Trump world is pretty clear,\" Daniel Goldman , a lawyer who worked on the case against Trump during his impeachment proceedings related to January 6, said on CNN on Tuesday. \"Presumably Donald Trump didn't know that he was getting $250 million on a bogus claim. But it's harder to prove that with actual evidence than it is just to assert that.\"\n\nGoldman outlined how prosecutors would need to find donors and nail down that they had intended to donate to a legal defense fund, and that they had been victimized by having their money sent toward an unadvertised purpose.\n\n\"You'd show the legal defense fund doesn't exist. And you basically got a criminal case. It's a pretty textbook case of wire fraud,\" Goldman said. \"The more difficult thing is to attach this to Donald Trump.\"\n\nState prosecutors could be a likely route\n\nIf the Justice Department ultimately didn't pursue the accusations, state-level law enforcement may be interested in them. James, in New York, who has built her political persona around conducting a years-long investigation into the Trump Organization, is already signaling that route.\n\nState attorneys general have consumer protection law they could deploy to investigate whether any donors were misled by the campaign solicitations, and they have recently focused on fundraising tactics involving the Trump campaign.\n\nIn an important test case of the scope of state attorneys general's power to investigate federal fundraising practices, four states, including New York, won a key ruling earlier this year related to WinRed, a company that processes online donations.\n\nFour attorneys general -- from New York, Connecticut, Maryland and Minnesota -- opened investigations into WinRed after The New York Times published an article detailing how the Trump campaign and WinRed used pre-checked boxes to sign donors up to make repeated contributions.\n\nThe states sent subpoenas for records seeking information about clients who used the pre-checked boxes, complaints from donors and refunds that had been provided. WinRed sued to block the subpoenas, arguing that state consumer protection laws were preempted by the Federal Election Campaign Act. The Trump campaign refunded some of the donors.\n\nEarlier this year, a federal judge sided with the attorneys general and dismissed the lawsuit, saying they had the power to investigate federal campaigns.\n\nJustice Department investigation thus far\n\nSo far, there has been no public indication that federal prosecutors are scrutinizing the broader post-election fundraising that largely went to the political action committee Trump controls.\n\nBut the inquiry is wide, according to grand jury requests shared with CNN. The Justice Department's January 6 grand jury investigation has sought information about Trump rally organizing and the campaign's use of Trump electors in battleground states where he lost the popular vote.\n\nSeveral months ago, the Justice Department also was looking into fundraising conducted for a different fund, Defending the Republic, which was promoted by the conservative attorney Sidney Powell, who was involved in Trump's legal challenges after the election. While Powell's attorney told CNN in January that she was cooperating with the inquiry, it's unclear where that investigation now stands.\n\nHistorically, the Justice Department has used its public corruption prosecutors to bring cases against political fundraising scams, including in the border wall charity investigation where Steve Bannon was indicted. Trump pardoned Bannon at the end of his presidency.\n\nIn the We Build the Wall case the alleged deception was explicit and the men took steps to try to conceal their wrongdoing, according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors allege the men falsely told the public in donor solicitations, public statements and on social media that \"100% of the funds raised\" would be used for construction of the wall and not a \"penny\" would be used to compensate Brian Kolfage, a US veteran working with Bannon on the wall effort. Instead, prosecutors alleged, Kolfage and Bannon used shell companies to route hundreds of thousands of dollars to themselves, which were used to cover personal expenses. Kolfage pleaded guilty in April and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office is investigating Bannon and whether he violated state laws with his role in the fundraising effort, CNN has reported. Recently, several people in Bannon's \"immediate circle\" were subpoenaed to appear before a state grand jury, sources told CNN.\n\nAsked previously about the grand jury subpoenas, Bannon's attorney Robert Costello told CNN: \"I am unaware of these matters.\"\n\nIn other schemes, sometimes known as \"scam PACs,\" prosecutors say the misdirection is often brazen. In one, a Maryland political consultant took in donations for specific purposes to support candidates. Yet he never intended to spend the money on what was advertised, and instead put donations toward asking for more donations. He received a prison sentence of three years.\n\nIn another case announced last year, three men associated with PACs were accused of soliciting donations for 2016 presidential candidates, but the money went to benefit them personally. One of the three men has pleaded guilty.", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz", "Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/politics/donald-trump-dual-legal-blows-analysis/index.html", "title": "Trump: Dual legal blows hammer ex-President | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nA day of double legal blows undermined ex-President Donald Trump’s battle to avoid criminal action for hoarding classified documents and left him exposed to potential civil penalties targeting the business wealth on which his political mystique is built.\n\nTrump’s lifelong capacity to thwart accountability is now facing its sternest test as investigations and evidence mount against him. Trump has not been charged with any crimes, but the legal and court processes he is a master at delaying and twisting in procedural knots are now making serious headway.\n\nTwo huge developments on Wednesday crashed into Trump’s legal teams, which were already fighting off serious investigations on multiple fronts.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James unveiled an astonishing 200-page civil lawsuit that alleged that the Trump family empire was essentially built on years of grift and self-enrichment by deceiving lenders, insurers and tax authorities and dodging the laws that apply to every American. James is seeking the redress of $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds and sanctions that would severely crimp the Trump Organization’s capacity to do business and would effectively drive the former President and his family out of the city that made his name. Still, the case is a civil one and while James referred evidence to the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department, she could not make a criminal charge. Trump responded with fierce denials of wrongdoing and claims he was the victim of a “witch hunt.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:13 - Source: CNN See Trumps reaction to New York attorney general's lawsuit\n\nIn a crucial ruling in the case of highly sensitive material that Trump took to his Mar-a-Lago resort, an appeals court handed the Justice Department a victory by allowing it to look at documents marked as classified that were seized in a search by FBI agents last month. Three judges, including two appointed by Trump, ruled that the public has a strong interest in ensuring his retention of the material did not cause “exceptionally grave damage to the national security.” Given Trump’s record of seeking to delay investigations against him as long as possible, he could try another legal maneuver but his options are running out, with one of his only remaining possibilities being an emergency request to the US Supreme Court.\n\nA tightening web of investigation\n\nBoth developments appear to have widened Trump’s potential legal exposure, which now appears stark in at least three separate dramas that include a probe in Georgia into his alleged attempt to steal the 2020 election in the critical swing state. The ex-President has denied wrongdoing on all accounts.\n\nBut the deepening crisis for Trump also came on a day when the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection formally announced its first fall hearing for next week. The panel has yet to decide whether to make a recommendation for criminal action against the former President. The Justice Department already has its own separate grand jury probe into events surrounding his false election fraud claims and those leading up to the attack on the US Capital by his mob of supporters.\n\nThe darkening legal storm for Trump also bolsters the extraordinary possibility of a former President facing potential criminal action and serious civil penalties that could significantly threaten his fortune. Much of Trump’s initial political appeal is based on the idea that he is a wildly successful tycoon who built a hugely profitable business and amassed personal wealth. If it is proven that it is all a scam and that his career is a house of cards built on illegal acts, his narrative will absorb a serious hit – although it’s unlikely that would ever be enough to shake his appeal to his core voters.\n\nThe latest legal rebukes of Trump come as he considers a likely 2024 presidential campaign, which he has already signaled would be constructed on his claim that he is being politically persecuted by Democrats, and has already implicitly warned of violence if he is formally indicted.\n\n‘The art of the steal?’\n\nThe civil suit filed by New York state against Trump represents the broadest catalogue yet of the former President’s business practices and also targets three of his adult children – Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric, who are deeply involved in the Trump Organization.\n\nIt alleges a staggering pattern of overvaluing of properties and assets across Trump’s real estate portfolio, his hotel and golf club empires. The purported aim of the multiple schemes was to deceive lenders, insurance brokers and tax authorities to give him better loan conditions and to lower his tax liability. James alleged that each certification was personally signed off by Trump and that he played a direct role in falsifying valuations. In one case in her claim, James said that Trump inflated the size of his Trump Tower apartment from less than 11,000 square feet to more than 30,000 square feet to arrive at a value of $327 million. In another case, she claimed that Trump repeatedly inflated the value of an office building the organization owns at 40 Wall Street.\n\n“It is an enormous complaint, it is a robust complaint, it is filled with facts and it is very serious. And so Donald Trump and others named in the complaint are going to have their day in court to respond to this and try and seek to challenge it,” Geoffrey Berman, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN’s Erin Burnett.\n\n“It is formidable.”\n\nJames said that any regular citizen who had allegedly committed such acts would have the book thrown at them. She argued that not pursuing the case would mean there would be two justice systems, one for working people and one for the rich and the powerful.\n\n“There cannot be different rules for different people in this country or this state,” James said.\n\nHer remarks took direct aim at the conceit behind Trump’s entire political narrative – that he’s an outsider fighting for everyday Americans against a system that favors elites.\n\n‘Corporate death penalty’\n\nThe penalties that James is seeking against Trump in what is likely to be a protracted case have the potential to at the very least severely limit the capacity of the business to operate, especially in the US financial capital.\n\n“She is seeking what corporate lawyers call the corporate death penalty, which would be decertification of the Trump Organization so they couldn’t even do business in New York anymore,” CNN legal analyst Paul Callan told Anderson Cooper.\n\n“It’s a very, very serious penalty if the AG wins the suit.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 03:14 - Source: CNN Watch New York AG announce lawsuit against Trump\n\nIn a sign that Trump’s defense could be an uphill task, James said that he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In a civil case, as opposed to a criminal one, prosecutors have the right to ascribe an adverse inference to such a step.\n\nJames, a Democrat, went out of her way to insist that there was no political motivation behind her case and that other corporations had faced similar censure.\n\nBut James has created some openings for Trump to accuse her of political bias. She had publicly said before taking office that she believed that the then-President could be indicted. And the almost taunting use of Trump’s slogan in her presentation unveiling the lawsuit did appear somewhat triumphalist. “Claiming money that you do not have does not amount to the ‘art of the deal,’” she said. “It’s the art of the steal.”\n\nTrump quickly responded to the lawsuit by calling it a witchhunt – his well-worn tactic of dismissing any attempt to force him to face accountability. Trump may try to argue that his business was adopting the same business practices as others in New York and that he is being unfairly singled out as a former President and potential future candidate.\n\nStill, the evidence unveiled in the lawsuit could spiral in unexpected directions in other jurisdictions – even if it does not result in a criminal case against the Trump Organization – that could threaten the business’ financial viability.\n\nAnother blow in the classified documents case\n\nThe Justice Department’s victory in the 11th Circuit represents another legal blow to Trump because it targets the idea that he’s immune from rules pertaining to classified information.\n\nThe appeals court did not just partially stay a lower court’s ruling to halt the DOJ’s review of 100 classified documents taken from Mar-a-Lago, which officials say are government property and could expose US intelligence sources and methods and even put covert US assets at risk overseas. The ruling also obliterated the argument of the Trump legal team that the former President may have declassified the documents as president.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:35 - Source: CNN Attorney breaks down why Trump couldn't declassify documents by 'thinking about it'\n\n“The record contains no evidence that any of these records were declassified. And before the special master, Plaintiff resisted providing any evidence that he had declassified any of these documents,” the ruling said, referring to the third-party official appointed by a lower court to go through the documents taken in the search.\n\nNick Akerman, a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on CNN Wednesday that the 11th Circuit gutted Trump’s case, expressing doubt that that the Supreme Court would take the case up if it got that far.\n\n“Donald Trump had no proper interest in classified documents; there is no way he ever has the right to get this information or see it. That really is the underlying basis of this whole opinion,” he said.\n\nThe political fallout\n\nAs always, when Trump faces a legal threat, the question arises whether he will face a political price.\n\nThe former President has spent years seeking to discredit any institution, including the courts, that takes him on. He bashes them as biased, corrupt and a tool of liberal persecution. He has also specifically targeted James, accusing her of racism against him. Such demagoguery is now a critical tool of his political brand. At rallies, he tells supporters that he is willing to be persecuted to shield them.\n\nThere is little chance the former President’s base will turn on him. Still, yet more damaging allegations of Trump’s behavior are unlikely to help his already diminished standing with general election voters who voted him out of office in 2020. And the pressure of yet another serious legal threat cannot help but weigh on his mind as he contemplates another White House run.\n\nHowever, the reality that sitting presidents enjoy protections against criminal action may appear even more attractive to Trump now. And if he doesn’t run in 2024, it would make it more difficult for the former President to claim he is being politically victimized.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2020/06/24/larry-nassar-usa-gymnastics-scandal-still-ripples-four-years-later/3248714001/", "title": "Four years later, how the Larry Nassar and USA Gymnastics ...", "text": "Nearly four years ago, the Indianapolis Star published its first report, “Out of Balance,” on a sexual abuse scandal at USA Gymnastics. On Wednesday, Netflix is releasing a documentary, “Athlete A,” in which athletes and IndyStar journalists elaborate on the investigation.\n\nHere's what has happened since August 2016:\n\nLarry Nassar sentenced\n\nLarry Nassar, 56, a former U.S. gymnastics physician, is serving what is essentially a life sentence in prison.\n\nHe was accused of assaulting at least 250 women and girls dating back to 1992. He was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison in July 2017, to 175 years in a Michigan state prison in January 2018, and to 40 to 125 years in state prison in February 2018. The state prison sentences are to run consecutively with his federal sentence.\n\n“I just signed your death warrant,” Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said at the January 2018 sentencing.\n\nRachael Denhollander was the first to allow her name to be used in IndyStar interviews about the case. She was cited by Michigan Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis during sentencing.\n\n“Without that first Indianapolis Star story in August 2016; without the story where Rachael came forward publicly shortly thereafter — he would still be practicing medicine, treating athletes and abusing kids. ... Let that sink in for a minute,” Povilaitis said.\n\nUSA Gymnastics files for bankruptcy\n\nIn December 2018, USA Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy protection, a move it said would help resolve lawsuits stemming from the Nassar case. The action was intended to preserve itself as a national governing body after the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) threatened to remove that status.\n\nSo many lawsuits\n\nThe legal fallout is complex and ongoing. However, resolution of a major case might be forthcoming.\n\nAs a result of a remotely held conference before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana last week, Judge Robin Moberly issued an order that could produce a settlement with the Nassar survivors committee.\n\nThe Indianapolis court is allowing three depositions to be taken of USOPC staff, and USA Gymnastics will file a new reorganization plan. The survivors committee, USOPC, USA Gymnastics and insurance carriers were ordered to participate in remote mediation sometime between July 27 and Aug. 14. Ten days before the mediation date, the survivors committee, USOPC and insurance carriers are to submit a settlement offer, not to be disclosed.\n\nAttorneys had filed a motion opposing a protective order sought by the USOPC to block testimony in the Nassar case. The motion stated the USOPC “seeks to quietly hide in the periphery of this bankruptcy\" in hopes claimants would tire of the process and accept a settlement without the USOPC \"disclosing any facts whatsoever related to its liabilities.”\n\nIn January, USA Gymnastics filed a reorganization plan in response to a motion filed on behalf of survivors to dismiss bankruptcy protection. The plan offered two options: survivors as a group may vote to accept $217 million to settle all claims, or vote to continue to pursue lawsuits and collect judgments from insurance policies.\n\nJohn Manly, attorney for more than 200 survivors, called the proposed settlement “unconscionable.” Jon Little, an Indianapolis attorney who also represents survivors, told IndyStar that $217 million is a “starting point,” but not nearly enough. He said money should be set aside for those filing future claims.\n\nBottom line: The USOPC and insurers have the money, and USA Gymnastics does not. So the two sides facing off are the survivors committee and USOPC, whose financial position has been damaged by the pandemic and whose reserves could be depleted by cancellation of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nSteve Penny out on bond\n\nSteve Penny, former president of USA Gymnastics, pleaded not guilty in a Texas courtroom in October 2018 to a charge of tampering with evidence in the Nassar case. If convicted, Penny faces two to 10 years in prison.\n\nHe was accused of destroying or hiding documents related to Nassar’s activities at the Karolyi ranch, the former national training center outside Huntsville, Texas. He was freed after posting $20,000 bond. He had been arrested in Gatlinburg, Tenn., where his attorney said he was on a family vacation trip.\n\nPenny first learned of allegations against Nassar in July 2015, more than a year before the Rio Olympics. In Rio, the United States won nine medals in women’s gymnastics (the most by one country since the Soviet Union in 1972) and an unprecedented second straight team gold.\n\nRather than alert authorities in 2015, Penny hired an outside firm to investigate. He resigned from USA Gymnastics in March 2017. The day after his arrest, he was placed on the “permanently ineligible” list by USA Gymnastics.\n\nIn February 2019, USA Gymnastics hired Li Li Leung as president and CEO, becoming the fourth to hold that position in a period of 23 months. She remains CEO. Previous CEOs were Kerry Perry and Mary Bono, who resigned four days after her appointment.\n\nSimone Biles outraged\n\nImagine a sport alienating its biggest star. That is what has happened with gymnastics and Simone Biles, arguably the greatest athlete in the sport’s history.\n\nFor the first time in a public court filing, Biles identified herself as a plaintiff in the civil case involving USA Gymnastics and the USOPC.\n\n“It's hard coming here for an organization, having had them fail us so many times,” Biles told reporters at the 2019 national championships.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported USA Gymnastics withheld the investigation of Nassar’s sexual abuse from Biles. When USA Gymnastics approached the FBI in Indianapolis in 2015, Biles was in town doing promotional appearances for the upcoming nationals.\n\n“Can’t tell you how hard this is to read and process. The pain is real and doesn’t just go away...especially when new facts are still coming out,” Biles posted on Twitter.\n\nKarolyi Ranch closes\n\nUSA Gymnastics used the ranch owned by Bela and Martha Karolyi from 2000 to 2018 for its national training center. The Karolyis filed suit against USA Gymnastics, seeking damages for the canceled sale of their gymnastics facility and declarations that they are not liable for Nassar’s actions. Critics complained of a “toxic culture” at the ranch.\n\nAfter using gyms in Sarasota, Fla., and Crossville, Tenn., USA Gymnastics designated an Indianapolis facility as interim training center. The Gymnastics Company is on the southeast side at 5646 Mutual Lane.\n\nCreation of SafeSport\n\nThe U.S. Center for SafeSport launched in 2017 to address child abuse in sport. In February 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act, an attempt to amend a patchwork of state laws by requiring adults who interact with amateur athletes to report suspected abuse to law enforcement within 24 hours. Statute of limitations is not to begin until a victim realizes the abuse.\n\nSafeSport was created to collate a central database. The program has been criticized as being underfunded and not independent of the USOPC.\n\nContact IndyStar reporter David Woods at david.woods@indystar.com.

One retired Army captain created a color-coded map that purportedly shows where there was rampant fraud during the election.\n\n\"Elections Expert Seth Keshel Releases National Fraud Numbers: Finds 8.1 Million Excess Votes in US Election, Affirms Trump Won PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ, GA and MN,\" reads the headline of an Aug. 2 article from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website that has repeatedly published false claims about voter fraud.\n\nThe article, which accumulated nearly 13,000 shares within four days, cites an Aug. 2 post from Keshel on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app popular with far-right extremists.\n\nFact check:Arizona early votes falsely cited as evidence of voter fraud\n\nThe post includes a table that purportedly shows the number of \"excess Biden votes\" in all 50 states. Based on a \"trend analysis of population growth, voter behavior and party registration,\" Keshel concluded that more than 8.1 million excess votes for President Joe Biden were counted in the election.\n\n\"Trump won: PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ, GA, MN,\" Keshel wrote in the post, which was viewed more than 170,000 times within five days. Former President Donald Trump shared those findings in an Aug. 3 statement.\n\nBut Trump didn't win any of the states Keshel said he did.\n\nElection experts say Keshel's analysis is bogus, and other independent fact-checking organizations have debunked it. There is no evidence to support the figures in the Telegram post, nor is there evidence of any widespread voter fraud affecting the 2020 election outcome. Biden won the election with 306 electoral votes.\n\nFact check:Conspiracy theory falsely says Biden arrested in plot to make Trump president\n\n\"Keshel is promoting a bizarre and unfounded conspiracy about the 2020 election,\" Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in an email.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Gateway Pundit for comment.\n\nTable of excess votes is 'meaningless'\n\nThe Gateway Pundit billed Keshel as an \"elections data expert\" whose \"investigation\" came up with a conservative estimate of voter fraud in 2020. But there's no evidence his Telegram post is based in fact.\n\n\"It’s not clear precisely what Keshel has done to create this 'trend analysis,'\" Charles Stewart, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email. \"So as far as I can tell, he’s just pulling numbers out of the air.\"\n\nIn a Facebook message to USA TODAY, Keshel declined to provide additional evidence to support his claims.\n\n\"If I sent everyone information, I'd get nothing done,\" he said.\n\nIn its fact check debunking Keshel's claims, the Associated Press wrote that Keshel identified himself on LinkedIn as a technology company sales manager and former baseball analyst. His profile, which USA TODAY could not find online, did not mention election experience, according to the AP.\n\nWithout seeing Keshel's sources and methods, election experts told USA TODAY it's impossible to verify his table.\n\n\"If I infer he’s comparing Biden’s numbers to Trump’s, and Trump’s 2020 numbers to 2016, then we need to see the full model he’s using,\" Stewart said. \"A rigorous statistical model would have explicit measures, reported parameters, and confidence intervals, none of which I see here.\"\n\nModeling aside, Keshel's claims aren't supported by vote totals from the election. Biden won each of the states Keshel says he lost.\n\nFact check:False comparison drawn between California, Arizona signature matching\n\nThat's according to Electoral College votes certified by Congress in January. Biden flipped several states that went for Trump in 2016, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The race was closer in states that tend to vote Republican, including Arizona and Georgia, but multiple recounts in those states affirmed Biden's win. The race was not similarly close in Nevada or Minnesota.\n\n\"Keshel's table as posted on Telegram is meaningless and therefore, meritless,\" Lorraine Minnite, an associate professor at Rutgers University-Camden and author of \"The Myth of Voter Fraud,\" said in an email. \"Without more information about his data and analytical methods, the table shows nothing.\"\n\nNo evidence of widespread fraud\n\nDesipite Keshel's claim that there were millions of excess votes counted for Biden, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud affecting the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nFor there to be voter fraud on the scale that Keshel claims – 8.1 million excess votes for Biden – it stands to reason that Democrats would have performed well in other races, too. But they didn't.\n\n\"Biden won the national popular vote by a margin that is not surprising or out of line with other recent elections,\" Burden said. \"Republicans did quite well in other races, making gains in the House of Representatives, governorships and state legislatures.\"\n\nMore:'Just say that the election was corrupt': Handwritten notes show Trump pushed DOJ to back voter fraud claims\n\nOfficials from both parties at every level of government have repeatedly refuted claims of widespread voter fraud affecting the 2020 election results.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and its partners said the election was the \"most secure in American history.\" Former Attorney General William Barr repeatedly dismissed claims of fraud from Trump and others, saying there was no evidence to support them. Several hand recounts and audits in battleground states across the country reaffirmed Biden's victory. And dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies to overturn the election results failed.\n\n\"There is no convincing evidence that fraud produced a substantial number of invalid votes for any candidate in 2020,\" Burden said.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that more than 8 million excess Biden votes were counted during the 2020 election. Keshel has refused to provide evidence to support the figures in his Telegram post, and election experts who reviewed the post say its figures are baseless. Certified vote totals show Biden beat Trump in each state Keshel said he lost.

We don’t know whether … they even know that they won a prize.

Get organized and make a plan. Consider staying anonymous, if it’s a possibility.”\n\nInterest rates rising:Why does the Fed raise interest rates? And how do those hikes slow inflation?\n\nMake an offer:As housing cools, some buyers get a second chance to grab their first choice\n\nHow much is the jackpot, when is the drawing, what are my chances of winning?\n\nThe $1.02 billion prize is for winners who choose the annuity option, paid annually over 30 years. Most winners opt for the cash option, which for the next drawing Friday night is an estimated $602.5 million.\n\nThe single chance of matching all six numbers is roughly 1 in 303 million. Mega Millions tickets – which cost $2 each – are sold in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nWhy shouldn’t you tell everyone?\n\nScammers.\n\n“Some of those scammers have falsely identified themselves as being affiliated with Mega Millions,” Mega Millions said. “These scams all have one thing in common: They try to trick you into sending them money or personal information by claiming that you have won a large lottery prize.”\n\nNo representative of Mega Millions would ever call, text, or email anyone about winning a prize, Mega Millions said.\n\nDON'T GET CONNED:Stay alert against financial scams\n\nWINNING:‘We did it again’: Maryland mom wins $100K jackpot for third time in five years\n\nAlso remember, \"no real lottery tells winners to put up their own money in order to collect a prize they have already won,\" it said.\n\nSteve Azoury, owner of Azoury Financial in Troy, Michigan, said he has advised many lottery winners, including a $181 million winner \"who said ‘If I didn’t know you before, I don’t want to know you now.’”\n\nIf you can’t tell everyone you won, what can, or should you do?\n\n“Get a tax attorney and a tax accountant right off the bat and then a financial advisor,” said Azoury. “They’ll work hand in hand to figure out the plan.”\n\nThe plan will include which payout option to choose:\n\nAn annuity option makes an initial annual payment followed by 29 annual payments. Each payment is 5% larger than the previous one.\n\nThe cash option is a one-time, lump-sum payment equal to all the cash in the Mega Millions jackpot prize pool.\n\nThe plan also should include a “fall guy,” Azoury said. “That’s the person or adviser who keeps you from giving loans to anybody, who tells people all the money’s tied up in investments, not available. We have nothing available to help you out and we’re not interested in your project.”\n\nREGULAR PAYOUTS:Are annuities safe in a recession? Sales are surging, here's what to know\n\nSLIM ODDS:7 things more likely to happen than winning the Powerball or Mega Millions lottery\n\nShould you take the lump sum or installment payments?\n\nThat decision depends on your goals, your age, and what lottery rules are for beneficiaries to continue receiving payments, or if you’d likely squander a lump sum.\n\nMark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt, recommends considering the following:\n\nSize of the lottery winning: That can serve as a guide to determining taxes you may owe and the financial security you can derive from it. If the amount is on the smaller side, a lump sum may simply be easier.\n\nCurrent and projected earnings: Consider your ability to earn money and tax rates over your lifetime.\n\nEASY GAMBLING:Online lottery tickets put Texans’ most-played games a touch away\n\nDIFFERENT GAMBLE:'He won the lottery': Ohio 13-year-old sells Mac Jones football card for $100,000\n\nHow much do you bring home?\n\nThat depends on how you decide to take your money and complex state laws.\n\nIf you win the Mega Millions lottery, you’ll likely be propelled into the highest federal tax bracket. Your state of residency and where you bought the winning ticket can greatly impact what you pay in state taxes.\n\nFor example, if you’re a California resident and purchase your ticket there, then you pay the 37% federal tax rate but are in luck because California doesn't tax lottery winnings, Steber said.\n\nNew York, though, has the highest tax rate on lottery winnings.\n\n.\n\nBut, if you’re a California resident on vacation in Rhode Island and decide to buy a ticket there, you’ll have to include your lottery winnings on your federal and California tax returns and file a nonresident Rhode Island tax return for your jackpot. You should claim a tax credit for the Rhode Island taxes on your California return so you won't be double-taxed on the same income in two states, he said.\n\n“This is where a tax professional really comes in handy,” Steber said. “State taxes can be very tricky.” (Just to show how complicated state taxes can be and why you really should enlist a professional, Steber originally said in this story California would tax your lottery winnings if you're a resident there. He has helped clarify this for our update.)\n\nTAXING:Senate Dems say boosting taxes on higher income earners will extend Medicare solvency\n\nA MILLION MISTAKE:Man claims $1 million Mega Millions prize from ticket he says was a 'mistake'\n\n\"How long does it take to get your money if you win the Mega Millions?\"\n\nOnce you claim the prize, it shouldn’t take too long, Azoury said. “Maybe a couple of weeks,” he said.\n\nRemember, most people won’t claim their winnings right away because they'll take time to set their plan. Claim periods vary by jurisdiction so people should check with the lottery in the state where the ticket was purchased to get the applicable claim period for that ticket.\n\nMega Millions claim periods range from 90 days to one year from the draw date, the lottery said.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

The New York Islanders purchased $50,000 worth of tickets. The CEO of Raising Cane’s shelled out $100,000 to buy tickets for employees. And, hours before the drawing, hundreds of people waited in line to buy tickets at a \"lucky\" liquor store in Hawthorne, California.\n\nBy Saturday morning, the line for the lotto machine at the Des Plaines Speedway was so long that it snaked around the store, said Lisa Lepore, 61. Lepore said she works as a bus driver and regularly fuels up at the location, next to O'Hare International Airport.\n\nWhen she heard the news early Saturday, Lepore wondered if one of her coworkers had become rich overnight, she said.\n\n\"I hope that somebody who needs it really wins it because it would be a game-changer for them,\" she said.\n\nAs Lepore spoke, others trickled past the machine, sandwiched between the ice cream freezer on one side and the donut case and beef jerky stand on the other. Some scanned old tickets. Others purchased new ones. The small trash can on the ground overflowed with discarded paper strips and scratch-off cards.\n\nOther customers – many dawning airline uniforms – purchased milkshakes and cigarettes, and employees sold pizza and reloaded coffee machines.\n\nDon Barrett, 64, stopped at the Speedway while getting gas and slipped a bill into the lotto machine.\n\n\"I thought I'd try my luck,\" Barrett said. \"I didn't even know it was this location.

Today, the latest from UN meetings as much of the world condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Plus a closer look at rising interest rates and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nHurricane Fiona hit Turks and Caicos yesterday as a Category 3. Puerto Rico is still working to recover with more than a million homes and businesses still without power yesterday. A day after more than 200 whales were found stranded in Tasmania, only 35 were alive earlier today. It's not clear what led the animals to wash up on the Australian Island. And two people have finally claimed the ticket to the third largest jackpot lottery win in US history. They came forward in Illinois, nearly two months after the mega millions $1.34 billion winning ticket was announced.\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden yesterday strongly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and for the world to stand behind efforts against the aggression. In an address to the United Nations, he also called Russian leader Vladimir Putin reckless for making veiled nuclear threats.\n\nPresident Joe Biden:\n\nA permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase the sovereign state from the map. Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenants of the United Nations Charter. No more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force. Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime. Now, Russia's calling up more soldiers to join the fight and the Kremlin is organizing a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the UN Charter.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBiden's comments came after Putin accused the West of nuclear blackmail. He said, \"Those who are attempting to blackmail us with nuclear weapons must be aware that the prevailing winds may also turn towards their side.\"\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also addressed the UN yesterday. He even got a standing ovation.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy:\n\nMankind and the international law are stronger than one terrorist state. Russia will be forced to end this war. We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms, but we need time.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has made no serious effort to negotiate an end to the war, accusations also thrown toward Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, a pair of Americans fighting for Ukraine have been freed in a prisoner exchange after being captured in June. Saudi Arabia brokered a swap with Russian-backed separatists featuring other prisoners too, including five British nationals.\n\nIn Russia, protests have sparked this week across the country with more than 1400 arrests made in 38 cities nationwide. Activists are protesting the government's latest plan to call some 300,000 citizens into military service. Russia passed a law in February that makes it a criminal offense punished by up to 15 years in prison to discredit the military. Russia has used the law to stamp out dissent to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n♦\n\nArizona's Secretary of State races are usually sleepy campaigns, but this year's contest will take the national spotlight when the two major party contenders clash in their first debate tonight. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with national political correspondent, Phillip Bailey for a preview of what's to come.\n\nPhillip Bailey:\n\nThe past two years, our country has been unusually consumed by the last election, the 2020 presidential election due to these continued and persistent lies about who won the 2020 election. Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential race. Yet we see this growth of election deniers, about more than 300 or so who are running for some pretty serious public offices here in 2022, including secretaries of state. We wrote last year, USA TODAY, about this proliferation and this coalition of \"America first\" secretaries of state candidates who are running in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, some really important swing states. People who have denied the outcome of the 2020 election who are now running to oversee the next election, and probably more so than any of them, Mark Finchem of Arizona is the face of that movement.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo what should people be looking for in this specific debate in Arizona, which takes place tonight?\n\nPhillip Bailey:\n\nI think look, Mark Finchem, the Republican candidate for Secretary of State in Arizona, is running against the Democrat, Adrian Fontes. The Fontes campaign has leaned heavily into the election denial claims by representative Finchem, they have not shied away from it. If you notice Mr. Fontes's first campaign ad of this race, he talks about being a Marine and he uses footage from the January 6th riots. He goes after Finchem and calls him a radical and extremist. He's the first sort of person who's going to have a debate here where Democrats and others are saying democracy itself is on the line. Now, obviously other issues like inflation, the economy, and abortion have taken the forefront. But in these secretaries of state races, in particular, voting rights and election denialism is going to be at the forefront. What I'm looking forward to see is how aggressive Fontes is and is he going to be sort of a rallying cry to remind Democrats and voting rights advocates around the country of what's at stake in 2022.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo how can those that are not living in Arizona watch this?\n\nPhillip Bailey:\n\nThese secretary of state races, PJ, are typically very sleepy affairs. A lot of people even in state don't necessarily pay attention to their secretary of state race, but this is going to seize national attention. Obviously, the Arizona Republic will be paying attention to this, along with USA TODAY through our websites. Obviously, the Arizona PBS is hosting the debates, so it's going to be on their website. But for national audiences, C-SPAN is probably the best way to watch. This is going to be nationally broadcast. Like I said, usually, these races are sort of a snooze fest and they're very anonymous. People are like, \"Who's running for secretary of state.\" This year's going to be different, not just in Arizona, but in Nevada and Michigan and many other key states. Secretary of state races are going to be at the forefront and we're going to be watching them pretty much in the same way we watch gubernatorial or senate races.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find Phillip's full story in today's episode description.\n\n♦\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is being accused of mass fraud in a lawsuit this week. New York Attorney General Letitia James yesterday accused him of padding his net worth by billions of dollars and misleading banks about his assets.\n\nLetitia James:\n\nWe are filing a lawsuit against Donald Trump for violating the law as part of his efforts to generate profits for himself, his family, and his company. The pattern of fraud and deception that was used by Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization for their own financial benefit is astounding.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYesterday's lawsuit filed in state court in Manhattan is the culmination of a three-year civil investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization. His three oldest children, Donald Jr, Ivanka, and Eric, were also named as defendants along with two longtime company executives. In more than 200 pages, the suit alleges dozens of instances of fraud. They include claims made on annual financial statements as proof of his riches as he looked for loans and deals. In one example, he said to have claimed his Trump Tower apartment was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. The Attorney General said no New York City apartment has ever sold for close to that amount. James said the investigation also found evidence of potential criminal violations, including insurance fraud and bank fraud, but she said her office was referring those findings to outside authorities.\n\n♦\n\nThe Federal Reserve has announced that it's raising interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point again for the third consecutive time. So how will that hit your wallet and portfolio? PJ Elliott spoke with money reporter, Medora Lee for some answers.\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nSo when the Fed raises interest rates, it doesn't actually raise consumer rates, but it raises what is considered its Fed funds rate. It's a benchmark, interest rate, and all other consumer rates will eventually follow in a ripple effect through the economy. When the Fed raises rates, you should expect mortgage rates to rise. If you're already locked into a fixed mortgage rate, you probably don't have to worry, your rate will just remain the same where you locked it in. But if you haven't bought a home yet, you should expect those rates to be higher, so you'll have to weigh more carefully whether you can afford this house now because your monthly payments will be bigger and weigh how much you want the house because you'll be paying more.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo what about credit cards? How is that going to be affected?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nThat's probably going to be very huge because credit cards notoriously already have very high rates. And I think that with every rate hike that comes credit card rates will rise even more. Already they're almost like 20% or something on some of these credit cards. So with credit cards, you should probably be looking to stop spending so much on your credit card and if you can find credit cards with lower interest rates. A lot of credit card companies are still offering 0% balance transfers, so you should really take advantage of that. Usually, they'll give you 0% on your credit card for something like 18 months or something. And during that, if you transfer your balance, you can start paying down your principal right away before the rate shoots up. So just make sure you don't spend any more on that card though because your goal is to lower your debt not increase it.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nYes, absolutely. So let's talk about savings and stocks now, how are those affected by a Fed rate hike?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nSo the stock market is going to be tough. I mean, they're always going to be some companies that can weather this. But basically though higher interest rates kind of slows down the entire economy and it makes borrowing more expensive for consumers and for businesses. So for their business investments, they'll be paying more if they have to take out a loan. And then they get a little bit of a whammy from consumers if they have to pay more for their money as well, they may not buy as much of whatever it is you're selling or serving. So this could really hurt the stock market a lot. Generally, the high-growth companies like tech companies are the first to feel it because they generally spend a lot of money now for future growth. If they have to pay more for that money now that'll hurt your future growth.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnother powerful earthquake has hit Mexico, this time with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8. The quake hit early this morning in the western state of Michoacan near the Pacific Coast. That comes just three days after a 7.6 magnitude quake shook western and central parts of the country, killing at least two people. That was the third major earthquake to strike the country on September 19th, following previous ones in 1985 and more recently in 2017. Those September 19th quakes came right around when the country was doing its annual earthquake drill conducted every year to mark the 1985 tragedy that killed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

But this one, with all the rain, it just destroyed everything in the house. Gov. Pierluisi also told CNN Monday that damage on the island is mostly rain-related.\n\nBy midday Monday, about 1,000 people in Puerto Rico had been rescued by emergency crews, said Maj. Gen. José Reyes, adjutant general of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n\nThe \"catastrophic rain that won't stop\" is \"the biggest challenge\" for responders, Federal Emergency Management Agency Coordingating Officer Robert Little told CNN's Erin Burnett Monday evening.\n\n\"The first responders, the local responders, the responders of the government of Puerto Rico, are not able to get out and help those that needed or access the damage like they would like to do,\" he added.\n\nCars and buildings are partially submerged in Puerto Rico, which remains lagely without power.\n\nIntense rain was expected to produce more mudslides and catastrophic flooding through Monday night.\n\nOne hundred first responders from New York will head to the US territory to help as soon as weather allows, Pierluisi said, adding that the governors of New Jersey and California have also pledged to send help.\n\nFiona made landfall Monday morning in the Dominican Republic after crossing onto land a day earlier in southwestern Puerto Rico.\n\nStill, Puerto Rico remains almost entirely under flash flood or flood warnings -- nearly five years to the day after Hurricane Maria devastated the territory.\n\nOne area north of the city of Ponce reported over 2 feet of rain in 24 hours.\n\nRescues were underway Monday in the western Puerto Rican municipalities of Mayaguez and Hormigueros, officials said. The Guanajibo River in Hormigueros surpassed its previous record height set during Maria.\n\nMeanwhile, southern Puerto Rico can expect another 4 to 8 inches of rain or more early this week -- meaning Fiona will leave the island deluged with 12 to 30 inches of rain, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across Puerto Rico,\" the center said.\n\nAt least one death was reported in the heavily-damaged city of Basse-Terre , the capitol of the French territory of Guadeloupe, the vice president of the territory's environmental agency said.\n\nFiona could become a major hurricane by Wednesday, with winds reaching 111 mph . That would make Fiona the first major hurricane of the year in the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMassive power outages cripple Puerto Rico\n\nA house is deluged Sunday in Cayey, Puerto Rico. Three people inside the home were reportedly rescued.\n\nJust 115,000 out of 1.4 million customers on the island currently have power, Pierluisi said Monday evening. The entire island was in the dark early Monday, PowerOutage.us reported.\n\nAnd it could be days before power is restored, the main power utility in Puerto Rico said Sunday, as daily high temperatures after Monday are forecast to reach the mid-80s to 90s.\n\nSeveral transmission line outages contributing to the blackout, LUMA Energy said. Power will be restored \"gradually,\" Pierluisi said in a Facebook post.\n\nOnly 35% of customers are getting water services because water filtration plants are being impacted by the river flooding and excess rain, the governor said.\n\nHurricane evacuees take refuge at a public school in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico.\n\nBy late Monday morning, a bit of good news from island's capital: The power system came back up for hospitals in San Juan's medical complex, Puerto Rico Health Secretary Dr. Carlos Mellado López said. The complex is the island's most important and stretches across 227 acres, according to the Health Administration of Puerto Rico.\n\n\"The power system at all the hospitals in the Medical Center Complex has been restored,\" Mellado tweeted Sunday night. \"Our patients are safe and receiving the medical care they need.\"\n\nFiona's latest path\n\nIntense rainfall will continue producing mudslides, landslides and catastrophic flooding across Puerto Rico through Monday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFiona could intensify as it moves across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe hurricane slammed the Dominican Republic community of Boca de Yuma early Monday, whipping maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm knocked 59 aqueducts out of service, leaving more than 1 million people in the Dominican Republic without running water, according to Jose Luis German Mejia, an emergency management official. At least 54 homes have been reported damaged so far, said Juan Manuel Mendez, the country's emergency management director of operations.\n\nEmergency officials have transported 789 people to safety, Mendez said at a storm briefing Monday. More than 500 people are housed in 29 shelters, he said.\n\nTen electric circuits are offline currently, but officials did not have an exact number of how many customers were without power.\n\n\"This is still an emergency event,\" and the storm is still affecting the country, said Mejia.\n\nLife-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding is forecast for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic through early Tuesday, the hurricane center said.\n\nFiona could also dump 10 inches of rain in the eastern and northern parts of the country, according to the center.\n\nAs Fiona moves away from the Dominican Republic's northern coast, it's expected to intensify as it moves north over warm water.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected in the southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday, and Fiona is expected to impact the eastern Turks and Caicos on Tuesday morning.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said Monday evening.\n\n\"Fiona will continue turning northward and then northeastward this week, nearing Bermuda on Friday as a major hurricane,\" CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nYet another widespread calamity\n\nPower outages have become a familiar crisis for many who live in Puerto Rico. Just five months ago, residents suffered another islandwide blackout after a fire broke out in a power plant.\n\nSome parts of the island still bear the scars of Maria, which inflicted catastrophic infrastructure damage ; it took almost a year for power to be restored across the island.\n\nSamuel Rivera and his mother Lourdes Rodriguez lived without power for about a year after Maria, Rivera told CNN. On Sunday morning, they lost power once again, conjuring up similar fears to those they had five years ago.\n\nThey were also concerned a nearby river might overflow and trees surrounding their home could be felled by the powerful winds, they said.\n\nRushing waters easily wiped away a bridge , carrying its structure downstream, one video of the dangerous flooding shows. Elsewhere in the city of Arecibo, quickly moving waters overtook large construction vehicles and entire trees as rain fell in sheets, another video by Samuel De Jesús shows.\n\nMany rivers on the eastern side of the island were at moderate to major flood stages Sunday afternoon, including one southeastern river which rose over 12 feet in less than seven hours.\n\nUS President Joe Biden early Sunday approved an emergency declaration to provide federal assistance to disaster relief efforts.\n\nMore than 300 FEMA emergency workers were on the ground to respond to the crisis, said Anne Bink, FEMA's associate administrator for Response and Recovery.\n\n\"Our heart goes out to the residents that again are going through another catastrophic event five years later,\" Bink said, nodding to Maria. This time, she said, FEMA plans to implement lessons learned from the 2017 crisis.\n\n\"We were much more prepared. We have four warehouses now strategically located throughout the island, which includes commodities, exponentially larger supplies than in the past,\" Bink said.\n\n\"We're proactively there -- and well ahead of any storm hitting -- to make sure that we are coordinating. And all of the planning efforts we undertake during those blue skies days can be brought to bear when the rain falls.\"\n\nBiden told Gov. Pierluisi in a Tuesday call that he would \"ensure that the Federal team remains on the job to get it done, especially given that Puerto Rico is still recovering from the damage of Hurricane Maria five years ago this week,\" a readout of the call said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe", "Holly Yan", "Melissa Alonso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/08/26/tropical-depression-9-could-become-hurricane-ida/5598203001/", "title": "Powerful Tropical Storm Ida prompts hurricane watch for Gulf Coast", "text": "Tropical Storm Ida had maximum sustained winds of about 40 mph Thursday afternoon as it formed near Jamaica.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said the system will undergo \"rapid intensification\" and be \"near major hurricane strength when it approaches the northern Gulf coast on Sunday.\"\n\nThe depression is forecast to deliver anywhere from 6 to 12 inches of rain over parts of Jamaica, Cuba and the Cayman islands.\n\nHurricane watches were issued for several Gulf Coast states Friday morning as Tropical Storm Ida, which formed in the Caribbean Sea, barreled toward the southern U.S. with forecasters warning it could rapidly strengthen into one of the strongest storms of the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe warnings were issued along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, including New Orleans, Mississippi and parts of the Alabama coastline. A tropical storm watch was also issued along parts of the Alabama coastline to the Florida border.\n\nA tropical storm warning for the Cayman Islands was discontinued Friday morning but remains in effect for two of the islands: Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.\n\nThe system is taking aim at the U.S. Gulf Coast, but conditions appear right for the storm to cause extreme weather for inland regions as well, according to a Thursday afternoon AccuWeather briefing. Senior meteorologist Dan Kottlowski said parts of Tennessee still reeling from deadly floods are at risk for more heavy rain.\n\nThe storm is shaping up to be \"probably be the strongest storm of the season thus far,” Kottlowski said. It could make landfall before the end of the weekend as a hurricane, giving people in its path little time to prepare or evacuate, Kottlowski said.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. EDT Friday, the storm was located about 75 miles north-northwest of the Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean Sea and was moving northwest at about 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said the system will undergo \"rapid intensification.\" When the system reaches the northern Gulf Coast on Sunday, the Hurricane Center predicts it will be \"at or near major hurricane intensity.\"\n\nThe Hurricane Center defines \"major hurricanes\" as Category 3 or higher. Category 3 storms have winds of 111-129 mph and \"devastating damage will occur\" with storms of that strength.\n\nHurricane Grace made landfall on Mexico’s Gulf Coast as a Category 3 storm this month, but Kottlowski said this latest system has the potential to do more damage because of its potential inland effects in the U.S.\n\nThe Hurricane Center at 8 a.m. EDT Friday warned of hurricane-force winds, heavy rainfall and flooding Sunday and Monday with total rainfall accumulations of 8 to 16 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches possible from southeast Louisiana to coastal Mississippi and Alabama.\n\nSunday is 16 years to the day that Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi as a catastrophic Category 3 storm. Nearly 2,000 people died during Katrina and damage was reportedly $125 billion, according to the National Hurricane Center. It left about 80% of New Orleans underwater.\n\nDonald Jones, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana said people living across the northern Texas coastline and Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama coastlines need to closely watch Ida forecasts.\n\n“This is going to turn into a very serious situation relatively quickly. We've only got two or three days here of the storm actually being over water before landfall, so this storm is forecast to intensify pretty rapidly.\"\n\nIda bringing heavy rain to western Tennessee is a “nightmare scenario,\" Kottlowski said.\n\nLast weekend, torrential rains sparked fast-rising floodwaters in the Waverly, Tennessee area, knocking homes off their foundations and killing at least 20 people, local and state officials reported.\n\nBoth the Cuban and Cayman governments have issued tropical storm warnings following the formation of Tropical Depression Nine, according to information on the website of the U.S. National Weather Service.\n\nThe depression is forecast to deliver anywhere from 6 to 12 inches of rain over parts of Jamaica, Cuba and the Cayman islands. Forecasters warned of possible flash floods and mudslides and a storm surge of as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal, along with “large and destructive waves.”\n\nContributing: Brad Schmitt, The Tennessean; Daniella Medina and Ashley White, Lafayette Daily Advertiser; Paul Singer, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/26"}]}

It was also used for the funerals of the Queen’s first prime minister, Winston Churchill, and her cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, the gun carriage will set off at 10:44 a.m. and be drawn by 142 Royal Naval Ratings, who are service personnel, according to the senior palace official.\n\nIt will then process on the short journey from New Palace Yard to Westminster Abbey, which will be lined by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. The procession will be led by a massed Pipes & Drums of Scottish and Irish Regiments, the Brigade of Gurkhas, and the Royal Air Force with musicians numbering 200 in total.\n\nThe King, royal family members, and members of both households of the monarch and Prince of Wales will follow directly behind the coffin.\n\nFor the journey, the coffin will be flanked by the bearer party, pallbearers found from service equerries to the Queen, in addition to detachments of The King’s Body Guards of The Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, The Yeomen of the Guard and the Royal Company of Archers.\n\nA view of the Great West Door at Westminster Abbey.

The queen's eldest son, Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor, 73, is now King Charles III of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the date for the formal coronation ceremony for the new king has not yet been announced.\n\nShortly after the queen was laid to rest, the royal family's official Twitter account shared a new photo of Queen Elizabeth II climbing a hill with a walking stick in one hand and a coat draped over the other. She looks off in the distance, wearing sunglasses and a head scarf, as lush greenery fills the landscape behind her.\n\nAlong with the photo, the account shared a quote from William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\": \"May flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest.\"\n\nQueen laid to rest alongside husband, Prince Philip\n\nThe queen was laid to rest in an intimate ceremony away from cameras in Windsor, where she was reunited with her husband and her parents.\n\nCharles and senior royal family members gathered late Monday for the private interment ceremony at St. George’s Chapel, a gothic church on the grounds of Windsor Castle that has hosted royal weddings, christenings and burials since the 15th century.\n\nIn contrast to the pomp and pageantry of her grand state funeral, royal officials said the queen's internment was a “deeply personal family occasion.” They said the queen was interred together with Prince Philip’s remains at the King George VI memorial chapel, an annex within St. George’s.\n\nWhen Philip, the queen's husband of 73 years, died last year, his coffin had been placed in a different part of St. George’s Chapel, ready to be moved to the memorial chapel to join the queen when she died.\n\nElizabeth II’s parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, were also interred there along with the ashes of Princess Margaret, the late monarch’s younger sister who died in 2002.\n\nSt. George's is the resting place of 10 former British monarchs, including Henry VIII and the beheaded Charles I. It is also the home of the Order of the Garter, an ancient order of chivalry founded by King Edward III in 1348.\n\nWestminster Abbey: See Queen Elizabeth at the iconic church where she was married, crowned, laid to rest\n\nSpeaking ill of the dead?:We can't ignore Queen Elizabeth's complicated legacy\n\nWhen will King Charles' coronation take place?\n\nCharles will be crowned probably within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned, following the death of her father King George VI. Queen Elizabeth II was 25 when she took the throne.\n\nMost people in the U.K. have never lived through such a momentous event. But there's little puzzlement in the royal palaces, in Parliament or the British government, and almost certainly none in Charles' mind.\n\nOpinion:King Charles III must do better than his mother on colonialism and reparations. Will he?\n\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out for decades, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication, traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a pandemic.\n\nThe queen's funeral was expected to draw millions of viewers\n\nThe state funeral, expected to be the biggest gathering of world leaders in years, drew millions of people to the streets of London and likely billions more to their TVs and computer screens. The funeral and events surrounding it were designed to help unite the royal family and divided subjects while helping ensure the monarchy survives another century.\n\nLondon’s mayor’s office said up to two million people were expected to line the streets as members of the royal family and hundreds of foreign dignitaries and heads of state descended on Westminster Abbey.

Today we said a final farewell to Her Majesty The Queen,” he wrote in the caption.\n\nSandra Oh attended the funeral at Westminster Abbey, posting several photos on Instagram, featuring the actress wearing mourning colors.\n\nAnd Elton John posted photos, too, remembering some moments he shared with the queen and noting she will be \"sorely missed.\"\n\n“My own memories of her are filled with joy and admiration,\" he wrote. The Queen honoured me with a CBE, a knighthood and the Companion of Honour. I was lucky enough to perform at three of her Jubilees. They were always joyous and humbling experiences. But it was the moments out of the public eye that I will most fondly remember her for.\"\n\nWhat is the committal service at Windsor Castle?\n\nThe queen headed to her final resting place in Windsor Castle where a committal service took place before she was lowered into the Royal Vault.\n\nThe committal service was conducted by the dean of Windsor, David Connor. Events include prayer and a choir performance at St George's chapel. Nearly 800 people were expected to attend, including royal family members, and the hymn, \"All My Hope on God is Founded,\" was performed.\n\nWhile the procession took place, the Imperial State Crown sat atop the queen’s coffin along with her scepter and orb.\n\nDuring the committal service, the crown, scepter and orb were removed from the top of the coffin. The items were placed on an altar at St. George’s Chapel, and marked the final separation of the late queen from her crown.\n\nThe “Wand of Office” was broken by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Andrew Parker. The breaking of the wand is a tradition in a sovereign’s funeral, according to The Independent, and hasn’t been seen since King George VI died in 1952.\n\nThe new king stood by quietly during the moments of farewell and appeared somber and a bit teary-eyed before his mother’s coffin was lowered into the vault.\n\nPast tears:Did Queen Elizabeth cry at Prince Philip's funeral?

They were also among early arrivals to St George's chapel for the committal service.\n\nAt the state funeral, Truss read a prayer from Bible’s John 14: 1-9.\n\nPrincess Kate, daughter Princess Charlotte honor the queen with poignant accessories\n\nMother and daughter duo Princess Kate and Princess Charlotte, who attended the state funeral, both wore simple black dresses topped with black overcoats, paired with black tights and black shoes. But their jewelry choices paid tribute to a beloved matriarch.\n\nPrincess Charlotte wore a dainty brooch on her coat in the shape of a horseshoe, a tribute to the queen, her great-grandmother, who had a lifelong passion for horses. The queen often attended races and was also a successful owner and breeder.\n\nPrincess Kate, the wife of Prince William, wore two pieces of jewelry that once belonged to her grandmother-in-law. She wore Bahrain Pearl Drop Earrings and a four-strand pearl choker necklace, both from the queen's collection, People reported.\n\nFuneral attire:Princess Kate, daughter Charlotte honor Queen Elizabeth with sweet details\n\nRoyals escort the queen's casket to Wellington Arch, Windsor Castle\n\nFollowing the funeral, the coffin – accompanied by units of the armed forces in dress uniforms and members of her family – was carried through the capital’s streets.\n\nAt Wellington Arch near Hyde Park, it was placed in a hearse and driven to Windsor Castle – where Elizabeth spent much of her time – for another procession before a committal service in St George’s Chapel. She will be laid to rest with her late husband, Prince Philip, at a private family service.\n\nWhat is the hearse the queen is in?\n\nThe queen’s coffin was moved from the gun carriage to the royal hearse at Wellington Arch as it was taken to Windsor. The hearse drove 25 miles west of London to Windsor Castle and St George's Chapel, a mini-cathedral that seats 800 and is often used for royal weddings. It's where Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were married in 2018.\n\nAt Windsor, the state hearse traveled in procession to St George’s Chapel via the Long Walk. Once inside, a committal service began at 4 p.m. local time, 11 a.m. EDT.\n\nThe glass-walled hearse allows the queen’s coffin to be viewed – and it is lit up when it is dark out.\n\nFuneral program: What happened at queen's funeral\n\nThe funeral concluded just after noon, local time. The pall bearers escorted the queen's coffin onto the gun carriage.\n\nThe queen will be buried in a special chapel beneath the floor of St George's with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband, Philip.\n\nThe program also included:\n\nPatricia Scotland Commonwealth Secretary-General read a lesson from Corinthians 15 as a tribute to the queen’s life of dedication to service and the nation.\n\nA sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nChoirs sang the Anthem, taken from \"Songs of Farewell\" by Hubert Parry, a favorite of King Charles'.\n\nA short anthem, composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the queen’s coronation in 1953, presenting a reflective moment in the service.\n\nThe third hymn, \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\" is a Welsh tune, and was sung at the wedding of The Prince and Princess of Wales at Westminster Abbey in 2011. The arrangement is by James O’Donnell, a former organist at the Abbey.\n\nThe Archbishop gave the commendation over the queen’s coffin. The commendation will include the familiar line, \"Go Forth, O Christian Soul, From This World,\" which is often heard during funerals.\n\nThe choirs sang a new anthem, composed for the service by Sir James McMillan. The words are taken from Romans 8, which leads with the hopeful, confident line, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\"\n\nThe dean pronounced the blessing from the altar, and the congregation will remain standing for the last post, which will be sounded by the state trumpeters of the household cavalry.\n\nThis was followed by two minutes’ silence, to be observed across the United Kingdom.\n\nThe trumpeters then sounded the reveille, before the national anthem was sung.\n\nThe sovereign’s piper played the traditional lament, ‘Sleep, dearie, sleep.’\n\nAt the conclusion of the lament, at noon local time (7 a.m. ET), the pall bearers entered and moved the queen’s coffin to the state gun carriage.\n\nCharles writes note to the queen tucked in funeral wreath atop coffin\n\nThe funeral wreath on the queen's coffin was anything but funereal – it was a massive assembling of color and symbolism topped with a note from Charles. \"In loving and devoted memory. Charles R,\" it read.\n\n\"Charles R\" is the monarch’s official signature, with R being Latin for \"Rex\" or king. (Elizabeth’s signature was Elizabeth R for \"Regina,\" Latin for queen.)\n\nThe sight of that note immediately evoked memories of the note that sat on Princess Diana’s coffin during her funeral procession to Westminster Abbey in 1997. It was from her sons and signed \"Mummy.\"\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace’s notes on the funeral, the queen’s wreath included, at the king’s request, flowers and foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the king’s private home Highgrove House.\n\nThe foliage was chosen for its symbolism: Rosemary for remembrance. Myrtle for the ancient symbol of a happy marriage, and cut from a plant grown from a sprig of myrtle in the queen’s 1947 wedding bouquet. English oak symbolizes the strength of love.\n\nAlso included are scented pelargoniums, garden roses, autumnal hydrangea, sedum, dahlias, and scabious, in shades of gold, pink and deep burgundy, with touches of white to reflect the Royal Standard on which it sits.\n\nAnd at the request of the king, a longtime environmentalist, the wreath is made in a sustainable way, formed in a nest of English moss and oak branches and without the use of floral foam.\n\nWho attended the queen’s funeral?\n\nThe guest list for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II amounted to hundreds of people, a mix of members of the British royal family, foreign royals (many of them relatives of the queen), domestic and foreign government leaders, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, British religious and military leaders, members of the royal households, and scores of ordinary people, from the National Health Service, for instance, who were invited to mark their service to the nation.\n\nThe top British royals:\n\nKing Charles III\n\nCamilla, Queen Consort\n\nPrincess Anne Princess Royal, Vice Adm. Sir Tim Laurence\n\nPrince Andrew Duke of York\n\nPrince Edward Earl of Wessex, Sophie Countess of Wessex\n\nPrince William, Prince of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nPrince George of Wales\n\nPrince Charlotte of Wales\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nEarl of Snowdon\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nAlso there are some two dozen other members of the queen’s family, including descendants of her mother’s Scottish family. All eight of her grandchildren are there and some of the older 12 great-grandchildren, including the new second and third in line in the succession, Prince George of Wales, 9, and Princess Charlotte of Wales, 7.\n\nMany of the foreign royals who attended also are related to the British royal family through descent from Queen Victoria, sometimes known as the \"grandmother\" of Europe in the 19th century. The monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are there. Also, Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, making their first overseas trip since assuming the throne of Japan in 2019.\n\nThe Bidens top the foreign leaders list, which also includes France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Ireland’s President Michael Higgins. Also there: Ursula von der Leyen, representing the European Union that Britain quit amid many recriminations in 2016. Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also are there, representing three of the major Commonwealth nations over which the queen also reigned.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral:See King Charles III, Prince Harry, all royals who attended\n\nIs Prince Harry at the funeral? Harry wore military medals, but not his uniform\n\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, were visiting the U.K. from their home in California to promote several causes they are involved with when the queen died.\n\nAt Monday's funeral, Harry wore his military medals but not his uniform. He wore the uniform during a vigil on Saturday with Queen Elizabeth's grandchildren.\n\nRoyal experts have explained that only working members of the royal family will wear the military uniform for the five events during the late monarch's period of mourning and state funeral.\n\nHarry walked in to Westminster Abbey alongside his brother, Prince William. But during the service, Harry and Meghan sat in the second row behind his father, while William, Princess Kate and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across the aisle in the first row.\n\nIs Sarah 'Fergie' Ferguson at the funeral?\n\nSarah Ferguson, affectionately known as Fergie, attended the state funeral for the queen Monday. The Duchess of York, 62, has remained close with the royals despite her divorce from Prince Andrew in 1996. The former pair share daughters Princess Beatrice, 34, and Princess Eugenie, 32, who were also in attendance.\n\nFollowing the queen's death, Ferguson wrote in a tribute on Twitter that \"she was was the most incredible mother-in-law and friend.\"\n\n\"I will always be grateful to her for the generosity she showed me in remaining close to me even after my divorce,\" the Duchess of York added. \"I will miss her more than words can express.\"\n\nState funeral at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe queen's casket entered Westminster Abbey around 11 a.m. local time Monday. The choir of St. George's Chapel sang The Sentences as the queen's coffin procession, including King Charles, Prince William, Princess Kate, Prince Harry, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince George, Prince Charlotte, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, followed the coffin into the abbey.\n\nDavid Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, opened the service before attendees joined together to sing The Hymn, \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nDuring the funeral, speakers included Most Rev. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury; Rev. Mark Birch, Minor Canon and Precentor; Patricia Scotland, Commonwealth secretary-general; Shermara Fletcher, principal officer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Relations, Churches Together in England; and Rt. Rev. Dame Sarah Mullally. As the funeral concluded, the choir sang \"God Save the King.\"\n\nFuneral music: Hymns sung at queen's funeral\n\nThe music during the funeral will be sung by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and included The Sentences, written by William Croft, whose Sentences have been used since the mid 1500s, and at every State Funeral since the early 18th century.\n\nThe choir of St George's Chapel sang The Sentences during the procession as the casket entered. The choir of Westminster Abbey began the funeral service in song, later joining with the choir of the Chapel Royal for a rendition of \"Like as the Heart.\" The funeral's attendees sang \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nThe choir also sang \"The Lord’s My Shepherd,\" which also was heard at the Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh in 1947. The choir sang \"God Save the King,\" featuring different lyrics from what many have known for decades as \"God Save the Queen,\" as the funeral concluded.\n\nDetails about Queen Elizabeth's coffin\n\nThe oak coffin was made more than 30 years ago, funeral directors previously confirmed to USA TODAY. Leverton & Sons, which has served as funeral directors to the royal household said it inherited the coffin made for the queen by another firm, Kenyons.\n\nAndrew Leverton, a funeral director at Leverton & Sons, previously told British outlet the Times \"It is made from English oak, which is very difficult to get hold of.\n\n“Oak coffins are now made from American oak. I don’t think we could use English oak for a coffin now. It would be too expensive,” he told the outlet.\n\nThe coffin is also lined with lead, Leverton & Sons said. The lead lining makes the coffin so heavy that eight military bearers carried it Monday.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's casket:Queen to be buried in decades-old coffin lined with lead that takes 8 people to carry\n\nImperial State Crown: Details about crown atop casket\n\nThe majestic Imperial State Crown sits atop the queen’s flag-draped coffin as the queen was moved to Westminster Abbey, along with her scepter and orb.\n\nThe crown, the same one the young Queen Elizabeth II wore for her coronation in 1953, is adorned with stones including the 317-carat Cullinan II diamond, one of several stones cut from the more than 3,000-carat Cullinan Diamond, mined in South Africa in 1905, when the nation was a British colony. The main stone – the 530.2-carat Cullinan I diamond, also called the Star of Africa – rests at the top of the monarch’s scepter.\n\nAs the royal jewels are in the news, so are repeated calls to return the diamonds to their country of origin. The queen's death at 96 on Sept. 8 has also renewed the conversation of the royal family's ties to colonialism and the queen's lack of apology or atonement.\n\nCalls for reparation from former colonial powers are not new, but they have resurged in recent years. Barbados in November 2021 removed the queen as its head of state, becoming the region’s newest republic. Six other Caribbean countries have signaled their intent to follow suit.\n\nThe monarchy:Imperial State Crown and royal scepter glimmer, but some say on back of colonialism\n\nWhat is the gun carriage used to carry the queen?\n\nWhen the coffin emerged from Westminster Hall, the pallbearers placed it on the green gun carriage that was used for the funerals of the queen’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather, all kings.\n\nKing Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward flanked the procession, followed by several other members of the royal family including Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nKing Charles, more royals arrive at funeral\n\nKing Charles was met with applause by crowds as his motorcade arrived at Westminster Hall for the queen's coffin procession to Westminster Abbey. Prince William and Prince Harry joined him.\n\nOne car contained Queen Consort Camilla and Catherine, Princess of Wales, with her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Another featured Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.\n\nMore members of the royal family, including Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrived shortly after.\n\nThe funeral’s order of service showed that George and Charlotte will walk together behind their parents. They will be followed by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and other royal family members.\n\nThe royal children’s 4-year-old brother, Prince Louis, is not expected to be present at the funeral, which will be attended by some 2,000 people.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Liz Truss, more world leaders arrive\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, is among the top world leaders who arrived at Westminster Abbey ahead of the funeral.\n\nBiden arrived at Westminster Abbey for the queen’s funeral in his armored limousine, The Beast. He was among the few international diplomats who, for security reasons, did not ride on a fleet of chartered luxury buses provided for other world leaders. Biden stepped out of the The Beast a few minutes after 10 a.m. local time. He did not say anything or address the press.\n\nMany other leaders arrived Monday morning via bus; the Bidens arrived separately. British Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte Macron, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and wife Michelle Bolsonaro and Israeli President Isaac Herzog and wife Michal Herzog were also spotted arriving.\n\nThe president signed the official condolence book and attended a reception Sunday at Buckingham Palace hosted by King Charles III.\n\nBiden is among many world leaders who traveled to the United Kingdom to honor Queen Elizabeth’s long reign. During his visit, Biden told media the queen \"was the same in person as her image: decent, honorable and all about service.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the royal family, King Charles and all of the family. It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you’ll never overcome it,\" the president said, adding that he told Charles the queen will be with him \"every step of the way, every moment.\"\n\nThe day before the funeral:Biden arrives in London for funeral; Queen's grandchildren stand vigil by coffin\n\nTom Parker Bowles, more royals' family members arrive\n\nLess than an hour and a half before the funeral is set to begin, notable arrivals connected to the royal family began to trickle in. Queen Consort Camilla's family was also photographed arriving at Westminster Abbey, including Laura Lopes, Camilla's 44-year-old daughter, and Tom Parker Bowles, her 47-year-old son. Princess Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, were also photographed upon arrival.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nWhere will Queen Elizabeth II be buried?\n\nThe queen will be buried at St George Chapel at Windsor Castle, where many of her ancestors are buried, including her parents, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother.\n\nFollowing the funeral at Westminster Abbey, the coffin procession will begin, joined by King Charles, other members of the royal family, past and present members of the queen's household, governors general and prime ministers of the realms.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral details:When is it? Will it be on TV? Your questions, answered\n\nKing Charles thanks the public for 'messages of condolence' ahead of queen's funeral\n\nAhead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, King Charles III issued a statement Sunday evening thanking people in Britain and across the world for \"the many messages of condolence.\"\n\n\"Over the last ten days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched,\" the king said. \"In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother.\"\n\n\"As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief,\" Charles concluded his statement.\n\nAhead of the queen's funeral Monday, a new photograph was released Sunday.\n\nAccording to the royal family on Facebook, the photo was taken to mark the queen's Platinum Jubilee earlier this year. She was the first British monarch to reach this milestone.\n\n\"Tomorrow, millions will come together to commemorate her remarkable life,\" the post read.\n\nPrince Charles is now King Charles III. Here's what to know about UK's new monarch.\n\nHow old is Westminster Abbey, site of Queen Elizabeth funeral?\n\nWestminster Abbey, where Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral will be held Monday, has a centuries-long association with the royal family, hosting generations of coronations, royal weddings and funerals.\n\nThe church, which was consecrated in 1065 and “has been the setting for every coronation since 1066” and 16 royal weddings, a statement on the abbey’s website says.\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's connection with Westminster Abbey ran like a thread through her early life and her long reign,” the site says. “As an 11-year-old girl, she watched as her father was crowned here. As a young adult, she married here and was crowned here.”\n\nFourteen English monarchs were buried there between 1066 and 1760, including Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of King Henry VIII, who was interred in the abbey in 1603. The Unknown Warrior, whose body was brought from France in 1920, is buried in the abbey’s nave. Author Charles Dickens is among those buried in Poets' Corner of the abbey.\n\nThe funeral of Princess Diana was held at the abbey in 1997 and the Queen Mother’s funeral took place there in 2002. More recently, Prince William and Duchess Kate, now the Prince and Princess of Wales, were married there in 2011.\n\nVisual guide to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey\n\nQueen's funeral more than ceremony, designed to show monarchy's stability\n\nThe queen, who died Sept. 8 in Scotland at age 96 after 70 years on the throne, was widely considered the glue holding the U.K. together. She was also the most canny of her Windsor ancestors about using ceremony and splendor to bond the monarchy and the people who pay for it.\n\nNot since 1965, for former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, has Britain mounted a state funeral, which is usually reserved for monarchs, with exceptions for distinguished figures such as Churchill, the queen's first prime minister of her reign.\n\nRoyal funerals are planned decades in advance by governments and the crown, and the plans are updated regularly. The monarch plays a crucial role in deciding details. The choice of flowers in the wreath on her coffin, the music and prayer selections, even the bespoke design of the Royal Hearse (lots of glass and inside light so the casket can be seen even at night), were all decisions made by the queen.\n\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nMourners line the streets during queen's funeral\n\nAt 6 a.m. local time, snipers were on rooftops, sniffer dogs were on the streets, drains were being searched and surveillance drones have been banned from all of central London. Around 20 miles of barriers have been erected to control crowds as the queen’s coffin travels the short distance from Westminster Hall, where it is lying-in-state, to Westminster Abbey, and then onward to Windsor Castle after the funeral for burial.\n\nA full five hours before the funeral gets underway, London’s transportation network was already busy on a public holiday, with the subway system seeing members of the public rushing to secure viewing spots in and around Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. Many carried small fold-up chairs, and Londoners almost entirely wore black in the quiet of the city. Volunteers in purple vests every few yards provided help with directions and other needs.\n\nHyde Park, one of London's central parks, is a designated screening spot for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on Monday. The 11 a.m.-ceremony will be broadcast live on large screens for attendees to see for free at the park, and the Hyde Park site will show the procession through London following the funeral, the procession through Windsor and the Committal Service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nSigns and staff are present across the city to direct people to either the park or other \"viewing areas\" where they may catch a real glimpse of the state funeral route. The park and viewing areas include dedicated spots for anyone who has an accessibility need, including British Sign Language interpreters and a dedicated location for wheelchair users.\n\nPeople watched the funeral and procession from almost everywhere – lining the streets 10-deep to sitting on blankets in parks.\n\nLucy Hartnell, 26, from Hertfordshire, organized a picnic at Hyde Park of what she and friends assumed were “queen favorites” including strawberries, cucumber finger sandwiches, Prosecco, cupcakes and chips. They took the tube into London and were \"shocked\" how easy it was for them to get to Hyde Park to view the funeral.\n\nThey said they attended to not miss a big event and aren’t really pro-royal or anti-royal, which has been a large debate among young people.\n\n\"We’re not super against the royals or for them, we just wanted to be part of them moment,\" Hartnell said.\n\nThey said the transition to a king likely won’t affect them, but they said the area where they grew up is very pro-monarchy. \"Our grandparents care a lot. We don’t care that much either way. People our age are like 'we should get rid of the monarchy.' But no one cares enough to actually do anything about it … we just like having them,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Nicole Fallert, Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara, Maria Puente, Laura Trujillo, Amy Haneline and Morgan Hines, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/15/queen-elizabeth-ii-funeral-details/10380743002/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth funeral details: Time, live stream, burial information", "text": "Given the hours and reams of media coverage of the death of Queen Elizabeth II in recent days, it's almost surprising to learn that her funeral on Monday is still a mystery to millions in the USA.\n\nNevertheless, the gods of Google insist multiple questions are trending about the funeral. We shall endeavor to answer some:\n\nWhen is Queen Elizabeth II's funeral?\n\nThe funeral will take place at Westminster Abbey, the 753-year-old church where royals have traditionally been married, mourned and buried, on Monday starting at 11 a.m. British local time, or 6 a.m. ET.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II funeral live updates::News from the queen's funeral as it unfolds\n\nAbout 15 minutes before the service starts, the queen's Royal Standard-draped coffin topped with the Orb and the Scepter will be moved by the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy (the same carriage that carried the coffin of her father, King George VI) from Westminster Hall, where it has been lying in state since Wednesday night, to Westminster Abbey.\n\nThat procession, led by King Charles III and his siblings, will look very much like the procession to take the coffin from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on Wednesday, but shorter. The royals will be accompanied by ranks of uniformed troops, senior palace officials and even the queen's pages as hundreds of thousands of mourners line the streets of central London to pay respects.\n\nIn the abbey, about 2,000 guests will be waiting for the start of a service that will last about an hour.\n\nMore:Your visual guide to Queen Elizabeth II's carefully planned funeral events, through Sept. 19\n\nSpeaking at a news briefing Thursday, Edward Fitzalan-Howard, the Duke of Norfolk who holds the hereditary title Earl Marshal responsible for organizing state occasions such as this, said the funeral will reflect the \"unique and timeless position\" the queen held in the lives of millions, and the sense of loss shared around the world.\n\n\"It is our aim and belief that the state funeral and events of the next few days will unite people across the globe and resonate with people of all faiths, whilst fulfilling Her Majesty and her family’s wishes to pay a fitting tribute to an extraordinary reign,\" the duke told reporters.\n\nWhat kind of funeral will Queen Elizabeth II get?\n\nIt will be the grandest the British can muster, a state funeral, usually reserved only for monarchs or special figures such as former Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\n\nHers will be the first state funeral in the United Kingdom since Churchill's in 1965.\n\nA state funeral is organized and paid for by the state and combines the ceremonies and rituals for the sovereign with those of any family's funeral for a loved one. A royal family is mourning; they just have to do it in public.\n\n\"Ceremonial\" funerals, in the British parlance, are reserved for royals who are not sovereigns, such as the queen's husband, Prince Philip, or her mother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother,.\n\nA special ceremonial funeral, which remains unforgettable, was mounted quickly in 1997 for Princess Diana, who was no longer a member of the royal family when she died in a car crash in Paris. But she is still the mother and grandmother of expected future sovereigns, Prince William, the new Prince of Wales, and his son, Prince George, 9.\n\nMore:Survival of the Monarchy: Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nWhere is Queen Elizabeth II going to be buried?\n\nShe will be buried at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, where many of her ancestors are buried, including her parents, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother.\n\nWhen the funeral service at the abbey is over, the queen's coffin will be carried in another procession to the Wellington Arch along Whitehall, The Mall and past Buckingham Palace.\n\nAt the Arch, the coffin will be transferred to the Royal Hearse, which will drive the 25 miles west of London to Windsor Castle and St. George's Chapel. The latter is a mini-cathedral that seats 800 and is often used for royal weddings. It's where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were married in 2018.\n\nAt Windsor, the state hearse will travel in procession to St. George’s Chapel via the Long Walk. Once inside, there will be a committal service beginning at 4 p.m. local time, 11 a.m. ET.\n\nBesides the family, the congregation will be made up of past and present members of the queen's household, including from the private estates. Governors general and prime ministers of the realms also will be there.\n\nBefore the final hymn is sung, the State Imperial Crown, the Orb and Scepter will be removed from the top of the coffin and placed on the altar. As the coffin is lowered into the royal vault, the dean of Windsor will say a psalm, the garter king of arms will list the queen's many styles and titles, the sovereign’s piper will play a lament, and the archbishop of Canterbury will give a blessing. The national anthem will conclude the service.\n\nThe queen will be buried in a special chapel beneath the floor of St. George's with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband, Philip. This ceremony will be private.\n\nWill Queen Elizabeth II's funeral be televised?\n\nYou won't be able to escape the coverage. All of the networks in the United Kingdom, and the United States, will be broadcasting it live from early hours Monday.\n\nIt is expected to be the most watched broadcast ever, with an estimated 4 billion turned in.\n\nAs an example, Anglophilic PBS in the U.S. will offer BBC’s live uninterrupted coverage starting at 4 a.m. to noon ET (check local listings) on PBS, PBS.org and the PBS Video app.\n\nAll of the major U.S. networks rushed teams to London in the hours after the queen's death and have been talking nonstop ever since, following plans years in preparation, rather like the queen's funeral plans.\n\nThe locals were even more prepared: The U.K broadcaster ITV fielded multiple trucks, camera rigs, crews and reporters at key locations in London and Windsor, including a prebuilt studio with lighting and furniture in Windsor, according to Variety.\n\nWho is Queen Elizabeth II's successor?\n\nCharles, her eldest son and the former prince of Wales. At 73 and after decades as the king-in-waiting, he is now the sovereign and leading his family and the nation in the mourning for \"my beloved mother.\"\n\nWhat religion was Queen Elizabeth II?\n\nChurch of England, founded (originally) by Henry VIII in the 1530s. The funeral rites will be based on the Order of the Burial of the Dead from the Book of Common Prayer.\n\nBy law and custom, the sovereign is the supreme governor of the Church of England, aka the Anglican Church (or the Episcopal Church as it is known in the USA). The queen was an authentically devout member all her life.\n\nThe law says the sovereign and his or her spouse must be Protestants, never Roman Catholics, under the general theory that you can't profess to follow one religion while serving as the head for another, even though there are few major differences between the two churches.\n\nAnd it should be noted that the spiritual spaces where the queen's funeral will take place, including the abbey and the chapels, were built by the Catholic Church for Catholics hundreds of years ago.\n\nWhen did Queen Elizabeth II's husband die?\n\nPhilip died April 9, 2021, at age 99, at Windsor Castle after weeks in two hospitals.\n\nBorn a prince of Greece and Denmark, and exiled with his family soon after his birth, the duke and the queen were married for 73 years, and she described him as her \"strength and stay.\"\n\nHis biographers and British historians described him as crucial to his wife's success as the sovereign for 70 years, the longest in British or English history since 1066.\n\nHis funeral, at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, was much reduced – only 30 mourners in total – because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But it was designed by the no-fuss Philip to be as unfussy as possible anyway.\n\nAmong the most memorable features: His hearse was a customized Land Rover he designed himself. It carried his coffin, adorned with his naval cap, sword, a flag representing his Greek and Danish heritage, and a spray of flowers chosen by the queen, from the castle to the church.\n\nHow much was Queen Elizabeth II worth?\n\nNo one knows for sure; her private worth was ... private. Forbes magazine recently put it at $500 million, but it's a guess at best. It's safe to say she wasn't hurting.\n\nIn any case, all of her private estate was inherited by Charles upon her death, including her jewelry (but not the Crown Jewels, which belong to the state) and privately owned Balmoral Castle in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk (but not Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle and similar state-owned residences).\n\nThough the queen's land holdings were rich and vast, her jewelry was just as breathtaking, and this was down in part to her grandmother, Queen Mary, consort to George V. She collected lavish baubles all her long life, and when she died in 1953, she left most of it to her granddaughter the queen.\n\nWhen did Queen Elizabeth II become queen?\n\nOn Feb. 6, 1952, when she and Philip were on a holiday in Kenya before setting off on a world tour. She was just 25 and didn't immediately know she was queen at the time.\n\nBack in England, her father, King George VI, who looked ill when waving them off on their trip, died in his sleep at Sandringham, after a day of shooting on the 20,000-acre Norfolk estate. He was 56. (He had come to the throne unexpectedly in December 1936 after his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated in a huff because he wasn't allowed to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson.)\n\nGeorge had been suffering from lung cancer, although his doctors didn't tell him, his family, the government or the public, which made his death even more of a shock. He had just undergone what was then described as successful surgery to remove most of his left lung.\n\nIn the era before mass communications, it took some time for the news to reach Kenya, where Elizabeth had been enjoying watching and filming the wildlife from Treetops, a treetop lodge hotel. Her husband broke the news to her. The loss left them devastated but calm.\n\nAs many said later, she went up a tree a princess and came down a queen.\n\nShe immediately made plans to return to London, began writing letters to her hosts on the now-canceled world tour, and told an aide who asked what she intended to use as her regnal, or reign, name.\n\n\"My own name, of course.\" Thus: Elizabeth.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/politics/biden-world-leaders-queen-elizabeth-funeral/index.html", "title": "Biden and world leaders attend state funeral for Queen Elizabeth II ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Monday joined a long slate of world leaders for Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral inside London’s Westminster Abbey, where royal pageantry was on full display to pay tribute to a monarch whose rule spanned seven decades.\n\nWorld leaders, dignitaries, politicians, public figures and European royals were among the 2,000 attendees.\n\nThe service was conducted by the Rev. David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, at Westminster Abbey. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and Patricia Scotland, the Commonwealth Secretary General, read lessons. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivered a sermon. Toward the end of the service, the Last Post sounded before a two-minute silence was observed. The state funeral was brought to a conclusion by the Queen’s Piper, who played a Reveille, the National Anthem and a Lament.\n\nInvitations were sent over the weekend to the heads of state of countries with whom the United Kingdom has diplomatic relations. The list of leaders who attended the state funeral was long, and included leadership across the Commonwealth and around the world. Representatives of Syria, Russia, Belarus, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Venezuela were absent. For most nations with an invitation, attendance extended to the head of state plus a guest.\n\nFollowing Monday’s state funeral, the coffin will be conveyed from the hall to Wellington Arch before making its final journey out of London to Windsor. The Queen’s journey will end at St. George’s Chapel, within the grounds of Windsor Castle, where her coffin will be lowered into the Royal Vault below the chapel.\n\nBiden was one of the few world leaders to arrive in his own motorcade at the Queen’s funeral, but for the last 10 days, his aides have worked behind the scenes to ensure he had as small of a footprint as possible while she was laid to rest.\n\nA person familiar with the planning said the White House was very conscious about not making the trip about Biden, reviewing protocol closely in recent days as to avoid any missteps that could potentially distract from the funeral itself. Biden traveled with a smaller staff than is typical for an overseas visit, and his aides decided against scheduling even an informal meeting with Truss while in London.\n\nInstead, the only events on Biden’s schedule were those planned in coordination with the palace, the person said.\n\nMonday’s ceremonial events are the culmination of nearly two weeks of public arrangements, codenamed “Operation London Bridge.”\n\nPlans for the Queen’s funeral have been in place for years, allowing American advisers greater insight into precisely what will happen over the coming days as they make security arrangements.

During their brief visit to London, the President and first lady Jill Biden paid their respects to the Queen as she was lying in state, signed condolence books and attended a reception with other leaders and King Charles III.\n\nThe funeral takes place the same week world leaders are slated to convene for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where Biden will hold his first bilateral meeting with Truss on Wednesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/uk/queen-elizabeth-funeral-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Queen Elizabeth's funeral: Britain bids farewell to monarch with an ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritain bid farewell to Queen Elizabeth II on Monday with a majestic funeral steeped in tradition and a send-off reflective of the broad popularity she managed to retain over her remarkable seven-decade reign.\n\nRoyal family members and dignitaries gathered at Westminster Abbey for a somber service. Presidents, prime ministers, princes and princesses, and other public figures sat side-by-side to pay their last respects – a testament to her far-reaching appeal and deft diplomacy.\n\nThe funeral, which served as both a state and religious service and marked the culmination of 10 days of mourning, honored the Queen with the sort of pageantry that she used to promote the royal family and “brand Britain” throughout her life.\n\nTens of thousands of people flocked to streets around Westminster Abbey and along the 25-mile procession route from central London to Windsor, hoping to catch a glimpse of the sovereign’s flag-draped coffin as it traveled by hearse to her final resting place.\n\nIn the third and last procession of the day, the Queen’s coffin was taken past throngs of well-wishers lining the Long Walk to Windsor Castle for her committal service and burial at St. George’s Chapel, where she was separated from the crown for the final time.\n\nLater in the evening, she was interred together with her husband of 73 years, the Duke of Edinburgh, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel.

Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThough the death of Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, had been anticipated and carefully planned for for years – funeral arrangements, codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” were long the subject of speculation – the magnitude of this moment of mourning and the public outpouring of emotion has still caught many off guard. Even for those who are not fans of the royal family, her death marks the end of an era, a shift in the national landscape.\n\nAt 96, the Queen had become an almost mythical symbol of stability amid constant change. Her 70-year rule was bookended by war and pandemic, punctuated by uncertainty about Britain’s role on the world stage. She was crowned as the sun had started to set on the British Empire, and her death has renewed a conversation about the country’s dark colonial past. It comes at a time of great political and economic upheaval, not only in the United Kingdom, but across the globe.\n\nMourners observe two minutes of silence outside Buckingham Palace. Alkis Konstantinidis/Pool/AP\n\nMore than 200 foreign dignitaries were invited to her funeral at Westminster Abbey, including US President Joe Biden and Commonwealth leaders like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Many traded limos for buses to arrive at the funeral, just one part of a plan that amounts to the single biggest security operation that British authorities have seen since World War II.\n\nRepresentatives of some of the many charities of which the Queen was patron, along with emergency service workers and public servants, were also among the 2,000-strong congregation.\n\nThe service took place in the same abbey nave where, 69 years ago, the Queen was crowned and where, 75 years ago, she was married to her husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died last year. A sovereign who knew the soft power of spectacle, her coronation was, at her request, broadcast for the first time on television, bringing the splendor of the monarchy to millions around the world.

Admiration for the Queen has staved off a major reckoning of the crown’s brutal legacy in former colonies – including its historic links with the slave trade – but that already appears to be changing as some Commonwealth countries look to break away.\n\nLast week, Antigua and Barbuda announced plans to hold a referendum on whether to become a republic, and last November, Barbados became the first realm in nearly 30 years to remove the British monarch as head of state.\n\nKing Charles left a handwritten message on top of the Queen's coffin: \"In loving and devoted memory.

The Queen represents the “continuity of a hundreds-years-old tradition,” he said, adding that he came to London to see “the continuity of the nation.”\n\nWhile there were no screens, mourners on The Mall were able to hear a radio broadcast of the funeral. People stood still, their gazes lowered. Later, as the funeral procession passed by, children were hoisted aloft on shoulders to see the military units march past and people snapped pictures on their phones – capturing the end of an era.\n\nPeople weep as they watch the Queen's funeral procession in London. Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters\n\nOver the past four days, an almost familial sense of loss was palpable among mourners who waited in a queue that snaked for miles along the River Thames to Westminster Hall, where the monarch’s body lay in state, to file past her coffin.\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s children, King Charles III, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, and Prince Edward, on Friday entered the cavernous chamber, heads bowed, to hold silent watch over the velvet catafalque bearing her coffin, adorned with the sovereign’s jewel-encrusted crown, orb and sceptre. A day later, Prince William and Prince Harry, dressed in military uniform, held their own sombre vigil, standing alongside the Queen’s six other grandchildren.\n\nOn Monday morning, the King and other members of the royal family followed the coffin as it was conveyed from Westminster Hall, on her final journey to the abbey. It was carried on the same gun carriage used for the funeral of the Queen’s father, King George VI, and Winston Churchill, the first of 15 British prime ministers who served under her.\n\nBritain's King Charles III, front, and Anne, Princess Royal, right, walk behind the Queen's coffin.

Made from flowers and foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace and other royal estates, it included pink and gold pelargoniums, garden roses and dahlias, with myrtle cut from a plant grown from a sprig that featured in the Queen’s wedding bouquet.\n\nAs the coffin moved inside the abbey, the Queen’s great-grandchildren Prince George and Princess Charlotte formed part of the procession behind her coffin.

Dominic Lipinski/Pool/AP\n\nIt was the sort of traditional, classical music that the Queen championed in life. Hymns chosen were “The Day Thou Gavest, Lord” and “The Lord is My Shepherd, I Shall Not Want,” which was sung at her wedding to Prince Philip in 1947, and the anthem “O Taste and see how gracious the Lord is,” which was composed for the Queen’s coronation in 1953 by Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\nA choral piece was also especially commissioned for the day, composed by the master of the king’s music, Judith Weir, “Like as the Hart.” It is said to be inspired by the Queen’s “unwavering Christian faith,” and is a setting of Psalm 42 to music.\n\nRev. David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, conducted the service. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, who the Queen appointed just two days before her death, and Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland read lessons and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, delivered a sermon.\n\n“The grief of this day, felt not only by the late Queen’s family but all round the nation, the Commonwealth and the world, arises from her abundant life and loving service – now gone from us,” Welby said in his sermon, recalling the monarch’s 21st birthday broadcast, in which she famously declared that she would dedicate her whole life to serving the nation and the Commonwealth.\n\n“Service in life, hope in death; all who follow the Queen’s example and inspiration of trust and faith in God can with her say: ‘we will meet again,’” he concluded, quoting the Queen’s speech during Britain’s Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, a nod to Vera Lynn’s wartime song.\n\nPipe Major Paul Burns of the Royal Regiment of Scotland closes the Queen's funeral with a rendition of \"Sleep, Dearie, Sleep.\" Gareth Cattermole/Pool/Reuters\n\nThe hour-long service concluded with a two-minute silence, after which the congregation sang the national anthem, “God Save the King.” The Queen’s piper, whose music roused the monarch every morning, played a fitting lament, “Sleep, Dearie, Sleep,” to close the proceedings.\n\nThe day’s events were a display of centuries-old rituals – a royal cavalcade flanked by guards in braided uniforms, kilted bagpipers and drummers, streets lined with soldiers saluting as the coffin passes. Minute guns were fired in Hyde Park and Big Ben tolled throughout the procession to Wellington Arch, where the coffin was placed into a hearse to be transported to Windsor.\n\nOnce there, the state hearse traveled past more than 140,000 people lining the procession route to Windsor Castle, with crowds packed the length of the Long Walk. Two of the Queen’s beloved corgis sat outside the castle, awaiting her last homecoming.\n\nPeople line the procession route from London to Windsor. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nIn a committal service at St. George’s Chapel on Monday afternoon, members of the royal family and the Queen’s household staff past and present sat together in pews for a more intimate ceremony. Some of the music in the service was composed by Sir William Henry Harris, who was the organist of St. George’s Chapel when the Queen was a girl and is believed to have taught her to play piano.\n\nIn a poignant moment filled with theater, silence descended on the chapel and the crown jeweler removed the Imperial State Crown and the sovereign’s orb and scepter. The Lord Chamberlain, the head of the Queen’s household, broke his wand of office and placed it on top of the coffin before it was lowered into the Royal Vault.\n\nThe Queen's coffin is carried into St. George's Chapel.

An annex of St. George’s Chapel, it also houses the remains of the Queen’s father, her mother the Queen Mother, and her sister Princess Margaret.\n\n“It just means so much to me,” said Lorraine Calloway, who came to Windsor with her son Cohen, age 8, to participate in the historic day. “To come and see the Queen have her last resting place here is something that is really fundamentally important to me, and the family.”\n\nCrowds line the Long Walk outside Windsor Castle to watch the procession.

It is the greatest consolation to me to know of the sympathy expressed by so many to my Sister and Brothers and that such overwhelming affection and support should be extended to our whole family in our loss.\n\nTo all of us as a family, as to this kingdom and the wider family of nations of which it is a part, my Mother gave an example of lifelong love and of selfless service. My Mother’s reign was unequalled in its duration, its dedication and its devotion. Even as we grieve, we give thanks for this most faithful life.\n\nI am deeply aware of this great inheritance and of the duties and heavy responsibilities of Sovereignty which have now passed to me. In taking up these responsibilities, I shall strive to follow the inspiring example I have been set in upholding constitutional government and to seek the peace, harmony and prosperity of the peoples of these Islands and of the Commonwealth Realms and Territories throughout the world.\n\nIn this purpose, I know that I shall be upheld by the affection and loyalty of the peoples whose Sovereign I have been called upon to be, and that in the discharge of these duties I will be guided by the counsel of their elected parliaments. In all this, I am profoundly encouraged by the constant support of my beloved wife.\n\nI take this opportunity to confirm my willingness and intention to continue the tradition of surrendering the hereditary revenues, including the Crown Estate, to My Government for the benefit of all, in return for the Sovereign Grant, which supports My official duties as Head of State and Head of Nation.\n\nAnd in carrying out the heavy task that has been laid upon me, and to which I now dedicate what remains to me of my life, I pray for the guidance and help of Almighty God.\"\n\nKing Charles expected to receive officials Saturday afternoon\n\nThrough the day Saturday, King Charles III is also expected to receive varying officials at Buckingham Palace at separate times including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Prime Minister and Members of the Cabinet, leaders of opposition parties and the Dean of Westminster.\n\nKing Charles III pays respects to his 'darling mama' in first official address\n\nFriday, King Charles III, on the first full day of his reign following the death of Queen Elizabeth II Thursday, addressed the nation in a nearly 9-minute long pre-recorded message.\n\nThe new king paid respects to his mother, his queen — and the era in which she ruled — and commented on how his life will change going forward while promising to serve his people.\n\nThe new king expressed \"profound sorrow\" in the wake of Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\n\"My beloved mother was an inspiration, an example to me and to all my family,\" he said. \"And we owe her the most heartfelt debt any family could owe to their mother for her love, affection, guidance, understanding and example.\"\n\nHe continued, noting her pledge at the age of 21 to devote her life to her people and called it \"a profound personal commitment, which defined her whole life.\"\n\n\"As the Queen herself did with such unswerving devotion, I too now solemnly pledge myself throughout the remaining time God grants me to uphold the constitutional principles at the heart of our nation,\" he said.\n\n\"In a little over a week's time, we will come together as a nation, as a commonwealth and indeed a global community to lay my beloved mother to rest,\" he said. \"In our sorrow, let us remember and draw strength from the light of her example.\"\n\nKing Charles then gave thanks for condolences and support and shared one more message, addressing his mother directly.\n\n\"To my darling mama, as you begin your last great journey to join my dear late papa, I want simply to say this: Thank you.

The first leg of the Queen's final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. The trip by road ordinarily takes around three hours, however, it was driven slowly to allow people to witness the procession and bow their heads as it passed.\n\nAn honor guard made up of the Royal Regiment of Scotland greeted the hearse in Edinburgh with a royal salute before the coffin was transferred to the Throne Room by a military bearer party.\n\nMeanwhile, back in London, the King met with the Commonwealth secretary general before hosting a reception for the high commissioners from the realms of which he is now head of state in Buckingham Palace's Bow Room.\n\nOn Monday morning, the King started the day with a trip to Westminster Hall where both Houses of Parliament expressed their condolences.

They were followed by senior staff from the royal households as well as close personal staff and members of the Household Division. As crowds watched the procession -- which took around 40 minutes -- Big Ben tolled and minute guns fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery at Hyde Park echoed across the capital.\n\nThe Queen's coffin was placed on a raised platform -- or catafalque -- in the middle of the hall and is being guarded around the clock by officers from the Household Division, the King's Bodyguard or the Royal Company of Archers.\n\nUpon its arrival at Westminster Hall, a short service was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, after which the hall opened for the public to pay their respects.\n\nKing Charles III walks with his sons behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the public filed past the Queen's coffin during its first full day lying in state at Westminster Hall on Thursday.\n\nThe hall will be open 24 hours a day until 6:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m.) on the day of the Queen's funeral.

The sheer numbers caused queueing to be temporily paused on Friday.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News earlier this week, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said of the scale: “If you think about the London marathon, the carnival, previous royal weddings, the Olympics – it’s all that in one.”\n\nThe three police forces which operate in the British capital – the Metropolitan Police, the City of London Police and British Transport Police – initiated their well-rehearsed plans across London as soon as the death of Elizabeth II was announced on September 8.\n\nThe funeral will be the “largest single policing event” that London’s Metropolitan Police force has undertaken, its Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy told reporters Friday.\n\n“As a single event, this is larger than the 2012 Olympics. It is larger than the Platinum Jubilee weekend. And the range of officers, police staff, and all those supporting the operation is truly immense,” he said.\n\nIt is also set to “be the largest global protection operation the Met Police has ever undertaken” as “hundreds of world leaders and VIPs” descend upon London, he said.\n\nWhen asked specifically how high-profile guests would be transported to London’s Westminster Abbey for the funeral service, Cundy declined to give specific details, saying it would not be conducive to a “safe and secure event and policing operation.”\n\nMeanwhile the mammoth logistical operation has involved myriad other aspects, such as medics, toilets, street cleaning and road closures.\n\nThe size of the crowds turning out to pay their last respects is “impossible” to predict, according to Andy Byford, commissioner for Transport for London (TfL).\n\nByford described the funeral as “the biggest event” the transport network has ever faced in an interview with Britain’s PA Media news agency.\n\nComparing it to the Olympics, he said: “This is more challenging. It’s over a long period and although there are estimates, it is impossible to say with certainty how many people will turn up to the various elements, so we’ve assumed the highest possible number and we’re aligning our service to match that.”\n\nInvitations have been sent to world leaders, politicians, public figures and European royals, as well as more than 500 international dignitaries. The security considerations are mind-boggling.\n\nCrowds have been growing in London in the run-up to the Queen's funeral. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe British government is taking the lead on logistics but has refused to comment on specific “operational security arrangements.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden was among the first to confirm his attendance at the event, which will be attended by up to 2,000 people. Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako will also travel to London, as will many other royals and global leaders.\n\nHundreds of police officers from other forces are supporting the Met, yet the attendance of so many VIPs will pile on the pressure.\n\n“Everything will have been negotiated,” said Morgan, explaining that some concessions will have been made. There simply aren’t enough police and protection officers to give an escorted convoy to everybody who would normally get it on a standalone visit. Therefore people are being put together on a logistical basis,” Morgan said continued.\n\nHuge crowds have waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the Queen lying in state before her funeral. Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSimon Morgan is a former royalty protection officer who was responsible for overseeing senior royals including the Queen and new King between 2007 and 2013.\n\n“It will be seamless,” Morgan, who now runs private security firm Trojan Consultancy, told CNN. “The policing plan and security behind it is a two-fold operation: security and public safety are both intrinsic.”\n\nMorgan said the events surrounding the state funeral have been in the pipeline for decades. “London Bridge came to fruition in the 60s. It’s been subject to review at least three times a year.\n\n“Elements are discussed and indeed some elements have been already used in isolation,” he said, citing the Queen Mother’s funeral in 2002, royal weddings and the Platinum Jubilee as examples.\n\nRegular reviews were vital in combating the changing nature of security threats – from Irish nationalism in the 1970s and 80s, to Islamic extremism more recently.\n\nWhite House aides have declined to provide specific security details for President Biden’s visit, but say they are working with their British counterparts to ensure the demands of presidential security are met. The FBI will monitor potential threat streams and share any information with UK security service MI5.\n\nWhen reports emerged last week that world leaders would be required to ride on a bus to the funeral, US officials were skeptical and shot down the suggestion Biden would travel to Westminster Abbey in a coach.\n\nIn 2018, when other world leaders traveled together in a bus to a World War I memorial in Paris, then-US President Donald Trump traveled separately in his own vehicle. The White House explained at the time the separate trip was “due to security protocols.”\n\n“Everything will have been negotiated,” said Morgan, explaining that some concessions will have been made. There simply aren’t enough police and protection officers to give an escorted convoy to everybody who would normally get it on a standalone visit. Therefore people are being put together on a logistical basis,” Morgan said.\n\n“There’s no compromise in relation to security and a lot of visiting dignitaries will be very aware of the optics of demanding their own protection teams.”\n\nPolice must also consider the “fixated threat,” he said. “That’s someone who is fixated on a member of the royal family. A lot of those people are subject to mental health orders and subsequently came to the attention of medical professionals and sometimes law enforcement.”\n\n“Single cause” activists also pose a risk, Morgan said. The force has already come in for harsh criticism over its treatment of republican protesters.\n\n“Every single one of these causes wants to use global media attention to highlight what’s important to them,” he added.\n\nSymon Hill, from Oxford, told CNN how he was aggressively arrested after calling out “not my King” at a ceremony which proclaimed Charles III’s accession. He said he had been left “gobsmacked” after “police intervened, grabbed hold of me, handcuffed me, and put me in the back of a police van.”\n\nHe added: “Surely arbitrary arrest is not something we should have in a democratic society.”\n\nAccording to Morgan, police aim not to ban peaceful protests but ensure public order, as demonstrations can sometimes provoke confrontation when emotions are running high.\n\n“The police are very much in a ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ situation,” he said.\n\nWhile police are spearheading the operation, many others are closely involved – among them military, transport and utility bosses.\n\nPreparing London for the Queen's funeral has been a massive operation which has been decades in the planning. Richard Baker/In Pictures/Getty Images\n\nConcerns over health are paramount. As well as the official emergency services, around 2,000 volunteers and employees from St. John Ambulance have provided 24-hour support in London and Windsor for the lying-in-state, as well as her funeral.\n\n“In our planning for this sad occasion, we estimated we’d need around 1,000 volunteers, but more than double that have said they can make themselves available,” St. John Commissioner of Operations Mike Gibbons said in a statement.\n\nPatrick Goulbourne, assistant commissioner, operational resilience and control, at London Fire Brigade, told CNN his team worked “over many years with partners.”\n\nThey have carried out fire safety inspections on over 40 key central transport hubs and have also been carrying out around 160 fire safety inspections a day at hotels, restaurants, shops and more. In addition, there have been 10 fire engines and around 50 firefighters assisting people in line to see the Queen’s coffin around the clock.", "authors": ["Lianne Kolirin"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/uk/royal-news-newsletter-09-16-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Inside Westminster Hall, where the Queen is lying in state - CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in a special September 16 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon (CNN) The tapping of a sword echoes through Westminster Hall. Here, in the oldest part of the Houses of Parliament, it reverberates instantly around the space, stopping people in their tracks and capturing their attention.\n\nMoments later, footfalls on ancient steps resound as soldiers from units serving the Royal Household march into the room to relieve the guard around the Queen's coffin.\n\nMembers of the public watch as the new guard makes its way in perfect synchronicity to the central platform, mesmerized by the jingling of medals as the soldiers move.\n\nWith another tap, the old guard troops out and its replacement takes up position, standing perfectly still beneath the 11th-century hall's medieval roof.\n\nThe crowd reanimates once more and the lines streaming past the catafalque resume. Here, beneath these ancient timber beams, ancient traditions are playing out in present day.\n\nThe Queen has been lying in state since Wednesday, when her coffin was conveyed to Westminster Hall in a somber procession that saw King Charles III, Princes William and Harry and other senior royals follow behind on foot. It will remain here until the morning of the Queen's state funeral on Monday.\n\nThe Queen's mother and father both lay in state here before her: King George VI in 1952, and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 2002. So did her grandfather George V in 1936 and her great-grandfather Edward VII in 1910 -- the first royal to lie in state.\n\nTo maintain a continuous vigil, each watch lasts for 20 minutes.\n\nState funerals are only reserved for monarchs, however, there has been one exception: Elizabeth II's first prime minister, Winston Churchill. He also lay in state in the hall after his death in 1965.\n\nAs candlelight glistens on the symbols of state atop the coffin -- the Imperial State Crown and the Sovereign's Orb and Sceptre -- mourners pay their respects to the late monarch. Some young, some old, families with children in school uniforms, those of faith and those of none -- all are here to say farewell and thank the Queen for her lifelong service.\n\nThe walk from one end of the hall doesn't take long -- a few minutes at most. After waiting for hours in The Queue, sometimes overnight, the fleeting moment they've all been waiting for finally arrives.\n\nMen pause briefly to bow to the coffin while several women perform a deep, respectful curtsey. Some simply smile or nod their head. Others take a moment to blow a kiss toward the catafalque. Then there are the older military veterans, with medals proudly displayed, who stand to attention and perform one last salute to their former commander-in-chief.\n\nMembers of the public view the Queen's coffin, which is draped with the Royal Standard, on which lie the Instruments of State -- the Imperial State Crown and the Orb and Sceptre.\n\nMany in the queue have waited for hours and hours to get to this point. But as each person finds their own way to acknowledge the Queen, some stopping the flow of movement for the briefest of seconds, no one complains. Those in line wait patiently for the person ahead of them to do what they need to do before they move forward, and on toward the exit.\n\nAs the mourners reach the far side of the hall, almost every single person -- including us -- stops and turns back for one final look and to say a silent goodbye to the only monarch most have ever known.\n\n(CNN's James Frater contributed to this story.)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe King walks with his family behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday.\n\nQueen's funeral details revealed.\n\nFriday usually means it's time for your weekly dose of royal headlines.

The state funeral in central London gets underway from 11 a.m. and then a committal service at St. George's Chapel will take place from 4 p.m.\n\nFEATURED PHOTOS\n\nOnly a minority will remember firsthand what life was like the last time the UK buried a monarch. Images taken in 1952 following the death of the Queen's father, King George VI, reveal just how much the country -- and the world -- has changed.\n\nJust like today, crowds poured into central London in February of that year, hoping to catch a glimpse of George VI's funeral procession.

The company also said it would increase its dividends to shareholders by 10%. Shares nudged up in London Stock Exchange trading.\n\nAcross the board, Its been bumper profits for energy giants: Companies including Shell (SHLX) and Exxon (XOM) posted strong results in recent weeks as global oil prices have soared.\n\nBut those profits are coming under intense scrutiny from lawmakers, and harsh criticism from consumers.\n\nThe combined impact of rising energy bills and food prices has plunged millions of Britons into the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. In March, the country’s Office for Budget Responsibility said that living standards, measured by levels of household disposable income, had suffered their biggest drop since records began in 1956.\n\nNow, people in the United Kingdom, struggling with inflation at a 40-year high, will likely see their energy bills increase this winter, according to new research.\n\nThe average energy bill is expected to rise 83% from its current level to top £3,600 ($4,397) a year beginning January for millions of UK households, according to estimates from research firm Cornwall Insight published Tuesday.\n\nThat’s up 7% from its previous estimate made in early July.\n\nAs a result, the firm expects the average household will spend more than £300 a month ($366) to power their homes. And the pain will continue well into next year and beyond.\n\n“It is not only the level — but the duration — of the rises that makes these new forecasts so devastating,” Craig Lowrey, a principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said in a press release.\n\n“This level of household energy bills currently shows little sign of abating into 2024,” he added.\n\nHousehold energy bills have already risen by 54% this year as wholesale natural gas prices — exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February — have soared to record levels.\n\nOfgem, the UK’s energy regulator, is next due to raise its price cap — the maximum suppliers can charge customers per unit of energy — in October. Many households, already struggling with historically high inflation, are bracing for a huge hit to their finances.\n\nActivists have been sounding the alarm for months. By January, more than half of UK households — about 15 million — are predicted to fall into “fuel poverty,” spending more than 10% of their overall income on energy, according to estimates by the Child Poverty Action Group.\n\nCost-of-living crisis\n\nMega profits have fueled calls for the government to hike a windfall tax on energy companies to ease households’ bills.\n\n“The market is failing and millions will struggle to keep warm this winter,” the End Fuel Poverty Coalition said in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nThe campaign group said the UK government, and the two candidates vying to replace Boris Johnson as the next prime minister, were “sleepwalking into [a] nightmare.”\n\nEarlier this year, the UK government said it would introduce a 25% tax on the profits of energy producers, which is expected to collect around £5 billion ($6 billion). The tax will help pay for a package of support worth around £15 billion ($18 billion), including a £400 ($488) grant to 29 million households from October.\n\nBut the grant will only “scratch the surface of [the] problem,” according to Lowrey.\n\n“Our new figures show that even increasing support for October will not make much of a dent in what is likely to be a sustained period of high energy bills,” he said.\n\n— CNN Business’ Julia Horowitz contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/economy/uk-energy-bills-poverty/index.html", "title": "A third of Brits face poverty with energy bills set to hit $5,000 - CNN", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nNearly one third of households in the United Kingdom will face poverty this winter after paying energy bills that are set to soar again in January, campaigners say.\n\nAbout 10.5 million households will be in fuel poverty for the first three months of next year, according to estimates from the End Fuel Poverty Coalition (EFPC) published on Tuesday — meaning that their income after paying for energy will fall below the poverty line.\n\nThe UK government defines poverty as household income of less than 60% of the UK median, which stood at £31,000 ($37,500) in 2021, according to official statistics.\n\nThe predictions are based on new estimates from research firm Cornwall Insight, also published Tuesday, which show that the average household energy bill is expected to hit £3,582 ($4,335) a year from October, and £4,266 ($5,163) from January — equating to about £355 ($430) a month.\n\nJanuary’s forecast represents a 116% increase in energy bills from current levels. As fuel prices surge, estimates are having trouble keeping pace. Just last week, Cornwall Insight predicted January’s prices would rise by 83% from current levels.\n\nThe research firm said it had revised its figures because of a jump in wholesale prices and a change in the way the UK regulator calculates its price cap. But there could be relief on the horizon: Cornwall Insight expects bills to start falling in the second half of 2023.\n\nFuel bills started rising last year as a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February has only exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe average UK household bill has already risen 54% this year, exacerbating a cost-of-living crisis that has forced many Britons to choose between “heating and eating.”\n\nIn May, the government announced a £15 billion ($18 billion) package of support — including a £400 ($484) payment to 29 million households from October — to ease the burden of energy bills.\n\nBut Simon Francis, coordinator for the EFPC, said the latest price estimates meant the current level of government support amounted to a “drop in the ocean.”\n\nCraig Lowrey, a principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said in a Tuesday press release that if “£400 was not enough to make a dent in the impact of [the company’s] previous forecast, it most certainly is not enough now.”\n\nLiz Truss, the UK’s foreign minister and current frontrunner to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister next month, has proposed cutting taxes to help people struggling with their bills, rather than direct help. Her rival, former finance minister Rishi Sunak, has said more support will be needed.\n\nMeanwhile, the CBI — the country’s top business organization — has urged Johnson to bring the leadership candidates together to agree on a way to support households and businesses with their energy bills so that measures can be announced as soon as the October price cap is set on August 26.

Their results were published in the journal Cell Reports on Tuesday.\n\nDr. Manel Esteller, a researcher at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, said that he worked on research involving twins in the past, but for this project, he was interested in people who look alike but have no actual family connection going back almost 100 years.\n\nGeneviève Kirouac and Dominique Sévigny - (Michael Malone and Charles Hall Chasen)\n\nArt leads to science\n\nSo, he turned to art to answer a question about science. He and his co-authors recruited 32 people with look-alikes who were part of a photo project “I’m not a look-alike!,” done by a Canadian artist, François Brunelle.\n\nThe researchers asked the pairs to do a DNA test. The pairs filled out questionnaires about their lives. The scientists also put their images through three different facial recognition programs. Of the people they recruited, 16 pairs had similar scores to identical twins identified using the same software. The other 16 pairs may have looked the same to the human eye, but the algorithm didn’t think so in one of the facial recognition programs.\n\nResearchers then took a closer look at participants’ DNA. The pairs the facial recognition software said were similar had many more genes in common than the other 16 pairs.\n\n“We were able to see that these look alike humans, in fact, they are sharing several genetic variants. And these are very common among them,” Esteller said. “So they share these genetic variants that are related in a way that they have the shape of the nose, the eye, the mouth, the lips, and even the bone structure. And this was the main conclusion that genetics puts them together. ”\n\nThese are similar codes, he said, but it is just by random chance.\n\n“In the world right now, there are so many people that eventually the system is producing humans with similar DNA sequences,” Esteller said. This likely was always true, but now with the internet, it’s a lot easier to find them.\n\nBeatriz Nogueira and Bruna Soares Da Costa - (Joshua Corrigan and Francisco Costela)\n\nOther factors at play\n\nWhen they looked closer at the pairs, they determined other factors were different, he said.\n\n“There’s the reason they are not completely identical,” Esteller said.\n\nWhen scientists looked closer at what they call the epigenomes of the doppelgängers that looked most alike, there were bigger differences. Epigenetics is the study of how the environment and behavior can cause changes in the way a person’s genes work. When the scientists looked at the microbiome of the pairs that looked most alike, those were different, too. The microbiome are the microorganisms – the viruses, bacteria, and fungi too small to see with the human eye – that live in the human body.\n\n“These results not only provide insights about the genetics that determine our face but also might have implications for the establishment of other human anthropometric properties and even personality characteristics,” the study said.\n\nThe study does have limitations. The sample size was small, so it is difficult to say that these results would be true for a larger group of look-alikes. Although researchers believe that their findings would change in a larger group. The study also focused on pairs that were largely of European origin, so it is unclear if the results would be the same for people who come from other parts of the planet.\n\nDr. Karen Gripp a pediatrician and geneticist at Nemours Children’s Health whose research is referenced in this work, said the study is really interesting and validates a lot of the research that comes before it.\n\nIgnacio Contreras and Antonio Carranza - (Elisabeth De Freitas and Meira France Desranleau)\n\nReal world application of the science\n\nGripp uses facial analysis software in her work with patients who might have genetic conditions to assess her patient’s facial features which might be suggestive of certain genetic conditions.\n\n“It’s a little bit different from the study, but it really points in the same direction that changes in a person’s genetic material affect the facial structures, and that’s really the same underlying assumption that was used in this study as being indeed confirmed, in contrast to some other things like the microbiome did not seem to be as relevant,” Gripp said.\n\nAs far as the nature versus nurture question the study brings up, Gripp thinks that both are important.\n\n“As a geneticist, I firmly believe in the nature and the genetic material being very important to almost everything, but that does not take away from saying nurture is just as important,” Gripp said. “For every person to be successful in the world there are so many contributing factors and the environment is so important that I don’t think it’s one or the other.”\n\nMelissa Thorkilsen and Andrea Chalon - (André Ravary and Jean Aumais)\n\nA potential problem\n\nThe study she said also points out that there are still limits to the accuracy of facial recognition software. While several cities concerned about privacy issues and misidentification problems have enacted rules banning or restricting local police from using facial-recognition software, the federal government and some local law enforcement have been using it more frequently.\n\nA 2021 federal investigation found that at least 16 federal agencies use it for digital access or cybersecurity, 6 use it to generate leads in criminal investigations, and 10 more said they planned to expand its use.\n\nIt’s also used more commonly at airports. Some companies use it to help make hiring decisions. Some landlords have installed it so tenants can enter buildings. Some schools use it to take attendance and to monitor movements in public spaces on college campuses.\n\n“If you translate this study into the real world, that shows you a potential pitfall that digital facial analysis tools could misidentify somebody,” Gripp said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhile the technology has been improving, in past studies, the technology has already been shown to be far less accurate when identifying people of color, and several Black men, have been wrongfully arrested due to facial recognition.\n\n“If you think about the facial recognition software that often opens computer screens and things like that, misidentification is possible. So I think this has taught us something very important about facial analysis tools too,” Gripp said.\n\nBut the study does seem to suggest one conclusion. At least physically, we may not be all that unique.\n\n“I think all of us right now have somebody that looks like us, a double,” Esteller said.\n\nWhile some would prefer to be singular in their look, Malone, who happens to be friends with his double, is heartened by the fact that he is not alone in his looks. His similarity to his friend has made them closer, and he thinks if more people knew how similar they were to others, that maybe they, too, could find commonality, especially in this polarized world.\n\n“It’s made me realize that we are all connected,” Malone said. “We’re all connected because humankind probably starts with one little thing.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/06/22/study-balancing-one-leg-predicts-life-longevity/7697219001/", "title": "Balancing on one leg for 10 seconds predicts lifespan, health: study", "text": "You're twice as likely to die in the next decade if you're unable to balance on one foot for 10 seconds, according to a new study.\n\nConversely, the study suggests that your ability to balance on one foot points to longer life expectancy.\n\nThe peer-reviewed study conducted by Brazilian researchers, published Tuesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, determined that a person's balance ability can be preserved into the sixth decade of one's life – meaning it's more broad of an indicator of life expectancy across age ranges than aerobic fitness, flexibility or muscle strength.\n\nDr. Claudio Gil Soares de Araújo, the lead author of the study and a sports and exercise physician at the Exercise Medicine Clinic Clinimex in Rio de Janeiro, said poor balance is linked to frailty in older adults and one's musculoskeletal fitness is a prime indicator of declining health.\n\nChill time:It’s Mental Health Awareness month—focus on self-care with these relaxing products\n\nTurning 60 soon?:Here are 3 smart money moves that will improve life in retirement\n\n\"If you are younger than 70 years, you are expected (as the majority of those at that age) to successfully complete the 10 seconds,\" Araújo told USA TODAY in an emailed statement. \"For those older than 70 years of age, if you complete it, you are in better static balance status than your age-peers. ...The advantages of the 10s OLS test include the fact that it is simple and it provides rapid, safe and objective feedback for the patient and health care providers regarding static balance.\"\n\nIn conjunction with suggesting regular doctor visits feature a balance test, Araújo recommended that people try a 15-second balance test of their own during their morning routine when they're brushing their teeth at home, to use as a barometer for their well-being.\n\nResearchers in the study zeroed in on 1,702 participants from ages 51 to 75 for the study, with the average age set at 61. Their first checkup – study participants were tracked starting in 2008 – collected data on their weight, waist size and measures of body fat. Only individuals who could walk steadily were included in their analysis. Then, the participants were all asked to stand on one leg for 10 seconds without holding onto anything for support. One in 5 failed the test. Each participant got three tries to put the back of their other foot on the weight-bearing leg, which could be barefoot or with a proper tennis shoe on.\n\nThe inability of participants to pass the balance test increased with age, while those with weight problems or diabetes were more likely to fail. The study's finalized research factored in age, sex, BMI, history of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. The final results determined that the risk of death within a 10-year span was 1.84-fold higher in participants who failed the balance test versus those who passed it.\n\nThe test has its limits, Araújo noted: \"This is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause.

More than 59% of the people who drank unsafe amounts of alcohol were between 15 and 39. Over two-thirds were men.\n\nIn every geographic region, the study found drinking alcohol does not provide any health benefits to people under age 40 but does raise the risk of injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides.\n\nThe study defined a standard drink as 10 grams of pure alcohol, which might be a small 3.4-fluid ounce (100 milliliters) glass of red wine, a 12-fluid ounce (355 milliliters) standard can or bottle of beer (3.5% alcohol) or a 1-fluid ounce shot of spirits (30 milliliters) that is 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nConclusions criticized\n\nWhile praising the analysis as well-conducted, some experts not involved with the research expressed concern about the study’s conclusions.\n\nStatistics show there are “over 14 times as many alcohol-attributable deaths in the UK among 70-74 year-olds than 20-24 year olds,” said Colin Angus, a senior research fellow at the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the UK’s University of Sheffield, in a statement. The data “contradicts the assertion in this new study that we should focus on the drinking of younger age groups,” Angus said.\n\n“The elephant in the room with this study is the interpretation of risk based on outcomes for cardiovascular disease – particularly in older people,” said Dr. Tony Rao, visiting clinical research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.\n\n“We know that any purported health benefits from alcohol on the heart and circulation are balanced out by the increased risk from other conditions such as cancer, liver disease and mental disorders such as depression and dementia,” Rao said in a statement.\n\nA study published in March found just one pint of beer or glass of wine a day can shrink the overall volume of the brain, with the damage increasing as the number of daily drinks rises. On average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank half of a beer.\n\nResearch in the US has shown drinking among adults rose during pandemic, particularly among women, with “a 41% increase in heavy drinking days,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nA study published in June found many moderate drinkers over age 30 binge on the weekend – defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time. Drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men – or five or more drinks on the same occasion – was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAA. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, it said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with those who abstain.\n\n“The recommendation that those under 40 should not drink at all is totally unrealistic,” Matt Lambert, CEO of the Portman Group, an industry-funded group that regulates alcohol marketing in the UK, said in an email.\n\nGakidou, the study’s senior author, admitted that “it’s not realistic to think young adults will stop drinking. Still, we think it’s important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.”\n\nFor those over age 65, any increase in drinking is worrisome because many older adults “use medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,” the NIAA said.\n\n“There is a high threshold for being able to say that alcohol is an effective prevention therapy, and the studies so far do not reach that threshold. If they did, then you can be sure that the drinks industry would be applying to the FDA for a license,” said Dr. Nick Sheron, a professor in the hepatology department at the UK’s University of Southampton.\n\n‘A more detailed and nuanced analysis’\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation last published a report on alcohol four years ago when it analyzed 2016 Global Burden of Disease data on people 15 to 49, finding no amount of liquor, wine or beer was safe for overall health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“What we have done in this new study is a more detailed and nuanced analysis of 21 different world regions,” Gakidou said. “What we’ve been able to do now is break it down: Who is alcohol harmful for?

It's a medley of symptoms that can occur months -- and even years -- after recovering from Covid, according to a new study of more 1 million people from eight countries.\n\nAdult risk of developing seizure disorders, brain fog, dementia and other mental health conditions remain high two years after recovering from Covid-19, the study found.\n\n\"These are important findings, but they shouldn't lead to panic,\" said coauthor Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the UK. \"We're not talking about things that are 10 or 100 times more common. I think the worst odds ratio is sort of two or three.\"\n\nChildren had an increased risk of being diagnosed with epilepsy or seizures, encephalitis and nerve root disorders, which can cause pain, weakness or loss of sensation in an arm or a leg. There was also a small, but worrisome risk of being diagnosed with a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or delusional thinking.\n\n\"This is an extremely robust and well conducted study, using data from a large sample, and across multiple nations,\" said Rachel Sumner, senior research fellow at Cardiff Metropolitan University in the UK, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"The findings are alarming and are critically important in our current context of unmitigated Covid spread,\" she added via email.\n\nThe study's conclusions match the clinical experience of Dr. Aaron Friedberg, a clinical assistant professor of internal medicine who works in the Post-Covid Recovery Program at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center in Columbus.\n\n\"I just talked to someone who had been originally diagnosed more than two years ago with Covid, but they're only seeing a post-Covid specialist today,\" said Friedberg, who was not involved in the study. \"That doesn't necessarily mean they're getting those symptoms two years later. It means they are just being diagnosed with them.\"\n\nFriedberg also said he sees people suffering severe symptoms two years after diagnosis.\n\n\"They can't think, they can't breathe.

TriNetX is an international network of data without any identifying factors from hospital, primary care and specialist providers. About 89 million patients are in the data pool.\n\nA woman gets tested for the coronavirus in June in Berlin.\n\nThe study looked at 1.25 million patients two years after their Covid-19 diagnosis and compared them with a closely matched group of 1.25 million people who had a different respiratory infection.\n\n\"We compared those two groups of patients in terms of 14 major neurological and psychiatric disorders in the two years after the Covid-19 or respiratory infection,\" said coauthor Maxime Taquet, an academic clinical fellow in psychiatry at the National Institute for Health and Care Research's Biomedical Research Centre in the UK.\n\nThe research team looked at the following conditions: anxiety disorders; mood disorders; psychotic disorder; insomnia; cognitive deficit (a composite of codes to capture so-called brain fog); dementia; epilepsy or seizures; encephalitis; intracranial hemorrhage; stroke; parkinsonism ; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders; and neuromuscular and muscle disease. Researchers also looked at deaths from any cause.\n\nMost of the patients were from the United States, but the study also included people from Australia, the UK, Spain, Bulgaria, India, Malaysia and Taiwan.\n\nThe study could not tell if people had experienced ongoing symptoms for the full two years since a Covid-19 diagnosis: \"That might be the case, it may not be the case,\" Taquet said. \"This data is only looking at the number of new diagnoses being made, not the persistence or the duration of the symptoms.\"\n\nThe news was both good and bad.\n\nFor adults, the risk of developing \"brain fog, dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy and seizures remain elevated throughout the two years\" when compared with people with other respiratory conditions, Taquet said.\n\nAdults over the age of 65 had a 1.2% increase in the risk of being diagnosed with dementia, the study said. While \"it's very clear that this is not a tsunami of new dementia cases, equally (I think) it's hard to ignore it, given the severity of the consequences of dementia diagnosis,\" he said.\n\nThere was some good news for adults, Taquet added: \"Risk of some disorders -- in particular anxiety and mood disorders -- disappeared within two to three months, with no overall excess number of cases over the two years.\"\n\nEffect on children\n\nThere was also good news for children: \"The risk of brain fog in children was transient -- there was no overall risk,\" Taquet said. Nor were children at any greater risk of being diagnosed with anxiety and depression after Covid-19, \"even in the first six months,\" he said.\n\nBut there were disturbing findings when it came to other conditions. For example, children had a \"twofold increased risk of epilepsy and seizures,\" Taquet said, and a \"threefold increased risk of a psychotic disorder diagnosis in two years after having Covid compared to those diagnosed with another respiratory tract infection.\"\n\nIn the study of 10,000 children with a Covid-19 diagnosis, 260 had developed epilepsy and seizures within two years, compared with 130 out of 10,000 children diagnosed with another respiratory tract infection, which was a \"twofold increased risk,\" Taquet said,\n\nThere was a threefold increased risk of a psychotic disorder diagnosis in children two years after a Covid-19 infection, Taquet said. Yet \"the absolute risk remains quite low,\" he said, with 18 diagnosed cases of psychosis out of 10,000 children.\n\n\"I think we need to be careful in the interpretation of the reported small increases in dementia and psychosis,\" said Paul Garner, an emeritus professor in evidence synthesis in global health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK. Garner was not involved in the study.\n\n\"These are, in my opinion, more likely to be related to the societal upheaval and dystopia we have been living through rather than being a direct effect of the virus.\"\n\nA long-term impact\n\nOverall, evidence from the study is \"particularly worrisome,\" Cardiff's Sumner said, because even Covid-19 variants considered to be milder appear to have the same long-term consequences.\n\nIn addition, \"some of these disorders will continue to have delay in diagnosis and treatment with healthcare systems that are struggling to deal with both Covid infections and backlogs of patient waiting lists,\" Sumner added.\n\nThat reality matches the clinical experience of doctors such as Friedberg, who has been treating long Covid patients since not long after the pandemic began.\n\n\"I've got severe post-Covid (patients) from the ancestral strain from March 2020, and I've got the same in people who developed it a few months ago. So I think it can be equally severe with any of these variants,\" he said.\n\nYet Friedberg told CNN there have been \"zero public policy decisions\" about what happens after Covid-19.\n\n\"The idea that maybe there's this terrible thing that's happening that we won't appreciate until months or years later isn't being addressed adequately,\" Friedberg said.\n\n\"Say kids just can't run as much as they used to, or have seizure disorders now, or adults just can't handle as many tasks of work or have trouble caring for their kids at home because they've just got brain fog, they've got chronic shortness of breath.\n\n\"If that starts happening to, let's say, 5% of the population each time there's a Covid wave, that starts to add up.\"", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/health/cancer-deaths-preventable-study/index.html", "title": "Almost half of cancer deaths globally are attributable to preventable ...", "text": "(CNN) Globally, nearly half of deaths due to cancer can be attributable to preventable risk factors, including the three leading risks of: smoking, drinking too much alcohol or having a high body mass index, a new paper suggests.\n\nJUST WATCHED See how AI can predict future cancer risk Replay More Videos ...

That marks a rapid change within a few generations, given that only 3.8% of women earned more than their husbands in 1960, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nTo be sure, that means about half of American women say they earn less than their partners. With International Women’s Day observed on March 8, the United Nations says no country has yet achieved gender parity. And the gender pay gap in the U.S. is still very real, with the country coming in at 53rd out of 153 countries in equality.\n\nYet in a growing number of U.S. households, women are now earning more than their husbands and partners. There are plenty of emotions about this shift – but mostly among women, the TD Ameritrade study found.\n\nWhen men and women were asked how they felt about earning more than their partners, most men shrugged it off by saying they were “neutral” about it. Women breadwinners, though, were far more likely than men to describe themselves as secure, proud, independent and in control – although they were also more likely to say they felt guilty and embarrassed.\n\nThe sense of pride is one that rings true with Beth Shocki, 38, who works in advertising and lives with her husband and two daughters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Shocki says she earns about twice the income of her husband, a high school guidance counselor.\n\n“There are a lot of emotions tied to it because we're used to society thinking the man is the sole provider,” she says. For her, it didn’t hit home until she and her husband had children when she understood she would never be a stay-at-home mom like her own mother.\n\n“It was that realization that I was the breadwinner and I would always be working,” Shocki adds. But, she points out, it’s also an empowering role that lets her set an example for their daughters, who are 2 and 4.\n\nMarriage Finances:After the wedding, should you marry your money in a joint account? Here are 3 approaches.\n\nSharing bank accounts with your spouse:Should you share a checking account with your spouse or keep separate bank accounts? It depends\n\nMillennial shift\n\nIt’s likely that more women will become their families’ breadwinners in years to come, given that more women are enrolled in college now than men, points out Valiere Simpson, managing director of investor services at TD Ameritrade. That’s because workers with college degrees typically earn more than those with only high school degrees.\n\nAlready, there are clear generational shifts, with millennial women almost twice as likely as women in the baby boomer generation to earn the same as their partners, she says. But more than 1 in 5 millennials say they experience negative friction in their relationship because one partner earns more – yet only 1 in 10 boomers say it causes friction.\n\n“Millennials are facing different challenges” such as college debt and cultivating their careers, Simpson points out. “That puts more pressure on them to think about their finances.”\n\nMillennials are also getting married later than previous generations, giving them years to establish their financial habits and independence, she adds.\n\n“We’ve recently seen a trend among millennials where they value their independence more than other generations, specifically as it relates to their finances,” says Dana Marineau, vice president and financial advocate at Credit Karma.\n\nAbout two of three millennials in relationships keep at least one separate bank account from their partner, Marineau says. That suggests “they enjoy the freedom to spend their money how they want,” she adds.\n\nWho makes investment decisions?\n\nYet there’s still a wide gender gap when it comes to which partner is calling the financial shots, according to TD Ameritrade. About two-thirds of men say they make their household’s investment decisions, the survey found.\n\nThat speaks to the need to improve women’s financial literacy, TD Ameritrade’s Simpson says. Almost 6 in 10 women said they wished they had more confidence in their financial decision making, according to a recent study from Allianz Life.\n\nAt the very least, the partner who is managing finances should provide a report or explanation about their decisions to the other, says Shelly-Ann Eweka, wealth management director at TIAA. But, she adds, more women should be involved in those investment choices, especially because women have longer lives than men on average and will need to make their retirement income stretch for more years.\n\nFor Shocki of North Carolina, taking on the role of breadwinner is empowering.

Before you start revisiting all your favorite recipes: Researchers were only looking at how much salt was added after the meals in question were cooked, according to findings published in the European Heart Journal in July.\n\nResearchers followed up with participants about nine years later and found that the more salt people had added to their meals, the greater their chance of early death. However, those people consuming high levels of salt could lower their risk by eating more fruits and vegetables, the study said.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends adults consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of salt per day – but notes the “ideal limit” is 1,500 milligrams per day. Consuming too much salt can raise blood pressure, which in turn can cause heart disease, stroke and kidney disease, the heart association said.\n\nThe UK National Health Service recommends that adults limit their sodium intake to about a teaspoon of salt a day.\n\nThere is a long track record of scientific research showing that a diet high in salt is risky, but this study adds a new level of caution against adding more to your plate, said lead study author Lu Qi, a professor of epidemiology at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans.\n\n“More evidence, especially those from clinical trials, is needed before the public takes any action,” he said. “However, our findings are in line with the previous studies which consistently show that high sodium intakes are adversely related to various health outcomes such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.”\n\nEven if you don’t add any salt to your own plate, you might be getting more sodium than you should be.\n\nGoing further to cut back\n\nA 2020 meta-analysis of 133 clinically randomized trials on lowering salt intake found strong evidence that cutting back dietary sodium reduced blood pressure in those with existing hypertension – and even in those who were not yet at risk.\n\nOne of the main culprits of high levels of sodium in our diets? Manufactured foods, which often use salt for flavor, texture, color and preservation. More than 70% of the sodium Americans eat comes from what has been added by the food industry to products later purchased in stores or restaurants, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\n“Most of my patients do not add salt at the dinner table, but don’t realize that bread rolls, canned vegetables and chicken breasts are among the worst culprits (of high sodium) in the US,” said Dr. Stephen Juraschek, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who researches sodium and hypertension.\n\nJuraschek was not involved in either the Biobank study or 2020 meta-analysis.\n\nBut salt makes everything taste so good, you may be thinking.\n\nThere are strategies, however, for keeping a vibrant palate and creating enticing dishes with less salt, said Carly Knowles, a registered dietitian who is also a private chef, licensed doula and the author of “The Nutritionist’s Kitchen” cookbook.\n\nKnowles recommends cooking at home – where you have more control over the salt shaker while making your meal – more often, reading the ingredients on your products, substituting in herb and spice blends without salt, and focusing your diet on minimally processed foods.", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}]}

This completed its long journey from Balmoral Castle to Edinburgh, then from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall and Westminster Abbey, and then finally to St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.\n\nThousands of mourners lined the streets to pay their final respects to the Queen, after her funeral earlier in the day.\n\nAfter the pomp and pageantry of the state funeral at Westminster, attended by leaders from across the globe, a more intimate committal service was held at St. George’s.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 04:14 - Source: CNN Watch key moments from Queen Elizabeth II's funeral\n\nAt the service’s conclusion, the Queen’s coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault – the resting place of many past monarchs. Below the chapel lie King George III, IV and V, William IV and others. Last year Prince Philip, the Queen’s husband, was also laid to rest there.\n\nBefore that King Charles stepped forward to place the Queen’s Company Camp Colour of the Grenadier Guards on the late monarch’s coffin.\n\nThen, the Lord Chamberlain, who is the most senior office in the Royal Household, broke his Wand of Office and placed it atop the coffin. The ceremonial breaking of the thin staff is to create symmetry with the three Instruments of State that have been removed, according to Buckingham Palace.\n\nWhile the Queen’s coffin was being lowered into the vault, the Dean of Windsor said a Psalm, before the Garter King of the Arms pronounced the styles and titles of the Queen. This concluded the public ceremonies devoted to her.\n\nHowever, the vault was not her final resting place.

Acres of red Beefeater uniforms. Forests of raised arms with cellphones snapping and filming. Flowers everywhere, whether laid in neat piles or pelting the black Jaguar hearse as it glided through town.\n\nAll to celebrate the final moments in the storied life of Queen Elizabeth II. A woman who made history. A woman who – in dying at age 96 after 70 years on the throne – was history.\n\nThe spectacle of it all was breathtaking. The crisply dressed military men and women in uniform with their gleaming epaulets; the impeccably behaved and beautifully groomed horses; the traditional gun carriage that carried the queen's father and grandfather, both kings, before her.\n\nAnd on the coffin, iconic symbols of controversial British power: A monarch’s scepter, an orb signifying God’s dominion over the Earth, and the Imperial State Crown with its nearly 3,000 sparkling diamonds.\n\nElizabeth II's funeral:Princess Kate, daughter Charlotte honor the queen with sweet details in attire\n\nFor once, this cacophonous global capital was reverently quiet. Often the loudest sound along the funeral procession route was that of hoofbeats. In a country and a world that so often lacks unity, there seemed to be nothing but.\n\nMany Londoners wore black. They lined streets and filled parks with decorum. There was a sense of shared allegiance in the air, if not to a royal institution than to a beloved figure.\n\n“It was nice to pay tribute for everything she’s done for the country,” said Thomas Gregory of Derby in typically understated British fashion, who along with his bulldog, Tink, had joined thousands watching the ceremonies on a large screen in Hyde Park just a couple of miles from Westminster Hall, where the queen's body had been lying in state.\n\nAs perhaps expected, there was little sobbing or hysterics on display. This is England, after all. But the stiff upper lip was quivering.\n\nIn one moment caught by photographers, Princess Charlotte, 7, daughter of Prince William, the heir to the throne, and Princess Kate, started to cry. The picture spoke for many.\n\nThe state funeral of Queen Elizabeth:History passing before us, never to be forgotten\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's final day of making history\n\nOver roughly six hours, from the start of the queen's funeral service at London’s Westminster Abbey around 11 a.m. local time until the solemn lowering of her casket beneath the floor of St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, thousands of Britons and billions of television viewers around the globe took in scenes out of a storybook.\n\nThe event drew a panoply of VIPs, from President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden to former British prime ministers and leaders of various British Commonwealth nations.\n\nBut all eyes were on the queen’s immediate family, from Prince Harry and his wife, Duchess Meghan, who exited royal service to live in the United States, to the newly minted and very much in mourning King Charles III. He left a handwritten note on his mother’s coffin reading “In loving and devoted memory,” signed Charles R, for \"Rex,\" Latin for king.\n\nThe event was at once ceremonially ancient and unavoidably modern. And in a testament to this queen’s unflaggingly steady reign, it also was unusually personal for a range of generations, despite the intensifying debate over the need for monarchs in the 21st century.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II funeral updates:Queen laid to rest alongside husband in private ceremony\n\n“Lizzy was fab. We liked Lizzy,” said Chanelle Tollervey of Hertfordshire. “My nan (grandmother) was devastated.”\n\nShe and her friend Lucy Hartnell, both 26, organized a viewing party picnic in Hyde Park, featuring what they assumed were the queen’s favorites: strawberries, cucumber sandwiches and cupcakes.\n\nTollervey summed up a nation’s mood in the simplest of terms, noting how truly strange the substitution of one simple word can be: “Singing ‘God Save the King’ is going to be weird.”\n\nHyde Park attendees grew silent as the service began to air on three large screens. Many viewers stood for the service's choral elements.\n\nNearly every person wore black or bore a British flag. As \"God Save the King\" began, people sang as the skies parted and a bright sun split the gray clouds.\n\nAfter the funeral ceremony ended, people raced to park exits amid cannon blasts so they could catch a glimpse of the procession carrying the queen’s coffin to Windsor. Many waited for nearly an hour for the motorcade to make its way from the abbey to the park, and in their exuberance at one point spontaneously broke into another chorus of “God Save the King.”\n\nWhen the queen's hearse finally drove swiftly by, the crowd clapped and cheered.\n\nPoignant moments at the queen's funeral:From emotional royals to funeral wreath\n\nA state funeral rooted in tradition and captured on smartphones\n\nPomp and circumstance abounded in a way not seen the state funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965. But in contrast to all that were countless 2022 touches.\n\nBeyond the ubiquitous smartphones, there were plenty of mourners lining the route dressed in shorts and T-shirts, a striking contrast to the almost blinding uniforms of those accompanying the body.\n\nSpeaking ill of the dead?:We can't ignore Queen Elizabeth's complicated legacy\n\nAnti-memorial:King Charles III must do better than his mother on colonialism and reparations. Will he?\n\nA viral moment was born out of the funeral service, when a bishop accidentally dropped a piece of paper and it found its way to the middle of Westminster Abbey. Tweeted @nickswhite, “Impressive work under pressure by the bishop who, having dropped a piece of paper which landed right in camera shot of the coffin, 5 mins later had managed to retrieve it out of shot.”\n\nAnd ultimately, there was the televised nature of the more intimate details of the ceremony itself: No one but invited guests – typically limited to family, close friends and members of state – had ever been allowed to view a monarch’s committal service. Sharing that normally private event had a way of making you feel as if everyone's grandmother had died.\n\nPapergate? Man drops piece of paper on ground near coffin during queen's funeral in viral moment\n\nBut for some of those who turned up in person to salute their queen, conclusions had not yet been reached on how to feel about the next chapter of the monarchy.\n\nElyas Hussein, 45, who traveled 125 miles from Birmingham to watch the funeral on the big screen in Hyde Park, had “mixed emotions” watching the ceremony.\n\n“She represented the Commonwealth,” he said, a collective of nations once part of an empire that was tightly and often brutally controlled by the Great Britain.\n\nHussein said his father served in the British Army’s Pakistan regiment, and both his uncles also served in the British Army. He expressed optimism about Charles, who is likely to streamline and perhaps refocus royal responsibilities as king.\n\n“I think King Charles will emulate his mother,” he said. “He’s done a lot for young people with The Prince’s Trust,” referring to Charles’ charity, which helps youths get jobs and education.\n\nThe queen's funeral:See King Charles III, Prince Harry, all royals who attended\n\nThe last British queen for many generations\n\nIn the end, the finality of it all was inescapable.\n\nNot only had Britain lost a monarch whose long reign may never be equaled, but the Windsor family had lost a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother who by all accounts cared deeply for her family throughout countless scandals, upheavals and deaths.\n\nAmong the most poignant images appeared as the queen’s coffin was driven up the long sloped driveway to the entrance of her beloved Windsor Castle, a place she most considered home.\n\nAs the hearse made its way to the entrance, a riderless black pony stood almost at attention, next to a handler with bowed head. This was the queen’s Fell pony Emma, one of many horses she doted on during a lifetime of devotion to those regal animals.\n\nAnd then up the road stood two dogs, both looking calm if perhaps a bit lost. Sandy and Muick, the queen’s corgis, just two of the dozens she had owned.\n\nThe queen was, once again, home, if now only in spirit.\n\nAs the committal service replete with sung hymns and liturgical readings wound down, there came a moment of marked transition. Crown jeweler Mark Appleby approached the coffin and carefully removed the scepter, orb and crown, which will be used in Charles' coronation sometime next year.\n\nThen, almost imperceptibly, the coffin lowered into the floor of the church. A bagpiper began to play. The last British queen for likely many generations to come went to her eternal rest, alongside her mother, father and sister.\n\nOn June 2, 1953, the Archbishop of Canterbury turned to a 26-year-old Elizabeth, newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II, and in a nod to her Church of England faith that would sustain her throughout her life, said, “May she be filled with thine abundant grace and princely virtues.”\n\nFor many Britons and admirers around the world, Queen Elizabeth embodied that 70-year-old wish.\n\nContributing from London: Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara and Nicole Fallert, USA TODAY\n\nFascinator faux pas:Jill Biden criticized for wearing fascinator instead of hat to Queen Elizabeth's funeral", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/04/17/prince-philip-funeral-will-queen-elizabeth-cry/7230173002/", "title": "Did Queen Elizabeth cry at Prince Philip's funeral?

She cried when she went to Aberfan, Wales, in 1966 to meet with survivors of a horrifying avalanche of coal waste that killed 144 people, most of them children, Bedell Smith says. At her sister Princess Margaret’s funeral in 2002, people who were there and seated near her told Bedell Smith she was \"very tearful\" and \"the saddest I've ever seen her.\"\n\nPrince Philip's funeral:Queen Elizabeth II sits alone, family says farewell at St. George's Chapel\n\n\"She has shed tears but it's been at appropriate times, such as the Remembrance Sunday commemorations\" for Britain's war dead every November, adds longtime royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, who spent part of her childhood in Kensington Palace as the daughter of a former press secretary to the queen.\n\nBut the widespread impression that the queen rarely shows emotion gets to the underlying role of the longest-serving reigning monarch in British history: After 69 years on her throne, she has had a lot of practice at hiding her feelings when necessary – and often it is necessary.\n\nRoyal reunion: Prince William and Harry leave Prince Philip's funeral shoulder to shoulder\n\nThe queen held back her undoubted sorrow on Saturday at the funeral of her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died April 9 at age 99. The 94-year-old monarch kept her composure as she exited her Bentley and entered St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, a tiny, stooped figure dressed in black and wearing a matching face mask. She sat alone at the service, her head bowed, and left with the Dean of Windsor, who officiated.\n\nRare new photo:See Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II pose with great-grandchildren\n\n\"I don't think we can underestimate how significant a loss this is to the queen – it's undeniable this will be the hardest day of her life,\" Arbiter says.\n\nHer family has seen her grief up close, but those watching the televised service did not. All 30 guests in the congregation, in keeping with pandemic rules, were wearing masks. TV cameras stayed a respectful distance from royal faces during the service, as is customary.\n\nWhy did Prince Philip's Land Rover carry his casket?The story behind the strange hearse\n\nThe queen's second son, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, said to be her favorite, gave a hint of his mother's demeanor when he spoke to reporters two days after his father's death.\n\n\"The queen, as you would expect, is an incredibly stoic person,\" said Andrew, 61. \"She described (his death) as having left a huge void in her life but we, the family, the ones that are close, are rallying round to make sure that we're there to support her.\"\n\nThe definition of a stoic is a person who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining. This is the queen to a T, Bedell Smith says.\n\n\"She is a woman of deep feeling but she works very hard to present an impassive face,\" Bedell Smith says. \"It's partly due to her role, and partly her temperament and the way she was brought up.\"\n\nHere's why: Prince Philip laid to rest in Royal Vault but it's not his final destination\n\nThe then-Princess Elizabeth, as she was known until her ascension in 1952, was trained very deliberately not to show her feelings in public, Bedell Smith says.\n\n\"If you see her at any number of (performances) or events, for practical reasons she watches but she doesn't applaud,\" Bedell Smith says. \"The theory is, if she starts to express reaction of any kind, it will be seen as favoring one group over another. So she's perfected this neutral look.\"\n\nAt times, she has been criticized for having a \"stony\" face, for appearing to be unfeeling or uncaring, Arbiter says. She is damned if she shows emotion, damned if she doesn't, so her safest option is to not react.\n\nRoyal romance:Look back at Prince Philip's 73-year love story with Queen Elizabeth II\n\n\"The best way to avoid criticism is to give away nothing, but it takes a will of steel and many years of practice,\" Arbiter says.\n\nCompared with her husband, who was more likely to express himself if he was vexed or moved in some way, she has to show neutrality. \"The discipline! She is so disciplined in every way,\" Bedell Smith says.\n\nAs a member of Britain's World War II generation, when so many endured hardship, loss, grief and devastation, stoicism was a coping mechanism for everybody, not just the queen, Arbiter says.\n\n\"There's a famous phrase the royals say: 'Don't wear private grief on a public sleeve,' \" Arbiter says. \"The family recognize that so many Britons have gone through hell in the past year and they will want to maintain that perspective\" during the funeral.\n\nPrince Philip has died:A look at the British royal family tree, spanning four generations\n\nThe family wanted the ceremony to be focused on the duke, the longest-serving royal consort in British history, and to his years of service to the nation.\n\nThe queen, who is head of the Church of England, may have chosen to make her final goodbye in an even more private and spiritual setting: in her private chapel where his casket had been at rest since his death. There are no TV cameras there.\n\n\"I think before the funeral she will have gone to the private chapel for a moment with coffin alone,\" Arbiter says. \"That will be her intimate moment of goodbye, a quiet moment of reflection and faith.\"\n\nThen she put on her neutral face, and a mask and led her family through another royal ceremony to be remembered down the ages.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/uk/royal-news-newsletter-01-14-21-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Queen left with no choice but to cast Prince Andrew adrift ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the January 14 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here.\n\nThe Queen's second son has been stripped of his cherished royal titles and will be the only one of his siblings no longer referred to as His (or Her) Royal Highness, Buckingham Palace announced Thursday. The extraordinary statement came a day after a federal judge rejected a bid to have a civil suit against him in New York thrown out. Judge Lewis Kaplan effectively said Andrew does have a case to answer after being accused of sexual assault.\n\nNow he's facing the prospect of a very public trial later this year on allegations brought by Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was sexually trafficked to the royal by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, when she was underage. Andrew has previously denied all allegations and has said that he does not recall ever meeting the then-17-year-old, nor does he remember ever having the picture taken with her that has been featured repeatedly in media around the world.\n\nA royal source told us that all Andrew's titles -- his military affiliations and other royal patronages -- were returned to his mother effective immediately and will be redistributed to other members of the family.\n\nWe've been told the decision involved many of the Windsors, but the Queen will have had the final say, in close consultation with her direct heirs -- Princes Charles and William.\n\nTo be clear: Andrew retains his own Duke of York title and he is still a member of the royal family, but, like the Sussexes, he will no longer represent the Queen in an official capacity.\n\nA statement from Buckingham Palace regarding The Duke of York: pic.twitter.com/OCeSqzCP38 — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) January 13, 2022\n\nThe loss of the military titles in particular will be extremely painful for the prince, who, as a veteran of the Falklands War, took that part of the job most seriously.\n\nIn a press release on Thursday, announcing the Queen's decision, it was made clear that Andrew will no longer have any royal public duties and will be defending himself as a private citizen in the allegations made by Giuffre.\n\nThe Duke of York does still have legal options he can pursue in the sexual assault lawsuit, but each comes with a degree of risk and no guarantee he'll be able to mend his stained reputation. In a nutshell, the prince can opt to appeal the judge's ruling, fight by going to trial, default or settle.\n\nSeveral legal experts we've spoken to in the past 48 hours have suggested an out-of-court settlement may be the best approach. But Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, has indicated his client may prefer to have her day in court.\n\n\"I think it's very important to Virginia Giuffre that this matter be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims. I don't think she has a firm view as to exactly what a solution should be,\" he said in an i nterview with the BBC . \"But I think what's going to be important is that this resolution vindicates her and vindicates the claim she has made.\"\n\nA source close to Prince Andrew told CNN Thursday that he will \"continue to defend himself\" against the sexual abuse lawsuit.\n\n\"Given the robustness with which Judge Kaplan greeted our arguments, we are unsurprised by the ruling. However, it was not a judgement on the merits of Ms Giuffre's allegations,\" the source said.\n\n\"This is a marathon not a sprint and the Duke will continue to defend himself against these claims,\" the source added.\n\nThe Queen and her second son chat at the Windsor Horse Show in May 2017.\n\nAndrew's permanent removal from royal duties will surely have been a tough call for the matriarch, but one she clearly felt was needed in her capacity as head of the institution. The message here is this: The case in New York is simply too damaging to the family and the reputation of the monarchy -- so he had to go.\n\nWith no official duties to perform, he will no longer receive public funds but will be free as a private citizen to take paid work in the private sector or source money through other private means to fund his very expensive legal effort. That would have been seen as a conflict of interest while he was an HRH.\n\nThe sovereign herself has faced some criticism for not acting fast enough as the scandal began to engulf Andrew back in 2019 , following his car crash interview with the BBC over his relationship with Epstein. Many at the time felt he lacked empathy for the disgraced financier's victims and that his titles should have been revoked then, rather than more than two years later.\n\nMark Stephens, a media lawyer with the London-based firm Howard Kennedy, believes the family and public were \"prepared to give him some latitude to defend himself on the grounds that you're innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\nThe prince's attorneys had argued that Giuffre's lawsuit violated the terms of her 2009 settlement agreement with Epstein in Florida, in which she agreed to a \"general release\" of claims against Epstein and others. That settlement, released to the public recently, shows that Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop the case without any admission of liability or fault. The prince's name does not explicitly appear as a party.\n\nThe pair attended the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn in London on December 13, 2018.\n\nHowever, Stephens continued, \"When he sought to say, with one side of his mouth, 'I never met this woman' and with the other, 'Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, settled my case for me or any case for me,' I think that that was too much for the British public to stomach, and that was when the public, I think, decisively moved against Andrew and anyone that was seen to support him.\"\n\n\"The criticism of the Queen and her tacit support for her son has really only occurred since Brettler (the duke's lawyer) made that argument to Judge Kaplan, and it sounded more loudly since the results of that argument have come down,\" he added.\n\nThe question now is: Will the duke's permanent exile be enough reputational damage control in the eyes of the public? Legal experts say the Queen has responded authoritatively, acting promptly instead of waiting for any verdict should the case reach the trial stage. She only retains the crown by virtue of parliamentary support and that, in turn, relies on public support.\n\nNick Goldstone, head of dispute resolution at international law firm Ince, called the removal of military titles and royal patronages, combined with no longer being able to use the HRH style in an official capacity, a \"significant development.\"\n\nHe said it was \"probably enough\" to quell further criticism of inaction from the public, adding \"it certainly appears to have brought the Duke of York's public life as a royal to an end for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nPrince Andrew stands with his mother and other members of the royal family during Trooping The Colour, the Queen's annual birthday parade, on June 8, 2019 in London.\n\nStephens, too, believes the palace moved quickly and decisively. \"Essentially, he's been put out to pasture, and he's been reduced in status to the same status as Prince Harry,\" he said, adding: \"The handing back of his titles and honorifics makes it clear that he has no part in the future of the public civic life of this country.\"\n\nMost notably that means Andrew won't have a front seat at the upcoming jubilee celebrations to mark the Queen's 70 years on the throne. He will be there for group photos but without the prime position assumed by an HRH.\n\nAndrew will now be hoping the public are able to compartmentalize the lawsuit and allow 2022 to be defined as a royal jubilee year instead of a scandalized one. That's clearly the hope of the rest of the family.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nSo, it's been announced that Prince Andrew will stop using the \"HRH\" style in any official capacity. Let's break down what it all means.\n\nThe letters stand for His or Her Royal Highness, a style used to denote senior members of the royal family.\n\nSince the early 18th century, it's been customary for the title to be issued to sons and grandsons (and later, daughters and granddaughters) of the monarch.\n\nIt is bestowed upon royal members at the discretion of the monarch at the time, but was used liberally until World War I.\n\nThen, in 1917, George V restricted how many minor royals were getting the title -- at a time when there was public suspicion about the German origins of the House of Windsor, speedily renamed that year from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nThe Duke of York at the 100th Anniversary Ceremony of The Royal Air Force at Westminster Abbey on July 10, 2018\n\nQueen Elizabeth II has loosened those guidelines, giving HRH status to a number of senior royals.\n\nToday, children and grandchildren of the monarch traditionally get the HRH title -- though it was historically withheld from granddaughters. The title doesn't stretch to all the minor royals, but does include family members like the Queen's cousin Prince Michael of Kent, who is far down the line of succession.\n\nNot everyone has accepted the offer of an HRH. Princess Anne, the Queen's daughter, declined the title for her own children, Peter and Zara. The move has allowed them to carve out relatively normal lives away from significant public scrutiny.\n\nAfter her divorce from Prince Charles, Diana had her HRH taken away. Instead, she was given the courtesy title of \"Diana, Princess of Wales.\" Similarly, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also stripped of her HRH following her divorce from Prince Andrew.\n\nMost recently, the Sussexes gave up their HRH titles after announcing they would step back from the royal family and relocating to the United States.\n\n(With reporting by CNN's Rob Picheta)\n\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visits the set of the long-running television series Coronation Street, in Manchester, England on July 8, 2021.\n\nPalace reveals how Queen's 70th year on the throne will be celebrated.\n\nA holiday weekend, a special \"platinum pudding,\" and a pageant of flags. June is shaping up to be a fun and flamboyant celebration of Britain's longest-serving monarch.\n\nWe've mentioned before that to mark the unprecedented anniversary, a number of events will take place throughout the UK over the year -- culminating in a four-day national holiday weekend from Thursday, June 2 until Sunday, June 5, known as the Jubilee Weekend.\n\nOne of the initiatives is the \"Platinum Pudding\" contest -- a nationwide baking competition seeking out a new dessert dedicated to the Queen (Think \"The Great British Baking Show\" -- but bigger!) UK residents aged eight and over are eligible to create a recipe, and finalists will be judged by a panel including famed baker Mary Berry, renowned chef and \"Masterchef UK\" judge Monica Galetti and Buckingham Palace head chef Mark Flanagan. The winning recipe will be made available to the public ahead of the long weekend.\n\nThe Trooping the Colour parade will return to kick off things off. But we'll also have beacons lit across the nation, Buckingham Palace's music concert and street parties. It all culminates with a pageant that will include 5,000 personnel, performers, key workers and volunteers from the UK and the Commonwealth.\n\nThis pageant will involve a \"River of Hope\" section, featuring 200 silk flags that will process down The Mall -- the road in London that leads to Buckingham Palace -- like a river. Schoolchildren are invited to create a picture of their hopes and aspirations for the planet over the next 70 years as the artwork for the flags.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's deputy official spokesman told journalists on Friday: \"It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning, and Number 10 has apologised to the palace.\" Under England's coronavirus restrictions, social gatherings indoors were limited at this time. The very next day, the nation watched as the Queen sat alone in St. George's Chapel in Windsor. The photograph of the solitary grieving monarch elicited enormous sympathy from the public, both at home and abroad.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip.\n\nPrince Charles says painting 'refreshes the soul.'\n\nAt the largest exhibition of his watercolors to date, painting enthusiast Prince Charles has described the restorative benefits of art, saying it \"transports me to another dimension,\" adding that his hobby \"refreshes parts of the soul which other activities can't reach.\" A new show brings together nearly 80 of the prince's landscape paintings. Like Queen Victoria, the prince is a \"keen watercolorist\" who \"paints whenever his schedule allows,\" according to his official website. He regularly depicts the royal family's estates, including Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, and has also produced watercolors in Turkey, Nepal and the Swiss Alps.

Sign up here.\n\nLondon (CNN) The tapping of a sword echoes through Westminster Hall. Here, in the oldest part of the Houses of Parliament, it reverberates instantly around the space, stopping people in their tracks and capturing their attention.\n\nMoments later, footfalls on ancient steps resound as soldiers from units serving the Royal Household march into the room to relieve the guard around the Queen's coffin.\n\nMembers of the public watch as the new guard makes its way in perfect synchronicity to the central platform, mesmerized by the jingling of medals as the soldiers move.\n\nWith another tap, the old guard troops out and its replacement takes up position, standing perfectly still beneath the 11th-century hall's medieval roof.\n\nThe crowd reanimates once more and the lines streaming past the catafalque resume. Here, beneath these ancient timber beams, ancient traditions are playing out in present day.\n\nThe Queen has been lying in state since Wednesday, when her coffin was conveyed to Westminster Hall in a somber procession that saw King Charles III, Princes William and Harry and other senior royals follow behind on foot. It will remain here until the morning of the Queen's state funeral on Monday.\n\nThe Queen's mother and father both lay in state here before her: King George VI in 1952, and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 2002. So did her grandfather George V in 1936 and her great-grandfather Edward VII in 1910 -- the first royal to lie in state.\n\nTo maintain a continuous vigil, each watch lasts for 20 minutes.\n\nState funerals are only reserved for monarchs, however, there has been one exception: Elizabeth II's first prime minister, Winston Churchill. He also lay in state in the hall after his death in 1965.\n\nAs candlelight glistens on the symbols of state atop the coffin -- the Imperial State Crown and the Sovereign's Orb and Sceptre -- mourners pay their respects to the late monarch. Some young, some old, families with children in school uniforms, those of faith and those of none -- all are here to say farewell and thank the Queen for her lifelong service.\n\nThe walk from one end of the hall doesn't take long -- a few minutes at most. After waiting for hours in The Queue, sometimes overnight, the fleeting moment they've all been waiting for finally arrives.\n\nMen pause briefly to bow to the coffin while several women perform a deep, respectful curtsey. Some simply smile or nod their head. Others take a moment to blow a kiss toward the catafalque. Then there are the older military veterans, with medals proudly displayed, who stand to attention and perform one last salute to their former commander-in-chief.\n\nMembers of the public view the Queen's coffin, which is draped with the Royal Standard, on which lie the Instruments of State -- the Imperial State Crown and the Orb and Sceptre.\n\nMany in the queue have waited for hours and hours to get to this point. But as each person finds their own way to acknowledge the Queen, some stopping the flow of movement for the briefest of seconds, no one complains. Those in line wait patiently for the person ahead of them to do what they need to do before they move forward, and on toward the exit.\n\nAs the mourners reach the far side of the hall, almost every single person -- including us -- stops and turns back for one final look and to say a silent goodbye to the only monarch most have ever known.\n\n(CNN's James Frater contributed to this story.)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe King walks with his family behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday.\n\nQueen's funeral details revealed.\n\nFriday usually means it's time for your weekly dose of royal headlines. Clearly this has changed a little since the Queen's death last week as we've been sending a few more editions to make sure you're kept in the loop on the latest funeral arrangements.\n\nTo that end, we wanted to send out a quick note today to make sure you didn't miss the rundown of ceremonial events for the late monarch's services on Monday.\n\nThe meticulously planned arrangements will see King Charles III and members of the royal family walk behind the coffin once more as it is moved from the heart of the British parliamentary estate to Westminster Abbey for the hour-long service.\n\nThere will also be a two-minute nationwide silence held shortly before the end of the state funeral service.\n\nThe Queen's coffin is now at Westminster Hall, where it will remain until 6:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. ET) on Monday. The state funeral in central London gets underway from 11 a.m. and then a committal service at St. George's Chapel will take place from 4 p.m.\n\nFEATURED PHOTOS\n\nOnly a minority will remember firsthand what life was like the last time the UK buried a monarch. Images taken in 1952 following the death of the Queen's father, King George VI, reveal just how much the country -- and the world -- has changed.\n\nJust like today, crowds poured into central London in February of that year, hoping to catch a glimpse of George VI's funeral procession. But while the time-honored ceremonies remain much the same, the people watching them look quite different.\n\nCheck out our photo gallery of what Britain looked like when the last monarch died:\n\nPhotos: What Britain looked like the last time a monarch died King George VI's coffin is carried through the streets of London before being transported to Windsor Castle for his funeral on February 15, 1952.

MUST WATCH Hear why people in London are queuing to see the Queen one last time 03:38\n\nIt is a moment for which Britain has been in solemn preparation for years. Multiple official agencies were brought together. Meticulous plans were secretly drawn up. Intricate logistical technicalities were ironed out. A route was carefully mapped out. And no country's population could have been better prepared for it.\n\nWe are talking, of course, about the line that Britons must join in order to pay their respects to the Queen. This is not an ordinary line. It has taken on symbolic meaning, a ritual to be undertaken, an embodiment of the national mood. It is, in short, not a queue but The Queue.\n\nIt snakes from Westminster Hall, where the late monarch's body is lying in state, for miles along the south bank of the Thames river. It stretches past landmarks such as the London Eye, the Globe theater and London Bridge.

At state occasions, a crown or tiara rested atop a perfect coif. At the stables of Balmoral, where she tended to her ponies in Wellington boots and a Barbour jacket, a patterned scarf was always tied under her chin. But most often, it was a hat.\n\n\"You almost can't see it in isolation. There's always a brooch, there's usually pearls, there's usually white gloves,\" Beatrice Behlen, senior curator of fashion and decorative arts at the Museum of London, said in a 2019 phone interview. \"And then the matching hat.\"", "authors": ["Analysis Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/uk/royal-news-newsletter-06-03-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Analysis: When Harry and Meghan reunited with the Windsors - CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nAs the bells of St Paul’s tolled for the monarch resting out of town in Windsor, a moment unfolded during arrivals that royal watchers had been holding out for – the return of the Sussexes.\n\nIt couldn’t have been easy. Outside they were greeted by cheers from the crowd that well outweighed the boos. That would have been heartening for the couple, in light of so much bad press about them. Even critics of the Sussexes in the crowd that CNN spoke to gave the couple credit for being there and showing their respect for the Queen.\n\nThis wasn’t just their first public appearance as a couple at a royal event in more than two years, it was a major state event – a thanksgiving for the Queen’s unprecedented reign in the hallowed surroundings of St Paul’s Cathedral.\n\nInside, they made their way down the long aisle, heads turning as they went along and the television cameras locked in on them to an almost uncomfortable extent.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrive for a service of thanksgiving for the reign of Queen Elizabeth II at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Friday. Alberto Pezzali/AP\n\nAnyone hoping to see rifts from the past couple of years healed in front of the cameras were left disappointed as Harry and Meghan took their seats amongst junior royals (including Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, and their husbands, with whom the Sussexes have no beef).\n\nWhat we don’t know yet is whether the couple had any private meetings with Prince Charles and Prince William to resolve outstanding differences.\n\nAhead of the event, there had been plenty of speculation in the British press over how the couple would be received. But they’ve taken a low-key approach to their jubilee attendance which may play in their favor.\n\nOn Thursday they didn’t appear in front of the cameras at all. They watched the Trooping the Colour military display from a window overlooking Horse Guards Parade. Were it not for confirmation of the pair’s attendance and eagle-eyed photographers with their long-lens cameras capturing grainy snaps, they might have slipped completely under the radar.\n\nThis was clearly a visit rooted in reverence for the Queen and her historic reign. If their strategy was to avoid overshadowing the 96-year-old’s milestone moment, it worked and may have gone some way to start healing that rift.\n\n“There was this huge roar when the Sussexes arrived, real popularity. People were really thrilled to see them. There was this real closeness – the family was together,” CNN royal historian Kate Williams said. “There’s been a lot of negative press about Meghan and Harry and it’s time to look past that and see that they were there to support the Queen.”\n\nShe continued: “As the Queen said in her statement when Meghan and Harry left the royal family, left as full-time royals, she said they are ‘much loved’ members of our family and that was very clear today.”\n\nThe couple take their seats within St Paul's. Dan Kitwood/AP\n\nEmily Nash, CNN royal contributor and royal editor for Hello! magazine, said it was “huge” to see the Sussexes back in the royal fold.\n\n“Not least because it sends out a signal that the family is united behind the Queen and they are prepared to put whatever has happened behind the scenes behind them,” she explained. “Whether by accident or by design, chances are relationships are going to thaw. They’re going to be able to spend some time together. Hopefully, that is going to build bridges again.”\n\n“But there is a lot contingent on this. We have Harry’s book coming out at some point, we have the Netflix documentary – there are all things that are going to cause concern to the royal family,” she added. “Whether or not, behind the scenes, these are things that are being discussed remains to be seen. But I think the very fact that they are here obviously is a cause of great pleasure for the Queen.”\n\nIt’s unclear at this point if we’ll see the Sussexes again over the weekend. We’re finding out day-to-day about their presence at the celebrations. But so far it looks like there has been some healing. Such a rebalance in the public face of the family would have been welcomed as a gift by the Queen on her landmark weekend.\n\nWHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE QUEEN’S HEALTH\n\nThe Queen’s absence at her own service of thanksgiving has inevitably sparked questions about the 96-year-old’s health again.\n\nIn years past, the monarch rarely scrapped engagements at the last minute. But her advanced age has made it difficult to work the jam-packed schedule, filled with official commitments and appointments, that has defined the majority of her reign.\n\nThe Queen and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nAs she gets older, the Queen has reduced her number of events to focus on core constitutional duties but she’s even being forced to reduce that. Prince Charles had to represent her at the State Opening of Parliament this year.\n\nThe palace has given no reason to think the Queen is in poor health. However, her age and the fact that she is the world’s most recognizable woman often fuel speculation when something is amiss with the British sovereign. The palace has tried to strike a balance between being truthful while preventing people from becoming overly concerned.

Nearly a month on, many are still furious at the lack of government response or arrests over the comments, which they say highlights a worsening climate for the country’s Muslims.\n\nAfter mounting pressure, India’s top court intervened on Wednesday, asking for a response from state and federal authorities within 10 days.\n\nPandey and several others are being investigated by local police for insulting religious beliefs, a charge that carries a possible sentence of up to four years in prison, Haridwar police officials told CNN.\n\nNeither Pandey, nor the others, have publicly commented about the outcry or investigations.\n\nLate Thursday, police in Uttarakhand state, where Haridwar is located, arrested a man who spoke at the event, senior Haridwar Police official Shekhar Suyal told CNN. It is unclear what the man said at the event. Police have not formally charged anyone with any crime.\n\nCNN has contacted India’s Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Hindu Mahasabha and Pandey, but has not received a response.\n\nAnalysts say the Hindu Mahasabha is at the tip of a broader trend in India which has seen an alarming rise in support for extremist Hindu nationalist groups since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power nearly eight years ago.\n\nAlthough these groups aren’t directly associated with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his own Hindu nationalist agenda, and the lack of repercussions for these groups’ previous vitriolic comments, has given them tacit support, making them even more brazen, analysts say.\n\nAnalysts fear this rise poses a serious danger to minorities, especially Muslims – and worry it may only get worse as several Indian states head to the polls in the coming months.\n\n“What makes the Hindu Mahasabha dangerous,” said Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University near India’s capital, New Delhi, “is that they have been waiting for a moment like this in decades.”\n\nRise of the right-wing Hindu group\n\nFounded in 1907 during British rule at a time of growing conflict between Muslims and Hindus in the country, the Hindu Mahasabha is one of India’s oldest political organizations.\n\nThe group didn’t support British rule, but it didn’t back India’s freedom movement either, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was particularly tolerant of Muslims. Even now, some members of the group worship his assassin, Nathuram Godse.\n\nThe Hindu Mahasabha’s vision, according to the group’s official website, is to declare India the “National Home of the Hindus.” The website says if it takes power, it will not hesitate to “force” the migration of India’s Muslims to neighboring Pakistan and vows to reform the country’s education system to align it with their version of Hinduism.\n\nWith its controversial campaigns and ideology, Hindu Mahasabha has always been a marginal political force. The last time the group had a presence in Parliament was in 1991.\n\nBut according to Verniers, their “strength is not to be measured in electoral terms.” And in the past eight years since Modi came to power, they appear to have expanded in numbers and influence based on the size and frequency of their meetings, he said.\n\nWhile the group does not publicly disclose how many members it has, Verniers said they are “comfortably in the tens of thousands.”\n\nHindu Mahasabha targets rural communities in northern states, where there is a large BJP presence, encouraging them to vote for parties that align with their Hindu-nationalist ideology, including Modi’s BJP, Verniers said.\n\nModi, in turn, has publicly honored the Hindu Mahasabha’s late leader, Veer Savarkar, for “his bravery” and “emphasis on social reform.”\n\nNathuram Godse's statue is adroned with a garland at the Hindu Mahasabha office in New Delhi. K Asif/The India Today Group/Getty Images\n\nAnd as Hindu Mahasabha has grown in recent years, it has become more outspoken.\n\nIn 2015, Sadhvi Deva Thakur, then a senior member of the group, caused widespread controversy when she told reporters Muslims and Christians should undergo forced sterilization to control their population growth. CNN has reached out to her for comment.\n\nPandey, who spoke at the December conference in Haridwar, was arrested in February 2019 after a video showed her shooting an effigy of Gandhi, according to CNN affiliate CNN News-18. Photos uploaded to her official Facebook page last May show her worshiping a statue of Gandhi’s assassin. CNN has not been able to confirm whether she was formally charged over the February 2019 incident.\n\nHindu Mahasabha isn’t the only right-wing Hindu nationalist group to espouse violent sentiment toward liberals and minorities – including India’s 200 million Muslims, who make up 15% of the country’s 1.3 billion population.\n\nAt last month’s conference, several speakers called on India’s Hindus to “defend” the religion with weapons. Another called for the “cleansing” of India’s minorities, according to video from the event.\n\nBut according to Verniers, Hindu Mahasbha one of the largest right-wing political groups aiming to make India the land of the Hindus.\n\nAnd while the group’s campaigns and ideas are decades old, they’re more bold about them now.\n\n“The escalation of their hate speech is reflective of the state of affairs in India,” said Verniers. “But they are able to get away with it more.”\n\nThousands of people gather to mark protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act law in Delhi, India, on January 26, 2020. Javed Sultan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nActing with impunity\n\nThe reason extremist groups appear to be on the rise is clear, according to experts: they have impunity and support.\n\nIndia prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs.\n\nAccording to lawyer Vrinda Grover, any group inciting violence is barred under Indian law.\n\n“Police, states and the government are responsible to ensure (inciting violence) doesn’t happen,” she said. “But the state, through its inaction, is actually permitting these groups to function, while endangering Muslims who are the targets.”\n\nPandey’s rant and some of the other calls for violence were the “worst form of hate speech,” according to Verniers.\n\n“This is the first time I find myself using the term ‘genocide’ in Indian politics,” he said, referring to the comments made at last month’s conference. “They have tacit support in the form of government silence.”\n\nThat’s because Modi also has a Hindu nationalist agenda, experts say.\n\nModi swept to power in India in 2014, promising economic reform and development for the country.\n\nBut starting from his first term as Prime Minister, minority groups and analysts say they began to see a significant shift in India’s ideology from a secular to a Hindu nationalist state.\n\nThe BJP has its roots in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing-Hindu group that counts Modi among its members. Many RSS members are adherents of the Hindutva ideology that the Hindu Mahasabha preach – to make India the land of the Hindus.\n\nIn 2018, India’s current Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were “termites” and promised to rid the nation of them.\n\nThe BJP’s Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of the north Indian state Uttar Pradesh, known for his anti-Muslim views, once compared Muslim Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed, the alleged planner of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, according to the Press Trust of India.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, vigilante groups killed dozens of people – many of whom were Muslims – for allegedly consuming or killing cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus, according to a report from Human Rights Watch.\n\nModi publicly condemned some of the killings, but the violence continued, and in 2017, his government attempted to ban the sale and slaughter of cows –currently illegal in several Indian states – nationwide.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inauguratea the Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor, Varanasi, on December 13, 2021. Sanjay Kanojia/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHuman Rights Watch said many of the alleged murders went unpunished in part due to delayed police investigations and “rhetoric” from ruling party politicians, which may have incited mob violence.\n\nIn 2019, India’s Parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims. It led to extended protests and international condemnation.\n\nIn December 2020, Uttar Pradesh enacted a controversial anti-conversion law, making it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.\n\nOther states, including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Assam, introduced similar laws, leading to widespread harassment and, in some cases, arrests for interfaith couples, Christian priests and pastors.\n\nThe chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state Yogi Adityanath addresses a public rally in Allahabad on December 26, 2021. Sanjay Kanojia/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAll of this has only served to encourage extremist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha, say experts.\n\nZakia Soman, a women’s rights activist and co-founder of the Muslim group Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said “a failure of governance” had given rise to more right-wing extremists.\n\n“Our community is realizing that we have become second-class citizens in our own country,” Soman said. “Minority bashing and hate is becoming regular and normalized. As the intensity increases, the venom and violence in their language also increases.”\n\nA 21-year-old Muslim student in Delhi, who chose to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from right-wing groups, said Muslims are filled with “a sense of fear” every time right-wing Hindu groups make hateful comments.\n\n“It gives us a sense that we don’t belong here,” he said.\n\nThe future of the Hindu-right\n\nDespite police investigations and public outrage, legal action against those who spoke and were present at December’s event have been slow.\n\nIn a letter submitted to Modi on Friday and seen by CNN, students and faculty of the prestigious Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and Ahmedabad said his silence “emboldens” hate, adding there is “sense of fear” among minority groups in India.\n\nSome experts agree the government’s silence has only emboldened these groups further.\n\n“Hate speech precedes hate crimes,” Grover, the lawyer, said. “And we are witnessing a crescendo of hate crimes. These groups are rapidly spreading poison through society.”\n\nA 2019 US intelligence report warned that parliamentary elections in India increase the possibility of communal violence if Modi’s BJP “stresses Hindu nationalist themes.” It added that state leaders “might view a Hindu-nationalist campaign as a signal to incite low-level violence to animate their supporters.”\n\nThe BJP – which rarely gives statements on the issue – says it does not discriminate against minorities, adding in a statement last March that it “treats all its citizens with equality” and “laws are applied without discrimination.”\n\nBut analysts fear the BJP’s divisive politics will could lead to increased violence against minority groups in the lead up to pivotal state elections this year.\n\nAnd reported episodes of violence against Muslims have already increased ahead of this year’s state elections.\n\nIn December, crowds of India’s Hindu-right confronted Muslims praying on the streets in the city of Gurugram, just outside of Delhi.

Roshan Abbas is a Delhi-based documentary photographer and a student at Jamia Millia Islamia. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen, as journalists, we prepare for a job, we think carefully about our questions, locations and equipment. But for one of us, documentary photographer Roshan Abbas, there is an added consideration – how much of his true identity to reveal.\n\nAbbas, co-author of this article, is a Muslim man in India. A country where, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch, Muslims are being vilified and evicted from their homes, their freedom of religious expression stifled.\n\nIt’s oppression Abbas has experienced firsthand, choosing not to wear a kurta – a loose, collarless shirt – that might point to his identity as a Muslim, when traveling the country for work.\n\nThe decision is cautionary. In public spaces, there looms a sense of uneasiness. Mob lynchings of Muslims who look visibly Muslim have arisen in the past.\n\nLikewise, Muslim women wearing hijab can face backlash and discrimination, even though there’s no national ban on religious garments in public spaces.\n\nAbbas also takes care not to disclose that he attends Jamia Millia Islamia – a Muslim university associated with student-led protests against the government. The campus has been closed on-and-off since 2019 amid a tumultuous relationship with the government.\n\nJust one example of the targeted persecution of Muslims is a controversial citizenship law granting Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants, introduced by the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019.\n\nPrime Minister Modi has previously suggested that people protesting against the law can be “identified by their clothes” – a clear reference to Muslim protesters. Little wonder then, that Indian Muslims feel they have had to change how they dress, eat and speak in public.\n\nTensions between Indian Hindus and Muslims have been flashpoints for decades, even before the British left in 1947 and the country gained independence. But since Modi’s government came to power in 2014, crimes against the Muslim minority have steadily increased.\n\nUntil recently, members of the BJP hadn’t outwardly acknowledged their goal of making India a Hindu nation. Othering Muslims, the country’s second largest religion, has proven to be an effective strategy in the BJP’s majoritarian politics.\n\nNow, India’s roughly 200 million Muslims – just over 14% of the population – are defending their right to live.\n\nLast month, local authorities and bulldozers razed shops and homes in Jahangirpuri – a low-income, predominantly Muslim neighbourhood in Delhi. The demolition followed communal clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the area. It mirrored the manner in which authorities responded to similar outbreaks of violence in other parts of the country – with bulldozers.\n\nWhat we are seeing in India is more than the systemic oppression of Muslims and other minorities. Prior to 2014, Muslims already accounted for only 14% of the population, but almost 20% of inmates in India’s jails.\n\nBut with authorities having abandoned their fundamental duty to safeguard the constitutional rights of minorities, India’s Muslim population is being rendered insignificant by the day.\n\nWhat’s more, open calls for violence against Muslims have become increasingly frequent. Following the southern state of Karnataka’s controversial ban on headscarves in classrooms earlier this year, a member of a Hindu nationalist youth group called for those who wore hijabs to be “cut… into pieces.”\n\nAnd in December last year, a Hindu leader at an event in the northern state of Uttarakhand called for “Hindus to take up weapons” to ensure a “Muslim didn’t become the prime minister in 2029.”\n\nYet world leaders seem unbothered by the state of affairs on the ground in India. There are no sanctions or wide condemnations of the Modi government. What little international media coverage there is of the situation – in our experience as journalists – been pushed aside to cover the war in Ukraine. And while that news needs due coverage, so does this.\n\nThere have been some international breakout moments. On his recent visit to Gujarat, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a JCB plant and posed for photos on a bulldozer – the same brand of bulldozers used to demolish Muslim-owned shops and homes.\n\nThis caused outrage both in India and the UK, with members of the opposition in the UK even going so far as to question whether Johnson’s trip to India “helped legitmize the actions of Modi’s far-right government.”\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson waves from a digger at a JCB factory in Gujarat, during his trip to India in April. Ben Stansall/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that Modi has yet to condemn the recent spurts of communal violence across the country. Despite India being the world’s largest democracy, and constitutionally secular, the BJP has repeatedly stoked the flames of communalism, othering Muslims, branding them dangerous and violent.\n\nIn recent years, several BJP-governed states passed a “love jihad” (or “anti-conversion”) law. The law aims to prevent women from converting when they marry outside their faith, particularly, as the nickname suggests, keeping Hindu women from marrying Muslim men. It’s been likened to the 1935 Nuremberg laws banning marriages between Jews and those of “pure” German blood in Nazi Germany.\n\nThis year, we find ourselves inching further toward a propaganda nation-state. A controversial film about a fictional university student who finds out Islamist militants murdered his Kashmiri Hindu parents was openly praised by Modi.\n\nThe film enjoyed a “tax free” status in several states to make it more accessible to a wider audience. However, this too was accompanied by anti-Muslim sloganeering and its screening in “mixed population areas” of Delhi was accompanied by increased police presence.\n\nIslamophobia has permeated every aspect of Indian society. Our cities are being renamed to erase traces of Muslim history, while Muslims in metropolitan areas face ghettoization on account of structural biases.\n\nAnd while beef and meat bans intimidate economically deprived marginalized groups including Muslims, the gross double standards of beef exports from India continue. (Cows, for those unfamiliar, are sometimes considered sacred in Hinduism.)\n\nIndian Muslims are forced to navigate social spaces with an eye of caution, amid a so-called “anti-terror” law to arrest and incarcerate for years without trial. For many activists and journalists jailed under the law, their only fault is their Muslim identity. But any unjust incarceration does more than silence the brave; it instills a sense of fear in the young minds of the Muslim community.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIndeed, in March the international alliance, Genocide Watch, put out a genocide warning – Muslims in India are under threat. India on the Brink, a genocide prevention summit, also declared that the country was on the brink of genocide.\n\nHow Abbas dresses for work is just the tip of the iceberg; Muslim women continue to face the brunt of Hindu nationalism.

Progressive human rights ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, blacks, and the LGBT community demanded, and often won, equal rights. Technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of.\n\nThe world certainly has progressed, but wars have raged on, and climate change has picked up speed, endangering the ecosystems of our planet.\n\nTo put this in perspective, 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the most important event in each of the past 100 years. We drew on research material and news reports to determine what event had the biggest impact in a particular year.\n\n1919: National booze ban\n\n• Date: Oct. 28\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nCongress passes the 18th Amendment that bans the production, transport or sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The legislation opens the way for Prohibition, which lasts from 1920 to 1933. The public flouts the law, which succeeds in enriching gangsters and contributing to the rise of organized crime.\n\n1920: Women's suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population (starting with white landowning males over the age of 21) could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution is passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots.\n\nSports gambling:Why sports betting hasn't gone nationwide yet after Supreme Court ruling\n\n1921: Chinese Communists rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded, and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo that would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes monkey trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to Biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,460 in 2017 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court rules that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. starts numbered highway system\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Lindbergh would become one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany's aircraft industry. Also, his son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler consolidates power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 100-meter relay.\n\nFrom Alaska to Florida:States with the biggest and smallest governments\n\n1937: UAW changes car industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald's Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald's into what it is today – the world's largest restaurant chain.\n\n1941: Attack on Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed. The United States declares war on Japan the next day and three days later against Germany and Italy.\n\n1942: GIs arrive in Europe\n\n• Date: Jan. 26\n\n• Location: Northern Ireland\n\nThe first U.S. troops destined to fight in Europe in the world's greatest war arrive in Northern Ireland. It is the beginning of a military buildup that would culminate in the invasion of France more than two years later. Before then, the United States was providing only material support to its ally across the Atlantic, while building up what President Roosevelt called the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" in anticipation for the inevitable entry of the United States into the war in Europe.\n\n1943: Invention of LSD\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Basel, Switzerland\n\nSwiss chemist Albert Hoffman had been studying the potential medicinal value of lysergic compounds when he accidentally exposed himself to LSD-25, which he had created years earlier in his lab. This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier. The plan is conceived during the Quebec Conference by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. The invasion starts at 6:30 a.m. on five beaches, and over the next 24 hours about 4,900 Allied soldiers are killed, many of them the instant the doors of their Higgins transport boats opened directly into German machine gun fire.\n\n1945: World War II ends\n\n• Date: Sept. 2\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe surrender of Japan marks the end of World War II amid one of the most tumultuous years of the 20th century. Earlier in the year, leaders of three nations – Benito Mussolini, Franklin Roosevelt and Adolf Hitler – die and Nazi Germany surrenders. Though the surrender of Japan was inevitable, the prospect of a horrific Allied assault on the Japanese mainland convinces the United States to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic bomb attacks, along with the entry of the Soviet Union in the war against Japan, compel the Japanese to surrender.\n\n1946: Baby boom starts\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nMore American babies are born – 3.4 million – in 1946 than in any year in U.S. history up to then. The number of births grows to 4 million per year from 1954 to 1964, the last year of the baby boomer generation, the biggest generation at that point in history.\n\nIt's raining rats:Live rat falls from Buffalo Wild Wings ceiling as customer watches\n\n1947: India gains independence\n\n• Date: Aug. 15\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C\n\nThe sun sets on the British Empire in India in 1947, as the Asian nation becomes the world's largest democracy. Independence is the culmination of decades of work by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indian nationalists committed to throwing off the yoke of British colonialism. The transition to independence comes at a price. The subcontinent is partitioned into two nations, Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Violence erupts between Hindus and Muslims as Hindus migrate to India and Muslims shift to Pakistan. It is estimated that 1 million people die during the migration.\n\n1948: Birth of Israel\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: Middle East\n\nAfter Israel declares its independence following a UN resolution, neighboring Arab states with troops from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), Lebanon and Saudi Arabia attack the former British-controlled Palestinian mandate. The Arab-Israeli War ended with an armistice that leaves Israel with some territories as Egypt and Jordan retains control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, respectively.\n\n1949: NATO founded\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nTwo years into the Cold War, the Soviet Union detonates its first nuclear bomb and quickly exerts its influence over Eastern Europe. It attempts to do the same in Western Europe, which is still recovering from the massive destruction of World War II. To respond to the Soviet threat, U.S. and Western European allies form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Fundamentally, NATO simply states that an attack on any NATO member would be considered an attack on all NATO members. Cold War tensions ratchet up later that year when the communists take over China, the world's most populous nation.\n\n1950: Korean War starts\n\n• Date: June 25\n\n• Location: Korea\n\nThe North Korean People's Army crosses the 38th parallel into South Korea, eliciting almost an immediate response from President Harry Truman, and starting the Korean War – a proxy battle between the United States and the People's Republic of China. Three years later, a ceasefire would halt the war. The uneasy relations between North Korea and South Korea last to this day.\n\n1951: Rosenbergs sentenced\n\n• Date: March 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nHusband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are convicted of espionage for their part in passing along atomic secrets to the Soviet Union during and after World War II. They are executed two years later. Not everyone is convinced of their involvement in the scheme. Supporters claim they are scapegoats swept up in the Cold War hysteria of the time. Documents revealed decades later would show the detailed extent of Julius Rosenberg's involvement in the spy ring, though Ethel's participation in the scheme remains inconclusive.\n\n1952: First hydrogen bomb test\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Marshall Islands\n\nThe United States successfully detonates its first hydrogen bomb, a second generation thermonuclear device, in the Marshall Islands as part of Operation Ivy, one of a series of nuclear bomb tests. From 1946 to 1958, the United States used the remote Pacific Marshall Islands as its nuclear weapons testing site, detonating a total of 67 nuclear tests.\n\n1953: The dawn of DNA\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: Cambridge, England, U.K.\n\nCambridge University scientists James Watson and Francis Crick announce they have discovered the fundamental behavior and double-helix structure of DNA. Though scientists had been aware of DNA since the 1860s and its role in genetic inheritance since 1943, Watson and Crick were the first to explain how DNA works to replicate itself and pass on genes from one generation to the next.\n\n1954: Brown vs. Board of Education\n\n• Date: May 17\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nIn a landmark case involving Linda Brown of Topeka, Kansas, who had to cross a railroad track to reach an all-black elementary school even though an all-white school was closer, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the segregated school system was unconstitutional on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. The clause would be used again by the courts to reverse state-level racial segregation practices and ordinances.\n\n1955: Parks starts a movement\n\n• Date: Dec. 1\n\n• Location: Montgomery, Alabama\n\nRosa Parks makes history by refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus. The arrest of Parks for insisting to remain seated leads to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascent of a young pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., as a local activist leader to advance the civil rights cause. A successful federal lawsuit by the NAACP against the city leads to the desegregation of the Montgomery bus system on Dec. 21 of the following year.\n\n1956: Hungary suppressed\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Budapest\n\nNine years after the start of the Cold War, Hungarians took to the streets, demanding democratic reforms. Three days later, Soviet Red Army troops invade Hungary, killing thousands. Nine days after the incursion, Budapest is occupied by the Soviet troops in one of the largest and most aggressive actions taken by the Soviet Union since the end of World War II.\n\n1957: The Little Rock Nine\n\n• Date: Sept 24\n\n• Location: Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower orders federal troops to protect nine African American high school students as they start classes at the all-white Little Rock Central High School. This would become one of the first high-profile actions by the federal government against state-level racial segregation.\n\n1958: U.S. launches first satellite\n\n• Date: Jan. 31\n\n• Location: Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\nThe United States successfully launches Explorer 1, three months after the Soviet Union sent its first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit. The two superpowers would go on to send more satellites into space, creating a Cold War space race to build ever more sophisticated orbital communications devices.\n\n1959: Castro takes over Cuba\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Havana\n\nU.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista flees Havana as Fidel Castro's forces advance on the Cuban capital. Days later, rebels led by Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos enter the city, followed two days later by Castro's forces, who quickly consolidate power in Cuba, establishing a communist government in the Caribbean's largest country.\n\nTraveling nightmare:Air Canada traveler claims she woke up on 'freezing cold,' 'pitch black' and empty plane\n\n1960: Lunch Counter Sit-in\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nWhen four African-American college students – Ezell A.

People live longer, eat better, have greater access to improved medical care and are freer to express their opinions and associate with whomever they want.\n\nThat optimism can be seen in population growth. Despite the two most devastating wars in human history, the world population has nearly tripled, from 1.9 billion to 7.5 billion, since 1917.\n\nOne hundred years is an eye blink in history, yet 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote in the United States. African-Americans were prevented from voting in the American South. Labor unions were in their infancy and were weak, and laws reforming child labor had yet to be passed by Congress. All that changed because of women’s suffrage, the inexorable march of civil rights and the strengthening labor unions.\n\nOne hundred years ago, a person anywhere in the world was more likely than not to be illiterate. And there was a good chance he or she was the subject of colonial rulers in South America, Africa and Asia. Two world wars would spell the end of imperial houses in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia, and weaken the grip of another, Great Britain. Independence movements sprouted in Europe, Africa and Asia, yearning for freedom and expressing national pride.\n\nNationalism had its dark side, though, with fascist governments ruling Italy and Germany. It would take a world war to remove their scourge. Another form of totalitarianism, communism, would dominate the USSR and Eastern Europe for several generations, as well as China and other countries in Asia, before the West would triumph over the Soviet Union and its allies in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of the Cold War, that conflict launched the space race and accelerated technological progress, hastening the use of personal computers and cell phones. These inventions have fundamentally changed our lives – from the way we communicate to the way we shop and socialize – and made billions of dollars for the companies that make them and their founders. These products and innovations are a major part of the culture today.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list. Deciding the most important event in a given year by its nature is a subjective exercise. In reaching our decisions, we chose the event that had the most far-reaching impact and was not necessarily the most famous event in a given year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

These stories range from massive conflicts or catastrophes that leave thousands dead or stranded to technological developments and supreme court decisions that completely change our daily lives.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the biggest news stories in each year since 1950. The event we chose for a given year wasn’t always the most talked-about story when it occurred, but each one in retrospect proved to have the biggest impact on history.\n\nMajor milestones in civil rights, wars and conflicts, and breakthroughs in science and medicine stand out in news coverage over this time period. As technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of, progressive ideas also found footing and changed the world. Women, African Americans, and the LGBTQ community demanded, and often won, equal rights – from the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the legalization of same-sex marriage. Here are the most important human rights milestones since 2000.\n\nIncreasingly, major news events in recent years include severe weather events and other catastrophes tied to global climate change. Devastating changes to our climate now endanger the ecosystems of our planet. In the coming years, natural disasters will have an increasingly large role on the course of history. Here are 26 disaster scenarios caused by climate change.\n\nDangerous states:Which states have the highest rates of violent crime and most murders?\n\nStock market:Investors could still be in for a bumpy ride in 2020\n\n1950: Korean War starts\n\n• Date: June 25\n\n• Location: Korea\n\nThe North Korean People’s Army crosses the 38th parallel into South Korea, eliciting an almost immediate response from U.S. President Harry Truman and marking the beginning of the Korean War – a proxy battle between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. The parties would agree to a ceasefire three years later. The uneasy relations between North Korea and South Korea last to this day.\n\n1951: Rosenbergs sentenced\n\n• Date: March 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nHusband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are convicted of espionage for their part in passing along atomic secrets to the Soviet Union during and after World War II. They are executed two years later. Not everyone is convinced of their involvement in the scheme. Supporters claim they are scapegoats swept up in the Cold War hysteria of the time. Documents would reveal decades later the extent of Julius Rosenberg’s involvement in the spy ring, though Ethel’s participation in the scheme remains inconclusive.\n\n1952: First hydrogen bomb test\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Marshall Islands\n\nThe United States successfully detonates its first hydrogen bomb, a second-generation thermonuclear device. The detonation in the Marshall Islands is part of Operation Ivy, one of a series of nuclear bomb tests. From 1946 to 1958, the United States used the remote Pacific Marshall Islands as its nuclear weapons testing site, conducting a total of 67 nuclear tests.\n\n1953: The dawn of DNA\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: Cambridge, England, U.K.\n\nCambridge University scientists James Watson and Francis Crick announce they have discovered the double-helix structure of DNA. Though scientists had been aware of DNA since the 1860s and of its role in genetic inheritance since 1943, Watson and Crick were the first to explain how DNA works to replicate itself and pass on genes from one generation to the next.\n\n1954: Brown v. Board of Education\n\n• Date: May 17\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark case involving Linda Brown of Topeka, Kansas, who had to cross a railroad track to reach an all-black elementary school even though an all-white school was closer, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the segregated school system is unconstitutional on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. The clause would be used again by the courts to reverse state-level racial segregation practices and ordinances.\n\n1955: Parks starts a movement\n\n• Date: Dec. 1\n\n• Location: Montgomery, Alabama\n\nRosa Parks makes history by refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus. Her arrest for insisting to remain seated leads to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascent of a young pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., as a local activist leader working to advance the civil rights cause. A successful federal lawsuit by the NAACP against the city leads to the desegregation of the Montgomery bus system on Dec. 21 of the following year.\n\n1956: Hungary suppressed\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Budapest\n\nNine years after the start of the Cold War, Hungarians take to the streets, demanding democratic reforms. Three days later, Soviet Red Army troops invade Hungary, killing thousands. Nine days after the incursion, Soviet troops occupy Budapest in one of the largest and most aggressive actions taken by the Soviet Union since the end of World War II.\n\n1957: The Little Rock Nine\n\n• Date: Sept 24\n\n• Location: Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nU.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower orders federal troops to protect nine African American high school students as they start classes at the all-white Little Rock Central High School. This would become one of the first high-profile actions the federal government would take against state-level racial segregation.\n\n1958: US launches first satellite\n\n• Date: Jan. 31\n\n• Location: Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\nThe United States successfully launches Explorer 1, three months after the Soviet Union sends its first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit. The two superpowers would go on to send more satellites into space, creating a Cold War space race to build ever more sophisticated orbital communications devices and to achieve spaceflight capabilities and generally space superiority.\n\n1959: Castro takes over Cuba\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Havana\n\nU.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista flees Havana as Fidel Castro’s forces advance on the Cuban capital. Days later, rebels led by Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos enter the city, followed two days later by Castro’s forces. Castro quickly consolidates power in Cuba, establishing a communist government in the Caribbean’s largest country.\n\n1960: Lunch counter sit-in\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nWhen four African American college students – Ezell A. Blair, Franklin E. McCain, Joseph A. McNeil, and David L. Richmond – sit down at a Woolworth’s lunch counter and ask for service, they are denied. The young men refuse to give up their seats, their sit-in leading to a larger six-month protest that results in the desegregation of the lunch counter by that summer and many other restaurants across the south.\n\n1961: Berlin Wall built\n\n• Date: Aug. 13\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nBy the late summer of 1961, the loss of skilled workers such as teachers, engineers, and doctors to the West reaches crisis levels in East Germany. On Aug. 12, 2,400 East Germans cross into West Berlin, the most in a single day. The next day, with the approval of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, East Germany begins building a wall that would extend 27 miles through Berlin, dividing families and friends for the next 28 years. The wall would serve as an enduring symbol of the Cold War, used by presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan to inspire a divided city.\n\n1962: Cuban missile crisis\n\n• Date: Oct.16-28\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWhen the United States learns that the Soviet Union is building nuclear missile installations 90 miles south of Miami in communist Cuba, the Kennedy administration enacts a naval blockade around the island, which is at times tested, to demand the removal of the missiles. The standoff is widely considered to be the closest the two nuclear superpowers come to direct military confrontation. Cooler heads prevail. The Soviet Union offers to remove the missiles in exchange for a guarantee that the United States will not invade Cuba. In secret, the administration also agrees to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey.\n\n1963: JFK assassinated\n\n• Date: Nov. 22\n\n• Location: Dallas\n\nAs John F. Kennedy prepares for his re-election bid, the 34th president of the United States embarks on a multi-state tour in September 1963. He is murdered by a sharpshooter’s bullet fired by Lee Harvey Oswald at about 12:30 p.m. as his motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza in Dallas. Oswald himself is murdered two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.\n\n1964: LBJ's \"War on Poverty\"\n\n• Date: Jan. 8\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson struggles to shift focus away from the Vietnam War and on his stated goals of reducing poverty, ending segregation, and establishing the social programs that many Americans rely on to this day, including the immensely popular Medicare program. During his “War on Poverty” State of the Union Address of Jan. 8, 1964, LBJ outlines the need for the country to reduce poverty, end racial discrimination, attend to the health needs of the elderly, and other progressive goals. LBJ later ushers in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965.\n\n1965: Selma to Montgomery march\n\n• Date: March 7\n\n• Location: Selma, Alabama\n\nThe fatal shooting of protester Jimmy Lee Jackson by an Alabama state trooper sparks a march in the state from Selma to Montgomery. Hundreds of civil rights activists march in what becomes known as “Bloody Sunday.” Police confront the marchers, led by John Lewis (who is a House Democrat from Georgia) and others. As the activists cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, police attack the protesters with tear gas and billy clubs, hospitalizing 50.\n\nA comfortable retirement:In which states will your money will last longest or shortest?\n\nRobocalls on the rise:Which states get the most and where does yours rank?\n\n1966: Mao purges rivals\n\n• Date: Aug. 13\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nAt the end of a weeklong session of the Communist Party Central Committee of the People’s Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong condemns the political elites, calling on China’s youth to rebel against the entrenched political hierarchy. It is the beginning of the decade-long Cultural Revolution that fundamentally transforms Chinese society. Intellectuals, members of the former Nationalist government, and people with ties to Western powers are persecuted, sent to re-education labor camps, or killed by factions of the Red Guards formed in the wake of Mao’s call to action.\n\n1967: Six-Day War\n\n• Date: June 5\n\n• Location: Middle East\n\nAmid escalating tensions with its neighbors, Israel launches a pre-emptive strike that destroys most of Egypt’s air force. Syria, Jordan, and Iraq also attack Israel. As the war continues, Israel takes the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, captures East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan, and in heavy fighting seizes the Golan Heights from Syria. A ceasefire goes into effect on June 10.\n\n1968: Dream denied\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Memphis, Tennessee\n\nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is fatally shot by James Earl Ray as the civil rights icon stands on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, a tragedy that sparks race riots nationwide. King’s influence in words and actions touch and move not only the nation, but the world, and resonate to this day. Two months later, on June 4, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and brother of John F. Kennedy, is fatally shot by Sirhan Sirhan, an Arab Christian from Jerusalem, who believes Kennedy is “instrumental” in oppressing Palestinians.\n\n1969: Landing on the moon\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Moon\n\nPresident Kennedy’s goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 is realized six years after his assassination. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins blast off from the Kennedy Space Center at 9:32 a.m. aboard the Saturn V rocket. After three days of travel, Armstrong and Aldrin land the Eagle module on the lunar surface as Collins remains in lunar orbit to pilot the module. Upon their return to Earth, the three astronauts are put in 21-day quarantine to ensure they did not bring back any lunar contagions.\n\n1970: Vietnam War turns to Cambodia\n\n• Date: April 29\n\n• Location: Eastern Cambodia\n\nAlthough the United States should be scaling back U.S. troop presence in Vietnam, President Richard Nixon approves an operation with the South Vietnamese to invade Cambodia to oust Northern Vietnamese forces there. The Cambodian incursion inflames anti-war protests in the United States as it is perceived to be an escalation of U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia.\n\n1971: Pentagon Papers\n\n• Date: Feb. 8\n\n• Location: Laos\n\nThe Pentagon Papers, a study by the U.S. Department of Defense about the country's involvement in the Vietnam war, are released and published first in The New York Times, then other newspapers. The documents expose several missteps and how several administrations have misled the American public about how involved the military was and about plans to escalate the war in 1964. They also reveal an expanded campaign in Cambodia and Laos, especially clandestine bombing in Laos, which today is considered the heaviest bombardment in history.\n\n1972: Nixon goes to China\n\n• Date: Feb. 21\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nNixon, a virulent anti-communist earlier in his political career, surprises the American public by traveling to Beijing for a week of talks in a historic first step towards normalizing relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Until this trip, the United States and communist China were de facto enemies, fighting proxy wars in the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and South Vietnam at the time of Nixon’s visit.\n\n1973: Roe v. Wade\n\n• Date: Jan. 22\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark 7-2 decision that will be known as Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court rules that under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, abortion is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The court adds that as the pregnancy develops the state can balance a woman’s right to privacy with its interest in preserving the “potentiality of human life.” As a result, states can ban abortion in the third trimester except in cases where a pregnancy affects a woman’s health.\n\n1974: Nixon resigns\n\n• Date: Aug. 8\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon announces his resignation amid impeachment proceedings stemming from the Watergate scandal and the administration’s attempt resist a congressional investigation. The scandal exposes abuses of power by the White House after five burglars were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. Nixon becomes the only president in U.S. history to resign.\n\n1975: Saigon falls\n\n• Date: April 30\n\n• Location: South Vietnam\n\nTwo years after the last American troops left Vietnam, communist troops from North Vietnam capture Saigon, ending nearly two decades of relentless war in the rice paddies and jungles of that Southeast Asian nation. The total number of fatal casualties for the United States is 58,220.\n\n1976: The Concorde changes air travel\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: London and Paris\n\nTwo supersonic Concorde jets take off simultaneously – one from London to Bahrain, operated by British Airways, and the other from Paris to Rio de Janeiro via Dakar in Senegal, operated by Air France – marking the first time paying passengers enjoy commercial travel at faster than the speed of sound. Though travel by one of the 16 Concordes ever put into service could slash travel time from New York to London in half, the high cost of maintenance, soaring ticket prices, as well as a fatal accident in 2000, would seal the fate of the narrow, slope-nosed aircraft.\n\n1977: Rise of the personal computer\n\n• Date: January\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nPersonal home computers began to emerge in the 1970s, but many of the earliest versions resembled calculators that would plug into televisions sets. By 1977, however, the desktop home computer begins to resemble the more modern versions – with an accompanying, attached or separate, computer screen and a magnetic tape or floppy disk storage device. The Commodore PET is unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago that year, while the first Apple II and Radio Shack’s TRS-80 also go on sale.\n\n1978: Cult's mass suicide\n\n• Date: Nov. 18\n\n• Location: Jonestown, Guyana\n\nMore than 900 people die in one of worst recorded acts of cult-related mass murder-suicide as nearly all the victims and perpetrators drink a powdered drink mix laced with cyanide. Most of the victims are Americans, devotees of Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones, a former Methodist-trained preacher who built a following and led the flock to Guyana. Among the dead are 276 children. A small number of cult defectors are killed by Peoples Temple gunmen who also slay Leo Ryan, California Congressman who had gone to Guyana to investigate Jonestown.\n\n1979: Islamic Republic born in Iran\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Tehran\n\nWorsening economic conditions, increasing discontent with the government, and wide support for religious leader in exile Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini end the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The shah and his family flee Iran in January 1979. On Feb. 11, the monarchy is dissolved, and on April 1, Khomeini declares Iran an Islamic republic. With support among the nation’s clergy and their many followers, he begins rebuilding Iranian society based on conservative Shiite religious principles. In November, a mob raids the U.S. embassy, taking more than 60 Americans hostage. The crisis would be influential in the following year's presidential election and would not fully resolve until January 1981.\n\n1980: Reagan elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the United States in an economic malaise and the Iranian hostage crisis hobbling the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan is elected the 40th president in a landslide. Reagan, who would serve two terms, was the oldest man elected president at the time. Reagan’s election changes the trajectory of American politics, ushering in an era of conservative leadership. During his tenure, he takes a more aggressive approach to the Soviet Union and increases defense spending. Reagan convinces Congress to cut taxes, a move that many economists credit with triggering an economic boom in the 1980s.\n\n1981: AIDS impacts America\n\n• Date: June 5\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a report about five gay men who had been diagnosed by local physicians with a rare form of pneumonia – the first reported U.S. cases of what would later become known as HIV/AIDS. The infectious autoimmune disease spreads so fast that by the end of the 1982, 500 Americans would die from what the CDC later calls acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The death toll would rise to 5,000 by 1985.\n\n1982: Mexico triggers regional debt crisis\n\n• Date: Aug 12\n\n• Location: Mexico City\n\nGlobal economic stagnation in the 1970s and early 1980s as well as excessive borrowing among Latin America’s biggest economies boils over when Mexico’s Finance Minister Jesús Silva-Herzog tells the U.S. Federal Reserve his country can no longer service its debt of $80 billion. After the announcement, lenders realize virtually every country in Latin America, led by Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, is not able to pay back loans. The crisis would lead to years of eroding wages, weak to negative economic growth, sky-high unemployment, severe austerity measures, and political instability – known as the “lost decade” in Latin America.\n\n1983: The internet is born\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe internet as we know it today – a seemingly endless collection of websites hosted on servers scattered across the globe – is still more than a decade away. At the beginning of 1983, however, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) – a small network for academics and researchers – transitions to the standard TCP/IP protocol of the World Wide Web. The protocol would become the internet's cornerstone and technical foundation as it allows expanded available address space. The protocol also decentralizes the network, thus also expanding accessibility.\n\n1984: Chemicals kill thousands in India\n\n• Date: Dec. 2\n\n• Location: Bhopal, India\n\nThe chemical disaster in Bhopal is still considered history’s worst industrial disaster. About 30 tons of methyl isocyanate, an industrial gas used to make pesticide, are released at a Union Carbide Corp. plant. About 600,000 poor residents of nearby shanty towns are exposed to a highly toxic compound that kills about 15,000 people and countless farm animals, according to Indian government estimates. The calamity leads to a generation of birth defects. To this day, locals claim the now-abandoned site is riddled with toxic materials left behind by Union Carbide, which was acquired by Dow Chemical in 2001.\n\n1985: Reagan, Gorbachev meet\n\n• Date: Nov. 19\n\n• Location: Geneva\n\nDespite his often bellicose criticisms of the Soviet Union, Reagan agrees to meet with his counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Geneva in the first meeting between leaders of the two Cold War foes in nearly a decade. Though the meeting yields little of substance, it initiates a closer relationship between the two men, who both seem committed to scaling back the nuclear arms race between the two nuclear superpowers.\n\n1986: Chernobyl disaster\n\n• Date: Apr. 26\n\n• Location: Prypyat, Soviet Union\n\nA combination of poor design and human error leads to a power surge in a reactor in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This leads to a massive explosion that puts highly radioactive material into the air. Soviet officials try to cover up the incident, but Swedish scientists notice the increased levels of radioactivity. It takes a little over a week for the radioactive emissions to be contained, but by then radioactive particles had already spread thousands of miles by wind currents to countries as far away as France. A 1,600 square mile area around the plant known as the “exclusion zone” is deemed unsafe, and more than 220,000 people have to be resettled. The radiation causes deformities in nearby livestock and cancer in many people near the blast. Though exact figures are hard to come by, the UN reports years later there were over 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children who were in the affected areas. The Chernobyl disaster is still considered the worst nuclear power failure in history.\n\n1987: Stock market tanks\n\n• Date: Oct. 19\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges 508 points, or more than 22%, on Oct. 19, 1987, later referred to as Black Monday. The drop, in percentage terms, is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\n1988: End of fighting in Iran-Iraq war\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Iraq-Iran border\n\nFrom 1980 to 1988, neighboring Middle East countries Iran and Iraq are engaged in a protracted war. It begins when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launches an attack on Iran in 1980, sensing an opportunity in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iraqi forces initially make incursions into Iranian land, but they lose the area gained in 1982 after Iran is able to mobilize its military and repel the Iraqi forces. Hussein seeks a peace deal that year, but Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini refuses. From 1982 to 1988, the fighting is characterized by sporadic missile launches, attacks on each others’ oil tankers, and the use of chemical weapons, mostly by the Iraqis. By 1988, Iran’s economy is in dire straits, forcing Iran to agree to a UN-brokered ceasefire. The two countries signed an official peace treaty in 1990. Anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million troops were killed in the war and up to 100,000 Kurds.\n\n1989: The Berlin Wall falls\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nCracks in the monolithic Soviet bloc are starting to appear in the 1980s, and the very symbol of communist repression comes crashing down in November, when the Berlin Wall is breached, ending a 28-year division of the city. During the day on Nov. 9, a spokesman for East Berlin’s Communist Party says that starting at midnight that day, citizens of East Germany would be free to cross the country’s borders. Almost immediately Berliners start slamming the wall with axes and sledgehammers. By nightfall, the celebration turns into what one observer calls “the greatest street party in the history of the world,” and the city is reunited. East and West Germany would reunite one year later.\n\n1990: Democracy in Poland\n\n• Date: Jan. 28\n\n• Location: Poland\n\nWith the hold of the Soviet Union and communism on East Europe loosening, Poland's ruling communist party votes to dissolve and become more moderate. In the following elections, Lech Wałęsa, leader of the Solidarity Movement and the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, wins the election and becomes president.\n\n1991: American goes to war in Middle East\n\n• Date: Jan. 17\n\n• Location: Saudi Arabia and Kuwait\n\nAfter Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invades and occupies Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, the United States sends forces to defend neighboring Saudi Arabia from being overrun and to protect its vital oil assets there, calling it Operation Desert Shield. With Saudi Arabia secured, the United States implements Operation Desert Storm to push Iraqi forces back across the border with Kuwait in a military operation that lasts until a ceasefire takes effect in April.\n\n1992: Cold War ends\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Camp David, Maryland\n\nJust weeks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec. 26, 1991, U.S. President George H.W. Bush and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, meet at Camp David to formally declare the end of the Cold War that began shortly after the end of World War II. The meeting comes days after both countries announce they would stop aiming nuclear missiles at each other. Russia declares its 11 former communist satellite republics – from Armenia to Uzbekistan – independent.\n\n1993: The EU becomes reality\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Brussels\n\nThe Treaty of the European Union, also known as the Maastricht Treaty, goes into effect in November, after a rough series of political wrangling. Among other concessions, the treaty allows the U.K. and Denmark to opt out of the common euro currency. The treaty opens the way to removing border controls among member states and invites new members to join the union.\n\n1994: Rwandan genocide\n\n• Date: April-July\n\n• Location: Rwanda\n\nFor decades, Rwanda has been embroiled in a conflict between the country's two major ethnic groups – the Hutu and the Tutsi. Over 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people are killed, mostly Tutsis, but some moderate Hutus as well. When Tutsi militant group eventually gains control of the country, some two million Rwandans flee to nearby African nations. In 2008, three former Rwandan officials are convicted by an international court of organizing the genocide.\n\n1995: Domestic terror strikes Oklahoma\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Oklahoma City\n\nIn the deadliest domestic terrorist attack in U.S. history, anti-government radicals Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. They time the truck-bomb attack for a weekday morning in order to maximize casualties. For the murder of at least 168 people, including 19 children who were in a child-care center in the building, and the injury of hundreds of others, an unremorseful McVeigh is executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. Nichols is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\n'You can do better':Jeff Bezos ripped for $690K Australian wildfire relief donation\n\nCutting the cord:As prices go up, here's how you can still save money streaming\n\n1996: The dawn of cloning\n\n• Date: July 5\n\n• Location: Midlothian, Scotland, U.K.\n\nDolly the Sheep enters the annals of bioengineering when scientists at Scotland’s Roslin Institute become the first to not only successfully clone a mammal, but also the first to do so using an adult cell rather than an embryonic one.

New Horizons is now en route to the Kuiper Belt, a massive asteroid belt at the far reaches of the solar system.\n\n2016: Trump elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 8\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nRunning on a populist agenda, Donald Trump is elected the 45th president of the United States and the fifth president in U.S. history (the second since the 2000) to win despite losing the popular vote. The real estate developer and television personality ran on a platform of putting “America First” in global trade and foreign policy negotiations and cracking down on undocumented immigrants.\n\n2017: Hurricane triple whammy\n\n• Date: August-September\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWithin just four weeks, three massive hurricanes – Harvey, Irma, and Maria – strike Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean, killing 228 people, inflicting a combined $265 billion in damages, and displacing millions of homeowners. Hurricane Maria inflicts immense damage to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was already struggling due to economic insolvency.\n\n2018: Wildfires\n\n• Date: November\n\n• Location: Northern California\n\nThe deadliest wildfires in the state’s history engulf northern California in November. The catastrophe costs the lives of 88 people, and the fire consumes 18,500 homes and businesses. State and federal officials estimate that it would cost $3 billion to clean up debris. Climate change activists say the conflagrations are evidence that global warming is no longer a distant concern and that it is occurring now.\n\n2019: Trump impeached\n\n• Date: Dec. 18\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2019, Donald Trump becomes just the third U.S. president to be impeached. A whistleblower reveals that in July Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as cybersecurity company Crowdstrike. These requests were made just after Zelensky said Ukraine wanted to buy weapons from the United States. After the call comes to light, Democratic leaders file two articles of impeachment – for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They say Trump abused his power by using the office of the president to target a political opponent. The obstruction of Congress charge stems from accusations that Trump Administration officials tried to cover up the whistleblower’s report. Trump calls the investigation a “witch hunt” and denies any wrongdoing. The House passes both articles in a vote that goes almost entirely along party lines, moving the impeachment proceedings along to the Senate.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

However, this level of economic development is not the norm in much of the world, and neither is the standard of living the typical American enjoys.\n\nThe material wealth of the United States has been generated through a complex, diversified economy, developed over centuries. The U.S. gross national income (GNI) per capita is $55,351. Meanwhile, there are more than half a billion people spread across dozens of countries worldwide where per capita GNI is about $2,000 or less.\n\nReviewing GNI per capita in 192 countries from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators Database, 24/7 Wall St. identified many of the the poorest countries in the world. GNI captures all economic activity within a nation’s borders in addition to the wealth created by nationally-owned entities operating in other countries. Unlike wealthier countries like the United States, many of the world’s poorest countries have only recently gained independence from their former colonial rulers in Europe.\n\nSocial Security is very successful:Here's why\n\nJob hunting? Don't leave your job before doing these 5 things\n\nIn many of the world’s poorest countries on this list, economic development has been hampered by political instability and violence. While many countries on this list have stabilized and have reported steady economic growth in recent years, others remain unstable and dangerous and are among the 14 countries the U.S. government doesn’t want you to visit.\n\nOther barriers to prosperity include a lack of critical infrastructure, like a reliable power grid. Public sector corruption, which can discourage investment and stifle growth, is also a common problem. Several of the countries on this list also rank among the most corrupt countries in the world.\n\n25. Benin\n\n• GNI per capita: $2,055\n\n• 2017 GDP: $23.1 billion\n\n• Population: 11.2 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 61.2 years\n\nBenin, a West African country of about 11.2 million people, is one of only 25 countries in the world with a GNI per capita below $2,100. About half of the population lives on less than $1.90 a day, and over three-quarters live on $3.20 or less a day.\n\nAs is the case in many poor countries, health outcomes in Benin lag behind much of the world. Life expectancy at birth in the country is just 61 years, about 11 years shy of the global average. The low life expectancy is partially the result of a high infant mortality rate. There are 98 infant deaths for every 1,000 live births per year in Benin, compared to 39 per 1,000 globally.\n\n24. Guinea\n\n• GNI per capita: $2,031\n\n• 2017 GDP: $26.0 billion\n\n• Population: 12.7 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 60.6 years\n\nDespite a wealth of valuable minerals like diamonds, gold, and aluminum ore, Guinea ranks as one of the poorest countries in the world. Only about a third of residents have access to electricity, and the country's 32% literacy rate is among the lowest in the world. Like many poor countries, Guinea has a largely agrarian economy, with farming accounting for about two-thirds of total employment.\n\nLike many countries on this list, Guinea has had a history of political instability that hampered economic development. In recent years, after a coup and military rule for two years, Guinea became civilian ruled again in 2010, only to succumb to a wave of political violence. In 2014, the country was also ravaged by the Ebola outbreak.\n\n23. Zimbabwe\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,990\n\n• 2017 GDP: $36.6 billion\n\n• Population: 16.5 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 61.7 years\n\nA former British territory, Zimbabwe has been an independent nation for less than 40 years. Zimbabwe is one of only 23 countries with a GNI per capita below $2,000. Low-income countries typically rely heavily on agriculture, and in Zimbabwe, farming accounts for 67% of total employment. Economic development is hampered by infrastructure limitations – just 38.1% of citizens have access to electricity.\n\nThe younger generation in Zimbabwe may be better equipped to foster prosperity in the coming decades as the country's leaders are investing in education. Zimbabwe spends the equivalent of 7.5% of its GDP on education, far more than the 4.8% average across all countries with available data.\n\n22. Mali\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,953\n\n• 2017 GDP: $37.4 billion\n\n• Population: 18.5 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 58.5 years\n\nLike many of the poorest countries in the world, Mali's population is growing rapidly. The West African country's annual population growth rate of 3.0% is faster than all but a handful of other countries worldwide. The country is also lacking in basic infrastructure. Just 35.1% of Mali citizens have access to electricity. It would take an average of 120 days to bring electricity to those in the country without it, compared to a global average of about 86 days.\n\nThe effects of the hardships associated with poverty are evident in the country's health outcomes. Life expectancy at birth in Mail is just 58.5 years, one of the lowest of any country in the world.\n\n21. Rwanda\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,814\n\n• 2017 GDP: $22.7 billion\n\n• Population: 12.2 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 67.5 years\n\nRwanda is a landlocked country in east-central Africa. Its economic development has been hampered by one of the worst genocides in history. In the mid-1990s, an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were killed in less than 100 days for their ethnicity.\n\nThough the country has made a comeback in recent years through coffee and tea production, it ranks among the poorest countries in the world, with a GNI per capita of just $1,814. Nearly 80% of Rwandans live on less than $3.20 a day, and over half live on less than $1.90.\n\n20. Chad\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,750\n\n• 2017 GDP: $26.3 billion\n\n• Population: 14.9 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 53.2 years\n\nDespite a wealth of valuable resources like gold and oil, Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world. Tensions between Muslims in the north and Christians in the south have been a drag on development. Government corruption is also hurting economic development and discouraging investment. Based on over a dozen surveys on perceptions of corruption in the public sector, Transparency International ranks Chad among the most corrupt countries in the world.\n\nChad's social and economic challenges have serious consequences for its citizens. Life expectancy in the landlocked country in north-central Africa is just 53.2 years, nearly the lowest of any country in the world.\n\n19. Ethiopia\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,719\n\n• 2017 GDP: $181.6 billion\n\n• Population: 105.0 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 65.9 years\n\nEthiopia is Africa's oldest independent nation, and having never been colonized, it has not faced the challenges that come with new-found independence that many other countries on this list faced. However, droughts and civil conflict in the early '90s have hurt development, and infrastructure in the country is lacking.\n\nLess than half of the population has access to electricity, and there are only about 38 cell-phone subscriptions per 100 people. Broadband and landline telephone subscriptions are even more rare. More than one in every four Ehtiopians live on less than $1.90 a day, and 62% live on $3.20 or less a day.\n\n18. Haiti\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,664\n\n• 2017 GDP: $18.2 billion\n\n• Population: 11.0 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 63.6 years\n\nLocated on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, Haiti is one of only a few countries on this list that is not in Africa. Though the country gained independence from France in the 19th century, it remained in its former colonial ruler's debt until 1947, paying compensation to former French slave owners. In recent decades, the country has been slammed by natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes and has also suffered from political instability.\n\nLike many poor countries, Haiti is heavily dependent on farming, with agriculture accounting for about half of total employment. The effects of poverty on the Hatian population are blatant as about 46% of the population is malnourished, and the average life expectancy in the country is just 63.6 years.\n\n17. Uganda\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,658\n\n• 2017 GDP: $72.8 billion\n\n• Population: 42.9 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 60.2 years\n\nGaining independence from Great Britain in 1962, Uganda fell under the tyrannical rule of Idi Amin from 1971 to 1979. During that period, the country's economy nearly collapsed following the expulsion of all Asian people at the direction of Amin. Additionally, an estimated 300,000 Ugandans were killed under Amin's regime. In recent decades, the landlocked African nation has been roiled by a military coup and rebellions headed by the Lord's Resistance Army.\n\nToday, broad-scale economic development in Uganda is hamstrung in part by infrastructure limitations. Only about a quarter of the country has access to electricity, and while there are over 58 cell-phone subscriptions per 100 people in the country, fixed telephone lines and broadband are virtually non-existent.\n\n16. Afghanistan\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,647\n\n• 2017 GDP: $63.8 billion\n\n• Population: 35.5 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 64.1 years\n\nWith chronic warfare, meaningful economic development in Afghanistan has been effectively impossible in recent decades. Invaded by the Soviets in 1979, the ensuing war lasted a decade and claimed over a million lives. Following Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. military has maintained a presence in the country, and, though NATO ended its combat mission in Afghanistan in 2014, insurgent forces continue to threaten the country's stability.\n\nToday, the standing government in the landlocked South-Central Asian country ranks among the most corrupt in the world. The country is heavily dependent on foreign aid, and citizens regularly suffer from shortages of clean water and electricity.\n\n15. Burkina Faso\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,640\n\n• 2017 GDP: $32.6 billion\n\n• Population: 19.2 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 60.8 years\n\nBurkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa, and despite significant gold reserves, it is one of the poorest countries in both the region and the world. Over the nearly 60 years since gaining independence from France, the country has endured regular political upheaval and violence – conditions under which meaningful development is all but impossible. Currently, over three-quarters of citizens live on less than $3.20 a day.\n\nSeveral social and infrastructure obstacles stand in the way of economic development today. For example, only about a third of adults in Burkina Faso are literate, and fewer than 20% of residents have access to electricity.\n\n14. Togo\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,586\n\n• 2017 GDP: $11.8 billion\n\n• Population: 7.8 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 60.5 years\n\nWeathering bouts of political instability since gaining independence from France in 1960, the West African nation of Togo has stabilized in recent years. The country's economy growth of 4.4% in 2017 was faster than the 3.2% global average growth, and Togo's government has invested heavily in infrastructure that will help attract investment and encourage development.\n\nStill, the country remains among the poorest in the world today. About half of the urban population lives in slums, and nearly half of Togo's total population lives on less than $1.90 a day. Life expectancy in the country is just 60.5 years, nearly 12 years below the global average.\n\n13. Guinea-Bissau\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,552\n\n• 2017 GDP: $2.9 billion\n\n• Population: 1.9 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 57.8 years\n\nThe West African nation of Guinea-Bissau is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Weak public sector institutions have given way to drug trafficking and illegal logging. The legal part of the country's economy is largely agricultural as over two-thirds of total employment is in farming. Cashews are the country's main export, accounting for about 80% of total export value in 2017.\n\nToday, only about 15% of the population has access to electricity, and 26% are malnourished. Guinea-Bissau is one of only a handful of countries worldwide where average life expectancy at birth is under 60 years.\n\n12. Eritrea\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,497\n\n• 2017 GDP: $6.8 billion\n\n• Population: 4.5 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 65.5 years\n\nOne of the youngest countries in the world, Eritrea won independence from neighboring Ethiopia in 1993. The country is highly militarized due in part to more than a decade-long war with Ethiopia that ended in 2018. In addition to war, the country's severe drought has hampered economic development, as agriculture accounts for about 63% of employment. Eritrea drew up a democratic constitution in 1997 but never implemented it. Today, the single-party state ranks among the most corrupt in the world.\n\nLess than half of Eritrea's population has access to electricity, and there are only about 14 cell-phone subscriptions per 100 people. Fixed telephone lines and broadband subscriptions are even more rare.\n\n11. Solomon Islands\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,494\n\n• 2017 GDP: $1.3 billion\n\n• Population: 611,343 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 71.0 years\n\nAn island nation in the South Pacific, the Solomon Islands is one of only a few countries on this list not located in Africa. Civil unrest brought the country to the brink of collapse in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A multinational peacekeeping group led by Australia remained in the country from 2003 to 2017 and brokered a peace deal between rival islands within the nation.\n\nThe county's economy is largely agricultural, with farming accounting for 61% of employment. Like many other poor countries, less than half of the population of the Solomon Islands has access to electricity.\n\n10. The Gambia\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,471\n\n• 2017 GDP: $3.2 billion\n\n• Population: 2.1 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 61.4 years\n\nCompared to most countries on this list – and most countries in West Africa – The Gambia is relatively stable socially and politically. Still, it ranks among the poorest countries in the world with a GNI per capita of less than $1,500.\n\nThe Gambia has limited natural resources and relies heavily on agriculture, with wood, brazil nuts, and cashews accounting for 80% of its exports in 2017. Less than half of The Gambia's population has access to electricity, and over a third of the country's urban population lives in slums.\n\n9. Sierra Leone\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,348\n\n• 2017 GDP: $10.5 billion\n\n• Population: 7.6 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 52.2 years\n\nSierra Leone is a resource-rich country in West Africa. It endured a devastating civil war that was fueled by diamonds and valuable minerals trade. Though the war ended in 2002, it destroyed many of the country's institutions, and the effects are still being felt. Today, Sierra Leone's public sector is perceived to be more corrupt than most other countries.\n\nThe problems associated with the lack of economic development are evident. About a quarter of the country's population is undernourished, and Sierra Leone's maternal mortality rate of 1,360 deaths per 100,000 live births is the worst in the world. The country was also among the hardest hit by the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and at 52.2 years, average life expectancy at birth in Sierra Leone is the worst in the world.\n\n8. Madagascar\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,339\n\n• 2017 GDP: $36.2 billion\n\n• Population: 25.6 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 66.3 years\n\nMadagascar is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean east of the African continent. The former French colony has been independent since 1960, grappling with political violence and coups in the last several decades. While the county has a substantial tourism industry, it is heavily dependent on agriculture, with farming accounting for more than two-thirds of total employment.\n\nLiving conditions for many in the country demonstrate the hardships associated with poverty. Over 77% of the country's urban population lives in slums, and about 43% of residents are undernourished. Life expectancy at birth in Madagascar is just 66.3 years, about six years shy of the global average.\n\n7. Mozambique\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,100\n\n• 2017 GDP: $33.7 billion\n\n• Population: 29.7 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 58.9 years\n\nA former Portuguese colony, Mozambique, a country on the Indian Ocean in southern Africa, became an independent nation in 1975. Like many former colonial territories, Mozambique struggled in its early years of independence, enduring a civil war that lasted from 1976 to 1992. Though the country's economy got a boost in 2011 with the discovery of natural gas, development is still lagging due in part to the over decade-and-a-half of civil war.\n\nA staggering 62.4% of the population lives on $1.90 or less a day, and nearly 82% live on $3.20 a day. The country is also dealing with a public health crisis, as 12.5% of the population between the ages of 15 and 49 are HIV positive. Partially as a result, life expectancy in the country is less than 60 years.\n\n6. Liberia\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,078\n\n• 2017 GDP: $5.5 billion\n\n• Population: 4.7 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 63.0 years\n\nFounded partly by freed U.S. slaves, Liberia's economy was all but destroyed in the 1990s and early 2000s by a civil war that left a quarter of a million dead and thousands more displaced. Limited economic development in the country has lead to a low standard of living. Less than 20% of the population has access to electricity, and about 39% are undernourished. The government, which ranks among the most corrupt in the world, spends relatively little on education as a share of GDP, and illiteracy is widespread.\n\nThe West African nation is resource rich, however, and gold exports are driving growth. In 2017, gold accounted for 19% of the country's $1.0 billion in exports.\n\n5. Malawi\n\n• GNI per capita: $1,064\n\n• 2017 GDP: $20.4 billion\n\n• Population: 18.6 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 63.7 years\n\nMalawi is an East African nation that shares a border with Mozambique, another country on this list. One of the poorest countries in the world, a staggering 70.3% of the population lives on less than $1.90 a day. Poorer countries are typically heavily dependent on agriculture and subsistence farming, and in Malawi, farming accounts for 71.9% of total employment.\n\nLike other countries in the region, Malawi is struggling to contain the spread of HIV. Currently, about one in every 10 residents between the ages of 15 and 49 are HIV positive, and, according to the BBC, more than a million children living in the country have been orphaned by the disease.\n\n4. Niger\n\n• GNI per capita: $906\n\n• 2017 GDP: $19.9 billion\n\n• Population: 21.5 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 60.4 years\n\nNiger is one of only four countries with a GNI per capita of less than $1,000. Since gaining independence from France in 1960, Niger has been marred by coups and political instability. As one of the least developed nations in the world, just 16% of the population has access to electricity. Over 80% of Niger's population lives in rural areas, and of those who live in urban areas, the vast majority live in slums.\n\nPoverty is widespread in the country as more than three in every four residents live on less than $3.20 a day. Niger is a resource-rich nation, however, and oil exploration and gold mining are driving economic growth. Niger's economy grew at a relatively rapid 4.9% pace in 2017.\n\n3. Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\n• GNI per capita: $796\n\n• 2017 GDP: $65.7 billion\n\n• Population: 81.3 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 60.0 years\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a country rich in resources like valuable minerals, like copper, diamonds, and gold. Rather than being an economic boon, however, control over these resources has helped fuel a civil war that lead to as many as 6 million deaths.\n\nBasic infrastructure is lacking in the country as only about 17% of the population has access to electricity, and there are no fixed telephone lines. This, in addition to rampant public sector corruption, makes conducting business in the country difficult. As in many poor countries, health outcomes are lagging in the DR Congo. The country has one of the world's highest infant mortality rates, and the average life expectancy is just 60 years.\n\n2. Burundi\n\n• GNI per capita: $686\n\n• 2017 GDP: $7.3 billion\n\n• Population: 10.9 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 57.9 years\n\nWith a GNI per capita of just $686, Burundi is the second poorest country in both Africa and the world. The country's modern history has been stained by a brutal 12-year civil war sparked in 1994 by ethnic tensions between the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority. Today, Burundi's public sector ranks among the most corrupt in the world.\n\nBurundi is also one of the least developed countries in the world. Over 87% of the population lives in rural areas, and fewer than 10% of people in the country have access to electricity. Though nearly all pregnant women in the country receive prenatal medical care, the country's maternal mortality rate of 712 deaths per 100,000 live births is among the highest in the world.\n\n1. Central African Republic\n\n• GNI per capita: $663\n\n• 2017 GDP: $3.1 billion\n\n• Population: 4.7 million\n\n• Life expectancy at birth: 52.9 years\n\nThe GNI per capita of $663 in Central African Republic is the lowest of any country in the world. Despite a wealth of resources like gold, diamonds, and oil, violence has hindered economic development since the country gained independence from France in 1960. After a string of coups in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, religious violence between the Muslim minority and Christian majority has plagued the nation since 2012.\n\nSlightly more than half of the CAR population lives in rural areas, but of those who live in cities, more than 90% live in slums. CAR is the only country with available data where over half of all citizens – 61.8% – are undernourished. The country also has the third highest infant mortality rate in the world and one of the lowest average life expectancies, at just 52.9 years.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Wars in the early part of the 20th century led to the end of the colonial world and gave birth to new nations. These wars also cost millions of lives and trillions of dollars. These are the most expensive wars in U.S. history.\n\nThroughout the past century, technological innovations transformed our lives in ways we never dreamed. Progressive ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, African Americans, and the LGBTQ community demanded, and often won, equal rights – from the ratification of the 19th Amendment in the United States to the legalization of same-sex marriage in many countries around the world. Even so, recent civil rights protests tell us the fight for equality is not over.\n\nDunkin' or Starbucks:Among America's favorite brew-at-home coffee brands, which comes out ahead?\n\nPlanes, phones and automobiles:These are the top-selling products from each state in the US\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that is ravaging the world in 2020 reminds us that for all of our scientific breakthroughs, we’re still vulnerable to deadly viruses that can shut down economies and disrupt society. People are hoping science can save Earth from the devastating changes to the climate that continue to imperil the ecosystems of our planet. In the coming years, natural disasters may have an increasingly impactful role on the course of history. Here are 26 disaster scenarios caused by climate change.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Tempo drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list. Deciding the most important event in a given year is by its nature a subjective exercise. In reaching our decisions, we chose the event that had the most far-reaching impact, even if it was not necessarily the most famous event in a given year.\n\nThe world's most important event every year since 1920\n\n1920: Women's Suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population – in the beginning only white landowning males over the age of 21 – could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution was passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots, though the voting rights fight was far from over for many African American women, especially in the South.\n\n1921: Chinese Communists Rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire Shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto Earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes Monkey Trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist and former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,498 in 2020 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would rule that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. Starts Numbered Highway System\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh Nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the first person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop, making him one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany’s aircraft industry. Also, his infant son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart Crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street Crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve, and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh Rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building Completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nU.S. President Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler Becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR Elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler Consolidates Power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR Launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens Flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 400-meter relay.\n\n1937: UAW Changes Car Industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism Surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes, and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II Starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's Founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald’s Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches, and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes, and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu, and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald’s into one of the world’s largest restaurant chains.\n\n1941: Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed. The United States declares war on Japan the next day and three days later against Germany and Italy.\n\n1942: GIs Arrive in Europe\n\n• Date: Jan. 26\n\n• Location: Northern Ireland\n\nThe first U.S. troops destined to fight in Europe in the world's greatest war arrive in Northern Ireland. It is the beginning of a military buildup that would culminate in the invasion of France more than two years later. Before then, the United States was providing only material support to its ally across the Atlantic, while building up what President Roosevelt called the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" in anticipation for the inevitable entry of the United States into the war in Europe.\n\n1943: Invention of LSD\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Basel, Switzerland\n\nSwiss chemist Albert Hoffman had been studying the potential medicinal value of lysergic compounds when he accidentally exposed himself to LSD-25, which he had created years earlier in his lab. This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery. The U.S. Army tests the drug on soldiers numerous times from 1955 to 1967, briefly toying with the idea of using LSD as a weapon to disorient enemy soldiers during combat.\n\n1944: D-Day\n\n• Date: June 6\n\n• Location: Normandy France\n\nThe plan for the biggest one-day military campaign in history, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces to push the Nazis out of France, is hatched in extreme secrecy a year earlier. The plan is conceived during the Quebec Conference by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. The invasion starts at 6:30 a.m. on five beaches, and over the next 24 hours about 4,900 Allied soldiers are killed, many of them the instant the doors of their Higgins transport boats opened directly into German machine gun fire.\n\n1945: World War II Ends\n\n• Date: Sept. 2\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe surrender of Japan marks the end of World War II amid one of the most tumultuous years of the 20th century. Earlier in the year, leaders of three nations – Benito Mussolini, Franklin Roosevelt, and Adolf Hitler – die and Nazi Germany surrenders. Though the surrender of Japan was inevitable, the prospect of a horrific Allied assault on the Japanese mainland convinces the United States to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic bomb attacks, along with the entry of the Soviet Union in the war against Japan, compel the Japanese to surrender.\n\n1946: Baby Boom Starts\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nMore American babies are born – 3.4 million – in 1946 than in any year in U.S. history up to then. The number of births grows to 4 million per year from 1954 to 1964, the last year of the baby boomer generation, the biggest generation at that point in history.\n\n1947: India Gains Independence\n\n• Date: Aug. 15\n\n• Location: Washington D.C\n\nThe sun sets on the British Empire in India in 1947, as the Asian nation becomes the world's largest democracy. Independence is the culmination of decades of work by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indian nationalists committed to throwing off the yoke of British colonialism. The transition to independence comes at a price. The subcontinent is partitioned into two nations, Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Violence erupts between Hindus and Muslims as Hindus migrate to India and Muslims shift to Pakistan. It is estimated that 1 million people die during the migration.\n\n1948: Birth of Israel\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: Middle East\n\nAfter Israel declares its independence following a UN resolution, neighboring Arab states with troops from Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia attack the former British-controlled Palestinian mandate. The Arab-Israeli War ended with an armistice that leaves Israel with some territories as Egypt and Jordan retains control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, respectively.\n\n1949: NATO Founded\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nWith the Cold War worsening, the Soviet Union detonates its first nuclear bomb and quickly exerts its influence over Eastern Europe. It attempts to do the same in Western Europe, which is still recovering from the massive destruction of World War II. To respond to the Soviet threat, U.S. and Western European allies form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Fundamentally, NATO simply states that an attack on any NATO member would be considered an attack on all NATO members. Cold War tensions ratchet up later that year when the communists take over China, the world’s most populous nation.\n\n1950: Korean War Starts\n\n• Date: June 25\n\n• Location: Korea\n\nThe North Korean People's Army crosses the 38th parallel into South Korea, eliciting almost an immediate response from U.S. President Truman, and starting the Korean War – a proxy battle between the United States and the People's Republic of China. Three years later, a ceasefire would halt the war. The uneasy relations between North Korea and South Korea last to this day.\n\n1951: Rosenbergs Sentenced\n\n• Date: March 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nHusband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are convicted of espionage for their part in passing along atomic secrets to the Soviet Union during and after World War II. They are executed two years later. Not everyone is convinced of their involvement in the scheme. Supporters claim they are scapegoats swept up in the Cold War hysteria of the time. Documents revealed decades later would show the detailed extent of Julius Rosenberg's involvement in the spy ring, though Ethel's participation in the scheme remains inconclusive.\n\n1952: First Hydrogen Bomb Test\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Marshall Islands\n\nThe United States successfully detonates its first hydrogen bomb, a second generation thermonuclear device, in the Marshall Islands as part of Operation Ivy, one of a series of nuclear bomb tests. From 1946 to 1958, the United States used the remote Pacific Marshall Islands as its nuclear weapons testing site, detonating a total of 67 nuclear tests.\n\n1953: The Dawn of DNA\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: Cambridge, England, U.K.\n\nCambridge University scientists James Watson and Francis Crick announce they have discovered the fundamental behavior and double-helix structure of DNA. Though scientists had been aware of DNA since the 1860s and its role in genetic inheritance since 1943, Watson and Crick were the first to explain how DNA works to replicate itself and pass on genes from one generation to the next.\n\n1954: Brown vs. Board of Education\n\n• Date: May 17\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark case involving Linda Brown of Topeka, Kansas, who had to cross a railroad track to reach an all-black elementary school even though an all-white school was closer, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the segregated school system was unconstitutional on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. The clause would be used again by the courts to reverse state-level racial segregation practices and ordinances.\n\n1955: Parks Starts a Movement\n\n• Date: Dec. 1\n\n• Location: Montgomery, Alabama\n\nRosa Parks makes history by refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus. The arrest of Parks for insisting to remain seated leads to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascent of a young pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., as a local activist leader to advance the civil rights cause. A successful federal lawsuit by the NAACP against the city leads to the desegregation of the Montgomery bus system on Dec. 21 of the following year.\n\n1956: Hungary Suppressed\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Budapest\n\nCold War tensions escalate when Hungarians take to the streets, demanding democratic reforms. Three days later, Red Army troops invade Hungary, killing thousands. Nine days after the incursion, Budapest is occupied by the Soviet troops in one of the largest and most aggressive actions taken by the Soviet Union since the end of World War II.\n\n1957: The Little Rock Nine\n\n• Date: Sept 24\n\n• Location: Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nU.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower orders federal troops to protect nine African American high school students as they start classes at the all-white Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. This would become one of the first high-profile actions by the federal government against state-level racial segregation.\n\n1958: US Launches First Satellite\n\n• Date: Jan. 31\n\n• Location: Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\nThe United States successfully launches Explorer 1, three months after the Soviet Union sent its first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit.

The real estate developer and television personality ran on a platform of putting \"America First\" in global trade and foreign policy negotiations and cracking down on undocumented immigrants.\n\n2017: Hurricane Triple Whammy\n\n• Date: August-September\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWithin just four weeks, three massive hurricanes – Harvey, Irma, and Maria – strike Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean, killing 228 people, inflicting a combined $265 billion in damages, and displacing millions of homeowners. Hurricane Maria inflicts immense damage to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was already struggling from economic insolvency.\n\n2018: Wildfires\n\n• Date: November\n\n• Location: Northern California\n\nWildfires engulfed northern California in November, the deadliest in that state’s history. The catastrophe cost the lives of 88 people and fire consumed 18,500 homes and businesses. State and federal officials estimated that it would cost $3 billion to clean up debris. Climate change activists said the conflagrations were evidence that global warming is no longer a distant concern and that it is occurring now.\n\n2019:Hong Kong Protests\n\n• Date: Beginning in March\n\n• Location: Hong Kong\n\nResidents of the small economic powerhouse of Hong Kong, which was given special administrative region status as a condition to its handover to China from Great Britain, protested a proposed extradition bill in March. That led to other mass demonstrations in Hong Kong throughout the year over concerns China was trying to erode Hong Kong’s autonomy.\n\nPeople power manifested itself in protests in other nations as well in 2019, with demonstrations leading to the ouster of presidents in Algeria and Sudan.\n\n2020: COVID-19\n\n• Date: March\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nA novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes the disease COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The virus spread to Europe and the United States in early 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11. The outbreak reached virtually every nation on Earth, leading to countrywide lockdowns, massive layoffs, business closures, and school shutdowns. As of Aug. 26, the pandemic claimed more than 820,000 lives worldwide, including about 179,000 people in the U.S. COVID-19 has become the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The Bank of England is widely expected to increase rates by half a percentage point, or possibly more.

Under new governor Mark Carney, the bank issued a statement saying that expectation of a rate rise \"was not warranted\".\n\nUNITED KINGDOM: Bank of England keeps stimulus program unchanged\n\nMarkets reacted dramatically to the two banks' statements. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares was up 3 percent, while Germany's DAX stock index was up 2.16%. Both the euro and pound fell on the two banks' actions.\n\nThe goal of the ECB and the Bank of England was to keep bond market interest rates from rising and hurting economic growth through higher borrowing costs. Market rates have crept up since the Fed signaled last month it could begin phasing out its bond-buying program this year.\n\nThe Fed program — known as quantitative easing — had been sending fresh money into financial markets, driving bond prices up and keeping borrowing costs down. Word the Fed might scale back soon sent the process into reverse.\n\nAnalyst Christian Schulz called the ECB guidance a \"mini-revolution\" because the central bank abandoned its longstanding catchphrase that it \"never precommits\" on its policies.\n\n\"This is a weak form of forward guidance. But it is guidance nonetheless,\" Schulz wrote in a note to investors.\n\nAt his news conference following the ECB meeting, Draghi rebuffed attempts by journalists to pin him down about what an extended period meant just saying \"an extended period of time is an extended period of time.\"\n\nHe also did not specify any concrete targets for unemployment or growth, as the U.S. Fed has done. The U.S. central bank has said its rates will remain near zero until U.S. unemployment falls to 6.5%.\n\nStill, Draghi was clearly at pains to show the bank as leaning toward doing more to help stimulate the eurozone. The ECB presidents said the current record low benchmark rate of 0.5% \"is not the lower bound.\" He added that the bank's statements were intended \"to inject a downward bias in interest rates for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThe ECB added that rates would remain low so long as three conditions continued to exist: no threat of inflation, weak economic output, and anemic lending by banks. But no figures were mentioned.\n\nThe eurozone economy has struggled due to the government debt crisis which has forced countries to cut back on spending and raise taxes to try to reduce levels of debt. Economic output shrank 0.2 percent in the first quarter, the sixth quarterly decline in a row.\n\nYet growth is key to getting the eurozone out of its problems. An expanding economy increases government tax revenue as people and businesses earn more. And it reduces the size of debt relative to the size of the economy.\n\nIn theory, a low interest rate could stimulate the economy by reducing borrowing costs on the loans businesses need to expand and create more jobs.\n\nYet the currently low refinancing rate - the rate the ECB charges private sector banks to borrow - is not being passed on by banks. That is because banks themselves often have strained finances and are keeping money back to meet new regulatory requirements aimed at strengthening the financial system.\n\nSo there is skepticism among economists and ECB leaders themselves about how much good another rate cut will do. The bank has already cut interest rates, made cheap three-year loans to banks, and offered to buy the government bonds of indebted countries in the open market if they promise to reform their finances.\n\nMuch attention has focused instead on tools the ECB could use beside rate cuts to try to get the economy going again. Forward guidance was one of those.\n\nThe bank has also said it is looking at ways to promote lending to small companies, working in cooperation with other EU institutions. However the ECB cannot do that alone. Steps to free up more money for banks to lend - by encouraging them to bundle small business loans into securities which could then be sold off - would take months to set up.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/957542/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-4-august-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 4 August 2022 | The Week UK", "text": "Archie parents prepare for ‘the end’\n\nThe parents of Archie Battersbee have vowed to “fight” to get him moved to a hospice, insisting they should be allowed to choose where he takes “his last moments”.

And the Bank of England (BoE) is predicting inflation will reach 11% this autumn.\n\nAs soaring prices for food, fuel and energy worsen the cost-of-living crisis, unions are calling for inflation-matching wage increases. But the government and Bank bosses are warning of the dangers of a wage-price spiral.\n\nWhat is a wage-price spiral?\n\nThe term wage-price spiral refers to the idea that a consistent ratcheting up of workers’ pay to match the cost of living will lead to companies raising consumer prices “to protect their margins”, said the Financial Times.\n\nThe threat of this “repeating, self-fulfilling process” has been cited by Boris Johnson and the government as a key reason to avoid sharp wage rises.\n\n“When a wage-price spiral begins, there is only one cure and that is to slam the brakes on rising prices with higher interest rates,” the prime minister said earlier this month.\n\nBoE governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC in February that while a “moderation of wage rises” would be “painful” for workers, pay curbs were needed to prevent inflation becoming entrenched.\n\nDoes everybody agree?\n\nUnions have questioned claims that increasing wages will lead to economic doom and have warned that workers are bearing the brunt of the inflation hikes.\n\nThe RMT, which is leading this week’s train strikes, is demanding that Network Rail workers get a 7% pay rise, in line with the cost of living.

Unfortunately, there are plenty more bumps in the road for investors in the coming weeks.\n\nSee here: FedEx’s stock is almost 20% lower in premarket trading on Friday after the company withdrew the financial guidance it issued just a few months ago and said it would move to slash costs as demand for packages fell across the globe. The company is seen as a bellwether for the economy since has insight into shipments across a wide range of industries.\n\n1. The US Federal Reserve meets next week. Persistent inflation, fears of recession and slowing economic growth have rattled markets across the globe. Now as major central banks institute aggressive rounds of monetary policy tightening to battle inflation, investors fear that they may go too far.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve will announce its decision on its next round of rate hikes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in the face of a very tight labor market and high inflation, has delivered a hawkish message to investors – indicating that the central bank will likely increase interest rates by another 75 basis points for the third time in a row.\n\nIf the Fed remains aggressive at the expense of economic growth we can expect months of cooling employment figures, especially wage data, and widening credit spreads that make it more expensive for companies to borrow.\n\nThat means higher bond yields, lower stock prices and less of a chance at a soft landing.\n\n2. Earnings season is coming. Another risk for Wall Street is softer corporate earnings in October.\n\nAbout half of all S&P 500 companies mentioned “recession” during second quarter earnings calls, the highest number since 2010. Wall Street estimates for the next quarter are reflecting that gloom.\n\nThird quarter earnings-per-share estimates have slipped more than 5.5% since the end of June, according to FactSet data. That’s the largest drop for a quarter since the second quarter of 2020 (when Covid-19 sent the United States into recession).\n\nCharles Schwab analysts are forecasting weaker earnings growth through 2022 compared to last year.\n\n3. War in Ukraine. Markets have been heartened by Ukraine’s advances, but the outcome of the war is far from certain. That should have investors on guard. Even if the conflict continues to swing in Ukraine’s favor, Europe is unlikely to dodge a energy crisis-induced recession this winter brought on by the invasion.\n\nGlobal commodity flows, including critical supplies of fossil fuels, food, and fertilizer continue to be hampered regardless of which side is winning the fight. A new report by S&P Global Ratings estimates that war-related global energy and food shocks will last through at least 2024. Those shocks will continue to weigh on GDP and fiscal performance.\n\nUS mortgage rates jump to highest level in 14 years\n\nMortgage rates in the US jumped past 6% this week, reaching their highest level since the fall of 2008.\n\nHigh borrowing costs and slim inventory levels continue to weigh on Americans looking for affordable housing, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.\n\nStubbornly high inflation is responsible for pushing rates up, noted Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.\n\nRates had fallen in July and early August as recession fears took hold. But comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and recent economic data have pulled investors’ attention back to the central bank’s fight against inflation, pushing rates higher.\n\nThere is a silver lining for those looking to buy. As mortgage rates rise and home prices remain high, home sales are slowing. Prices could also soon drop.\n\nWith borrowing costs expected to continue rising in the next few months, it is becoming increasingly clear that home prices need to decline to bring balance back to housing markets.\n\n“Many sellers are recognizing the shift in market conditions and are responding by cutting their asking prices,” said George Ratiu, manager of economic research at Realtor.com. “These changes are coinciding with the time of the year when buyers have historically found the best market conditions to find a bargain.”\n\nChina and Russia’s growing economic ties\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, met face-to-face on Thursday for the first time since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine earlier this year. Investors watched the meeting closely looking for clues into the status of their economic relationship.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, Putin acknowledged that Xi had “questions and concerns” about the invasion. Their economic partnership, however, didn’t seem to be at risk, reports my CNN colleague Nectar Gan.\n\nBeijing has boosted bilateral trade to record levels in a boon to Russian business amid Western sanctions. China’s spending on Russian goods soared 60% in August from a year ago. Its shipments to Russia jumped 26% to $8 billion in August, reports my colleague Laura He.\n\nPutin emphasized the two nations’ deepening economic ties at their meeting, noting bilateral trade exceeded $140 billion last year. “I am convinced that by the end of the year we will reach new record levels, and in the near future,” he said.\n\nBeijing has carefully avoided violating Western sanctions or providing direct military support to Moscow, but Chinese companies are taking advantage of the exodus of Western brands from Russia.\n\nChinese smartphones accounted for two-thirds of all new sales in Russia between April and June, Reuters reported. Passenger cars from Chinese manufacturers accounted for almost 26% of Russia’s market in August, the highest on record, according to Russian analytical agency Autostat.\n\nUp next\n\nA first look at the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey for September is released at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nComing next week: It’s a blockbuster week for central banks with the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England due to reveal their latest policy decisions.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote on sellers recognizing the shift in market conditions.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York (CNN Business) The world is in desperate need of water. Drought and increasing temperatures have threatened to impact nearly every major sector of the economy, from energy to agriculture to shipping.\n\nMarkets are taking note. The S&P Global Water Index, which tracks 50 companies from around the world that are involved in water utilities, infrastructure, equipment and materials, has outperformed the S&P Global Broad Market Index by more than 3 percentage points per year since its beginning in late 2001. So far this year, the Global Water Index return has been nearly 5 percentage points higher than the S&P Global BMI.\n\nEurope is suffering the worst drought it has seen in at least 500 years after sweltering temperatures led to thousands of deaths across Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal . European rivers hit record low water levels, interfering with crop and power production as well as shipping. The Rhine fell so low that shipping had to be severely reduced, causing supply issues in Switzerland and Germany . Yields of major crops are expected to fall by at least 10% to 20% due to water restrictions\n\nIt's not the only region of the world struggling with water shortages. A drought that has been enveloping the southwestern United States since 2000 marks the driest 22-year period of the past 1,200 years, a UCLA-led study found . The American Farm Bureau Federation suggests that yields could be down by as much as a third this year compared with last year because of drought and extreme heat.\n\nClimate change could make these extreme droughts a common occurrence. A report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year found droughts in drying regions that previously occurred only once every 10 years are now happening about 1.7 times per decade, on average. If the Earth warms by another 2 degrees Celsius, the once rare occurrences will happen about 2.5 times per decade.\n\nWhat it means for markets: Stress on public budgets will make it difficult for governments around the world to solve water-access and drought issues on their own. Publicly-traded companies are increasingly likely to be part of the solution, and analysts predict opportunity for upside.\n\n\"As these demands for clean water increase, companies involved in water-related business activities stand to grow in the coming years,\" wrote Tianyin Cheng, a senior director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nRecent reports from the World Economic Forum estimate the global water industry at $483 billion, as of mid-2022. Investors want in: There were 23 water funds launched over the last five years, with a collective $8 billion in assets, according to Morningstar data.\n\nAmerican Water Works Company AWK Xylem XYL through 2025. Common holdings in these funds include utilities like, Georg Fischer AG, a Swiss firm that works on the safe transportation of water, and water technology companies like, which forecasts revenue growth around 5% annuallythrough 2025.\n\nConsolidated Water CWCO , which recycles waste water into potable water, is also being watched by analysts. Its shares are up 52% this year while the broader S&P 500 is down nearly 19% over the same period.\n\nA rising tide: On the other side of the equation lie companies that sap water resources and don't address drought as a critical problem to their business operations. A recent analysis from environmental disclosure platform CDP and Planet Tracker, a non-profit think tank, showed listed companies could face losses of at least $225 billion from risks related to water.\n\nt he fund will pressure companies to pay more attention to their impact on water quality and availability. Participants, they say, will consider additional steps of \"escalation\" like voting against directors at companies who won't make necessary changes. Also in August, sustainability investor group Ceres announced the creation of the Valuing Water Finance Initiative , with 64 US and international investors representing a total of $9.8 trillion in assets under management. Investors include pension funds and asset managers such as Franklin Resources. Ceres sayshe fund will pressure companies to pay more attention to their impact on water quality and availability. Participants, they say, will consider additional steps of \"escalation\" like voting against directors at companies who won't make necessary changes.\n\nWall Street's big month\n\nAfter a mercifully quiet summer, the stock market is going to have a lot to react to this month. Between consequential central bank decisions around the globe (and at least eight US Fed officials speaking this week alone), Big Bank CEOs testifying before Congress and some changes coming to the crypto market, investors will have a lot to digest and contend with. That's not to mention the host of economic data that will let us know more about whether inflation is still biting, the labor market is still booming and consumers are still shopping.\n\nHistorically speaking, this isn't a great month for markets. But September is a month of clarity. The crisp air snaps away the last of August's haze and allows us to see what's ahead. Here's what we'll be watching over the next few weeks.\n\nBig week for central banks\n\nThe US Federal Reserve is arguably one of the most influential forces on markets right now as officials consider further interest rate hikes later this month to fight inflation. Investors will be watching closely for any clues to what it might do. Central bank decisions on hikes are expected across the globe, which are expected to have impacts on both European and US markets.\n\n-- Sept. 7: It's a central bank bonanza as Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester, Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard and Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr all give their economic outlooks. On top of that, the Fed will release its Beige Book, which describes the state of consumer spending, sentiment and housing demands in the 12 Federal Reserve districts.\n\nBeyond the US, the Bank of Canada also publishes its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate.\n\n-- Sept. 8: The Fed fete continues as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks from the Cato Institute at 9:10 am, ET. The last time Powell spoke, from Jackson Hole, he said the economy should expect some pain on the horizon, which sent markets reeling.\n\nThe European Central Bank will also release its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate, which will be closely watched by investors globally.\n\n--Sept. 9: This week of Fed festivities wraps with speeches from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Governor Christopher Waller.\n\nAn onslaught of data\n\nKey economic data mapping the trajectory of US inflation comes out the following week. This is the last drop of data before the Fed meets to decide where interest rates go, and investors will be looking closely for signs that inflation could be easing.\n\n--Sept. 13: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for August is released. This measures the change in the prices of goods and services, and the Fed pays very close attention to this figure.\n\n--Sept. 14: Producer Price Index (PPI) for August is released. This is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. It measures a change in input prices of raw, semi-finished or finished goods and services.\n\n--Sept. 15: The Bank of England publishes its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate. In the US, retail sales for August will also be released. These are an important indicator of consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of economic activity.\n\nAll eyes on DC\n\nThe penultimate week of September is perhaps the most newsworthy. Investors have been waiting since July to see the Fed's next move, and this week they finally meet and announce the extent to which they'll raise rates. Wall Street CEOs will also flock to the Hill to talk banking policy, and could give an update on where they predict the economy is headed in.\n\n--Sept. 20- 21: Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members will meet and vote on where to set the target interest rate. Traders will watch the decision closely as well as the press conference following the decision with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Any surprises could send US markets tumbling.\n\n-- Sept. 21-22: Bank of America's Brian Moynihan, Wells Fargo's Charlie Scharf, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, Citi's Jane Fraser, PNC's Bill Demchak, US Bank's Andrew Cecere and Truist's Bill Roger all testify for their annual report to Senate and Congress. Investors will listen for any predictions on where the economy is going and for any mentions of that dreaded 'R' word: Recession.\n\nPass the chips\n\nHere's another development in the longstanding US-China rivalry.\n\nThe Biden administration released plans for its $50 billion investment in the US semiconductor industry on Tuesday. Aimed at shaping an important industry and countering China, the Department of Commerce announced how it would allocate its CHIPS for America Fund, part of an act signed into law in July.\n\nAccording to the White House, about $28 billion of the fund will go toward grants and loans to help build facilities for advanced and cutting edge chip-making. Another $10 billion will go to expanding manufacturing for older generations of technology used in cars and communications tech like smart phones. The last $11 billion will go to research and development initiatives related to chipmaking.\n\nThe Department of Commerce will start accepting applications for the funding from companies by February and could begin distributing money by next spring.\n\nThe United States was once a leader in semiconductor chip manufacturing but has lost ground to other countries like China. Now, many American manufacturers import the chips that are essential to the production of cars, smartphones and medical equipment.\n\nAs my colleague Rishi Iyengar has reported , Taiwan complicates matters further. The self-governed island off China's coast has become a diplomatic and military flashpoint between Washington and Beijing. Taiwan is critical to the global semiconductor industry, with several of the world's top manufacturers headquartered there.\n\nThe new funding is intended to help companies bring chip manufacturing back to the US and, as a result, help lower costs and prevent supply chain disruptions, reports my colleague Katie Lobosco . The current global chip shortage has limited production of new vehicles, for example, leaving Americans facing high car prices.\n\nUp next\n\nEarnings from GameStop.\n\nApple unveils new products at 1 p.m. ET and the Federal Reserve releases its US Beige Book.\n\nComing Thursday: Fed chair Jerome Powell speaks at Cato Institute; US weekly jobless claims; ECB rate decision; Japan GDP.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/investing/george-soros-china-real-estate/index.html", "title": "George Soros warns China is facing an economic crisis | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nChina is facing an economic crisis after a real estate boom ended with a bang last year, according to investor George Soros.\n\nThe billionaire said in a speech at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution Monday that President Xi Jinping may not be able to restore confidence in the troubled industry, which has been hit by a series of defaults by developers and falling prices for land and apartments.\n\nChina’s real estate boom was based on an “unsustainable” model that benefited local governments and encouraged people to invest the bulk of their savings in property, Soros said.\n\nGovernment policies designed to curb the boom made it difficult for indebted real estate behemoth Evergrande to pay its debts, he added.\n\nThe developer is reeling under more than $300 billion of total liabilities, including about $19 billion in offshore bonds held by international asset managers and private banks on behalf of their clients.

On Sunday, the company said that receivers had been appointed over a plot of land in Hong Kong, which it pledged as collateral against a $520 million loan last year.\n\n“It remains to be seen how the authorities will handle the crisis,” Soros said, during a panel discussion about developments in China and how the United States should respond. “They may have postponed dealing with it for too long, because people’s confidence has now been shaken.”\n\nGeorge Soros looks on after delivering a speech on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on January 23, 2020.

The legendary investor and chair of the Open Society Foundations said in September that asset manager BlackRock was making a “tragic mistake” by doing more business in China. He has criticized Beijing over its surveillance policies and a crackdown on private business.\n\nThe Chinese president now faces risks from the property market, according to Soros, who was speaking just days before the start of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nFalling prices will “turn many of those who invested the bulk of their savings in real estate against Xi Jinping,” Soros said, adding that the current situation “doesn’t look promising.”\n\n“Xi Jinping has many tools available to reestablish confidence — the question is whether he will use them properly,” said Soros.\n\nAn aerial view shows the Evergrande Changqing community on September 26, 2021 in Wuhan, China.

According to the ARK Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 33% of people, in 2019, considered themselves Unionists, 23% identified as nationalists, while 39% regarded themselves as neither.\n\n“Surveys will show you that there is a developing sense of a Northern Irish national identity, but there is no song that encapsulates that or can be seen to encapsulate [it],” Paul Rouse – who wrote Sport and Ireland: A History – tells CNN Sport.\n\nNorthern Ireland's captain Marissa Callaghan challenges Marina Georgieva of Austria during Euro 2022. Graham Hunt/DPPI/Reuters\n\nNorthern Ireland has several national anthems in use across different sports, as well as different configurations of its teams – a relic of how each sport navigated this divide.\n\nEach of these songs occupies a slightly different position in Northern Ireland’s political landscape.\n\nIn rugby, where the team plays as a united Ireland, the Republic of Ireland’s national anthem “Amhrán na bhFiann” (“The Soldier’s Song”) plays at home matches, alongside the specifically commissioned, more inclusive “Ireland’s Call,” which plays at both home and away matches.\n\nAt the Commonwealth Games, the Northern Irish anthem is “Londonderry Air,” while for football, the anthem “God Save the Queen” – with its associations to the British Royal Family – is tied up with the unionist tradition.\n\n“You know, it’s quite sad. Northern Ireland don’t really have their own identity,” Northern Ireland’s captain Marissa Callaghan said in a documentary last year.\n\n“As a Catholic player, unfortunately, I don’t get that experience of standing tall and singing the anthem as loud as you can.\n\n“But it doesn’t take away the pride and the passion and what it means to put on the green shirt. It will take someone to think outside the box, won’t it? And be brave enough to move it forward.”\n\n‘What would happen to international sport in Ireland?’\n\nHistorically, each major sport has found a slightly different place within the Northern Irish landscape.\n\n“The creation of the modern sporting world happened in the 19th century … And when that was happening, Ireland was not partitioned,” says Rouse.\n\nWhen Northern Ireland was officially created on May 3, 1921, following the Irish War of Independence, teams in athletics, rugby and football represented the entire island.\n\n“The question immediately rose up what would happen to international sport in Ireland,” Rouse says. “And it varies from sport to sport.”\n\nThe Irish Football Association (IFA) was, and still is, based in Belfast – the game’s historic heartland where it first entered Ireland.\n\nThe history of Northern Ireland's football team is complex. Dan Mullan/Getty Images\n\nUnlike rugby, whose governing body was based in Dublin and structures allowed for more regional autonomy, football split into two with the establishment of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in Dublin in 1921.\n\nThe IFA and the FAI initially both fielded international teams called Ireland, selecting players from north and south of the border, until the 1950s when the demands of World Cup qualifying competitions forced the teams to become entirely separate.\n\nDuring ‘The Troubles,’ tensions flared, such as when riots marred a European Cup match between the border town of Dundalk and Linfield, a club closely associated with Unionism, in 1979.\n\nBut the success of the Northern Ireland squad at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, featuring players from both communities, showed how football could, at times, transcend the political divisions.\n\n“We tend to focus on the divide, it wasn’t just a divide, it was also a game which bound them together,” says Rouse.\n\nThese efforts to unite football have intensified following the peace process.\n\nIn 2006, the Amalgamation of Northern Ireland Supporters’ Clubs was awarded the Brussels International Supporters’ Award for supporting charities and its efforts to tackle sectarianism.\n\nEuro 2022\n\nThe Northern Ireland Women’s Football Association (NIWFA) is a much newer entity, formed in 1976, and since then, women’s football in the country has grown exponentially.\n\nA record crowd of 15,348 packed into Windsor Park to watch the side’s World Cup qualifying match against England, while approximately 1,200 players are now competing across six competitive divisions, according to its website.\n\nIts increasing popularity aligns with the trends in women’s football across Europe. Euro 2022 has already set attendance records – around 450,000 tickets were sold before the tournament – while more than 91,000 fans twice piled into the Camp Nou to watch Barcelona Femení earlier this year.\n\nAn official song – “Girl Got Game” by Jessica Hammond – has also been released to support the team and highlight women’s football.\n\nJulie Nelson scored Northern Ireland's first ever goal during the UEFA Women's Euro 2022. Harriet Lander/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nTapping into this, the Northern Ireland women’s team are hoping to emulate the ‘spirit of 2016’ that permeated the country when the men’s team qualified for Euro 2016.\n\n“[We] saw the positive impact that had,” Callaghan told Belfast Live.\n\nIt is the first time that the Northern Ireland women’s team has qualified for a major tournament, despite several long-term injuries to its key players.\n\nQualifying represented an impressive achievement for the team ranked 47th in the world, with many members of the squad balancing full-time work and football.\n\nNo matter what the result of Friday’s match, Northern Ireland will not reach the knockout stages following losses to Norway and Austria in its opening two matches, but the journey has the players feeling optimistic about the future.\n\n“Northern Ireland is an amazing place, and we have some amazing people,” Callaghan told Belfast Live. “Sport, including football, has always managed to bring people together.”", "authors": ["Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/politics/dark-money-donation-conservative-group-invs/index.html", "title": "Massive dark money donation: New conservative group got $1.6 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new group led by a prominent conservative lawyer has received $1.6 billion from one donor – the largest single contribution to a politically focused nonprofit that’s ever been made public, and a fortune that could be used to fuel right-wing interests.\n\nThe nonprofit, Marble Freedom Trust, received the contribution in the form of stock and then funneled more than $200 million to other conservative organizations last year, a tax form CNN obtained from the IRS shows.\n\nMarble Freedom is led by Leonard Leo, the co-chairman of the conservative Federalist Society, who advised former President Donald Trump on his Supreme Court picks and runs a sprawling network of other right-wing nonprofits that don’t disclose their donors, which are often referred to as dark money groups.\n\nA CNN review of financial documents connected the donation to Barre Seid, a low-profile, 90-year-old Chicago electronics company executive and philanthropist who has previously been tied to smaller anonymous contributions to other right-wing groups. The New York Times, which first reported the contribution on Monday, also identified Seid as the donor.\n\nThe massive donation instantly makes the Utah-based group one of the most well-funded organizations bankrolling conservative causes in the US – a staggering distinction for a group with zero public profile or even a website. In comparison, the single contribution is more than double the total amount raised by Trump’s presidential campaign committee during the entire 2020 election cycle.\n\nRobert Maguire, the research director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, called the donation “stupefying,” and “by far” the largest known contribution to a dark money political group.\n\n“I’ve never seen a group of this magnitude before,” Maguire said. “This is the kind of money that can help these political operatives and their allies start to move the needle on issues like reshaping the federal judiciary, making it more difficult to vote, a state-by-state campaign to remake election laws and lay the groundwork for undermining future elections.”\n\nLeo said in a statement that “it’s high time for the conservative movement to be among the ranks of George Soros, Hansjörg Wyss, Arabella Advisors and other left-wing philanthropists, going toe-to-toe in the fight to defend our Constitution and its ideals” – referring to two liberal-leaning billionaires and a consulting firm that manages several smaller dark money groups on the left.\n\nSeid did not respond to requests for comment left on phone numbers listed for him and his longtime assistant.\n\nHuge anonymous donation has ties to Chicago executive\n\n“Dark money” generally refers to nonprofits that get involved in politics but do not disclose their donors, a practice that significantly ramped up after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010. Many dark money groups, like Marble Freedom, are 501(c)4 organizations – nonprofits that are allowed to participate in politics as long as it is not their primary activity.\n\nGroups on both sides of the political spectrum have increasingly turned to dark money in recent years to sway voters or push agendas without revealing their ultra-wealthy benefactors – but the Marble Freedom donation dramatically eclipses even the largest of the previously known groups.\n\nMarble Freedom’s tax return covers its initial year of existence between May 2020 and April 2021. The gift of just over $1.6 billion came in the form of 100% of the stock of a privately held company, which Marble Freedom then sold to another company, according to the tax form.\n\nThe arrangement likely saved Seid a large amount of money in taxes, according to Marcus Owens, an attorney and former director of the IRS division on tax-exempt organizations, who reviewed the form for CNN. If Seid had personally sold the stock in the company, he would likely have had to pay capital gains tax on the proceeds of the sale. By donating the stock to Marble Freedom, he avoided having to pay that tax, and the nonprofit would be exempt from paying it.\n\nMarble Freedom wrote that it was withholding information about which company was donated and who it sold to because “disclosing it would effectively disclose the identity of its donors.”\n\nBut details about the donation connect it to the sale of the Chicago-based electrical device firm Tripp Lite, whose longtime chairman was Seid.\n\nAfter receiving the donated stock, Marble Freedom sold the company on March 17, 2021, according to the tax form. The same day, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents, the American-Irish power company Eaton acquired Tripp Lite for $1.65 billion.\n\nDuring the sale, “the sole shareholder of Tripp Lite” was represented by New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, Law360 reported at the time. Less than two weeks later, Marble Freedom paid Sullivan & Cromwell $940,000 in legal fees, the tax form shows. A spokesperson for Eaton said the company would not provide more details about the acquisition, and several lawyers involved in the transaction did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeid served as chairman and CEO and listed himself as the “owner” of Tripp Lite in federal campaign donation records from 2008. He worked at the company, which produces power strips, surge protectors and other devices, for more than 50 years, according to a Facebook post from Tripp Lite. He grew up in Chicago, the son of immigrants from Russia, according to Census records, and graduated from the University of Chicago.\n\nSeid has previously had a history of donating anonymously to conservative political groups and causes. An internal 2015 document from the Bradley Foundation, a right-wing nonprofit, stated that the conservative think tank Foundation for Government Accountability had received support from “Barre Seid (anonymously).” The document was part of a trove of records from Bradley that was hacked and released, and was later included as an exhibit in Senate testimony.\n\nIn addition, Salon reported in 2010 that “Barry Seid” was listed in tax documents as the identity of an anonymous donor who gave nearly $17 million to a group that produced an anti-Islam documentary and sent DVDs of the movie to millions of households during the 2008 election. An assistant for Seid told Salon that he did not contribute to the organization, although she didn’t address whether he made the donation by routing it through another group.\n\nAnd publicly released emails suggest that Seid may also be the anonymous donor who pledged $20 million over five years to George Mason University’s law school in order to rename it for former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. The emails were obtained through a public records request and published by George Mason Law alum Allison Pienta in 2019. The school has refused to identify the donor but has said that Leo coordinated the gift.\n\nSeid and his wife make public donations through another nonprofit, the Barbara and Barre Seid Foundation, which mostly funds Chicago-based cultural organizations and universities but has given to conservative and libertarian groups such as the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute. Seid also donated to various political campaigns in Illinois and elsewhere in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nBig spending and opaque groups\n\nEven in its infancy, Marble Freedom Trust has already funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to other dark money groups.\n\nLeo, Marble Freedom’s chairman and trustee, is one of the most influential figures in the world of conservative dark money. A longtime executive at the Federalist Society, a national network of right-leaning lawyers, Leo has led or served on the board of more than a dozen different nonprofits. Several of his groups have been associated with political campaigns promoting conservative Supreme Court nominees, operating in complex networks of spending.\n\nThe new $1.6 billion donation “solidifies Leo as just an absolute gravitational force within the conservative political and legal world,” Maguire said. “He was already the man behind the scenes raising money for reshaping the American judiciary, and this amount of money just takes it to a stratospheric level.”\n\nOn the Marble Freedom tax form, Leo is listed as being paid a $350,000 annual salary for 25 hours a week of work for the group.\n\nThe form states that the group’s mission is to “maintain and expand human freedom consistent with the values and ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.” While politics can’t be its primary focus, it can use at least some of its huge resources to influence this year’s midterms or future elections.\n\n“This is such a significant amount that it would be a game-changer if they do decide to devote even a portion of that to election-related spending,” said Anna Massoglia, the Editorial and Investigations Manager at OpenSecrets, a group that researches campaign finance.\n\nMarble Freedom reported making four donations to other nonprofits – transactions that appear to have taken place between the sale of the stock in mid-March 2021 and the end of April 2021.\n\nThe largest contribution was a $153 million gift to the Rule of Law Trust, a dark money nonprofit led by Leo that has funded other conservative organizations. The group’s tax returns show it received just under $80 million in donations in 2018 and no contributions in 2019 or 2020, so the gift from Marble Freedom represents a massive funding boost for the organization.\n\nMarble Freedom contributed $41.1 million to Donors Trust, a nonprofit that distributes money to conservative and libertarian groups in addition to nonpolitical organizations. The group is a donor-advised fund, which means its contributors can recommend where their donations to the fund are sent.\n\nIn the past, Donors Trust has funneled millions of dollars to groups that have amplified false claims about election fraud and advocated for more restrictive voting rules. The group has previously said that its donations are intended to “serve the public good.”\n\nMarble Freedom also donated $16.5 million to The Concord Fund, a nonprofit that has advocated for conservative nominees to the Supreme Court and other judgeships and is associated with a group that has pushed restrictive voting laws. Concord, which was previously known as the Judicial Crisis Network, raised $20.4 million from July 2019 to June 2020, according to its most recent tax return.\n\nIn addition to the three groups with political connections, Marble Freedom gave $18 million to Schwab Charitable Fund, another donor-advised fund.\n\nMarble Freedom lists two other board members in addition to Leo, both of whom are unpaid. One is Tyler Green, the former solicitor general of Utah, who has represented the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups in multiple voting-related lawsuits in recent years. Green, who is listed as Marble Freedom’s administrative trustee, is also a former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The trust’s address is listed as a home in North Salt Lake, Utah, that Green owns.\n\nThe board’s third member is Jonathan Bunch, a former Federalist Society vice president who has been involved with various groups led by Leo. Bunch is listed as Marble Freedom’s successor trustee. Green and Bunch did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the end of April 2021, Marble Freedom had more than $1.4 billion in assets – positioning it to play a major role in conservative causes potentially for years to come.\n\n“This group is emblematic of the corrosion and the breakdown of our campaign finance system,” Maguire said – and how it gives “wealthy donors, whether they be corporations or individuals, access and influence over the system far greater than any regular American can ever imagine.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Curt Devine Drew Griffin", "Casey Tolan", "Curt Devine", "Drew Griffin"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/953535/will-we-need-to-start-paying-for-lateral-flow-tests", "title": "Will we have to pay for lateral flow tests? | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said.

He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

Here are 14 interesting facts about the holiday's history and how the U.S. celebrates its Celtic roots.\n\n1. THE SHAMROCK\n\nSt. Patrick used the three-leafed shamrock to explain the Trinity. The first is for hope, the second for faith and the third for love.\n\n2. IRISH FLAG\n\nGreen stands for Catholics, orange for Protestants and white for wish of harmony.\n\n3. CORNED BEEF & CABBAGE\n\nA staple at St. Patrick's Day celebrations. In 2014, there were 40.3 billion pounds of United States beef and 2.2 billion pounds of cabbage production in the U.S.\n\n4. ST. PATRICK\n\nHe was born in Britain (then part of the Roman Empire), not Ireland.\n\n5. PINCHING\n\nThe tradition in America is to pinch anyone who isn't wearing green on St. Patrick's Day. Legend has it that wearing green makes you invisible to leprechauns, who pinch anyone they see.\n\n6. WHAT'S WITH THE GREEN ANYWAYS\n\nBlue was the color originally associated with St. Patrick. Green became associated with Ireland because of the Emerald Isles and wearing of the shamrock on men's lapels.\n\n7. PADDY NOT PATTY\n\nThe Irish nickname for Patrick is \"Paddy\" not \"Patty.\" So it's never St. Patty's Day.\n\n8. THE CHASE\n\nSt. Patrick never chased any snakes out of Ireland. The legend is St. Patrick chased away pagan beliefs to introduce the country to Christianity.\n\n9. CHICAGO RIVER\n\nSince 1962, Chicago has dyed the Chicago River on St. Patrick's Day. Then-Mayor Richard J. Daley and boyhood friend Stephen M. Bailey started the tradition.\n\n10. PARADES\n\nThe world’s first St. Patrick’s Day parade occurred on March 17, 1762, in New York City, featuring Irish soldiers serving in the English military. This parade became an annual event, with President Truman attending in 1948.\n\nTRY THIS: Popular juice bar says so long Bossier, hello Highland\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n33.1 MILLION\n\nThe number of U.S. residents who claimed Irish ancestry in 2014.\n\n40 LBS.\n\nAmount of dye it takes to dye the Chicago River green for the day.\n\n125,022\n\nNumber of U.S. residents born in Ireland.\n\n$62,141\n\nMedian income for households headed by an Irish-American.\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, KRT, History.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/11/crystal-cathedral-reborn-catholic-wiki-editathon-conjuring-house-news-around-states/39673771/", "title": "Crystal Cathedral reborn Catholic, 'Conjuring' house, Wiki 'editathon ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Auburn University has a new dual-degree program for students interested in both engineering and the German language, a boon especially to those hoping to work with foreign automakers in the state. A statement from the school says the new program has students taking four years of classes in Auburn and one year in Germany, where they’ll study at a partner school and work in an internship. The degree could help students wanting to work in fields including automotive manufacturing – the German automaker Mercedes-Benz has a plant that employs thousands in Tuscaloosa County. In all, almost 90 German companies have operations in Alabama. The university says the new program is a joint effort between the colleges of engineering and liberal arts. Most Auburn students minoring in German are engineering majors.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A mining company wants to begin exploratory drilling for the rare element vanadium in southeast Alaska. CoastAlaska reports that Northern Cobalt Ltd., an Australian firm, has applied to the U.S. Forest Service for the proposed project on Snettisham Inlet. The site is located in the Tongass National Forest, about 35 miles southeast of Juneau. Vanadium is used in steel alloys, as well as rechargeable industrial batteries. There are no active federal mining claims at the site. Exploratory drilling for iron ore was conducted at the location in 2012, but those claims were abandoned amid a collapse in iron prices. In a promotional video, the company’s managing director, Michael Schwarz, notes the site’s proximity to a power station. The Forest Service is reviewing the company’s application and accepting public comments through July 26.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A new report from Smart Growth America has ranked the state’s 7th Congressional District – which encompasses much of central and west Phoenix, as well as Glendale – the most dangerous place to walk in America. From 2008 to 2017, 344 pedestrians were killed in the 7th District alone – 4.48 for every 100,000 citizens, and the highest of any U.S. congressional district, according to the report. An Arizona Republic investigation published earlier this year found that 10 out of 12 “hot spots” where pedestrian crashes occur frequently are in the 7th Congressional District. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who represents the district, joined with colleagues to introduce a street safety bill titled the “Complete Streets Act of 2019” on Wednesday in the House and Senate.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The University of Arkansas Board of Trustees has approved a 3.1% salary increase for the chancellor at the system’s flagship campus. The raise for Joe Steinmetz, approved Tuesday, brings his annual total compensation to $714,000. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, that amount includes an annual salary of $464,000 and annual deferred compensation of $250,000 for Steinmetz. The board of trustees also approved pay increases for other employees Tuesday during a teleconference meeting, including 10% increases for the deans of UA’s Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design and the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences. Also Tuesday, the board approved a 2.1% pay increase for UA Chancellor Emeritus G. David Gearhart, bringing his annual salary to just under $290,000.\n\nCalifornia\n\nGarden Grove: An iconic, glass-paned church in Orange County that once housed a booming televangelist ministry has been transformed into a cathedral to give the region’s Catholics a long-awaited and much larger place to congregate and pray. The landmark building, with a facade made up of nearly 11,000 glass panes, was long known as the Rev. Robert H. Schuller’s Crystal Cathedral. It appears unchanged from the outside. But the cavernous house of worship is covered on the inside with quatrefoil window shades that send sunlight cascading across a stone altar, wooden pews and steel crucifix befitting a Catholic cathedral. The new Christ Cathedral will be dedicated next Wednesday after a $77 million makeover. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange bought the building after Schuller’s church went bankrupt in 2010.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State wildlife officials have released thousands of cutthroat trout into the wild in an effort to preserve the fish. The Denver Post reports Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials released an estimated 4,500 fingerlings that were transported to Cottonwood Creek near Westcliffe on July 1. Officials say the rare subspecies of fish are descendants of 158 cutthroat trout rescued from a wildfire that burned more than 25 square miles in the Sangre de Cristo Range in southern Colorado. Officials say ash from the fire three summers ago made water in Hayden Creek uninhabitable, and the surviving fish were taken to a hatchery near Crested Butte to spawn. The transport to Cottonwood Creek was conducted by Colorado wildlife and U.S. Forest Service staff and volunteers from Trout Unlimited.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A research scientist who worked at NASA and a chronic disease epidemiologist are just two of Yale University’s renowned female graduates, professors and staff who have gone unmentioned on the pages of Wikipedia. Dozens of Yale students and staff gathered Tuesday at the Yale School of Management to learn how to give those and many other Yale women their due on the predominantly male, English version of the crowd-sourced, online encyclopedia. Organizers of Tuesday’s “editathon” said they also hope to encourage more women to edit articles on the popular online encyclopedia, which relies on user-generated information. Professor Julia Adams, a historical sociologist, has written about female academics who were not included in academic papers and says that makes it difficult to refer to them on Wikipedia, which requires cited articles and journals for biographies.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Activist Sarah McBride is running for the state Senate in 2020. The 28-year-old Wilmington native announced Tuesday that she will try to replace Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington North, who is retiring at the end of his term. McBride rose to national prominence in 2016 when she became the first openly transgender person to speak at the Democratic National Convention. Long involved in politics, she is the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ civil rights advocacy group in the U.S. She plans to stay in that position part time during her campaign but would leave to be a full-time legislator if she wins, she said. McBride first made headlines in 2012, when she came out publicly as transgender at the end of her term as American University student body president.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: It wasn’t a one-time deal. President Donald Trump says he’s planning a repeat of last week’s “Salute to America” Fourth of July festivities that included a speech by him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Trump says that it was “a wonderful day for all Americans” and that, “based on its tremendous successes,” his administration has “made the decision to do it again next year and maybe we can say for the foreseeable future.” Trump’s decision to speak at the event drew protesters who objected to the inclusion of military equipment and what they saw as his co-opting of the holiday. Trump is calling the event “remarkable” and praising the “incredible, big, beautiful crowds” it drew despite the rain. “We celebrated freedom in all of its magnificence,” he says.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Non-native iguanas are multiplying so rapidly that a state wildlife agency is encouraging people to kill them. A Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission news release says people should exterminate the large green lizards on their properties as well as on 22 public land areas across South Florida. It doesn’t say just how civilians should try to kill them. “Homeowners do not need a permit to kill iguanas on their own property, and the FWC encourages homeowners to kill green iguanas on their own property whenever possible,” the agency says. Iguanas aren’t dangerous or aggressive to humans, but they damage seawalls, sidewalks and landscape foliage and can dig lengthy tunnels. The males can grow to at least 5 feet long and weigh nearly 20 pounds. The commission says female iguanas can lay nearly 80 eggs a year, and South Florida’s warm climate is perfect for the prehistoric-looking animals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayor has signed legislation banning smoking and vaping in enclosed areas such as bars, restaurants and one of the world’s busiest airports. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the legislation signed by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms will go into effect Jan. 2. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has been one of the few major U.S. hubs where people could still smoke inside designated rooms. Airport spokesman Andrew Gobeil has said the smoking rooms will be repurposed. Smokers will instead be allowed to smoke in an outdoor terminal smoking area before heading through security. The ban excludes private residences and establishments that ban minors and generate at least 20% of their income from tobacco product sales.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Tuesday he’d veto a bill that would require websites like Airbnb to collect and pay taxes on behalf of short-term vacation rental hosts, saying he wanted the state to coordinate with counties like Honolulu that have new regulations. Ige said he’s concerned the bill, if enacted, would legitimize illegal vacation rental operations. This is an issue across the state, where property owners have been renting homes in residential areas to tourists on a short-term basis without permits. The popularity of the practice has surged with the emergence of websites like Airbnb and HomeAway.com. On Oahu, home to Honolulu and the state’s most populated island, only about 800 vacation rental and bed-and-breakfast operators have permits to rent to tenants for less than 30 days, but there are an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 vacation rentals.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Department of Labor is eliminating more than half of its job service offices. The Idaho Press reports 14 of the 25 offices in the state will close by September. Department director Jani Revier says the new model will directly serve more people. Labor manager Dave Darrow says the new approach will allow the agency to serve people where there is the most need. Under the plan, there would be six primary regional offices and five affiliate offices providing services for job-seekers and employers across the state. Former state Sen. Shawn Keough says the new model will be a hardship on rural towns. Moscow was the first to close its office last week.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Police investigators have cracked the case: A 4- to 5-foot alligator is living in a lagoon at one of the city’s most popular parks. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says investigators went to Humboldt Park Lagoon on the city’s West Side and confirmed the unusual resident is there, as reported on social media. Officials couldn’t say how the creature got there. City officials say alligator traps are being placed around the lagoon in hopes the animal will swim into one and be safely removed. Guglielmi says the animal was expected to be trapped “and relocated to a zoo for veterinary evaluation.” Alligators favor warm-weather climates such as Florida but have been known to survive temporarily in the cold through a process similar to hibernation.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Agricultural officials say this year’s corn crop in the state is expected to be among the lowest quality in three decades following planting delays caused by excessive spring rainfall. Greg Matli, a statistician with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, tells The Herald-Times that the agency expects Indiana’s 2019 corn to be the fifth-lowest in quality since 1986. Monday’s report from the agency rates just 38% of Indiana’s corn crop as currently of good to excellent quality. That comes after heavy spring rains significantly delayed the planting of corn and soybeans, likely lowering crop yields. Sadie Davis, Purdue Extension office director in Greene County, calls this spring’s wet field conditions “astounding” and something Hoosier farmers haven’t seen in a long time.\n\nIowa\n\nOrange City: A magistrate has refused to dismiss a criminal mischief charge against a religious activist accused of burning four LGBTQ children’s books that he checked out of a library. Prosecutors say 63-year-old Paul Dorr posted a video on Facebook in October in which he denounced the Orange City library for having the books and threw them into a burning barrel. He argued in his motion for dismissal that he was singled out for prosecution because of the message he was sending. Sioux County District Court records show that Magistrate Lisa Mazurek said in her ruling issued Monday that Dorr didn’t prove his assertions and that the only message being sent to him is “that he cannot burn books that do not belong to him.” His trial is set for Aug. 6.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The city has opened a 91-acre wetland park in an area where thousands of migratory birds stop each year. The Wichita Eagle reports that visitors to the Pracht Wetlands Park can walk over galvanized-steel boardwalks and watch birds behind two observation points that are similar to duck blinds. Eventually there will be a half-mile loop of boardwalk circling the northern half of the park with multiple observation points and an observation tower. The total budget for the project is about $7.5 million. The City Council representative for the area, Bryan Frye, says that just under $2 million has been invested in it so far. Just to the west of the park, a major new retail-and-restaurant development is in the works. Frye described the project as “an eco-tourism opportunity.”\n\nKentucky\n\nBurgin: Officials have announced a new aftercare program meant to help prison inmates in addiction recovery avoid relapse. Kentucky Justice Secretary John Tilley says the program will provide a new system of support, mentoring and peer accountability for those offenders. Participants will live together in a dormitory located at Northpoint Training Center, a medium-custody prison in central Kentucky. State officials say SOAR, or Supporting Others in Active Recovery, focuses on preventing drug relapses and providing education and skills to rejoin a community upon release. It’s funded in part by a $300,000 grant from the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy. It is currently available for up to 88 inmates who have completed a substance abuse program and other requirements.\n\nLouisiana\n\nColumbia: Some 14 alligator snapping turtles reared at a fish hatchery are now swimming about in the wild. The release at Boeuf Wildlife Management Area in Caldwell Parish was part of a head-start program to replenish the species, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries says. The federal government is scheduled to decide next year whether to declare the turtles endangered or threatened. State biologists are working to reduce the need for such a listing. Adult alligator snapping turtles have formidable jaws. But most babies get eaten by larger animals. So since 2012, department biologists have raised hundreds of turtles for release when they’re bigger. Those released Wednesday ranged from 6 inches to 12.5 inches and from at least 2 to at least 6 years old, biologist Keri Lejeune of the department’s Wildlife Diversity Program says. The 51,100-acre wildlife management area southeast of Columbia includes eight bayous and 26 lakes.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s agriculture commissioner is asking the federal government to use a new program to buoy the wild blueberry industry during a difficult time. Blueberry harvesters collected about 57 million pounds of the fruit in 2018. That was down nearly 11 million pounds from the previous year, and prices have been low. Maine Agriculture Commissioner Amanda Beal is asking the U.S. Department of Agriculture for help via its market facilitation program. USDA launched the program last year to assist growers negatively affected by foreign trade retaliation. Beal says the program will provide more than $14 billion in direct payments to producers this year, but wild blueberries are not included in the program’s list of crops. Beal says Maine’s blueberry growers are often overlooked by programs and “deserve this needed support.”\n\nMaryland\n\nGlenelg: It appears Wi-Fi was the downfall of four teenagers who sneaked onto their school’s property the night before graduation last year and covered it in racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic graffiti. The Washington Post reports in a Tuesday story that the teens covered their faces during the hate crime but didn’t realize their cellphones automatically connected to Glenelg High School’s Wi-Fi under their individual student IDs. Seth Taylor, Tyler Curtiss, Joshua Shaffer and Matthew Lipp were soon arrested. Taylor said the teens meant to spray-paint “Class of 2018” on the sidewalk as a senior prank, but things got out of hand. Sentences for the four teens ranged from eight to 18 weekends behind bars.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGreat Barrington: A couple is working to preserve a crumbling hilltop cabin in western Massachusetts where the civil rights leader James Weldon Johnson wrote one of his most famous works. The Berkshire Eagle reports Rufus Jones and Jill Rosenberg-Jones, of New Jersey, purchased in 2011 a summer home on a 5-acre property in Great Barrington that once belonged to Johnson. They’re now turning their attention to saving the cabin where Johnson wrote “God’s Trombones,” a 1927 book of spiritual poetry. Johnson was an early leader of the NAACP and also a college professor, diplomat and songwriter. He died in 1938. Jones and Rosenberg-Jones say the cabin perched in an ancient hemlock grove has fallen into disrepair and could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to restore. The couple created a foundation in 2016 to help keep Johnson’s legacy alive.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: DTE Energy and the state’s prison system have launched a tree-trimming program that aims to fill open jobs and find full-time employment for released inmates. State, utility and union officials announced the program Tuesday at the Parnall Correctional Facility’s Vocational Village in Jackson. The first class of 24 started there last month. Prisoners who complete the training program will be eligible to join the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 17 and take an open job with a local tree-trimming supplier. Creators say the prisoners gain experience and get a job upon release – a challenge for many parolees. A stable job also reduces the chance they will return to prison. Officials also say the new pool of eligible workers will ease a shortage of trained people for the tree-trimming work.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report finds that murders decreased in the state last year, but rapes increased. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension released the 2018 crime report Monday that says violent crimes – including murder, rape, robbery, human trafficking and aggravated assault – decreased by nearly 7% in 2018. Murders in Minnesota decreased from 114 in 2017 to 104 in 2018. But rapes were up 9% in 2018. Robberies and aggravated assault both declined in 2018. Property crimes in Minnesota decreased nearly 9% in 2018. Motor vehicle theft was up for the third consecutive year. But burglary, theft and arson all declined, with arson numbers dropping to 426 in 2018, the lowest number since Minnesota started tracking arson crimes. The report is based on data reported by local law enforcement agencies.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A Republican candidate for governor says he would not let a female journalist follow him while campaigning unless she was accompanied by a male colleague – and now he’s trying to raise campaign money based on that because he says the “liberal media” are attacking him. “Before our decision to run, my wife and I made a commitment to follow the ‘Billy Graham Rule,’ which is to avoid any situation that may evoke suspicion or compromise of our marriage,” Robert Foster said in a fundraising email Wednesday. Larrison Campbell with online publication Mississippi Today wrote that she requested to “shadow” Foster to report about his campaign before the Aug. 6 primary, and his campaign director told her Foster wouldn’t ride in a vehicle alone with her because people could insinuate Foster and Campbell are having an affair.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Older residents of the Show-Me State soon will be able to get out of jury duty, if they so choose. Legislation signed Tuesday by Gov. Mike Parson will allow anyone age 75 or older to ask a court to be excused from jury duty. The judge will have to grant the request. The exemption is being added to a list of a half-dozen other categories of people who can be excused from jury duty. Those include nursing mothers, health care providers, and people for whom jury duty would impose an extreme physical or financial hardship. The new jury duty exemption will take effect Aug. 28.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Two groups are working on ballot initiatives seeking to legalize and tax recreational marijuana in the state. One group, MontanaCan, submitted proposed ballot language to the secretary of state’s office June 28. The Legislative Services Division is reviewing the language. The Missoulian reports another group, Coalition 406, is still surveying people and holding focus groups as it drafts its proposed ballot language. The organizations would have to gather about 25,000 signatures to qualify the issue for the November 2020 ballot. Both measures call for using the tracking, testing and regulation of the state’s medical marijuana program, taxing recreational marijuana at about 15%, and reducing or eliminating the tax on medical marijuana.\n\nNebraska\n\nHastings: Runoff from heavy rains in south-central Nebraska is moving down several rivers, posing new flood threats. Warnings were issued after up to 9 inches of rain fell in some spots during storms that struck Buffalo, Dawson, Frontier, Gosper, Kearney and Phelps counties overnight Monday. Floodwater entered several communities, including Kearney, where several people were stranded in their homes or vehicles. The National Weather Service says the Wood River at Alda is expected to crest Friday less than a foot below the record set June 16, 1967. The service says the water will reach houses on the north side of town and cover U.S. Highway 30. Floodwater also invaded the town of about 660 residents after the drenching March storms that hastened the snowmelt and caused widespread flooding in much of eastern Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Burning Man and neon lights are the predominant theme for the planned Reno Neon Line, which will see the installation of several art pieces in the Biggest Little City’s downtown Fourth Street corridor starting this week. Two sculptures will be installed this week, followed by two more next week, according to Jacobs Entertainment. A total of eight to 10 sculptures will be installed at the Reno Neon Line over the next two years. The first four sculptures are Desert Guard, a giant steel Mongolian warrior by artist Lu Ming; SQUARED, a 50-foot, tree-like LED lantern sculpture by industrial artist Charles Gadeken; Bloom, a large interactive sculpture by Michael Christian featuring lights and steel; and Rearing Horse, a kinetic horse sculpture made of found objects and built by Elko artist and inventor Barry Crawford. The installations will light up in the evenings with vibrant neon colors.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Democratic congressional delegation is welcoming Senate passage of a bill creating a commemorative coin to honor Christa McAuliffe, the Concord High School teacher who died in the NASA space shuttle Challenger disaster 33 years ago. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan introduced legislation in January to create a $1 coin to raise money for the FIRST Robotics program, while Reps. Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas introduced a House version of the bill. They said the coin would both honor McAuliffe and reaffirm Congress’ commitment to science education. The Senate bill passed Tuesday, and the House will now take up the bill. McAuliffe would have been NASA’s first designated teacher in space. She and six crewmates were killed when the Challenger exploded shortly after takeoff Jan. 28, 1986.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: America’s Playground is going green this week. The second annual Atlantic City Vegan Food Festival comes to the Showboat Hotel from Friday through Sunday. This year’s celebration of the vegan lifestyle, which uses no animal products, will be headlined by a talk from actress and activist Harley Quinn Smith. Smith, the star of “Yoga Hosers” who is featured in Quentin Tarantino’s July 26 release “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,” will appear in on-stage conversation with Alex Biese, features reporter for the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. The Red Bank-born Smith also happens to be the daughter of Highlands-native filmmaker Kevin Smith. General admission tickets, if purchased in advance, are $8 for the food truck festival Friday and $15 for the food festival Saturday. Kids ages 13 and under are free.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Environmentalists are going back to court in hopes of putting the brakes on plans to thin thousands of forested acres in the mountains bordering the city. Wild Watershed and others filed their appeal Monday, arguing that a U.S. district court judge erred when allowing the Santa Fe National Forest to move ahead with its plans for Pacheco Canyon and areas near Hyde Memorial State Park. The plaintiffs say forest officials failed to analyze the cumulative and indirect effects of clearing and burning in the area. In initially approving the projects, forest managers said the work needed to be done to reduce risks posed by disease, insect infestation and catastrophic wildfire. The environmentalists are concerned that the projects will end up targeting larger, older trees that are critical for many species.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state has expanded a law that prohibits gender pay discrimination, making it illegal to pay someone less based on characteristics including race, religion, disability or gender identity. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the changes into law in Manhattan on Wednesday, just before joining the U.S. women’s soccer team for a parade in New York City honoring their World Cup victory. Members of the team have filed a lawsuit demanding pay equity with the men’s soccer team, adding fuel to the broader debate over pay disparities that continue to affect millions of American workers. The new law, which takes effect in 90 days, also changes a legal standard for pay equity to make it easier for employees to prove discrimination in court.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Hurricanes, thievery and wrecks are taking out the state’s popular historical highway markers faster than the state can keep up. Historical marker program administrator Ansley Herring Wegner says five historical markers are missing, and a sixth that had been missing may be damaged beyond repair. More than 1,600 of the markers known as “history on a stick” stand along state roads, telling the stories of people and places that shaped the past. Replacing each costs $1,790. Wegner says the annual budget for new markers, repairs and replacements is $60,000. When she took her job in 2014, Wegner began keeping a database of missing markers and found some that had disappeared in the 1980s. The program began in 1936, when the first marker was placed in Granville County in honor of John Penn, who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Fourteen high schools in the state plan to form competitive video gaming teams during this upcoming school year as interest in esports increases nationwide, including at the collegiate level, where scholarships are offered for varsity teams. The Bismarck Tribune reports Mandan High School is one of them. Mandan Superintendent Mike Bitz says the school will spend about $20,000 this year to buy computers and other equipment to construct an esports lab for students. Bitz says esports will help an “underrepresented population” of students who might not otherwise partake in school athletics or activities feel more included. The Mandan esports season is slated to begin in October and will last through December. Two universities in North Dakota have an esports team, and two more colleges will launch teams this fall.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Discussions are underway to build a kid-friendly park as the city’s downtown population grows. Estimates show the number of people living downtown has grown to between 15,000 and 20,000 people, making it one of Cleveland’s biggest neighborhoods. Heather Holmes, the Downtown Cleveland Alliance’s vice president for marketing, tells Cleveland.com that her group, the city and downtown councilman Kerry McCormack have all been talking about the idea. Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that more than 1,100 children live in the general downtown area, with the number of children under 14 more than doubling over a decade. The park would be in addition to green space like the newly renovated Public Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Community leaders say they’re cautiously optimistic that the city’s new police chief will improve relations between the police department and historically underrepresented groups. Wade Gourley, 51, was appointed Monday as the department’s first new chief in 15 years and will oversee more than 1,200 uniformed officers. A 30-year veteran of the force, Gourley replaces former Chief Bill Citty, who retired in May after 41 years with the agency. Kris Steele, executive director of Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform, told The Oklahoman he hopes Gourley recruits and employs a diverse police force. About 6% of the department’s officers are Hispanic, 6% are black, and 1% are Asian. But the Census Bureau says Oklahoma City’s population is 18.5% Hispanic, 14.3% black and 4% Asian.\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Local officials in southern Oregon are asking the federal government to reject a proposed natural gas pipeline. The Medford Mail-Tribune reports the Canadian company Pembina wants to build a 229-mile underground pipeline to ship natural gas overseas to Asian markets. But county commissioners in Southern Oregon’s Jackson County say in a joint letter this month that the project would violate environmental laws and provide only short-term economic benefits to the area. Commissioners say Pembina is asking for exemptions to federal environmental regulations meant to protect forests and rare species. They add the project would only bring temporary construction jobs to the area and provide fleeting economic benefits. Pembina says it hopes to address the county officials’ concerns in future meetings.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf is moving to borrow up to $90 million to help counties pay for new voting machines ahead of 2020’s election, announcing the step Tuesday after a dispute between the Democrat and the Republican-controlled Legislature doomed funding legislation. Wolf said he was ordering a bond issue that would reimburse each county for 60% of their cost, according to Wolf’s administration, which provided little detail about the financing it will seek or the timeline for the move. Wolf began pressing counties last year to replace their voting machines before 2020 after federal authorities warned Pennsylvania and at least 20 other states that Russian hackers targeted them during 2016’s presidential election. That prompted a wide range of election integrity advocates and experts to urge states to switch to machines that produce an auditable paper trail.\n\nRhode Island\n\nHarrisville: A farmhouse that inspired the horror movie “The Conjuring” has new owners. Cory Heinzen tells the Sun Journal in Maine that he’s heard doors opening, footsteps and knocks. He says the house in Harrisville, Rhode Island, is “very busy.” The movie is based on the story of a family that lived in the farmhouse in the 1970s. The previous owners said the 1736 farmhouse was indeed haunted – by trespassers hoping to get a glimpse thanks to the 2013 movie. Heinzen, of Mexico, Maine, says he became interested in the paranormal while bivouacking at a Civil War battlefield and hearing screams and cannons. He and his wife bought the Rhode Island home last month and hope to open it to visitors and investigators later this year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A second police officer has resigned after authorities determined he was writing bogus traffic tickets to drivers without their knowledge. A statement from the Charleston Police Department says Blaine Morgan resigned Wednesday. Officer Michael Baker quit last week after an internal review of the traffic tickets. The department says the officers were writing the tickets so it looked like they were properly patrolling their area of Charleston. They would then dismiss the bogus tickets. The officers have not spoken about the investigation. Police say they have dropped all pending tickets written by the two officers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Regulators have approved a permit for construction of a wind farm in the northeastern part of the state. The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission approved a permit with conditions Tuesday to build the Crowned Ridge Wind Farm. The proposed wind farm will cover more than 53,000 acres in Grant and Codington counties and be capable of producing as much as 300 megawatts of energy from up to 130 wind turbines. Northern States Power Co., doing business as Xcel Energy, will purchase energy produced by the wind farm. Among the conditions the PUC placed on the permit are addressing sound levels and shadow flicker experienced by nearby residents, detecting ice on turbine blades, and monitoring grouse mating areas within the wind farm area once construction is complete. Crowned Ridge Wind estimates the wind farm will cost $400 million. Construction is expected to be completed by 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State health officials are launching a new public education and awareness campaign focusing on the impact of the opioid crisis. The state Department of Health says the campaign will kick off next Tuesday at the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville. The initiative will feature stories from people from every Tennessee county about how they have been personally affected by the opioid epidemic. It will also share information on how people can be part of the solution. With the project, state health officials will introduce a statewide media campaign and share materials with community partners to provide info on local resources. The campaign is funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Opioid Crisis Cooperative Agreement.\n\nTexas\n\nSurfside Beach: Kemp’s ridley sea turtles are critically endangered, but numerous volunteers patrol Brazoria County beaches every day during the nesting season to do their part to change that. The (Brazosport) Facts reports Texas A&M University at Galveston and Turtle Island Restoration Network partner to bring the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle eggs found along the Upper Texas Coast to Padre Island National Seashore, where they are incubated until ready to hatch and crawl out to the Gulf of Mexico. Volunteers patrol the 72 miles of beach from the Bolivar Peninsula to Surfside Jetty County Park by foot and utility task vehicles to spot turtle tracks and nests of eggs, says Joanie Steinhaus, the Gulf of Mexico program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. Volunteers patrol each year during the nesting season from April 1 to July 15, says Christopher Marshall, director of the Gulf Center for Sea Turtle Research.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state is planning to expand its remote-working program in hopes of reducing emissions and saving office space. Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said Monday that more than 2,500 state employees could eventually become authorized to work from home. Utah recently ran a teleworking pilot program with 136 employees who worked at least 3 days a week from home. Officials say it saved carbon-dioxide emissions from cars, and employees showed a 20% improvement in performance. Employees who participated in the program gave up permanent work spaces in favor of temporary shared workspaces, a model that saved space and is expected to be repeated at the new West Valley State Office Building.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Officials say an invasive beetle discovered a year ago in the state is chomping its way through trees in northern and central Vermont. Arborists in Burlington and other cities have considered treating prize trees to kill the emerald ash borer. Foresters, meanwhile, simply want to slow the spread of the pest. The emerald ash borer was first found in Michigan in 2002 and has spread to dozens of states and four Canadian provinces. Tony D’Amato, forestry program director at the University of Vermont, says the insects normally spread 1 to 2 miles a year, but they’re spreading much faster by hitching rides on firewood containing the insect’s eggs and larvae.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Deep-pocketed interest groups and activists on both sides of the long-running fight over gun laws are gearing up for a major clash in the state, now a key election battleground in the issue after Republicans on Tuesday adjourned a special legislative session called by the governor to consider gun-control measures in the wake of a mass shooting. The state’s off-year election will be closely watched because Virginia is the only state where control of the Legislature is up for grabs in 2019. Republicans currently hold a narrow majority. GOP lawmakers abruptly ended the session after less than two hours and postponed any movement on gun laws until after the November election. Democrats and gun-control advocates vowed to force them from office. Scores of gun-control advocates had gathered Tuesday outside the Capitol.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife has authorized killing some members of a wolf pack that are preying on cattle in northeastern Washington state. Agency director Kelly Susewind on Wednesday gave authority for the state to kill some members of the OPT pack in an effort to change the behavior of the pack. The action came after a cow was found Saturday in Ferry County that had been killed and partially consumed by wolves. The agency says the carcass suffered numerous bite wounds, accompanied by hemorrhaging. Wolf tracks were also seen at the site. Last year, the agency killed most members of the OPT pack that were preying on livestock. Conservation groups contend that repeatedly killing wolves in the same area does not stop cattle depredations.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A teachers union says it plans to sue over a sweeping GOP education bill that allows the creation of the state’s first charter schools. The West Virginia Education Association released a statement Wednesday saying it has sent the attorney general a formal intent-to-sue letter that alleges the legislation violates the state constitution. Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed the measure late last month after a gridlocked special session drew several heavy protests from teachers. The broad-based measure deals with several aspects of the state’s education system, but educators and Democrats fiercely opposed the provision to allow charters. They argued that charters would end up steering money away from public schools.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Mortgage foreclosure filings in the state have plunged to less than a quarter of what they were during the Great Recession and, in another economic downturn, aren’t likely to become so pervasive, says an economist who tracks foreclosures in Wisconsin. “I almost think it would be hard to get back there because we’re at such a low level now,” says Russell Kashian, a University of Wisconsin-Whitewater economics professor who oversees the college’s Fiscal and Economic Research Center. Data gathered by the center shows that through the first half of 2019, foreclosure filings in the state totaled 3,565 – the lowest in at least 19 years for that span. This year’s foreclosure tally amounts to 16% fewer than the 4,248 filed during the same period in 2018 and less than a fourth of the 15,427 recorded in the January-through-June stretch of recession-riddled 2009.\n\nWyoming\n\nRock Springs: The state Game and Fish Department wants people to turn in dead sage grouse they find so the birds can be tested for West Nile virus. Sage grouse have little resistance to West Nile, and the virus is often fatal to the chicken-sized, ground-dwelling birds. Wyoming is among just a handful of states with large populations of sage grouse. Leslie Schreiber with the Game and Fish Department says recent wet weather could encourage mosquitoes that can transmit West Nile to sage grouse. The Rock Springs Rocket-Miner reports you’re unlikely to catch West Nile by handling a dead bird. State officials say people who find a sage grouse that hasn’t died from an obvious injury should double-bag the carcass and take it to a local Game and Fish office.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2019/10/29/haunted-places-kentucky-and-indiana-see-map-ghost-story-sites/2496300001/", "title": "300+ haunted places in Kentucky, Indiana: Waverly Hills, Seelbach", "text": "Eastern Cemetery is haunted by some of its dead who are angry the cemetery is in such bad shape.\n\nHot Rod Hill hosts the ghosts of a tragic prom couple\n\nWaverly Sanitorium: You can check out, but you can never leave\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — Halloween is the perfect time to visit haunted houses, spooky theme parks and ghostly attractions.\n\nSure, a trip to the Baxter Avenue Morgue or The Haunted Hotel can be scary fun, but what about those really haunted places — cemeteries with legends of ghost visits, abandoned hospitals with stories of tragic deaths.\n\nThe Courier Journal assembled a map of hundreds of places in Kentucky and Southern Indiana with reports of paranormal activity, as collected by the Shadowlands Haunted Places Index.\n\nWe also gathered up some history and a few legends surrounding some of Louisville's eeriest locations, you know, just in case.\n\nSo, if you want to find out if these ghost stories are real, check them out for yourself.\n\nWe dare you.\n\nEastern Cemetery's angry spirits\n\nEastern Cemetery on Baxter Avenue is said to be haunted by some of its dead who are angry the cemetery is in such bad shape. It has endured severe overcrowding ⁠— cemetery ownership even began to reuse graves at one point ⁠— and general neglect over the years.\n\nGravestones date back to the 1700s, and there could be any number of people buried at Eastern Cemetery with reason for vengeance, including whoever is under one crumbling gravestone covered in dead grass and leaves, or the people near a rotting pumpkin strewn across the sidewalk.\n\nAccording to Louisville Ghost Hunters Society, Eastern Cemetery Corp. opened the first crematorium in Louisville in the early 1930s in what is now an apartment building.

According to the hotel's website, it began as the dream of Bavarian brothers Otto and Louis Seelbach, who came to Louisville in 1869 to learn the hotel business.\n\nDuring its 100-plus years downtown, the Seelbach has had many guests report strange sounds and activity during their stays.\n\nThere have been reports of televisions turning on at a loud volume at around 4 a.m., as well as the sound of running footsteps on wooden floors, even though the halls are now carpeted.\n\nSome guests have said they heard disembodied voices or felt cold patches throughout the hotel.\n\nThe ghostly Waverly Hills Sanatorium\n\nA list of haunted places in Louisville wouldn't be complete without mention of Waverly Hills Sanatorium.\n\nWaverly Hills in southwestern Louisville opened in 1910 as a two-story hospital to accommodate Louisville patients struck by a tuberculosis outbreak, according to Waverly Hills Historical Society. It eventually expanded to a new five-story building, which could hold more patients and opened in 1926.\n\nBefore the discovery of an antibiotic that treated and cured tuberculosis, a diagnosis of the disease was more or less a death sentence. The hospital was its own community set apart from the rest of Louisville to avoid contaminating the healthy population — it had its own post office and water treatment facility, and it grew and raised its own food.\n\n\"Once you went to Waverly Hills, you became a permanent resident,\" the historical society states on its website.\n\nThe tuberculosis hospital closed in 1961 and reopened in 1962 as WoodHaven Medical Services, a geriatric facility the state closed down in 1981.\n\nAfter it closed, Waverly Hills quickly gained a reputation for being haunted. It was purchased in 2001 by paranormal enthusiasts Charles and Tina Mattingly, and many volunteers working on the building's restoration have reported hearing ghostly sounds and slamming doors, seeing apparitions in doorways and being struck by invisible hands.\n\nToday, Waverly Hills attracts tourists from around the country with its paranormal and historical guided tours. It also allows private paranormal groups to host investigations of the facility, many of whom claim to have experienced inexplicable paranormal activity during their visits.\n\nMore:Explore Louisville's secret underground tunnels and the creepy stories they tell\n\n300+ haunted places in Kentucky and Indiana\n\nWant more?

Witch Hill\n\nThere is a tree in the middle of the road in Wilder where 3 witches were supposedly hung, and there is a curse on the tree to whomever tries to cut it down or spits on it. I have been to this place many times, and taken pictures, and many times even though it was a clear night, the pictures have come back covered in white blotches. You will find many out of the ordinary happenings on the way out to the tree. - September 2004 update /correction: It has recently been cut down and moved to the church parking lot at the top of the road. The three humps were also left off the story. There are three evenly spaced humps right before the bend the tree was on. These are the graves of the witches. The stories of distorted pictures are true though.\n\nAnnville, Ky.

Paramount Art Center\n\nIt is said that during some early renovation work on the Paramount Theatre, a death occurred there, and the man's ghost has forever since haunted the Paramount. In the early 1940s, four construction workers from Boyd Theater Company in Cincinnati, Ohio were working on a project inside the auditorium. It is reported that all of them had gone to lunch except for one man, a guy named Joe. When the other three returned, they found Joe hanging from the curtain rigging, dead. And since then, sounds have been heard, things have gone missing, cold drafts have been felt, and some folks even claim to have seen the image of a man appear on occasion. However, he is, by all means, a \"good ghost\" - one who seems to look out for the benefit of the theatre and its occupants. When Billy Ray Cyrus was here filming his video for \"Achy Breaky Heart,\" he was told about the legend of Paramount Joe. Between breaks, Billy Ray would talk to Joe, laughing and joking with him, sometimes even asking for his help. It is customary to get 8 x 10 photographs signed by each performer that appears at the Paramount and then hang the photo on the 'Wall of Fame' in the box office. Billy Ray personally autographed large color posters to each of the female employees working here at the time - and one with a personal inscription to Paramount Joe, whom he now had a fondness for. Each lady put her poster near her desk and Joe's was hung in the box office, near all the other performers. As time passed and the walls in the box office became too full of 8x10’s signed by other performers, the executive director felt that some of the pictures and posters needed to come down. Since there were so many of Billy Ray, she asked the women to remove their posters since they were all so similar. Nobody wanted to take their personally autographed picture of Billy Ray down, so they took down the one he had signed to Paramount Joe. The next day, when the ladies came to work, every single 8x10 and poster that had been hanging neatly on the walls the night before were now lined strewn on the floor, many of their glass frames shattered! It was as if someone had wiped each one off the wall. To this day, Paramount Joe’s poster still hangs in the Paramount, in a very special part of The Marquee Room, which is now the site of Paramount Joe's Rising Star Cafe.\n\nAshland, Ky. Small Blvd\n\nThere is a picture of a young Irish woman that hangs in the 5th house on the left. If you look at the picture the eyes will glow non-stop!

When it starts this, you are standing there cringing, just certain something is going to knock you down from behind, but the steps just stop abruptly and don't start back up until you begin walking again. When you step outside of the gate, the sounds of the footsteps stop.\n\nBardstown, Ky. Old Kentucky Home Middle School\n\nDuring the Civil War the school was used as a hospital.

Greenwood Mall\n\nBack in '96, a man was found dead in his pickup truck in the rear parking lot. The cause of death was never determined, and the vehicle was stolen.

After you pass this church there is a fork in the road, follow it to the left and this is where everything begins. However, on a good night, it begins when you first turn on the road. You must go after dark but the best time to go is around or after midnight. This cemetery disappears and then reappears in different locations. However, it will not show itself when you drive down the road. You must drive down to the end of the road and turn around and come back to see the cemetery. You will know when you are close to the cemetery because you will have an overwhelming feeling of sadness and will begin to cry for no apparent reason. You will see and hear various things. Sometimes you can hear music playing, laughter, screams and hear things trying to get in your vehicle.

If you are lucky enough to find the cemetery and drive up into it, you will not be able to drive out. It is so spiritually active that it drains the battery of your car leaving you stranded until the morning or until you get brave enough to push your car out. There have been images of Soldiers killing each other and those around them. There have been sightings of the dense woods opening where you can see more than you should. The fork in the road rolls and a dense mist appears and disappears as you drive the road. There is also a guardian dog. This dog closely resembles the \"Hounds of Hell\" as described in the Bible. This dog has dead yellow eyes and casts the shadow of a demon when it gets ready to disappear in the triangle at the fork in the road. The dog appears to be injured when it first appears on the side of the road, thus making you want to stop and pick it up, which in turn gives an open invitation to any spirit that is around. When you fail to pick up the dog things begin to change. The dog will walk a few steps and then turn to see if you are still following it. However, if you speed up the dog will speed up, if you slow down it will slow down, if you go to the left it will go to the left, if you go to the right it will go to the right and it is impossible to run over this dog. There have also been sightings of wrecked vehicles with people screaming for help.

There are many other things that occur out this road, but you must be very alert and very open to the spirit world and you cannot show fear, or it can take your soul, according to the legend. There are many trapped souls at this location that will mess with you. Make sure you do not have an open invitation of any kind. This means windows rolled up and doors locked. These spirits can also communicate with you through your dreams if you will let them. So, go if you dare just don't show fear! Everyone sees something different when they go to this location so be prepared to be scared.\n\nMarion, Ky. Pilot's Knob\n\nWitches Grave - This cemetery is located off Ford's Ferry Road in Marion. The legend behind this cemetery is about a five-year-old girl who was burned at the stake, along with her mother, in the late 1800s to the early 1900s for witchcraft. It is not known what happened to the body of the mother, however, the little girl, Mary Evelyn, is buried in a steel lined grave that is covered with rock and not dirt. She has a white picket fence surrounding her grave. The base of this fence is a series of crosses that connect end to end. However, she is not tall enough to climb over the fence, unlike a normal 5-year-old. Her tombstone looks brand new even though it is close to 100 years old, as does the fence. She paces inside this fence when someone comes to visit her making faces at them and reaching out to them. She sleeps during the day but is very evident at night. The legend also says that she cannot rest because she is searching for her mother but cannot escape the confines of the fence. Many unexplainable things occur at this cemetery. For one the \"Watcher\" makes himself very know and tries to follow you out of the cemetery. The \"Watcher\" was murdered at the swinging bridge but haunts the witch’s grave. He is trying to get to the little witch but because of the crosses that surround her he is unable to because he is evil. Crosses appear in the trees both upright and upside down, directly over her grave, though they face different directions. She presents herself as a normal 5-year-old little girl in a white dress, though her dress is scorched at the bottom as is her blonde hair. If you lay on her grave she will hold you down refusing to let go until someone from outside of the fence pulls you free. However, never lay on the grave when you are alone because chances are you will be pulled into her grave to be with her thus giving her more power. As with every haunted cemetery people that are open to the spirit world see something different.\n\nMartin, Ky.

There have been many sightings here of unexplained supernatural phenomenon. Such events include but are not limited to sightings of a \"werewolf\" type creature that charges up the hill at you, a female apparition that is not fond of males, and a strange light that seems to hover over one of the graves in the lower portion of the cemetery. Late at night during certain events, even the crickets are silenced.\n\nPaducah, Ky. Oak Grove Cemetery\n\nThe spirit of a young woman named Della Barnes walks through this cemetery on certain nights. Documents claim she was accidentally poisoned by the doctor who was treating her for an illness. Legend has a different story though. Some people believe that her fiancé murdered her in a fit of rage. He even went as far as to cut off her left ring finger to retrieve the expensive engagement ring he had given her. There is also an iron-rod statue of an angel that is said to turn and face a different direction in the cemetery.\n\nPaducah, Ky. Paducah Middle School\n\nThere have been reports of 4 gangsters roaming the halls and firing blanks at students. at night the janitors have reported smoke and the smell of marijuana coming out of the boy’s locker room.\n\nPaducah, Ky. Reidland Middle and High School\n\nDuring the day you could hear someone walking down the hallway and there would be no one there. Then some of the doors would open and close real fast and there would be nothing there some of them would not open it would be like it is stuck. Then the lights would go on and off and would not come on but when the teachers or students would go over there it would stop. Nobody knows what it is.\n\nPaducah, Ky. Whitehaven\n\nA restored mansion, now a rest area, and open to the public. A female apparition has occasionally been sighted on the balcony attached to the second-floor bedroom, believed to be the owner's wife. Legend has it she bled to death during an appendectomy. The feeling in that room is very pleasant, however, due to how much she loved that room---her husband had the room and balcony added on especially for her. She has been known to turn off the lights in that room, and the sounds of long skirts swishing as well as the scent of her perfume have been noted. Also, even though the old kitchen is now the employees' break room, there have been times the smells of someone cooking a huge feast have greeted startled visitors. It has been known to happen during the holidays, mainly Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is a beautiful place to visit, even if you don't get to meet the happy spirits inhabiting this great house.\n\nPaintsville, Ky. the City\n\nbuilt over partially or very near an Indian war and burial ground. This city is named for its numerous amounts of Indian paintings found here, and there are several Indian burial grounds here that businesses had been built on, that have had sightings.\n\nPaintsville, Ky.

Paintsville Elementary School\n\nNumerous reports of unexplained happenings from within the building including unexplained moaning, a sighting of a woman in one of the classrooms crying out to her husband and a child on the other side of the room, and many of the janitors working there claim there is in fact a ghost within the school.\n\nPaintsville, Ky. Ramada Inn\n\nThe RAMADA INN was built on haunted grounds. The once place called BRISTLE BUCK. At the RAMADA, employees have had first hand experience at hauntings. In the kitchen, pans will come flying from off the wall at whoever! Late at night in the atrium, there have been the footsteps of a woman in high heels heard, this is every night.

Along with the Parks memorial, the city will present two historic markers for Browder v. Gayle – the landmark case that ruled segregation on Montgomery buses unconstitutional. The civil rights memorials are a partnership among the City of Montgomery, Montgomery County, the Alabama Department of Tourism and the Montgomery Area Business Committee for the Arts.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal agency will decide by September how much ocean and coast will be designated as critical habitat for two ice seal species found in the state. The Center for Biological Diversity announced Monday that it had reached an agreement with the Commerce Department for the Trump administration to issue a critical habitat rule for ringed and bearded seals. Ringed and bearded seals live off Alaska’s northwest coast. Both are listed as threatened. Designation of critical habitat for threatened species is required by the Endangered Species Act a year after a listing. The Center for Biological Diversity sued in June because no critical habitat has been designated. Federal agencies that authorize activities such as oil drilling within critical habitat must consult with wildlife managers to determine if threatened species will be affected.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: For many elementary students, this time of year is filled with lessons about Thanksgiving, often arts and crafts or plays about the Pilgrims. That’s not the case for students at schools like Salt River Elementary and Puente de Hozho. Instead, these students get lessons that give insight into and strengthen their identity as indigenous people, focusing on fall harvest traditions and the importance of giving thanks. Teaching the myth of Thanksgiving is not required in the state’s standards for history and social studies. Salt River Elementary is a Bureau of Indian Education school located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and 100% of the student body is Native American. The school incorporates cultural and traditional learning within its curriculum. During November, many teachers increase those lessons for Native American Heritage Month. As for Thanksgiving, “we only talk about being thankful and being with family,” says Clarice Garcia, a fifth grade teacher. In the weeks leading up to the holiday, Garcia said she tries to talk about the positive and negative impacts explorers had on indigenous people, letting students form their own opinion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The University of Arkansas is now the home of a photo archive containing nearly a million photos of historical figures and events. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the collection arrived at the campus in Fayetteville last month. The archive includes photos of Babe Ruth, Bonnie Parker, Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King. There are also pictures documenting politics, wars, natural disasters and the civil rights movement. Dean of libraries Dennis T. Clark says the large trove is very significant in American journalism. He says it is the New York Post’s photo archive, which contains photos dating back to the 1860s. Lori Birrell, head of the special collections department at the UA library, says the collection will show the university is interested in having a national and international presence. Clark says the gift came from an anonymous donor in 2017.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo Safari Park has a pair of quirky new arrivals from Australia: platypuses. Last week the zoo publicly debuted an 8-year-old male named Birrarung and a 15-year-old female named Eve. The pair were flown to the park late last month. The zoo says it’s the first time in more than 50 years that platypuses – egg-laying mammals with furry bodies and ducklike bills – have been cared for outside of Australia. Safari Park’s lead keeper, Lori Hieber, says the pair have settled into their new, specially built habitat. She says they swim in the pools, play in the waterfalls and hunt live crayfish. An international conservation group lists the platypus as a “near threatened” species, mainly from habitat loss and the potential destruction from climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court has denied a request to reconsider a ruling declaring the sentences of hundreds of criminal defendants to be illegal. The Denver Post reports the justices refused to rethink whether criminal offenders could be sentenced to both prison and probation in the same case. Officials say the court ruled in September that defendants couldn’t be simultaneously sentenced. Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a petition this month challenging the decision, saying it could create extensive litigation affecting hundreds or even thousands of plea agreements and leading to numerous challenges. Officials say defendants convicted by a jury must be resentenced. Authorities say witnesses might have moved away, police investigators might have retired, and victims might not want to testify again, causing problems in the process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state will soon host its second inauguration of 2019. On Monday, West Hartford fifth grader Myra Stanfield will become the 2020 Kid Governor, succeeding 2019’s Ella Briggs. A ceremony is planned at the Old State House in Hartford. Like Ella, Myra was elected to the one-year position by fifth graders across Connecticut. She ran on a platform of preventing animal abuse. Her term begins in January. The civics education program was created in 2015 by the Connecticut Public Affairs Network, now known as the Connecticut Democracy Center. Participating students are given an opportunity to create a campaign platform around an issue, run for office and vote in the election. Gov. Ned Lamont, whose inauguration was 11 months ago, released a video online congratulating Myra.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Delaware Department of Insurance is warning residents about a new Medicare tool that state officials say causes confusion and conceals the total cost of coverage. In what he described as a rare consumer alert, Commissioner Trinidad Navarro said in a press release that the department has received numerous complaints about Medicare’s Prescription Plan Finder. The tool, created by the federal government and used by millions, is supposed to help find and compare Medicare coverage options for the current enrollment period, which ends Dec. 7. Navarro said the tool’s “focus on premium costs can deflect focus from higher personal costs at the pharmacy counter.” The tool organizes responses, Navarro said, by showing lowest premium costs first. But previous versions of the tool showed it by total annual costs. And if residents enter multiple medications, they could receive search results for plans that don’t cover all those they entered, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district is joining several states in suing e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, saying the company’s online ads and promotions illegally targeted minors. Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine announced the lawsuit Tuesday, alleging that Juul’s viral marketing contributed to the surge in underage vaping by teens in the district and across the U.S. The move follows similar lawsuits filed by California, New York and North Carolina. Several other states are also investigating Juul, which dominates the U.S. vaping market. Under intense pressure, Juul has suspended its U.S. advertising and halted sales of all but two of its flavors. Additionally, the company closed its social media accounts and tightened age verification for online sales. Representatives for Juul did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: The local school district is bringing in a crack squad of four-legged experts to deal with an overgrown patch of rough terrain, where hidden gopher tortoises, snakes, steep banks and vertical drop-offs make it too hazardous for grounds crews to handle. About two dozen goats will descend into a fenced area around a pond next to Imperial Estates Elementary in Titusville next week. Grounds services supervisor Matt Nolle says the area is too dangerous for heavy equipment or even people on foot. Goats are better for the environment and can get into places humans can’t. “Somehow, four legs is an advantage,” Nolle says. The Brevard School District is paying about $4,500 to hire the goats from Rent-a-Ruminant, a landscaping livestock company.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia Southern University has officially opened a learning center in Ireland. Savannah Morning News reports university leaders traveled to Wexford last week for the ceremonial event. A news release from the university says the center stems from a longtime partnership between the town and Savannah, as well as Georgia Southern’s Center for Irish Research and Teaching. The school says many Savannah residents claim Irish ancestry and can trace ancestors specifically to Wexford. University President Kyle Marrero met Ireland’s President Michael D. Higgins during the visit. The school says it marked the first official meeting between a Georgia Southern president and a foreign head of state. The school says Georgia Southern is the first public university in the United States to open an outreach learning facility in Ireland.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Education plans to offer free Hawaiian language courses to its employees. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the department’s 22,000 salaried employees, including 13,000 teachers, will be able to take courses beginning in January. Officials say the program is a partnership between the education department’s Office of Hawaiian Education and the University of Hawaii’s community colleges. The education department has incorporated Hawaiian language, culture and history in its curriculum since an 80-year public education ban on the language was overturned at the 1978 state constitutional convention. Employees can enroll in scheduled courses at seven community colleges beginning in the spring semester or join customized courses for education department staff groups. Teachers completing courses will receive professional development credits, while other employees will be given college credit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Fisheries managers are optimistic a program to save imperiled Snake River sockeye salmon is heading in the right direction despite few of the ocean-going fish making it back to central Idaho this year. Of the 735,000 young sockeye released in the state in 2017, only 17 survived the 900-mile journey to the Pacific Ocean and then back again to arrive as adults in the Sawtooth Basin near Stanley. But John Powell of the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said last week that fish raised to adults in hatcheries will keep the population going. Biologists also released 610 adults this fall into central Idaho lakes to spawn naturally. Powell also says biologists have solved problems that caused most of the young hatchery sockeye to die shortly after being released into the wild in 2017.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: There are full slates of special events and celebrations scheduled for the holiday season at two state historic sites in the city. Santa will be available regularly at the Old State Capitol to collect children’s Christmas wishes, and specially themed tours are scheduled for the Dana-Thomas House designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Children and families may visit with St. Nick and play holiday games at the Old State Capitol from 1 to 5 p.m. each Saturday from Nov. 30 to Dec. 21 and from 5 to 8 p.m. each Wednesday from Dec. 4 to 18. Each day will feature a different musical group as well. A dozen variously themed tours of the Dana-Thomas House are scheduled periodically from Nov. 29 through Dec. 20. Some require reservations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is facing calls from Democrats to explain his role in Amazon being cleared of responsibility for a warehouse worker’s death despite initial findings of major safety violations. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb denies any involvement in the state’s investigation of the 2017 death at Amazon’s Plainfield warehouse. The news outlet Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting reports a safety inspector ordered a $28,000 fine against Amazon, concluding it didn’t provide enough training before a forklift fatally crushed 59-year-old Phillip Lee Terry. It cites a recording the inspector made in which his boss tells Amazon officials how to shift the blame to “employee misconduct.” The death investigation happened while the Holcomb administration was bidding on Amazon’s planned second headquarters project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has pardoned two tom turkeys, continuing a long-standing Thanksgiving tradition celebrating the state’s turkey industry. The male birds named Benjamin and Franklin will live at Living History Farms in Urbandale, a 500-acre, open-air history museum that demonstrates three centuries of Iowa farm life. Reynolds held the annual event Tuesday at Terrace Hill, the governor’s residence, where she says she’ll spend Thanksgiving cooking for her family. Several family members, including grandchildren, petted the turkeys after Reynolds read the proclamation freeing them from becoming a thanksgiving meal. Iowa ranks seventh in U.S. turkey production, turning out more than 12 million turkeys annually on 130 farms. The state is fifth in turkey processing with plants in Storm Lake and West Liberty.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly reveled in holiday spirit Tuesday for the annual horse-drawn delivery of a Christmas tree to Cedar Crest, the official governor’s residence. The first-year governor said for years she has watched the celebration on the news with the rest of the state, and it was a “treat” to preside over the event. Every year, a member of the Kansas Christmas Tree Growers Association donates a tree for the occasion. Strawberry Hill Christmas Tree Farm near Lawrence donated this year’s model. Robin Dunn, of Dunn’s Landing farm near Wellsville, guided percherons Bill and Bruce as they pulled a replica Wells Fargo stagecoach up the drive to the front of the governor’s mansion to deliver the tree. Dunn said she has now delivered trees to five Kansas governors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s politicos are getting all wrapped up in the Christmas wars this year. After the reelection campaign for Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., began selling gift wrap featuring the Senate majority leader’s face with a Santa hat and a green bow tie – reminiscent of an iconic image of Christmas crooner Bing Crosby – the Kentucky Democratic Party has shot back with its own bespoke present paper. A donation of $30 to the commonwealth’s blue party yields a roll of red “Moscow Mitch” wrapping paper, featuring yellow images of the Republican wearing a Cossack hat with the “hammer and sickle” symbol on top of the words “Just Say Nyet to Moscow Mitch,” referring to a nickname McConnell received over the summer. “Anything @Team_Mitch can do, we can do better,” the Kentucky Democratic Party wrote in a tweet.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state museum system is asking for feedback as it works to update its governance, operations and attendance at its properties. The museum system wants people to fill out a five- to 10-minute survey about their interest in the facilities and their experiences at them. The survey will be available online until Saturday. The Louisiana state museum system includes the Cabildo and the Presbytere in New Orleans, the New Orleans Jazz Museum, the Capitol Park Museum in Baton Rouge and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in Natchitoches, among other facilities. Survey participants can enter to win a membership through the Friends of the Cabildo that gives free admission for two people and any children to all public state museum properties.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: Officials say a new partnership with the state’s farmers markets has expanded the number of people who can use the markets by making food assistance easier to access. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry says it has partnered with the Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets to help pay for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program processing equipment. The technology can cost hundreds of dollars, which prices many small markets out of the ability to buy it. About 1 in 8 Maine residents uses SNAP. The state says a half-dozen farmers markets have received new SNAP processing gear through the partnership since July. Maine has a total of about 35 farmers markets that accept SNAP.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island National Seashore: The National Park Service will institute a modest increase for all parks that charge entrance fees next year, including on Assateague Island. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, entrance fees at Assateague Island National Seashore will be modified to align with standardized rates being implemented nationwide for similar national park areas at the rate of an extra $5 per category. A seven-day pass to the park will be $25 per vehicle or $20 per motorcycle. An annual park pass will cost $45, and individuals will be charged $15 per person when entering by commercial vehicle. An entrance pass provides seven consecutive days of access to the seashore and the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia. The additional funds will be used for infrastructure and maintenance needs to enhance the visitor experience.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Native Americans are gathering for a 50th year in the seaside town where the Pilgrims settled – not to give thanks but to grieve. United American Indians of New England held its first National Day of Mourning in 1970. Since then, tribes have assembled at noon every Thanksgiving Day on a windswept hill overlooking Plymouth Rock. On Thursday, they’ll recall what organizers describe as “the genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture.” That’s an in-your-feast message, but co-leader Mahtowin Munro says the group is determined to get Americans to look beyond the Thanksgiving myth of European settlers and native people coexisting peacefully. Next year, Plymouth marks the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing in 1620.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: Leaders with Flint Community Schools are considering closing four of the district’s 12 school buildings amid a $5.7 million budget deficit partly driven by rising special education costs not covered by the state. Superintendent Derrick Lopez presented the proposal at a special school board meeting last week. It also calls for the restructuring four other district buildings. The plan would decrease transportation, security, maintenance, administrative and other expenses. Lopez says the district’s special education student number has greatly risen from just under 15% in the 2014-15 school year, as Flint’s water crisis began, to now 24%. Flint’s water was lead-contaminated when officials used corrosive river water from April 2014 to October 2015. In children, lead exposure can result in serious effects on IQ, ability to focus and academic achievement.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials have warned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that a proposal to streamline water quality laws would cripple their authority to protect drinking water, streams and wildlife from dozens of new projects each year. The EPA’s proposal targets Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which allows states to set their own conditions, conduct reviews, and approve or deny projects that could potentially pollute waterways. The change would give federal authorities power to dismiss conditions set by states or tribes and allow the EPA to overrule a state’s project denial. It would also prevent states from studying indirect sources of water pollution. But the Star Tribune reports that a Minnesota Chamber of Commerce official says some businesses welcome the changes. The EPA says states use their authority to impose conditions not related to water quality.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Magnolia State residents don’t have to leave the state to buy lottery tickets anymore. Tickets went on sale Monday at roughly 1,200 convenience stores and other sites. The Mississippi Lottery Corporation says people bought a total of $2.5 million in lottery tickets on the first day of sales, which translates into $570,000 for the state. Democratic state Rep. Alyce Clarke of Jackson has been pushing for years to bring a lottery to Mississippi. She bought a ceremonial first ticket at a RaceWay store and gas station in south Jackson. “It feels great. Finally, it becomes a reality. And it just goes to show you what happens if you don’t give up,” Clarke said. For decades Mississippi was one of only six states without a lottery amid strong opposition from politically powerful churches. People often drove to neighboring states such as Louisiana to buy tickets there.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Comedian Heidi Gardner is flipping the switch on an annual holiday lighting ceremony at the upscale Country Club Plaza shopping and dining district. The “Saturday Night Light” cast member says getting the starring role at the Thanksgiving night event once seemed “crazy” and “out of reach.” The Kansas City native was working on the Plaza in 1998 when actor Paul Rudd did the honors, lighting up several blocks of buildings. And she told The Kansas City Star that she has long had a picture of the Plaza lights on her refrigerator. The ceremony dates back to the 1930s. The only time the Plaza lights were not in operation occurred in 1973, when President Richard Nixon called upon all Americans to curtail the use of Christmas lights to reduce dependence on foreign oil imports.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The Board of Regents has approved a $150,000 pay raise to retain Waded Cruzado as the president of Montana State University after she received an offer for a higher-paying job. Supporters say Cruzado’s vision and fundraising ability make her worth the $476,000 annual salary, while opponents note her raise is nearly three times the median household income in the state. Commissioner of Higher Education Clay Christian supported the raise, saying it would allow Cruzado to continue the momentum she has created on the Bozeman campus. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports two classified MSU employees noted some workers are paid less than $11 an hour, vacancies are hard to fill, and people have left because they can’t afford to live in Bozeman. Regents on Friday also approved a 2% or 50-cent-per-hour raise for university system employees, whichever is greater.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is temporarily lifting weight restrictions on trucks carrying propane to address a shortage of heating fuels. State officials have suspended the 90,000-pound gross weight limit for motor carriers hauling critically needed heating fuels through Dec. 15. Lt. Gov. Mike Foley issued the order last week on behalf of Gov. Pete Ricketts, who is out of the state. Officials say drivers exceeding the normal weight limits must carry a copy of the executive order to document that they are providing direct support to the state. The order doesn’t apply to the interstate system. State officials say the shortage isn’t serious, but they’re monitoring it. They say more extreme shortages in surrounding states have increased the need to transport through Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A multibillion-dollar megaresort taking shape on the north end of the Strip is on track to become the most expensive hotel-casino project ever built. Malaysia-based Genting Group says the company’s Resorts World Las Vegas is expected to open in the summer of 2021. The cost of the project, initially targeted for a 2016 opening on the former site of the Stardust, was last estimated at $4 billion. Now it sits at $4.3 billion. That would make Resorts World Las Vegas more expensive than the development of the $4 billion Cosmopolitan. With the inflated price tag comes new features, according to the company, including a 5,000-capacity “state-of-the-art theater” scalable to host A-list residencies and corporate events; a 75,000-square-foot “nightlife and daylife concept”; and a 50-foot-diameter video globe to display over 6,000 square feet of LED content.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: Gov. Chris Sununu’s advisory board has voted to eliminate tolls on one of the state’s heavily traveled highways. The Executive Council voted Monday to get rid of the Merrimack tolls at the Everett Turnpike. The highway links Massachusetts and the New Hampshire cities of Manchester and Concord. Drivers currently pay 50 cents on the on and off ramps at the exits. The tolls bring in more than $1 million each year, but a transportation commission has decided that it puts Merrimack residents under an unfair burden. The tollbooths that were built 30 years ago will remain, but starting Jan. 1, motorists will be allowed to drive through without paying a toll.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Officials are hoping the return of redesigned holiday decorations will keep the season bright for commuters who travel through the Holland Tunnel. A slightly larger Christmas tree than the one used last year will be placed to cover the letter “A,” and a wreath will cover the letter “O.” A menorah will be positioned adjacent to the toll plaza on the New Jersey side of the tunnel. After complaints that the decades-old decorations over the New York-bound tunnel were distracting, more than 21,000 people last year voted in a poll commissioned by tunnel operator the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Voters wanted the tree moved from over the “N” in “Holland” to cover the “A” and the wreath moved from over the “U.” The decorations go up Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCimarron: One of the most spectacular properties owned by the Boy Scouts of America is being mortgaged to help secure the youth organization’s line of credit. The Boy Scouts say there is no plan to sell the Philmont Scout Ranch in Colfax County. It is being used as collateral to help meet financial needs that include rising insurance costs related to sex-abuse litigation. The move dismayed a member of Philmont’s oversight committee, who says it violates agreements made when the land was donated in 1938. The BSA disputed his assertion. The mortgage document was signed by top Boy Scout officials in March. But members of the Philmont Ranch Committee only recently learned of the development. The ranch is a popular destination for hiking and camping trips.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Thanksgiving came early for a group of New York City commuters who enjoyed a holiday feast on a subway train. Video footage shows riders standing behind a white-clothed table covered with plates of turkey, mashed potatoes and cornbread in the middle of a Brooklyn-bound L train on Sunday. Stand-up comedian Jodell “Joe Show” Lewis tells the New York Post he organized the Thanksgiving dinner to “bring a little excitement to commuters” and feed any New Yorkers who might be hungry. Lewis says he chose the L train after he saw how “dreary and upset” riders were at the inconvenience of a construction project that has cut service on the line.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Students and employees at all University of North Carolina system campuses will be able to use their school identification cards for the state’s voter ID mandate starting in 2020. The State Board of Elections announced on Tuesday the approval of cards for students and employees at 12 of the 17 UNC schools. These IDs were rejected earlier this year because they didn’t meet standards set in a law implementing the photo ID requirement. The ID mandate was added to the state constitution in 2018. The General Assembly altered ID security rules last spring so schools with rejected cards could apply again for next year. The board says more than 150 types of photo ID are approved for use with the March primary. A driver’s license is the most common.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There will be a runoff election for a new state Supreme Court chief justice. None of the three justices running to lead the high court received the majority votes necessary on Monday to clinch the position. Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jon Jensen were the top vote-getters, followed by Daniel Crothers. McEvers and Jensen are still in the running. The ballots were cast by the state’s 52 district court judges and each of the five justices on the high court. They will now recast their votes, to be tallied in early December. The chief justice position was left open after 86-year-old Chief Justice Gerald VandeWalle announced in September that he would not seek reappointment to the top post when his term expires at the end of the year.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The city’s zoo has welcomed a new baby giraffe shortly after losing the 12-year-old male giraffe that sired him. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden says 8-year-old Cece delivered the calf Saturday, and mom and baby are doing fine. Zoo officials say it’s too soon to determine the sex of the 6-foot-tall calf. The calf was the seventh sired by Kimba, who died earlier this month from complications following a surgical procedure on his hooves. The calf is the 17th giraffe born at the zoo. Giraffe populations in the wild are being affected by habitat loss, trophy hunting and illegal poaching, Zoo officials say up to 75% of calves in the wild die in their first few months of life, mainly due to predators.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new study has found that nearly 500 older, low-income Oklahomans died prematurely because the state did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The Oklahoman reports that a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis estimates 476 state residents between the ages of 55 and 64 died prematurely from 2014 to 2017 because the state declined to expand eligibility for the federal health care program. The left-leaning think tank says they are among 15,600 such deaths that could have been avoided nationally if all states had expanded Medicaid. The Washington, D.C.-based group says its estimates are based on mortality data and records and data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Social Security Administration. Republican leaders in the state dismissed the study as irresponsible and reckless.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregonians are being called to take pictures of the coast this week, for science. Coastwatch volunteer coordinator Jesse Jones says photos of extra high tides happening through Thursday can help scientists learn how different communities will be affected by climate change. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports photographs taken by citizen scientists and assembled by the Oregon King Tides Project can show where the water might be when the oceans rise. The Oregon King Tides project wants pictures from all along the coast to help figure out how to plan for rising seas. In particular, they need photographs of beaches as well as familiar landmarks like jetties, bridges, buildings, roads, seawall, shorelines, beach infrastructure and estuaries. Jones notes that the most helpful beach pictures are taken facing north or south so that it’s clear how far in or out the tide has come. Participants can upload the images to the Oregon King Tides website or post them to social media with the hashtags #orkingtides and #kingtides.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nReading: The state overhauled its child sexual abuse laws Tuesday, more than a year after a grand jury report showed the cover-up of hundreds of cases of abuse in most of Pennsylvania’s Roman Catholic dioceses over the past seven decades. The central bill signed by Gov. Tom Wolf gives future victims of child sex abuse more time to file lawsuits and ends time limits for police to file criminal charges. The grand jury report spurred several states to change their laws and other states to begin similar investigations. Wolf said the new laws will help repair “faults in our justice system that prevent frightened, abused children from seeking justice when they grow into courageous adults.” Wolf signed the bills at Muhlenberg High School in Reading, the home district of Democratic state Rep. Mark Rozzi, a champion of the legislation who has spoken publicly about being raped as a 13-year-old by a Roman Catholic priest.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The city is working with Brown University to create a digital map of one of the nation’s largest and most intact Colonial-era African burial grounds. The city wants a high-resolution map of God’s Little Acre to serve as the foundation for future site management and exploration. Doctoral students from the Ivy League university are working on the project. The Preservation Society of Newport County says the burial ground contains about 200 professionally carved headstones for enslaved and freed Africans from the 17th and 18th centuries, a time when African graves were typically left unmarked in the United States. City officials hope the map will be ready next summer so it can be made available to the public through a smartphone app and online. Tours currently rely on a printed map.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLoris: A farm animal with unbridled ambition has given new meaning to the phrase “get off your high horse.” Horry County Fire Rescue workers say they were called Sunday to a barn in Loris, where a horse somehow managed to leave its stall and climb into a hayloft. They had to bring in heavy equipment, and large-animal veterinarians helped sedate the horse before it was lowered to the ground on a makeshift platform. The horse has moved on to greener pastures, seemingly in good spirits in a grazing field. Rescue workers still haven’t figured out how the horse managed to climb a narrow set of stairs into the loft.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The last living worker who helped construct Mount Rushmore National Memorial has died. Donald “Nick” Clifford of Keystone, South Dakota, was 98. His wife, Carolyn Clifford, says he died Saturday at a hospice in Rapid City. At 17, Nick Clifford was the youngest worker hired to work at Mount Rushmore, in the state’s Black Hills. He operated a winch that carried workers up and down the mountain where the faces of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were carved, and he drilled holes for dynamite. The Rapid City Journal reports that Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln, decided in 1938 to field a baseball team and hired Clifford, who already was a veteran pitcher and right fielder. Clifford worked on Mount Rushmore from 1938 to 1940, earning 55 cents an hour.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal officials are proposing removing the Nashville crayfish from the endangered species list. A news release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says a review has found the crayfish populations are “healthy, stable and robust.” The 7-inch crustacean lives only in the Mill Creek watershed in metropolitan Nashville. The last review of the crayfish by the Fish and Wildlife Service recommended listing the species as “threatened.” Tierra Curry says that would be a better option. The senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity says Nashville is developing rapidly, and giving the species threatened status would allow it some continued protection. The proposal for delisting was published in the Federal Register on Tuesday. The agency will accept public comments through Jan. 27.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: An English teacher who was fired after tweeting that her high school was full of students who are in the country illegally has won an appeal to get her job back. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath ruled Monday that Carter-Riverside High School teacher Georgia Clark’s tweet was protected by the First Amendment. Clark can either receive back pay and employment benefits, or the Fort Worth Independent School District can pay her a year’s salary. District spokeswoman Barbara Griffith says Morath’s ruling was a technicality, and the district is exploring its options. Clark’s attorney didn’t respond for a comment. The district board voted in June to fire Clark. She told a district investigator that her tweet was meant only for President Donald Trump and that she didn’t realize her postings were public.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Two of the state’s small cities tested an alternative method of voting that allows people to rank candidates from first to last during recent municipal elections. The Daily Herald reports six cities had planned to test the ranked-choice voting system, but four backed out over concerns about how to explain how it works to voters. Vineyard and Payson were the municipalities that tried out a method that allows voters to rank candidates from first to last. If none of the candidates gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated. The process continues for several rounds until a candidate gets the majority of votes. Vineyard City Recorder Pamela Spencer says she only received a few calls from confused voters and considered it a success.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Four local high school journalists have won an award for their victory over censorship. Last year, the Burlington High students broke a story in their school newspaper about a school employee facing unprofessional conduct charges. The interim principal asked the students’ adviser to take it down. The article was removed, but students kept up links to it on social media, saying it was censored. Students talked to legal experts, and the newspaper cited its rights under the “New Voices” law that protects First Amendment rights of student journalists. Last week the students were awarded the Courage in Student Journalism Award, sponsored by the Student Press Law Center, the Center for Scholastic Journalism at Kent State University and the National Scholastic Press Association.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials are reminding Virginians it’s not too late to get their flu vaccine. The Department of Health encourages everyone older than 6 months to receive the vaccine. State health officials gathered last week for an event in Richmond to highlight the importance of the vaccine and get a flu shot themselves. Flu season normally begins in October. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says vaccination by the end of October is preferred, vaccination in November and beyond can be beneficial. Influenza activity usually peaks in January or later. The CDC warns the flu is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. The CDC also says vaccination has been shown to significantly reduce a child’s risk of dying from influenza.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council is proceeding with a new tax on Uber and Lyft rides pitched by Mayor Jenny Durkan to help pay for affordable housing and the delayed downtown streetcar and to give new support to ride-hailing drivers. The Seattle Times reports council members unanimously approved the 57-cent tax Monday. Durkan and the council have also promised to ensure Uber and Lyft drivers make Seattle’s $16 minimum wage starting next summer, but the city first plans to study driver pay. The new tax stops short of a more widespread tolling scheme some say is necessary to truly address congestion choking downtown streets. Durkan’s administration has explored the concept of congestion pricing, in which all drivers downtown would pay a toll. Uber and Lyft back that type of widespread charge and decried the new tax, claiming it could stymie ridership and hurt drivers. Durkan’s office projects the new tax will raise about $25 million a year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: It’s officially buck hunting season in the Mountain State. The annual buck firearms season kicked off this week and is expected to bring thousands of hunters to the state’s vast woodlands. Officials say starting the season toward the end of November increases the chances of hunting during snowfall, which makes it easier to spot and track deer. The season traditionally opens on the Monday before Thanksgiving. Hunters can harvest two deer on the same day, but only one can be an antlered buck. Anyone who wants an additional buck must buy a stamp from the state and have additional licensing. Gary Foster of the Division of Natural Resources says the state’s deer seasons help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars to the state’s economy. Buck firearms season ends Dec. 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic lawmakers want more diaper-changing stations in the state. State Reps. Jonathan Brostoff and David Crowley and state Sen. Chris Larson have introduced a bill that would require public and commercial buildings built or renovated after the bill becomes law to have diaper-changing stations in every restroom. Owners of commercial buildings with public restrooms would have to post signs identifying bathrooms with changing stations. Brostoff says he’s a new father, and he’s constantly struck by how few businesses have changing stations and how many place them only in women’s restrooms. Aides for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald didn’t immediately respond to emails inquiring about Republican support for the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The family of a man who was shot and killed by police officers is suing the city and the Casper Police Department. Daniel Wolosin alleges in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court that police officials failed to properly train officers in de-escalation techniques and failed to enforce policies that would have prevented the death of 38-year-old David Wolosin. Authorities say Wolosin opened fire first in the May 2018 shootout after two officers were called to check on a report of a man allowing children to drive a car on a dirt lot. Officer Jacob Carlson was shot multiple times by Wolosin and nearly died. City attorney John Henley told the Casper Star-Tribune he had not yet reviewed the lawsuit. Prosecutors previously determined the officers’ actions were justified.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/08/gingerbread-destruction-raffle-toilet-paper-pyramid-tiehms-buckwheat-news-around-states/40960031/", "title": "Gingerbread destruction raffle, toilet paper pyramid: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHayneville: A teenager admitted to fatally shooting a sheriff who was attempting to disperse loiterers at a gas station, a state investigator testified Monday. Lt. Shawn Loughridge of the State Bureau of Investigation testified in a preliminary hearing that 18-year-old William Chase Johnson admitted after being arrested that he shot Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams Sr. Johnson is charged with capital murder in the sheriff’s death. Store security video showed the sheriff arriving at a gas station and attempting to disperse a noisy crowd that was blocking gas pumps, the investigator said. He said witnesses indicated Johnson first approached Williams in an “aggressive” manner, and the sheriff told him to return to his vehicle. The sheriff was shot after approaching Johnson’s black Silverado truck, Loughridge testified.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: One of the longest-serving members on the state Supreme Court plans to retire later this year. The Alaska Judicial Council is accepting applications for the seat held by Justice Craig Stowers, who plans to retire effective June 1, according to Mara Rabinowitz with the state court system. Stowers, a former Superior Court judge, was appointed to the Alaska Supreme Court in 2009 and later served as a chief justice. Of the current justices, only Daniel Winfree has served on the Supreme Court longer. Winfree was appointed in 2007. The judicial council plans to meet in May to interview applicants. The names of finalists advanced by the council will be sent to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who will make the appointment.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Like many city libraries, the one in downtown Tucson is a refuge for homeless people looking for a bathroom, a computer or just a respite. But staff at the Valdez Main Library want to be even more of a resource for men and women having a hard time. For more than a year now, the librarians here have been holding monthly meetings as part of the On the Streets program. Those experiencing homelessness can once a month get a meal and connect with services. The program has helped temper friction that can develop when library staffers have to approach people who are sleeping, bathing or bringing in multiple items. An average of 50 people show up for the monthly sessions. They receive a meal prepared by a local food bank and can choose to stay for the meeting. They get to shape the topics of discussion, too.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State officials announced Monday that the closure of a hog farm near the Buffalo River has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility’s owners. Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst announced that the terms of the state’s agreement with the owners of C&H Hog Farms Inc. are complete. The shuttered hog farm’s owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last August, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. Under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in Vendor, about 95 miles northwest of Little Rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. The Nature Conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A team of eye experts has operated on an unusual patient – a gorilla. A cataract was removed Dec. 10 from the left eye of a 3-year-old western lowland gorilla who lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the park announced Monday. The gorilla, named Leslie, was given a muscle blocker to keep her still while a team that included vets along with anesthesiologists and an ophthalmology team from UC San Diego Health removed the cloudy lens and replaced it with an artificial lens that should last for life. The operation was performed at the San Diego Zoo Global’s Paul Harter Veterinary Medical Center. Cataract surgeon Chris Heichel, who led the team and has performed thousands of operations, said it was his first on a gorilla.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the November ballot. The secretary of state’s office said Monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. The gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of U.S. states. It was eradicated in Colorado in the 1940s. Colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund is campaigning for the plan. It says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. If passed, the initiative would direct the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the Continental Divide before 2024.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Gov. Ned Lamont is scheduled to appear at a public meeting this weekend to discuss his proposed transportation plan, which could include highway tolls. The town hall-style meeting is planned for Sunday at a school in Westport, where the Democratic governor is expected to be joined by Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti. It will be hosted by state Sen. Will Haskell and state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, both Democrats. A transportation forum that originally was planned for Tuesday evening in Westport had been postponed. “Improving our infrastructure is a top concern for my district. That’s why I’m so excited to host Gov. Lamont and leaders from his administration to hear directly from my constituents at this town hall meeting,” Haskell said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: An 18-year-old man has been charged with throwing an incendiary device at a Planned Parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor’s office announced. Samuel James Gulick, of Middletown, was charged Monday in federal court. Security video recorded Gulick spray-painting the phrase “Deus Vult,” a Latin expression meaning “God wills it,” in red letters across the Newark building’s exterior Friday, the U.S. attorney’s release said. Gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. The object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. Gulick was arrested by the FBI on Saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The viral art phenomenon known as “Infinity Mirrors” is returning to the Hirshhorn Museum on April 4. The Hirshhorn announced Monday that a mini exhibit of Yayoi Kusama’s work, “One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection,” will be on display through Sept. 20, WUSA-TV reports. The exhibit includes two “Infinity Mirror” rooms, including Kusama’s 1965 installation “Phalli’s Field” and a new room that will be announced soon. An early painting, photographs of Kusama and the 1964 sculpture “Flower Overcoat” will also be part of “One with Eternity.” The Japanese artist has created more than 20 of the mesmeric mirror rooms, allowing visitors to physically partake in the infinite repetition for which her paintings are known.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state’s environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former Gov. Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency’s mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency’s critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. “I don’t want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren’t even going to hold them accountable. I mean, how can we justify that?” Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Two men were killed last month in Atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. The chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. Changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, Shields said. “I have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception” for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Titusville, Florida.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state’s actions to fight road deterioration. Repair crews began working Sunday on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane. An area north of Pokiwai Bridge will remain closed until further notice, the Hawaii Department of Transportation said. Ed Sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. The collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. Inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. The 65-year-old Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address to lawmakers Monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. “I am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans’ prosperity and quality of life,” Little declared. His budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. His budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state’s rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. The state spends about half its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little’s budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed Monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. The legal sale of recreational cannabis began Jan. 1 in Illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. By comparison, Michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal Dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. Neal McQueeney of Midway Dispensary in Chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product Sunday and doesn’t expect to resume sales until Friday. Jason Erkes said Cresco Labs shut its Sunnyside shops in Chicago, Rockford and Champaign to all customers to “reset” and give his staff a break after working five consecutive 14-hour days.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A recently retired University of Southern Indiana professor already has a new job, as the state’s newest poet laureate. The Indiana Arts Commission says Matthew Graham of Evansville began his two-year term as state poet laureate last week. He succeeds Adrian Matejka, an Indiana University professor. Graham’s duties will include making public appearances at poetry readings or literary events and promoting poetry. Graham is the author of four books of poetry, including “The Geography of Home,” released in 2018. He’s received a number of national, regional and local awards, including a Pushcart Prize, an Academy of American Poets Award and two grants from the Indiana Arts Commission. Graham co-founded and co-directed “The Ropewalk Writers’ Retreat” in the historic southwestern Indiana town of New Harmony.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: To keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, Des Moines International Airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. Planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said Monday. The extra four gates hadn’t been slated to be built until 2040. The airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. But because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly proposed Monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the Republican-controlled Legislature spiked last year. Kelly’s proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it’s not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year’s proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. The Kansas Public Employee Retirement System projects Kelly’s proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Humane Society had its largest adoption year on record with about 6,902 animal adoptions in 2019. The Humane Society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. In total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs. Adoption officials said cat adoptions have been increasing over the past few years. Humane Society spokeswoman Andrea Blair said cats are popular with seniors, busy families, renters and people who travel for work. Blair said 1,583 cat adoptions took place at Purrfect Day Café, which opened in August 2018. The cafe serves coffee, snacks and cocktails while patrons interact with adoptable kittens and cats. Total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Residents who had real Christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state’s fisheries. Jefferson Parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual Christmas tree recycling program. It’s the parish’s 30th year doing the project. Volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed Feb. 1 to help move the trees out to Goose Bayou, according to Seamus Riley with the parish’s Coastal Management Department. The staging area is at Cochiara’s Marina in Lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. The parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect Louisiana’s coastline. The trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. In 2019, more than 6,000 Christmas trees were collected in Orleans Parish and airlifted by the Louisiana National Guard into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Biologists with the state Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. Starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as Maine’s moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. The study began in the winter of 2014 in western Maine, and a second study area in northern Maine was added in 2016. Over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a GPS collar. This year, the program will include a new area north of Moosehead Lake. The collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. Adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. For each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A newspaper’s review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. The Capital reports court documents filed through the state’s electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. In contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. That process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. The newspaper reports it’s unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. In the case of the man accused of opening fire in the Annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated “confidential,” keeping them from public view.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The City Council swore in the most diverse group in its history Monday. The council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by Mayor Martin Walsh during a ceremony at Faneuil Hall, the Boston Herald reports. The mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. Voters in November also elected the council’s first Latina member, Julian Mejia, as well as district councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Kenzie Bok and Liz Breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. City Councilor Kim Janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body’s president. The council was a white male bastion for decades, but Boston is now a “majority minority” city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.\n\nMichigan\n\nMidland: It’s not what the Egyptians had in mind, but it worked: A group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. It took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at Bullock Creek High School in Midland County. They are hoping to be recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. “There was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic,” Maxton Herst told MLive.com. “Every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. It was just kind of mind-numbing work.” Herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on YouTube. The students built the pyramid during holiday break. Rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWinona: An employee has been fired after tweeting criticism of his firm’s holiday gift to its workers. A branch manager for Fastenal in Canada was fired just before New Year’s Day after he posted a tweet chiding the company about its gift choice of barbecue sauce and a wooden grill scraper. Fastenal says the tweet violated the company’s policy on social media posts. CEO Dan Florness said the policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to every employee and posted on the company website. News of the firing has been widely shared on social media and prompted a backlash, including several website posts and phone messages that were deleted immediately because they were “vulgar” or “threatening,” Florness told the Star Tribune. Fastena’l, based in Winona, says it’s the largest fastener distributor in North America.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state’s prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates’ constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups said they were sending the letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Justice. The letter warns that “it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention.” U.S. Rep Bennie Thompson, Mississippi’s only Democrat in Congress, called Sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. Mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from Tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Gov. Mike Parson says he’s not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Parson, the former Polk County sheriff, said he is monitoring a Platte County court case that could provide legal guidance to the state’s prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. The video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. Opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. But backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. The governor’s stance is in contrast to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A Native American tribe has planned a celebration after recently gaining federal recognition. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana has announced plans to host a celebration Jan. 25 in Great Falls. The celebration comes about a month after President Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act containing an amendment giving the Little Shell Tribe federal recognition, officials said. The free celebration will be held at the Holiday Inn from 5 to 10 p.m. and is open to the public, tribal council members said. The celebration includes dinner, traditional music played by fiddlers, and speeches by dignitaries and council members. Other tribes are expected to be represented at the event, councilmembers said. The public is also invited to attend a pipe ceremony the same day at 1 p.m. at the Shawn Gilbert Event Center, tribal members said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The City Council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. The council voted unanimously Monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. The new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can’t be recycled. People have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can’t be recycled. Cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, Lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities Donna Garden told the council last month. The ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. Violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An Australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. The Center for Biological Diversity filed notice in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with Ioneer USA Corp. The center filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October to list Tiehm’s buckwheat as an endangered species. The lawsuit filed weeks later accused the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Monks at a Catholic college faced off in court Monday against the school’s board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks’ power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. A judge heard motions in Hillsborough Superior Court related to a lawsuit filed against the Saint Anselm College board last year. The unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks’ ability to amend the school’s bylaws. Michael Tierney, representing the monks, said the school’s charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. The school was set up and run by Benedictine monks for 130 years. The board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. It argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state’s network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. The measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. The bill was approved by two Assembly committees Monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. To achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. At the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle’s sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Legislature’s lead budget-writing committee on Tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of New Mexico’s windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. The Legislative Finance Committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. Legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The country’s busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of Penn Station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. More than 600,000 people pass through Penn Station daily on trains run by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City subway system. The station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. The more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: A popular ferry route has closed for three months to allow crews to perform repairs. The StarNews reports the N.C. Department of Transportation closed the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry beginning Monday to update ramp equipment at both ferry terminals. The department’s ferry division said contractors expect work on the approximately $3 million project should be done by early April. The work comes after a failure of the ramp system on the Southport side of the ferry shut down the route for five weeks in August and September. The ferry closure will be a headache for tourists and commuters. What was a 30-minute trip over the water could take an hour-plus by road. Nearly 200,000 vehicles make the Southport-Fort Fisher crossing each year, the StarNews reports, citing state statistics.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted Monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. The Bismarck Tribune reports the five-member Burleigh County Commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. The vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. That vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. Had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in Burleigh County, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump gave states and counties that power.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the state’s Medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. The governor’s directive came after a recent report showed Ohio’s uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the Columbus Dispatch reports. DeWine said he asked Medicaid Director Maureen Corcoran “to see what steps that we can take to deal with this” and to see if there is a way to “make re-enrollment easier” so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. The number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in December by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Two days of meetings and new searches are planned this week for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for more than two decades, authorities said Monday. Investigators with the Craig County District Attorney’s Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation will be joined by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman in and around the former town of Picher, about 85 miles northeast of Tulsa, said district attorney spokeswoman Michelle Lowry. Lowry said a request from Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency’s involvement. The OSMRE will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. Picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving in.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Resources Conservation Service says the amount of water from snow that’s fallen in Oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the Capitol Press reports. Water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern Oregon where the climate is drier. Every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the Owyhee Basin in southeastern Oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. The lowest totals are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the Willamette Basin at 26%. The water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30 of the following calendar year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday. A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices. The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer; Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks; and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland. Nesbit and Walsh were elected to become county judges, and DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner. Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nonprofits in the state have been awarded grants totaling nearly $300,000 for outreach to boost participation in the 2020 census. The Rhode Island Foundation announced the grants Monday from the Rhode Island Census 2020 Fund, a statewide, collaborative funding initiative. The goal is to protect the $3.8 billion a year Rhode Island receives in federal funding for education, health care, transportation and housing based on census data, the foundation said. Twenty-six organizations received funding for programs to reach hard-to-count communities, including the Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education in Providence, Progreso Latino in Central Falls, and Meals on Wheels in Providence. Nonprofits, municipalities, houses of worship, and public agencies including libraries and schools can apply for grants in the second round of funding.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The Citadel is evaluating the college’s existing buildings, infrastructure and landscapes to create a long-term plan that will guide future building projects and campus renovations. The campus master plan will create a vision of what the public military college could look like 15 years from now, The Post and Courier reports. “Once we have a plan in place, it will guide all of our facility decisions going forward,” said Jeff Lamberson, vice president of facilities and engineering. The college finalized a $450,000 contract with Ayers Saint Gross, an architectural design firm spearheading the project, in October. College officials have talked with hundreds of students, faculty and staff in more than 35 focus-group meetings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislators have invited the Crow Creek Sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual State of the Tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of Gov. Kristi Noem’s Cabinet. Lawmakers on Monday invited Lester Thompson Jr. to deliver the address next week. The move is a switch from plans to have Secretary of Tribal Relations Dave Flute give it. The annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. Last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the Great Sioux Nation Tribal address. That event will still happen in Fort Pierre across the Missouri River from the Capitol but has been rescheduled for after the State of the Tribes address.\n\nTennessee\n\nTownsend: One of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park’s most popular sites has been closed to all vehicles until repairs to a main access road tunnel are finished. The Cades Cove closure started Sunday night and is expected to last until March. Major repairs are needed for the internal drainage system in the 121-foot long Bote Mountain Tunnel on Laurel Creek Road, according to the National Park Service. The tunnel hasn’t undergone significant work since it was built in 1948. The cove’s campground also will be closed until March. The nearby Elkmont Campground and the Smokemont Campground in North Carolina will remain open year-round to accommodate displaced cove campers, according to WATE-TV.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A contempt of court charge has been dropped against the Dallas County district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. Both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer Amber Guyger’s murder trial despite a gag order by Judge Tammy Kemp. The white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his own apartment. Kemp said in an order that the interview, in which Creuzot explained why he thought Guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a “direct violation” of the gag order she’d issued in the case.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Transportation has started making safety improvements near a homeless resource center where cars killed three men, officials said. The department has installed electronic message signs to urge drivers to be cautious and alert for pedestrians near the South Salt Lake center, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake City leaders called for immediate pedestrian safety improvements after three men were fatally struck while trying to cross the street near the center. Police believe all three men were homeless and seeking shelter at the center. Four crashes, including those involving the fatalities, have occurred in the area since the November opening of the 300-bed men’s resource center, police said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bakery is hosting a raffle to find the lucky person who gets to tear down a gingerbread village. In a first for Birchgrove Baking, the sweet treat establishment is selling customers tickets “for the chance to win the right to destroy the village.” Initially, after the holiday season was over, the bakery struggled to find a creative way to raze its gingerbread village. Birchgrove co-owner John Belding says the owners have in the past resorted to destroying it themselves, getting out their own tension from the hectic year. Sales from this year’s raffle will go toward the Central Vermont Humane Society, an ongoing collaborator with Birchgrove Baking. Winners will be announced Friday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: More people earned bachelor’s degrees in the state last year than ever before. Data from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia shows that a record number of degrees were awarded in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health fields. During the 2018-19 school year, public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,168 degrees and certificates – an increase of nearly 50% from a decade ago. In-state students accounted for 86,325, or more than 70%, of those awards. Bachelor’s degrees accounted for 46% of the total, while graduate degrees made up 25%. Associate degrees made up 16%, and certificates made up 13%. The three most popular bachelor’s degree programs remained unchanged from previous years: business administration and management; psychology; and biology/biological sciences. Those three majors accounted for 19% of all bachelor’s degrees.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Monday swore in a new chief justice, as well as its first-ever Native American justice. The Spokesman-Review reports Justice Debra Stephens became the court’s 57th chief justice. A former Appeals Court judge and adjunct professor of law at Gonzaga University, she called it “the greatest privilege I can imagine.” Raquel Montoya-Lewis, a former Whatcom County Superior Court judge who is a member of the Pueblo Iselta tribe of New Mexico, was sworn in at the same ceremony. Montoya-Lewis is the first Native American to serve on Washington’s highest court and only the second to serve on any state supreme court in the nation. Stephens called it a historic day. Gov. Jay Inslee said Monday was a day when “a daughter of Spokane ascends to chief justice,” and the court gets Lewis-Montoya, a “judicial superstar” who is a good listener, decisive, caring and compassionate.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Department of Natural Resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. A long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average “catchable” size of the fish, Jim Hedrick, the division’s hatchery supervisor, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. When the drought broke in October, the hatcheries’ water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. But winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, Hedrick said. The growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. The division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. Hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for January stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans decided Tuesday to place only President Donald Trump’s name on the state’s primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. A committee made up of Republicans and Democrats met with state election officials in the Capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the April 7 primary ballot. The Republican committee members submitted only Trump’s name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. The Democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. The Republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other GOP hopefuls such as former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh to get on the GOP primary ballot. They could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by Jan. 28.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A school district has paid off more than $4,000 in student lunch debt after a crowd-sourced check bounced. The Casper Police Department has opened an investigation into the “Feed Casper Students” fundraising campaign on GoFundMe aimed at paying off the Natrona County School District’s student lunch debt, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The district accepted about $19,000 in fundraising donations in April, the same month the check bounced, school officials said. The district paid off the lunch debt for about 250 students out of its general fund, rather than reopen the outstanding debt for the students, officials said. A school district administrator made several attempts to reach the woman who started the fundraiser, Brittny French, authorities said. Multiple attempts by the Star-Tribune to contact French were unsuccessful last week, including through GoFundMe. Police asked anyone who had donated to the campaign to get in touch with police.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/08"}]}

Officials recently delayed a resolution that would have asked Gov. Kay Ivey to commit state funds necessary to return Amtrak service to the region, Al.com reports. Ivey said last month that she needs more information. Council members say they want more time to consider information about fares, ridership and logistics. Mayor Sandy Stimpson expressed concern about trains potentially blocking access to the cruise-ship terminal. Councilman Joel Daves also questioned ridership interest. Amtrak suspended service east of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina caused heavy damage in 2005. Mississippi ($15 million) and Louisiana ($10 million) have already dedicated their portions for the project. Alabama’s share would be about $2.7 million or less, the news site reports.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Furlough notices are being sent to about 2,500 University of Alaska system staff following Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of $130 million in funding. University system President Jim Johnsen last week said the cut, if it stands, would be devastating. The veto is on top of a $5 million reduction authorized by lawmakers, and Johnsen says it follows a series of cuts in recent years. He has called on lawmakers to override the veto, which would require 45 of the Legislature’s 60 members. House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt, in a statement Friday, said if his 15-member caucus decides to revisit any of Dunleavy’s cuts, it wants to do so through a separate budget bill rather than an override. Democratic Rep. Adam Wool says he hopes “common sense” prevails and the cut is overridden.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday slammed Nike for canceling the release of a shoe featuring an early design of the American flag, saying the company had “bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism.” Calling Nike’s decision a “shameful retreat,” the Republican leader vowed on Twitter to withdraw millions in incentives recently promised to the company in exchange for opening a manufacturing plant in Goodyear with some 500 full-time jobs. Nike pulled the shoe, set to go on sale this week, after former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick told them he and others found the version of the flag depicted on the shoe offensive, according to The Wall Street Journal. Kaepernick argued the “Betsy Ross flag” was appropriated by extremist groups as a symbol of white nationalism, the Journal reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s attorney general is asking a federal judge for a hearing on whether to block three new abortion restrictions a day or two before they’re to take effect. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Monday asked for an extension to respond to a lawsuit filed by abortion providers against the new laws, one of which would ban the procedure 18 weeks into a woman’s pregnancy. The three laws are to take effect July 24. Rutledge asked that the state be given until July 22 to respond and that a hearing on the request to block the laws be scheduled for July 22 or 23. Rutledge said the state would suffer “severe prejudice” if it has to defend the laws on the current timetable.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Four new gray wolf pups have come out of their den at the Oakland Zoo. The pups were born May 13. This month the 6-week-old pups have started to explore the 2-acre habitat. Parents Siskiyou and Sequoia were born in captivity and brought to the zoo’s California Trail area in April 2018. Siskiyou is a first-time mom, and the zoo doesn’t plan to breed further. Wolves are reclusive creatures and take time to bond. Then they mate for life. Darren Minier, the zoo’s assistant director of animal care, conservation and research, says creating a wolf pack is essential to the wolves’ emotional health. Zoo workers will monitor the family to ensure it is thriving.\n\nColorado\n\nFrisco: Officials with the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area in central Colorado say it will be open for skiing on the Fourth of July for the first time since 2011. The resort has received nearly 7 feet of snow since March. Lower-than-average temperatures since then allowed enough snow to remain. Ski area spokeswoman Katherine Fuller says Independence Day will be the final day of the resort’s 2018-19 ski season. The area has been open for weekend skiing for several weeks, and two lifts will run from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Thursday. No beginner skiing is available. Arapahoe Basin stayed open until Aug. 10 during the 1994-95 ski season.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State environmental officials are asking beachgoers to stay at least 50 yards away from where large concentrations or birds are gathered and avoid areas roped off as designated nesting locations. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is making the request as people visit Connecticut’s shoreline around the Fourth of July. Jenny Dickson, DEEP’s wildlife division director, says shorebirds and wading birds need special protection throughout the April-to-September nesting season. She advises beachgoers to keep fireworks and kites, especially kites that make noise, away from beach areas. Piping plovers, least terns, American oystercatchers, herons and egrets are particularly vulnerable. DEEP is also urging people to keep their pets leashed at all times and away from fenced areas, noting that dogs are prohibited on some beaches during the summer season.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A bill passed by the state House requires all restaurants to offer a healthy beverage as the first option in any kids meals. That means no more washing down Happy Meals with soda, at least not as a first option. Parents will have the option to substitute sugar-laden drinks if the eatery offers them. Many restaurants would be allowed to offer as a first choice water; sparkling water or flavored water without added sugar, corn syrup or artificial sweeteners; flavored or unflavored whole milk; nonfat or low-fat dairy milk, or a dairy substitute; 100% fruit or vegetable juice, or a combination of the two; or fruit or vegetable juice combined with water or carbonated water, without added sugars or sweeteners. What is different about Delaware’s push for healthier beverages is that it cannot be viewed as a money grab, as in places where a soda tax was levied.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Maryland’s transportation secretary says the state will withhold about $55.6 million in capital funds from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority due to a lack of transparency about how state money is being used. Pete Rahn wrote a letter Monday to WMATA board members and the CEO, saying it’s a necessary step “in response to an ongoing pattern of fiscal obfuscation and a lack of cooperation from WMATA.” A 2016 Maryland legislative audit recommended that Maryland create a process to verify that WMATA’s annual operating and capital grant subsidies are properly calculated. But Rahn writes that WMATA was unwilling to comply with these audits and refused to provide data requested for auditing its fiscal year 2017 capital program.\n\nFlorida\n\nSuwannee Springs: The Air Force says it’s investigating after a fighter jet struck a bird and dropped three dummy bombs used for training over northern Florida. Moody Air Force Base in central Georgia said in a news release that there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage after the 25-pound, nonexplosive training munitions were dropped Monday afternoon by an A-10C Thunderbolt II jet. The base said a “bird strike” had caused “an inadvertent release” of the three dummy bombs. The Air Force said it didn’t know where the training bombs landed, but the suspected area was about 54 miles south of Moody Air Force Base, near Suwannee Springs. The Air Force said the dummy bombs, though inert, contain small pyrotechnic charges and should not be handled.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city council has approved a far-reaching ban on smoking and vaping in restaurants and bars – and inside one of the world’s busiest airports. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that city council members approved the ban Monday. It covers cigarettes, cigars and electronic cigarettes. If signed by the mayor, it would take effect Jan. 2, 2020. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is one of the few major U.S. hubs where people can still smoke inside designated rooms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a 2017 report that most busy U.S. airports ban smoking in all indoor areas. Denver International Airport last year closed the last of its indoor smoking lounges and is now smoke-free indoors.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A Dutch video game designer and entrepreneur has established a laboratory on the Big Island that is focused on developing alternatives to fossil fuels for energy, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Henk Rogers established the lab to test and develop renewable energy systems that he hopes will make the state’s energy use 100% renewable by 2045, ending its reliance on fossil fuels that Rogers says is adding acid to the ocean and killing the coral reef, the newspaper reports. The laboratory, on a ranch, is focused on the use of hydrogen to create energy, aiming to use hydrogen energy cells to store the energy harnessed by the solar panels in order to power the community water system, create jobs and cook food, the Tribune-Herald reports. One of Rogers’ software companies has the intellectual property rights to Tetris, according to his Blue Planet Foundation’s website.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: The state’s Latino student population is growing, while the number of Latino or nonwhite teachers remains stagnant. The Idaho Press-Tribune reports that in the state’s 10 school districts with the highest percentage of Latino students, 90% of teachers are white. Officials say Latino students are the largest minority group in Idaho public schools, including several schools and a few school districts where there is a Latino student majority. Officials say the high concentrations of Latino students occur in rural areas across southern Idaho where jobs on farms and dairies have drawn Latinos for generations. Many of those with the highest percentage of Latino students are elementary schools. An official in a district with a high Latino population says recruiting and retaining teachers is difficult when other areas offer higher pay.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Implementation of a new rule requiring the city’s police officers to report every time they point a gun at a person is being delayed. The rule that is included in a consent decree in which the city agreed to implement dozens of reforms at the beleaguered police department was to have gone into effect Monday, but a spokesman says a new implementation date will be announced “in the near future.” Spokesman Luis Agostini said in an email that more time is needed to review feedback from the consent decree Independent Monitoring Team and the Illinois Attorney General’s office about the new policy. Under the policy, officers must notify the city’s Office of Emergency Management whenever they point a gun at someone.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Duke Energy is asking to hike residential electricity bills by about $23 a month, its first such appeal to state regulators in nearly two decades. The largest electric utility in the state filed its request with the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission on Tuesday asking to increase its annual revenue by roughly $395 million. The proposed rate increase is driven by investments to serve a growing customer base, generate cleaner electricity and improve the reliability of electric service, according to Duke’s petition. Kerwin Olson, director of local customer advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition, says the request is the largest increase he has seen among the state’s five investor-owned utilities. He said the utility already charges customers for things like grid modernization and expanding its system through expenses tacked onto the bill, and the hike also does not include building new renewable energy projects.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Zebras are back by popular demand at Blank Park Zoo for the first time since 2011. Two mountain zebras, named Duke and Duchess, have been getting acclimated to their habitat for several months, the zoo announced Tuesday. The animals are 3 and 4 years old. “Zebras are one of the top requests guests have asked me to bring to Blank Park Zoo,” CEO Mark Vukovich said in a statement. Like the zoo’s family of rhinos, the pair of zebras will be part of Species Survival Program. There are just 35,000 mountain zebras left in the wild, Vukovich said. Native to mountainous regions of Namibia, Angola and South Africa, the population is threatened by habitat loss, hunting and drought. Duke and Duchess are currently sharing their space with two ostriches part-time, the zoo says.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Two state lawmakers are encouraging teachers to incorporate culturally relevant studies into their lesson plans. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Democratic Reps. John Alcala and Valdenia Winn have spearheaded the Kansas Culturally Relevant Pedagogy Summer Intensive program, which is in its second year. Alcala helped create the initiative after noticing a lack of representation of various ethnic groups in history textbooks. The four-week-long program teaches Kansas educators about culturally relevant pedagogy, including Native American, Chicano/Latino, African American and Asian American studies. Teachers then implement the lessons in their classrooms and share with program directors what did and didn’t work. Alcala says all teachers who participate will be certified in culturally relevant pedagogy upon completion of the program.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The U.S. Postal Service has suspended mail delivery to a street that has a history of dog attacks. Postal Service spokeswoman Susan Wright says dog attacks have been a problem on Girard Drive for a long time, and the issue is only getting worse. She says a mail carrier recently dodged three loose dogs on the street near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Residents are being asked to pick up their mail from a nearby post office. Wright says the service is working with dog owners to restore delivery. She didn’t say when delivery is expected to resume. The service says mail carriers across the country suffered more than 5,700 dog attacks last year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Essence Festival, which draws thousands to the city the week of the Fourth of July, is celebrating 25 years of bringing African American women of all ages together for thought-provoking conversation and performances from top musical acts. Launched to mark the 25th anniversary of black-owned Essence magazine, the festival has become a yearly celebration to highlight excellence in business, fashion, entertainment and, of course, music. It is a destination vacation for African American women, as showcased in the 2017 hit movie “Girls Trip.” The festival Friday through Sunday has two parts: daytime activities and panel discussions mainly held at the convention center, and nighttime music and concerts at the Superdome. Mary J. Blige and Missy Elliott are among this year’s top-billed musical performers.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Baby lobsters are continuing to appear in high numbers off some parts of Canada while dwindling off New England, raising questions about what the valuable shellfish’s population will look like in several years. University of Maine scientist Rick Wahle has documented trends in baby lobster density for years and released new data for 2018 last month. Wahle says his new data reinforces recent trends about lobsters that show major upticks off sites in Atlantic Canada, such as areas in Nova Scotia. Meanwhile, the Gulf of Maine reported below-average numbers from Bar Harbor to Cape Cod. New England’s commercial harvest of lobster has been strong in recent years, but it’s dependent on young lobsters growing to maturity. Some sites, such as those off Rhode Island, show few baby lobsters at all.\n\nMaryland\n\nGermantown: A company that produces electronics for the aerospace and defense industry is planning a new headquarters in the state. Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration made the announcement Tuesday that RADA Technologies is planning the new headquarters in Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation’s capital. The administration says the company will relocate to a 25,000-square-foot facility by the end of this year. Because of the expansion, the company plans to create 50 full-time jobs over the next two years and a total of 80 new jobs by December 2023. RADA Technologies is the American subsidiary of Israel-based RADA Electronic Industries. The subsidiary has been operating for about a year in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Hogan administration says RADA will invest nearly $4 million into the expansion.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: History-minded revelers can celebrate the Fourth of July by checking out an original copy of the Declaration of Independence at the state’s Commonwealth Museum. The document was one of 14 original copies and was sent by the Continental Congress to Massachusetts during the Revolutionary War. The copy was printed in the shop of Mary Katherine Goddard and bears the signature of Massachusetts’ own John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress. Other items include letters from John Hancock announcing the Declaration of Independence and an account book from the War of 1812 with one of the earliest written references to the phrase “Uncle Sam.” Thousands have visited the museum, located in the Dorchester neighborhood, on July Fourth in recent years to view the document.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Helping endangered wildlife is now as easy as sipping beer. The Detroit Zoological Society and Birmingham-based Griffin Claw Brewing Co. have announced the release of Piping Plover Pilsner, a special brew named for an endangered shorebird that nests along the Great Lakes. A portion of the proceeds from sales will go toward supporting the zoological society’s wildlife conservation work. The limited-edition beer is available for purchase starting this week in four-packs of 16-ounce cans at Griffin Claw and select grocery stores in the metro area. Piping Plover Pilsner is the first in a series of four special brews Griffin Claw plans to release under the Survival Series label. Brews highlighting the society’s work to help Grauer’s gorillas, Panamanian golden frogs and Partula snails are also on tap.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Statistics released by the state Department of Health show 9,910 abortions were performed in Minnesota in 2018, a 2% decrease from the year before. While the overall numbers declined, the number of people who traveled to Minnesota for an abortion increased by 8% over 2017, with the bulk of out-of-state residents traveling from Wisconsin. The statistics released Monday also show that fewer teenagers and women under 20 received abortions in 2018. That number was 809, down from 841 a year before. The vast majority of abortions were performed in a woman’s first trimester.\n\nMississippi\n\nWoodville: A museum in southwestern Mississippi has opened a new exhibit of artifacts found near two Native American mounds in the area. The Natchez Democrat reports the items are now on display at the Wilkinson County Museum in downtown Woodville. Exhibit curator Megan Kassabaum, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, says the display has been in development since last year, when she and her students did excavation projects at the Lessley and Smith Creek mound sites west of Woodville. The exhibit includes three glass cases that showcase Native American artifacts such as jewelry, spearheads and arrowheads, cooking tools and utensils, and pieces of pottery, as well as two handmade replica pots.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A man who was unable to finish high school but went on to serve as crew chief for the famed Tuskegee Airman has received an honorary diploma nearly 80 years after leaving high school. The Jefferson City News-Tribune reports that James Shipley got the diploma in a Sunday ceremony. Military historian Jeremy Amick says Shipley didn’t have a chance to earn his diploma years ago. He attended an all-black high school that wasn’t credentialed through 12th grade. Shipley would have had to travel to Sedalia for his final year, and he didn’t have the resources to do so. The Tuskegee Airmen were black military pilots and crew who made up the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Native Americans in the state are rallying behind a family who say a federal investigation into the shooting death of their relative by a white man 14 years ago was tainted by discrimination. The 10-year-old civil lawsuit questioning the FBI investigation into Steven Bearcrane’s death is getting renewed attention amid increasing national awareness of unsolved cases involving missing and murdered Native Americans. Dozens of people from across the state filled a courtroom Tuesday as the attorney for Bearcrane’s parents and daughter said the 2004 death illustrates how the FBI provides fewer law enforcement services for Native Americans compared to the rest of the population. Bearcrane was shot by Bobby Holcomb on a ranch on the Crow Indian Reservation. The FBI investigation concluded the shooting was self-defense, and prosecutors declined to charge Holcomb.\n\nNebraska\n\nFremont: University of Nebraska students are beginning to work in several communities through a new summer service program created in the wake of this year’s devastating flooding. The program projects include documenting flood damage to roads and bridges, organizing a thank-you event for volunteers who cleaned up a local fairground, and developing multilingual disaster recovery materials to help with landscape design and GPS mapping. The Fremont Tribune reports that 24 students representing the Kearney, Lincoln and Omaha campuses are helping 14 communities, with more students being placed as the university matches students’ skills with local needs.\n\nNevada\n\nNorth Las Vegas: The state has restored voting rights to ex-felons, putting it in line with at least a dozen other states that automatically grant voting rights to people once they are released from prison. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said at a news conference Monday in Las Vegas that voting is an important part of reintegrating into the community and that his office would work to spread the word about the new law. The change moves Nevada away from a more complex system in which an ex-felon’s right to vote depended on their crime, completion of probation or parole, the year they were convicted, and whether a judge approved giving them back the right to vote. Supporters of the law estimate about 77,000 ex-felons in Nevada will regain the right to vote under the change.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLaconia: Officials say a 36-foot red oak sculpture of a Native American man called “The Defiant One” that had rotted through was removed. The Laconia Daily Sun reports the statue was dedicated in 1984 in Opechee Park. The sculpture was brought down by a backhoe Monday before it fell over on its own. Laconia Public Works Director Wes Anderson said when the sculpture came down, small pieces of wood and dust were everywhere, and “there was nothing you could recognize.” There’s an effort to replace the statue with one made out of a fiber filament. A 3D printer will use a laser scan to produce a new statue. Peter Toth, a Hungarian-born artist, created the wooden sculpture and others throughout the country to honor Native American people.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: The state has expanded its medical marijuana program – including increasing the number of illnesses eligible for cannabis use, boosting the amount that can be dispensed and raising the number of cultivator permits – under a broad new law. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act on Tuesday, alongside the parents and sister of the bill’s namesake, a 7-year-old who died last year after battling brain cancer. His parents have fought for easier access to cannabis to ease pain during illnesses. Among other changes, the measure allows for home delivery to patients. Illnesses now covered include seizure disorder, intractable skeletal muscular spasticity, post-traumatic stress disorder, glaucoma, cancer, chronic pain and opioid-use disorder. The law permits physician assistants and advanced practice nurses to authorize medical cannabis.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest electric utility on Monday submitted to regulators its plan for shutting down the coal-fired San Juan Generating Station, replacing the lost power and pricing the cost to customers. The filing with the Public Regulation Commission comes as a new state law dictates more aggressive renewable energy requirements while allowing Public Service Co. of New Mexico to recoup from customers some of the expenses. The costs range from nearly $4.7 billion to more than $5.4 billion, but utility executives say residential customers would end up saving about $7 a month in the first year after the plant closes under its preferred proposal. That option includes a mix of natural gas-fired power plants, solar and wind farms, and new battery storage facilities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An immigrant naturalization ceremony has been held at the Sept.11 memorial for the first time. The ceremony Tuesday saw 52 new U.S. citizens pledge allegiance to the nation at the ground zero museum, which opened in 2014. Alice M. Greenwald, president of the museum, says the location was symbolic because so many people who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001, were immigrants, hailing from 90 different countries. The acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, administered the Oath of Allegiance and welcomed the new citizens. “We are stronger today because of naturalized citizens like all of you who followed the rules, upheld our laws and chose to make a permanent commitment to the United States,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: It’s not every day you can see the state’s copy of the Bill of Rights, but the original copy is on display to visitors at the North Carolina Museum of History through Sunday, including on Independence Day. Each of the 13 original states received a copy of what were initially 12 amendments to the Constitution, signed by then-Vice President John Adams. Ten amendments were soon ratified. Historians say the copy was stolen from the old Capitol building in 1865 by a Union soldier. The document wasn’t recovered until 2003, during an FBI sting operation involving an antiques dealer. The copy is on display from time to time. It otherwise sits in one of two vaults in the State Archives.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Three Affiliated Tribes have been granted trust status for the historic Figure Four Ranch. The tribes bought the roughly 9,300-acre ranch that borders the reservation’s west side between Lake Sakakawea and the Little Missouri River in 1999 and converted it to a bison ranch. They requested trust status nearly a decade ago, a move that would make the land tax-exempt. The Bismarck Tribune reports it wasn’t approved until May, with a deed-signing ceremony this week. The federal government attributed the delay to red tape. Chairman Mark Fox said the change will allow the tribes to move ahead with energy development. Tribal officials also hope to develop tourism at the ranch, with expanded buffalo and elk hunting and the possible building of a hotel or resort.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A ceremony marking the 125th anniversary of a Civil War monument in the city is set for Thursday. The Cuyahoga County Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument honoring the county’s citizens who fought and worked for the Union was dedicated July 4, 1894. The anniversary celebration is set for noon at the monument on Public Square. Major General John C. Harris Jr., adjutant general of the Ohio Army National Guard, will give the keynote speech. The Monument Commission recently announced the addition of 107 names of veterans of the United States Colored Troops to 9,000 names already on the monument’s Roll of Honor. All 107 were enlisted or appointed from Cuyahoga County. In case of rain, Thursday’s ceremony will be held at the nearby Old Stone Church.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Officials say the number of structurally deficient bridges in the state has dropped from about 1,170 in 2004 to 132. Transportation Secretary Tim Gatz told a state transportation panel Monday that Oklahoma now ranks 13th in the U.S. for fewest deficient bridges in its highway system. About 6,800 bridges are part of Oklahoma’s system, a number that doesn’t include other spans operated by local entities such as city and county governments. Gatz says the state Department of Transportation began setting more money aside in 2006 for bridge repairs, and lawmakers provided additional funding a few years later. He says a finding that a bridge is deficient doesn’t necessarily mean it’s dangerous for motorists to cross. It’s an indication that some part of the bridge, such as the driving surface, needs improvements.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has approved a pioneering measure to increase the supply of affordable housing. The Senate voted 17-9 Sunday to send the governor a plan to ease local zoning laws. Cities with more than 10,000 people must allow for the construction of less expensive housing options like duplexes, triplexes and townhomes. The measure doesn’t require that these types of housing units actually be built. Rather, it lifts local bans on these denser housing options, paving the way for possible future development. The city of Minneapolis approved a similar measure last year. The move responds to a statewide affordable housing crisis that touches every part of the state. The governor earlier this year approved the first statewide rent control law in the nation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Patti LaBelle now has her very own street in her hometown of Philadelphia, and the legendary soul singer has christened it with a song. A stretch of Broad Street was renamed “Patti LaBelle Way” during a ceremony Tuesday. “The Godmother of Soul” thanked the throngs of fans who clogged the intersection and treated them to an impromptu rendition of her hit “Love, Need and Want You.” Brandishing one of the new street signs, she told onlookers she felt blessed and spoke about how her parents used to walk along this stretch of road. “Lady Marmalade” was LaBelle’s first No. 1 hit when she was the lead singer of LaBelle. She also had a successful solo career with hits like “You Are My Friend” and “New Attitude.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Sen. Jack Reed says the state’s health department will receive $11.3 million in federal funding over five years for immunization and vaccine programs for children. The Rhode Island Democrat says the state should expect to get nearly $2.3 million of that funding this year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Reed says the federal money will be used to improve immunization levels and help eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases among children. The funding can be used for health care providers to vaccinate uninsured children, underinsured children and children on Medicaid at no cost to their family. Reed says Rhode Island isn’t immune from the threat of a measles outbreak, but its high vaccination rate of young people is the best line of defense.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Supporters of the Confederate flag will be a few days late this year in marking the anniversary of the banner’s removal from the Statehouse grounds. A group called Flags Across the South has a permit for a rally outside the Capitol on July 13 and plans to fly the Confederate flag from a temporary flagpole from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., says Braxton Spivey, the group’s chairman. The event will be held three days after the fourth anniversary of the date state officials removed the banner from outside the Statehouse after a racially motivated attack at a historically black church in Charleston. The past three years, the South Carolina Secessionist Party raised the Confederate flag each July 10, but the group has since splintered, The State newspaper reports, and a group called Showing Up for Racial Justice Columbia reserved the spot this year, blocking any others from flying the rebel banner.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state’s first case of West Nile virus this year has been confirmed in Turner County, according to a Health Department news release. The person is in the 30-39 age group. West Nile is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause fever and sometimes fatal illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The West Nile season runs from summer through the fall, according to the CDC. Joshua Clayton, an epidemiologist with the South Dakota Health Department, said the state normally has more confirmed cases of West Nile than any other state and warned people to protect themselves, especially at night, “such as Fourth of July fireworks shows.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Grammy winner Kacey Musgraves hadn’t taken much time to reflect on her career until she saw it chronicled behind museum glass. The country singer is the subject of a new exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum that opened Tuesday and runs through June 2020. Her critically acclaimed record “Golden Hour” earned four Grammys this year, including album of the year. Musgraves said it was a funny conundrum to win that award when many people didn’t know her music. The 30-year-old has become a cross-genre star whose emotional, clever lyrics and inventive style blending country with electronic, disco and spacey pop sounds has earned her plenty of new fans. Musgraves says the exhibit hit her “in an emotional way.” “Kacey Musgraves: All of the Colors” includes photos, song lyrics and fashions.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Public visits to the 107-year-old Battleship Texas near Houston will be limited during cataloging of thousands of artifacts aboard amid plans for $35 million in ship repairs. The Texas Parks & Wildlife Department announced last week that starting July 8, the vessel at the Battleship Texas State Historic Site in La Porte will close to visitors Monday through Thursday. The ship will be open Friday through Sunday. Anyone already holding July and August reservations can visit as scheduled. Department spokesman Stephanie Garcia says artifacts on board must be taken care of, for storage, before the ship goes into dry dock to fix the leaking hull. The Battleship Texas Foundation said in May that the ship will get a new home following repairs. No new location has been announced.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: LGBTQ groups have been quietly accepted into a prominent July Fourth festival in this conservative city after being denied for years. The Daily Herald in Provo reports that five such groups marched in the America’s Freedom Festival parade last year, but only after an initial refusal and high-profile dispute. County officials threatened to pull $100,000 in taxpayer money from the privately organized event until the groups were allowed to participate. One was Utah County Commissioner Nathan Ivie, who recently came out as gay. This year, all four groups that applied were accepted to march in parade festivities. Freedom Festival Executive Director Paul Warner says the process was smooth. Actor Chuck Norris is a parade grand marshal along with Jennie Taylor, whose husband, Maj. Brent Taylor, was killed while deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nVermont\n\nShelburne: A simple change to a farmer’s hay cutting schedule could be the key to saving families of birds from extinction. Researchers are working with landowners in the state to preserve some of the last vital habitats available for grassland birds, like the bobolink, Savannah sparrow and meadowlark. Armed with data that shows an early hay cut can help the birds more successfully reproduce, places like Shelburne Farms are managing prime bird habitat to protect the species while also producing feed for their cows. Noah Perlut, associate professor and chairman of the Environmental Studies program at the University of New England, has studied these grassland birds for the last 18 years. While working for the University of Vermont, he made a groundbreaking discovery: If farmers cut hay early and wait 65 days before a second cut, the birds have enough time to breed and raise their young.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The city will no longer celebrate Thomas Jefferson’s birthday as an official holiday and instead will observe a day recognizing the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. The City Council voted Monday night to scrap the decades-old April 13 holiday honoring the slave-holding president and Founding Father. Charlottesville will now mark Liberation and Freedom Day on March 3, the day U.S. Army forces arrived in the city in 1865. Charlottesville has been grappling publicly for years with how to tell its history of race and discrimination. Those efforts intensified after white nationalists gathered in the city in 2017 for a rally that descended into deadly violence. The legacy of Jefferson, the nation’s third president, author of the Declaration of Independence and founder of the University of Virginia, has been a component of that ongoing debate.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Most of the 222 school buildings that officials examined across the state would be unsafe to occupy after powerful earthquakes. The Seattle Times reports that assessments by the Washington Department of Natural Resources found about a quarter of the schools would not be able to be repaired, and 43% posed a high or very high risk for loss of life from quakes. Department Chief Hazard Geologist Corina Forson says the buildings selected for assessment make up a “representative, meaningful sample” of the state’s 4,444 permanent school buildings. Officials determined that the most vulnerable buildings are the older ones and those built from unreinforced masonry or under-reinforced concrete. Forson says the department plans to examine 350 more schools.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nElkins: West Virginia University Extension Service faculty and staff are working with students at six elementary schools to plant edible landscaping that will provide fresh food for the students. Extension Service Family Nutrition Program youth health educator Tracey Valach found out one of the schools was planning new landscaping and suggested the school choose fruit-bearing plants. Valach worked with Extension Service agents Hannah Fincham and Jody Carpenter to choose the plants. With crowdfunding and community support, they purchased blueberry bushes and apple trees for each school. The students learned how to choose the best location for the plants. Valach says the students will be involved with harvest and other activities with the fruit, including hands-on cooking classes and taste testing. Some of the fruit will also go to the salad bar or be used in cafeteria meals.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: A man has been sentenced to 150 days in jail for repeatedly clogging women’s toilets, including at places he worked. Patrick Beeman, 35, pleaded no contest to five counts of misdemeanor criminal damage to property. The state recommended a 30-day sentence for the crime, but Sheboygan Press Media reports that Judge Kent Hoffmann on Monday gave Beeman 30 days for each count, to be served consecutively. The Sheboygan man also was ordered to serve three years of probation and pay $5,500 in restitution. Prosecutors say Beeman told police he gets urges to do odd things, like look for bottles in the garbage to clog toilets and cause them to overflow. Police found a toilet in the women’s bathroom at Deland Community Center clogged by a plastic bottle last March, an incident similar to 10 others beginning in 2017.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: A museum devoted to guns is reopening after a major renovation. Admission to the Cody Firearms Museum will be free Saturday night following the renovation, which cost $12 million. The Billings Gazette reports a large part of a new addition at the museum is dedicated to firearm education and safety. Visitors can practice on four simulators, one each for a handgun, M2 machine gun, long-range rifle and shotgun. The museum also has displays on rifling, gun barrel design and ballistics, where visitors can try to line up rifling marks with the images of fired bullets like a ballistics expert. Other displays cover the evolution of firearms and military history.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/greenville/2018/06/03/greenville-county-911-call-center/611624002/", "title": "Sheriff: Upgrades needed for understaffed Greenville County 911 ...", "text": "When you call 911 in Greenville County, routinely the dispatcher who answers must make a quick and potentially life-threatening decision: Answer your call for emergency assistance or help a sheriff's deputy with information about someone speeding.\n\n\"Potentially, you could be choosing between a caller who has a baby choking versus a deputy who has a traffic stop. I don't think I should ever be choosing which one to listen to,\" said Stormie Satterfield, a dispatcher at the Greenville County Sheriff's Office 911 center. \"As somebody calling in as a Greenville County citizen, I would feel very discouraged to ever call back.\"\n\nAnd when things are working properly, dispatchers can actually hear the deputy or you on the other end, but not always.\n\nMore:Johnny Mack Brown addresses low morale amid Will Lewis investigation\n\nIt's a scenario that plays out every day at the center that is the first response for the roughly 500,000 people in Greenville County who at any moment, could need emergency assistance. The 911 center is fraught with problems, from a severe shortage of staffers to old and faulty equipment unable to handle the area's growing population.\n\nInterim Sheriff Johnny Mack Brown is shining light on the dire need for improvements to the center since taking office in April. He has suggested hiring a temp agency to help fill gaps in coverage.\n\nAnd with Greenville County's budget approval for six new call-taker positions to open up this July, adding to the 12 positions that are already vacant, the openings show how deficiencies have kept the center from growing.\n\nThe staff shortage is a longstanding problem, according to the center's director, David Deitz. He said high stress, training standards and long hours paired with outdated equipment has left the center struggling to retain staff. Out of the 42 call-taker positions, 12 are vacant. Soon there will be 18 vacancies when the six added positions open up.\n\nCounty Administrator Joe Kernell called the staffing problem \"growing pains\" since new positions are opening up. But Deitz said it's a constant struggle to get them filled. Finding qualified candidates with the right set of skills is a challenge, he said.\n\nAbout 10 staffers work the center during any 12-hour shift. Based on the county's population size, Deitz said there should be at least 17 working at any given time.\n\nAbandoned calls\n\nNational standards urge call centers to answer 911 calls within 10 seconds 90 percent of the time, according to the National Emergency Number Association. Greenville County's call center doesn't meet the standard. Only about 83 percent of calls are answered within 10 seconds, according to the center.\n\nSome 911 callers end up hanging up, so dispatchers have to call them back to inquire about the emergency, said Satterfield, who has been a dispatcher there for five years.\n\nSo far this year, 7,114 calls were considered abandoned, meaning the caller hangs up before their call is answered. There are about 1,300 abandoned calls per month, according to the call center.\n\nThere's no national standard for abandoned calls since there are too many factors that play into when and why a call is dropped, according to the National Emergency Number Association.\n\n\"The inherent challenge is why there are abandonments,\" said Christopher Carver, director of 911/PSAP operations for the association, which is based in Virginia. \"Is it because it is taking too long for a center to answer calls or is it because of an abnormally large number of “'short-calls' or mis-dials — where a caller 'butt-dials' and hangs up prior to the call being answered?\"\n\nSatterfield said the call volume often outpaces the ability for the smaller staff to field calls quickly.\n\n\"It happens a lot,\" she said. \"We try to answer them within the first 10 seconds, but there's just not enough people in here to do that. And when you do answer a call you're constantly having to tell people to hold on.\"\n\nSince the 911 center for the Sheriff's Office is considered a primary public safety answering point, or PSAP, they field all 911 calls placed in the county unless its within another municipality. The call center processes about 700,000 calls per year. As of late May, the center had processed 227,685 calls. About 1,200 calls are handled each 12-hour shift.\n\nBrown, who was named interim sheriff in April after suspended Sheriff Will Lewis was indicted in charges of obstruction of justice and misconduct in office, addressed the Greenville County Council for the first time in May. The center's concerns were a main focus and within that, manpower was the priority.\n\nMore:Who is interim Greenville County Sheriff Johnny Mack Brown?\n\nCarver, of the National Emergency Number Association, said staffing is a problem nationally. He said centers need to look to successful centers to see that efforts like recruitment and social media campaigns are crucial.\n\n\"For one, it's an incredibly high stress job. And two, there's a relatively small pool of people that enjoy the job and who are successful at the job,\" Carver said. \"911 is one of the top three brands in the world and yet not everybody is aware of the system behind it. A lot of times people don't know of the job that exists.\"\n\n'Not the kind of experience I expected'\n\nGreenville County resident Heather Brown said she's experienced problems in the two times she's called 911 in the past year and a half. The first time it was to report a car that had driven into a ditch on Interstate 385.\n\n\"It rang a few times before someone picked up,\" Brown said. \"I explained the issue and they said hold on they had to transfer me. Then it rang and rang and someone else picked up, I explained, and they said I’d need to speak to Highway Patrol. So they transferred me. And that rang and rang and rang. I honestly didn’t think anyone would pick up.\"\n\nShe described her interactions with call-takers as \"rude\" and \"dismissive.\"\n\n\"The long waits between transfers is also pretty scary if there was a personal emergency,\" she said. \"It’s not the kind of experience I expected, that’s for sure. I was made to feel like maybe I had done something wrong. And it makes me scared to call if I have a medical issue.\n\n\"What if I pass out before that transfer is complete or before anyone picks up. I’m on a cell phone, so would they be able to find me? It’s very scary.\"\n\nThe majority of cell phone calls to 911 automatically alert the call center to the cell phone's location through GPS.\n\nAnother woman said she called 911 to report a domestic disturbance and did not get the response she was expecting.\n\nMore:Interim Greenville sheriff promises to open up books, get more deputies on the road\n\n\"I stayed on the line for almost two minutes and no answer,\" said Lynn Sarmento, of Greenville. \"The guy ran off and as did the girl. I hung up, and got a nasty call back from a 911 operator. I know they are short-staffed and have to do those call-backs so I was expecting it, but she was incredibly rude and unhelpful.\"\n\nUpgrades coming\n\nKernell, the county administrator, said the newly approved positions will improve customer service if they can be filled. Additionally, the county has already approved funding for a $5.5 million upgrade to the center's computer-aided dispatch system as well as an upgrade to the county's radio equipment, both of which he said will make communications more efficient and effective.\n\nThe new computer system puts more call information in front of a dispatcher, making it easier to see things like addresses, traffic patterns and where nearby responders and are to see who is handling which call. The radio upgrade to an 800 MHz system will allow different agencies to communicate using the same frequency. Both upgrades are expected to be completed this fall.\n\nAs it stands now, Brown describes the call center as \"a dungeon.\" The lights are dim, equipment appears outdated and a smattering of empty seats is a telling image of the immediate need: manpower.\n\nAll new communications employees hired as either call-takers or dispatchers must complete a two-week course through the S.C. Criminal Justice Academy. Dispatchers focus on handling communications for deputies and have more responsibilities while call-takers solely answer 911 calls, but because of the shortage, dispatchers are having to multi-task.\n\nA formula used by call centers to determine ideal staff sizes is calculated by call volume. When calculated eight years ago, 17 people should be working per shift. At the time, only eight or nine were working a shift at the call center, Deitz said. The county has grown since then.\n\nAs a stopgap, the Sheriff's Office is in talks with a private contractor to bring on part-time call-takers to help alleviate the call volume, Brown said.\n\nBrown said he also wants to upgrade the call center's equipment, replace outdated furniture, get new carpeting and spruce up the center's break room to make the job more appealing and provide better service.\n\nBrown did not yet have a specific cost or timeline for those upgrades.\n\nDeitz was promoted to the director of communications for the call center when Lewis took office in 2017. He has been with the call center for 19 years and said many of the desk features typically designed for dispatcher work stations are so old they are malfunctioning, presenting health concerns to the staff.\n\nSatterfield, 26, described the work environment as old and dirty with no circulation and broken equipment, with calls often being hard to hear.\n\nBecause the center is directly below the Greenville County jail, they often hear banging on metal from cells above and occasionally have water leaks from inmates clogging toilets, Deitz said. It is not clear whether the difficulty in hearing calls is a matter of cell phone reception on the other end of the call or something wrong with the call center's equipment, he said.\n\n\"Sometimes callers are fine, sometimes they're not,\" he said. \"We don't know if it’s on our side or their side.\"\n\nNevertheless, it's a problem, he said.\n\n\"That's one of the biggest things. And then when you've asked for it to get fixed, it's always a problem that it's unfixable,\" Satterfield said. \"I feel like we're pushed to the back burner a lot, and that's very discouraging, that's what will make you want to leave.\"\n\nDeitz said the shortage in Greenville County is felt elsewhere across the U.S. He said many government agencies, including in law enforcement, are struggling to retain full staff.\n\n\"It's one of those things where the government does stuff to keep up with what’s needed at that the time but doesn't plan for the future,\" Deitz said. \"And by the time the future gets here, we're already behind.\"\n\nIf more people worked there, dispatchers could focus solely on helping deputies on calls while call-takers handle all 911 calls and dedicate full attention to those. As it stands, dispatchers are \"doing a million things at once,\" Deitz said.\n\nThe short staff is problematic, Brown said, referring to the call center as \"the nerve center.\"\n\n\"It's the first opportunity for someone to make an opinion about the Sheriff's Office,\" Brown said.\n\nA dispatcher's shift is more demanding when they are fielding a high volume of calls that should instead be dispersed into a larger pool of call-takers.\n\n\"We have got to make sure we have the correct number of people on a shift so that they don't have to run through calls and can spend more time on each call,\" Brown said. \"Everything comes down to manpower.\"\n\n'I love what I do'\n\nStarting pay for call-takers is about $15.49 per hour, which goes up to $16.11 after completing training.\n\nDeitz said turnover is not frequent but added that some staff members do not stay long.\n\n\"The industry average is three to four years to stay in that role,\" he said. \"Basically due to the job and stress level from the job, people come and go from it.\"\n\nSatterfield said she hopes the renewed emphasis on dispatchers can lead to positive changes, a larger staff and more call-takers sticking around longer.\n\nDeitz said the work of a dispatcher is invaluable so there should be more commitment to improving working conditions.\n\n\"We are the first first responders,\" he said. \"We are the first person that hears of everything going on in Greenville County. We take what we’re hearing over the phone and we’re putting in a call and trying to create visual image of what these deputies and first responders are responding to. Nobody realizes what we do.\"\n\nCarver said a 911 center is one of the most critical pieces of public safety that is “not something you can screw around with.”\n\n“The reality is this, no matter how many firefighters, no matter how many EMTs, no matter how many police officers you have, if a call to 911 that indicates a need for those resources is not answered in a timely manner and not dispatched in an appropriate manner, the response times are far longer are you’re you’re going to have serious operational impacts.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/954703/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-crisis-in-general-practice", "title": "Everything you need to know about the crisis in general practice ...", "text": "Why the frustration? Because many people are struggling to see their GPs. Patients complain they are being left waiting weeks for in-person consultations; a petition to “restart face-to-face appointments” attracted over half a million signatures.\n\nAfter months of negative headlines, the Health Secretary Sajid Javid last month published a plan demanding improved patient access. He promised £250m in extra winter funding for GPs in England. However, doctors will be eligible for a share of the money only if they offered a certain proportion of face-to-face appointments; league tables will be published ranking them on this basis.\n\nThe plans went down well with campaigning newspapers – but were met with fury by GPs and unions, which said they scapegoated doctors and didn’t address underlying problems. The British Medical Association’s GPs committee unanimously voted to reject the measures, and is planning a ballot on possible strike action.\n\nAre the problems pandemic-related?\n\nTo an extent, yes. Lockdowns have worsened patient backlogs. During the pandemic, GP appointments dropped sharply – in England, they fell by around 30% in April 2020 compared with the previous April. This created a backlog of patients awaiting planned hospital treatments, which GPs now have to manage, along with playing their part in the vaccine rollout and treating patients affected by Covid.\n\nThe pandemic also sharply accelerated a trend towards appointments being held virtually as opposed to in person. Pre-Covid, 80% of doctors’ appointments in England were face-to-face. But that figure fell to 47% in lockdown; it had only gone back up to 61% by September. In some areas, fewer than half of appointments have been held in person.\n\nWhat’s wrong with virtual appointments?\n\nTelephone consultations – along with video appointments – offer many advantages, particularly for initial triage. They save time for both doctors and patients, and allow the latter to avoid spending time in busy waiting rooms – crucial in a pandemic.\n\nBut most GPs would accept that there is often no substitute for face-to-face care. Virtual appointments exclude those without access to phones or internet, and make it harder for GPs to pick up on mental health issues or signs of abuse. But the main problem is the risk of missed diagnoses, in the absence of physical examination.\n\nAn official assessment by the Department of Health and Social Care and the Office for National Statistics into the “unintended consequences” of remote consultations found that more than 175,000 diagnoses of key conditions are estimated to have been missed last year alone. There was also a worrying 15% drop in the number of patients referred by GPs for urgent cancer check-ups last year.\n\nSo why aren’t GPs doing more?\n\nThey say they’re already doing everything they can. Family doctors are furious, complaining that they are being blamed for underlying problems in the system. Funding, they say, is inadequate: there has been a steady decline in the proportion of funding going to primary care, which deals with 90% of patient contacts, but gets only 10% of the budget.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/05/governor-bill-lee-state-of-the-state-full-speech-tennessee/3028501002/", "title": "Tennessee State of the State: Read Gov. Bill Lee's full speech", "text": "Staff report\n\nGov. Bill Lee on Monday night delivered his first State of the State address to a joint session of the Tennessee General Assembly.\n\nRead his full speech, as prepared for delivery.\n\nLieutenant Governor McNally, Speaker Casada, Speaker Pro Tem Haile, Speaker Pro Tem Dunn, Members of the 111th General Assembly, Justices, Constitutional Officers, friends, guests, fellow Tennesseans:\n\n\n\nTennessee’s voters and its constitution have given me the responsibility of delivering this address evaluating where we are as a state and recommending action to make us even better.\n\n\n\nI am grateful for this opportunity to serve, and it is my high honor to be here tonight.\n\n\n\nThere's a scripture that encourages us to consider others as more important than ourselves.\n\n\n\nBefore I begin tonight, I’d like to acknowledge the woman in my life who embodies that most, my wife and the first Lady of Tennessee, Maria.\n\n\n\nYou and I have a First Lady who is deeply committed to serving this state purposefully and she challenges me every day to likewise govern with purpose.\n\n\n\nThank you, Maria. I love you.\n\n\n\nAnd let me say welcome and thank you to my Cabinet, and my staff; you’re doing an excellent job and you make us all proud.\n\n\n\nThe year my oldest daughter Jessica turned 16, she and I took a father-daughter trip for her birthday. We had both been through some very personal and tragic struggles and we decided to do something that would be \"overcoming.\"\n\n\n\nWe travelled to Wyoming to the Grand Teton National Park to climb one of the tallest mountains in the United States.\n\n\n\nIt's a difficult and technical climb, and we spent months preparing both physically and mentally.\n\n\n\nThe apex of our trip would carry us to 14,000 feet above sea level. Our first day we hiked up to 11,000 feet to make our camp for the night.\n\n\n\nAs we neared the basecamp, our guide, probably sensing my nervousness, pulled me aside and said something very important.\n\n\n\nHe said, “You need to make a decision that you’re going to make this climb before you get to the base camp.\n\n“Because when you get there you’re going to look up at the Grand Teton, and it’ll look like a massive granite spire that sticks straight up higher than you ever imagined, and you’ll feel very intimidated.\n\n\n\n“If you have the tiniest doubt in your mind that you can do it as you’re hiking up there today, then once you stand at the base camp tonight and look up, you’ll be convinced that you can’t possibly climb that thing.”\n\n\n\nHe told me I needed to decide right then and there whether I was going to finish the climb.\n\n\n\nI did decide, and we did finish and let me tell you, like everything that’s difficult, the view from the top was well worth the climb.\n\n\n\nAs a state, our challenges, too, are difficult, and the climb will require great effort, but Tennessee is a remarkable place, with remarkable people.\n\n\n\nNow, I think we can all agree that while important things happen in the halls of government it is actually what happens outside these walls that makes Tennessee truly great.\n\n\n\nNearly every Friday since we took office, Maria and I have left this building to meet Tennesseans in their communities to learn more about what makes our state work.\n\n\n\nWe met a soybean farmer in Lauderdale County who navigates the Mississippi floodwaters to pull in a harvest and carry on our proud agricultural tradition.\n\n\n\nWe met a third-grade teacher in North Nashville who works over time to ensure their students are reading at grade level and continue to be the fastest improving students in the nation.\n\n\n\nWe met a small business owner in Jamestown who employs fellow neighbors and keeps the backbone of the Tennessee economy running strong.\n\n\n\nAnd so, as a lifelong Tennessean, when I reflect on our state, I see her people and I am filled with pride.\n\n\n\nTo our elected leaders in this room and the many Tennesseans watching from their homes, I am proud to report after seeing with my own eyes: the state of our state is hopeful, prosperous, and strong.\n\n\n\nGod has truly blessed us – our economy is growing, our schools are improving, our natural resources are abundant and beautiful; indeed, we are the envy of many states.\n\n\n\nBut while our prosperity should be celebrated, it should not be taken for granted, for it was not granted to us.\n\n\n\nOur prosperity has been hard won. From the first settlers in the 1790’s to the leaders of past and present, many have contributed to the success we now enjoy.\n\nOur military veterans living, and remembered, deserve the most honored place among those we thank for serving.\n\n\n\nWe recognize the service of our heroes, and I'd like to talk about one family in particular who has embodied that service and sacrifice.\n\n\n\nU.S. Navy Lieutenant Richard C. “Tito” Lannom of Union City was reported missing as of March 1, 1968 during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\nThe Obion County native was assigned to Attack Squadron Three Five aboard the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier and was on an A-6A aircraft on a night mission over North Vietnam.\n\n\n\nLike many, he did not come back.\n\n\n\nLannom and the pilot were declared missing after a search and rescue mission failed to locate their plane.\n\n\n\nHe was 27-years old.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Vietnamese excavated a crash site on Tra Ban Island and were ultimately able to identify Lannom in September of last year.\n\n\n\nThis past weekend, our state had a memorial service for him.\n\n\n\nAfter more than 50 years, Lieutenant Lannom’s final resting place is home, on Tennessee soil, where he belongs.\n\n\n\nPlease join me in pausing to remember Lt. Lannom and the sacrifice he and so many others have made for our country.\n\n\n\nNow, please join me in recognizing the family of Lt. Tito Lannom who has come from across Tennessee to be with us – thank you all for the sacrifices you’ve made and for being here tonight.\n\n\n\nIndeed, this is a remarkable state with remarkable people, but past success should not be taken for granted and future success should not be assumed.\n\n\n\nWe can be glad for the things we’ve done that have brought us to this point, but we must also recognize that new accomplishments will be required from the leaders of today if we are to reach our full potential tomorrow.\n\n\n\nMaybe the key question before us is whether we will stand here and enjoy the view from this far up the mountain or push ahead to new heights and new prosperity.\n\n\n\nMy encouragement to you – to all of us – is that we press higher.\n\nA stronger education system; a better prepared workforce; a system of justice that lives up to its name; and safe neighborhoods across our state.\n\n\n\nThese and more goals are within our reach if we unite behind a common vision.\n\n\n\nIn addition to delivering this address, I have the task of proposing to you a state budget.\n\n\n\nBy God’s favor our state is in a strong financial position, and I believe my proposed budget reflects that.\n\n\n\nManaging a budget is one of the most important jobs of government and proposing a fiscally responsible budget is one of the most important jobs of a governor.\n\n\n\nAnd as a conservative businessman, I know a good budget needs to pay for what is needed, take on zero long-term debt, and, perhaps most importantly, save for a rainy day.\n\n\n\nAs our state continues to grow, we are committed to remaining among the most fiscally sound and best managed states in America.\n\n\n\nWe live in prosperous days, but it’s precisely during these times when we must build up our storehouses for when times may not be as good.\n\n\n\nFor that reason, I am particularly proud of this: in my budget, we are making the largest single contribution to our Rainy Day Fund in the state’s history.\n\n\n\nWhen this budget is implemented, our Rainy Day Fund will be $1.1 billion – the largest it has ever been in both real dollars and as a percentage of our overall revenue.\n\n\n\nThis budget is fiscally conservative and stays within the Copeland Cap, which as you in this room know is in our state’s constitution as a guardrail against out-of-control government spending.\n\n\n\nI have said many times that Tennessee can and should lead the nation, and this budget will help us do that.\n\n\n\nIn particular, there are four things in my budget and legislative agenda that I believe we must do if that goal to lead the nation is to become a reality.\n\n\n\nFirst, Tennessee must deliver a world class education and that education must be aligned with the needs of the job creators of today and tomorrow.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish that, our students need more guidance, our teachers and principals need more support, and our parents need more choices.\n\n\n\nI’ve spoken often about the four out of ten students will not attend college.\n\nFor them, we must vastly strengthen our vocational, technical, and agricultural offerings to make sure they are career-ready.\n\n\n\nAfter 35 years in the private sector, I know the job market can change quickly and education must stay in sync with industry.\n\n\n\nWhen companies like Google, Apple, and IBM no longer require a college degree for many high-skilled jobs, we know we need to think differently about how we approach preparing our kids for careers.\n\n\n\nElementary and middle schools need to begin skills training earlier and, from top to bottom, high school needs to look a lot different.\n\n\n\nIn that spirit, I’m proposing the Governor’s Investment in Vocational Education – the GIVE Act.\n\n\n\nThe GIVE Act is a $25 million investment to increase the number of young adults earning an industry certification and entering a career within one year of high school graduation.\n\n\n\nAnother one of our goals is to put Tennessee in the top half of states for technology sector job creation by 2022.\n\n\n\nTo that end, I recently announced the Future Workforce Initiative, a $4 million effort to increase science, technology, engineering and mathematics – STEM – training in K-12 schools.\n\n\n\nThe Future Workforce Initiative will add 100 new CTE programs, grow the number of teachers qualified to teach work-based learning and computer science classes, and expand access to AP courses and early postsecondary options for high schoolers.\n\n\n\nWe are also investing in agricultural education by allocating new recurring funding for both FFA and 4-H youth programs.\n\n\n\nThese programs and others like them are so important, and it takes the work of dedicated teachers and principals to make sure our students are being well prepared.\n\n\n\nOne such teacher is Dan Smith from Dyer County and he’s an example of the thousands of dedicated teachers we are fortunate to have in this state.\n\n\n\nDan, a horticulture and agriculture teacher at Dyer County High School and is a former agriculture Teacher of the Year, because of his exemplary work with students.\n\n\n\nHe has coordinated massive plant sales, integrated master gardeners and landscaped his entire school, and that’s just the beginning.\n\n\n\nHe’s a pillar in his community. He embodies the term – Agricultural Education.\n\nHe is with us here today, and please join me in thanking him for his years of dedicated work to improve the lives of the students of Tennessee.\n\n\n\nMany students will go to college, and for that group we want to provide world-class higher education options across our state.\n\n\n\nWe must continue to invest in our outcomes-focused approach to funding higher education, which is why we’ve set aside $34 million new dollars in this budget to fully fund our higher education institutions.\n\n\n\nWe will also invest more than $12 million dollars in financial aid to add nearly 7,000 students in need to those we help attend college or obtain a certificate here in Tennessee.\n\n\n\nWe are also adding resources to help prepare disadvantaged students for college, so they can best take advantage of the opportunities they earn.\n\n\n\nWe’re making CTE a major priority, but we also want to do other things well.\n\n\n\nI fundamentally believe that every child ought to have access to a great, traditional public school.\n\n\n\nAnd so even as we consider expanding options in this state, we must re-double our efforts to make sure that public schools in Tennessee are well-resourced and that Tennessee teachers and principals are the best and most celebrated in the business.\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, we are fully funding the Basic Education Program and recommending $71 million for a well-deserved 2.5% pay raise for teachers.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, to support educators and school leaders, we are proposing investments in the professional development of rural principals and expansion of the Rural Principal Network.\n\n\n\nIn response to the increasing needs of our lowest-performing 5% of schools, we are investing $5 million into improving student and teacher support in our priority schools.\n\n\n\nAcross our state, we have qualified educators and leaders who are making the sacrifice to serve on local school boards and bring their ideas to the table.\n\n\n\nLater this month, I will send a letter to every school board member and superintendent in this state, seeking their input on what is working and what should still be done to make Tennessee the home of the best public schools in America.\n\n\n\nTo those of you listening today, please know I look forward to personally reading your responses.\n\n\n\nIn my budget, I propose a three-year pilot program to provide critical student support services to high school students in our 15 distressed counties.\n\nThese funds will be matched by private donations and will allow us to provide meaningful support while also measuring the positive effects of this pilot program.\n\n\n\nI’ve often said that education is about more than a test score, but test scores can provide valuable data to both teachers and students when used properly.\n\n\n\nLater this month, tens of thousands of students will be completing their end of course testing to help ensure that they are receiving the quality education they deserve.\n\n\n\nThere has been lots of frustration around the administration of the state test in recent years, and I share in that frustration.\n\n\n\nMy Commissioner of Education is working tirelessly to prepare for this year’s test, but more importantly to finalize the procurement process for selecting a new test vendor for next year and beyond.\n\n\n\nBut while the execution must get better, we must remain committed to the notion that you can’t improve what you don’t measure.\n\n\n\nGoing forward, our focus will be on executing a testing regimen that is trustworthy, helpful, and on time.\n\n\n\nWhatever else happens in the classroom, the safety of our children and teachers is paramount for my administration and for all of our elected leaders.\n\n\n\nFor that reason, I am asking the legislature to join with me to fund an additional $30 million investment in our school safety fund and to prioritize the districts with schools who currently have no school resource officers on duty.\n\n\n\nTogether, we can make sure every school is a safer place for our children.\n\n\n\nIn my inaugural address, I said that Tennesseans would have to be bold, courageous, and strong in the face of today’s biggest challenges.\n\n\n\nOne of those challenges is closing the gap between the quality of education offered to students regardless of their zip code.\n\n\n\nTennessee has led the nation with important K-12 education reforms over the last decade, and we have seen the payoff: our student outcomes have been among the fastest improving.\n\n\n\nBut sustained improvement requires constant innovation, and we must keep looking for the next game-changer.\n\n\n\nParents need more choices with respect to the education of their children and those options should be well-funded and highly accountable.\n\nStudents have different needs and abilities, and our education system should mirror that diversity as best as possible.\n\n\n\nI believe highly accountable public charter schools are a great model for expanding choice without sacrificing quality, and I’ve seen firsthand how they can dramatically impact the life and trajectory of a student.\n\n\n\nIn my budget, we are doubling the amount of public charter school facility funding and I will support legislation this year that makes it easier to open good charter schools and easier to close bad ones.\n\n\n\nBut we should do even more.\n\n\n\nNearly one in three students born into poverty does not finish high school, and a student that doesn’t finish high school is much more likely to stay in poverty.\n\n\n\nLow-income students deserve the same opportunities as other kids, and we need a bold plan that will help level the playing field.\n\n\n\nWe need to change the status quo, increase competition, and not slow down until every student in Tennessee has access to a great education.\n\n\n\nWe’re not going get big results in our struggling schools by nibbling around the edges.\n\n\n\nThat is why we need Education Savings Accounts in Tennessee, this year.\n\n\n\nESAs will enable low-income students from the most under-performing school districts to attend an independent school of their choice at no cost to their family.\n\n\n\nI know there’s concern that programs like this will take money away from public schools, but my ESA plan will invest at least $25 million new dollars in public schools in the first year to fill the gap when a student transfers to another school.\n\n\n\nMy ESA plan will strengthen public schools and provide choices for parents at the same time.\n\n\n\nCreating competition will provide a new incentive for schools to improve and provide new opportunities for thousands of students.\n\n\n\nMembers of the legislature: now is the time.\n\n\n\nLet’s make this the year that every student in Tennessee has a chance at a great education, no matter where they live.\n\n\n\nAnother important issue in education is curriculum.\n\nWe should continue to root out the influence of Common Core in our state, but there’s another issue we should be mindful of as well.\n\n\n\nDuring the past two years of traveling on the campaign trail, an issue I was constantly asked about was civics and character education.\n\n\n\nAt face value, this may seem like a small issue.\n\n\n\nHowever, in the last year it was reported that young people between the ages of 18 and 29 in this country have a more favorable view of socialism than capitalism.\n\n\n\nAnd last week I read about a recent study that said in 49 of 50 states a majority of residents would fail the U.S. citizenship test.\n\n\n\nI can’t help but feel that these two statistics are somehow connected.\n\n\n\nPresident Reagan said that freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.\n\n\n\nThis demands answering an obvious question; how will our children know of our cherished American values if we do not teach them?\n\n\n\nWe all desire a more perfect union, but we cannot expect future generations to build upon the incredible progress our country has made if we fail to teach them the history and values that made it possible.\n\n\n\nSo, let me say this: whatever may be going on in other states or in our nation’s Capital, in this state, our children will be taught civics education, character formation, and unapologetic American exceptionalism.\n\n\n\nWe are beginning that effort by creating the governor’s civics instructional seal which will recognize schools that excel at teaching civics education.\n\n\n\nI said there are four things we must do if we want to lead the nation. First, we must build a better education system. Second, we must build a criminal justice system that is tough, smart, and above all, just.\n\n\n\nFor decades, this country has been too willing to fight crime on the surface alone – “lock ‘em up and throw away the key.”\n\n\n\nNow, in more ways than one, we’re paying the price for that.\n\n\n\nTennessee is currently incarcerating more people for longer than we ever have and the population in our county jails is growing daily.\n\n\n\nIn fact, at the bottom of this hill begins the most incarcerated zip code in America.\n\nIncarceration can have a generational impact.\n\n\n\nChildren with an incarcerated parent are at greater risk of being incarcerated themselves.\n\n\n\nAnd besides the human cost, there’s the actual cost.\n\n\n\nIncarcerating an adult in Tennessee costs $28,000 taxpayer dollars per year.\n\n\n\nIncarcerating a juvenile for a year can cost many times more than that.\n\n\n\nAnd for all the trouble and cost, what are our criminal justice outcomes?\n\n\n\nViolent crime is up. Recidivism is high. Jails are struggling to make ends meet.\n\n\n\nLet me be clear, the punishment for violent crime must be swift and severe, but we must also get better at helping those who will be released prepare to re-enter society, not re-enter prison.\n\n\n\nIt’s past time that our state’s elected leaders speak with one voice on this important issue: when it comes to reforming our state’s justice system, the cost of doing nothing isn’t zero.\n\n\n\nCrime victims pay the price. Families pay the price. And taxpayers pay the price.\n\n\n\nIn my proposal to the legislature this year, I recommend a series of smart reforms that will make a big difference.\n\n\n\nOne area of reform my administration will address is our use of community supervision for low-risk offenders.\n\n\n\nCommunity supervision allows us to provide the corrections oversight necessary to hold someone accountable for their crime without incurring the economic and social cost of incarceration.\n\n\n\nIt costs about 20 times more to incarcerate someone than to put them under community supervision, and the latter leads to better outcomes.\n\n\n\nOne of the first things we will do is add funds to the Electronic Monitoring Indigency Fund and add the use of GPS monitoring so that low-risk, non-violent individuals can keep their jobs and provide for their families instead of spending unnecessary time in jail.\n\n\n\nOf those who are incarcerated, 95% are not serving a life sentence and will eventually come out and we need to be sure they are prepared for that.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because every successful reentry means one less crime, and one less victim.\n\n\n\nMy commitment to having fewer crime victims in this state is reflected in a proposed expansion of education and re-entry counselling opportunities in our prisons.\n\nEducational attainment for incarcerated people can reduce their risk of recidivism by up to 43%.\n\n\n\nAnother important part of successful re-entry is stable employment.\n\n\n\nFor that reason, we have introduced a bill eliminating the expungement fees for those already eligible under the law to alleviate the cost burden of getting back on their feet.\n\n\n\nWe must also take bold steps to stop the scourge of drugs illegally trafficked into our state.\n\n\n\nI pledged to make Tennessee a state that drug traffickers fear, and I will make sure that our prosecutors and our law enforcement have the tools they need to make that a reality.\n\n\n\nWe are increasing the penalties on dangerous drugs like fentanyl and making it clear that we will have no leniency on high level drug dealers who target the residents of this state.\n\n\n\nAnd we need more than just strong laws to keep our communities safe; we also need strong law enforcement.\n\n\n\nIt is no secret that Tennessee lags other states on law enforcement and corrections pay, which impacts our hiring and retention rates.\n\n\n\nWe are increasing investments in correctional officer pay and training opportunities, and this budget calls for new investments in our law enforcement capacity, improving the in-service training pay supplement, and provide new funding to support the increased demands of our Drug Overdose and Violent Crime Task Forces.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, tomorrow morning, I will sign an Executive Order creating a task force to address the growing fiscal and social costs of incarceration.\n\n\n\nI appreciate the focus placed on these issues by members of the General Assembly and our Supreme Court in recent years, and it is time to move forward in a comprehensive way.\n\n\n\nThis task force will be led by Judge Brandon Gibson from my office and will include crime victims and their families, members of the general assembly, state agencies, law enforcement, community and faith based programs, and, yes, even former inmates.\n\n\n\nFundamentally, this task force will recommend legislative and budgetary changes that will help reduce recidivism, make our communities safer and save tax dollars.\n\n\n\nI know we can do things differently, because I've been involved with groups who have made a difference.\n\n\n\nNonprofits like Men of Valor in Nashville are helping those who enter prison be better prepared to reenter society.\n\nThe recidivism rate of Men of Valor’s program graduates is less than one of third of the statewide average.\n\n\n\nOne person who benefited from this group is a man named Marcus Martin.\n\n\n\nMarcus was incarcerated for five years.\n\n\n\nBy his own admission, he was on a quick path back to prison, until he got involved with Men of Valor.\n\n\n\nNow, on the outside for 16 years, Marcus is a full-time prison minister, helping and making a huge impact on those still on the inside.\n\n\n\nMarcus Martin is here with us tonight – Marcus, please stand and be recognized.\n\n\n\nMarcus, thanks for what you’re doing.\n\n\n\nMy fellow Tennesseans, this is a story of redemption, this is a story of Tennesseans helping other Tennesseans.\n\n\n\nIt’s also a story of fiscal responsibility… and common sense.\n\n\n\nWe need more of these stories, and when we get them, it won't be surprising to see that our crime and recidivism rates start going down.\n\n\n\nAnd my administration will do more than talk about how important we think these issues are.\n\n\n\nWe intend to be national innovators and leaders in showing how people throughout our state – the volunteer state – are willing to partner together to serve one another.\n\n\n\nTonight, I’m proud to announce that we are launching the Volunteer Mentorship Initiative to equip Tennesseans throughout our state to mentor fellow Tennesseans who are currently in prison.\n\n\n\nAnd I’m signing up tonight as the first volunteer.\n\n\n\nThis initiative will begin by working with Tennessee-based non-profits to pair degree-seeking inmates with mentors on the outside as they seek better opportunities for themselves during their time in prison and their first days back in their communities.\n\n\n\nI am pleased to announce that Senator Mike Bell and Representative Michael Curcio have graciously agreed to be the honorary co-chairs of the Volunteer Mentorship Initiative.\n\n\n\nAnd I am even more proud that every member of my senior staff has enthusiastically agreed to join this program as our first batch of new mentors.\n\nTonight, I’m asking members of our General Assembly and every Tennessean who desires to prayerfully consider volunteering to join this effort.\n\n\n\nAs our state has shown before, we can change the course of history and the destiny of people when we step up, volunteer, and serve one another.\n\n\n\nThe challenge ahead of us is great, but the urgency of the situation is greater, and I know we will rise to meet the challenge.\n\n\n\nFor this issue, the admonition to we public servants is clear: do justice, love mercy, walk humbly.\n\n\n\nFirst, education. Second, justice. And third, every Tennessean should have access to high-quality health care they can afford.\n\n\n\nThis is an ambitious goal that no state has accomplished, and Tennessee will not accomplish it overnight.\n\n\n\nWe will work with patients, providers, and payers to establish Tennessee as a world-class health care market for our people using transparency and competition.\n\n\n\nTo begin this process, I have asked our Finance and Administration Commissioner, Stuart McWhorter, to chair a Healthcare Modernization Task Force that will work closely with private sector stakeholders, policymakers, and communities across the state to develop a list of reforms and critical investments.\n\n\n\nIn the short-term, there are several things we can do to move Tennessee toward having better health outcomes.\n\n\n\nSo that more uninsured Tennesseans have access to quality primary and preventative-care services, we are providing additional funding to our health care safety net which supports community and faith-based care centers serving those who do not have health insurance coverage.\n\n\n\nWe will continue to work with the General Assembly and with Washington to look for waiver opportunities that help us increase insurance coverage without big government strings attached.\n\n\n\nWe will also be exploring ways to build off the important efforts of the Trump administration to promote price transparency.\n\n\n\nAnother way to lower health care cost is to combat Medicaid fraud.\n\n\n\nTackling fraud in Medicaid is particularly important as we work to prevent the fraudulent distribution of opioid medications.\n\nTo support that effort, we are creating 24 new positions in the state’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.\n\n\n\nTogether these efforts will place downward pressure on the cost of coverage.\n\n\n\nI am also committed to working with our rural communities to ensure that they have quality healthcare that meets their current and future needs.\n\n\n\nDespite the closure of rural hospitals across the state and country, there are many opportunities to transform care in these communities through smart reforms, increased innovation, and a new business model.\n\n\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a long-term approach, and we have already taken steps that will deliver real progress this year.\n\n\n\nFor one, I’m proposing $20 million to boost broadband accessibility which will make technology like telemedicine more accessible and practical.\n\n\n\nWe are increasing, by as much as $8.6 million, funding for graduate medical education at Tennessee’s medical schools and critical incentive programs that provide financial support to resident physicians who commit to living and working in our rural communities.\n\n\n\nBy increasing the supply of care that reflects the needs of rural communities we will be driving down the overall cost of care.\n\n\n\nOur focus on economic development and vocational education will also drive better health outcomes as individuals are increasingly able to get higher paying jobs that provide greater stability and access to coverage.\n\n\n\nToo often, the conversation around health care focuses exclusively on physical health.\n\n\n\nPhysical well-being is important, but a national conversation around mental and behavioral health is long overdue.\n\n\n\nNearly 300,000 Tennesseans are facing serious mental health challenges, and far too many are slipping through the cracks.\n\n\n\nI made a vow on the campaign trail to strengthen the mental health safety net and I intend to do just that.\n\n\n\nIn this budget, I am recommending an increase of $11 million in recurring funds to our Behavioral Health Safety Net and our Regional Mental Health Institutes.\n\n\n\nThese investments will help us serve thousands more of our most vulnerable Tennesseans, most of which do not currently have health insurance.\n\nTennessee’s suicide rate is 20% higher than the national average.\n\n\n\nFor that reason, I’m proposing a $1.1 million investment that will expand the state’s partnership with the Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network to establish a new regional outreach model and increase the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ efforts.\n\n\n\nTo truly be champions of mental and behavioral health, we must put everything we have behind defeating the opioid crisis in Tennessee once and for all.\n\n\n\nWe must continue to make progress in preventing addiction, and I will defend the smart limits on prescriptions passed by this legislature.\n\n\n\nIn this budget, we’ll also work to address the other victims of the opioid crisis — the dependent children of those addicted.\n\n\n\nWe recommend expanding our investment in the Safe Baby Courts initiative to support vulnerable infants and are including $5 million dollars in new funding to address a rising caseload in our Department of Children’s Services.\n\n\n\nAlso, as we begin to see an increasing rise of students entering kindergarten facing challenges from prenatal drug exposure, I recommend that we invest an additional $6 million dollars in our Early Intervention Services for schools.\n\n\n\nThese investments will make Tennessee a healthier state, and when we’re healthier it’s good for Tennesseans and it’s good for the bottom line.\n\n\n\nFourth and finally, when we have accomplished these and many other goals, what remains expected of us is that government be operated with integrity, effectiveness, and as little cost as possible.\n\n\n\nFundamentally, we believe government exists to protect our liberties – not to grant favors, not to build kingdoms, and not to needlessly interfere with the lives of our citizens.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, the voters did not send us here to create more government.\n\n\n\nNo, they sent us here to protect their freedoms and protect their hard-earned money.\n\n\n\nI’ve long believed that Tennessee’s most precious natural resource is our people.\n\n\n\nMany of our people can be found at non-profits in this state who are doing, with excellence, jobs that government cannot or should not do.\n\n\n\nSo, to help protect taxpayer dollars and to engage some of our under-utilized citizens, one announcement I am particularly excited to make is the Governor’s Office of Faith-based and Community Initiatives.\n\nThis office will leverage the non-profit community and help us unleash the potential of all Tennesseans to get involved to not only make lives better for their fellow citizens but to reduce the responsibilities and ultimately the size of government.\n\n\n\nI’d like to close tonight with two short stories.\n\n\n\nThis last month we have seen record rainfall across our state.\n\n\n\nMany areas have flooded, others have dealt with mudslides, water treatment plants have failed, and some of our neighbors have lost loved ones.\n\n\n\nOur hearts are with those hurting families, and with all others who are still cleaning up, even tonight.\n\n\n\nAnd we’re grateful to the first responders, state employees, and everyday citizens who were there during the storms and who are supporting that clean up.\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, amid some scary moments, one state employee jumped in to help.\n\n\n\nWhen the flooding started in Dickson County Lt. Travis Plotzer of the Tennessee Highway Patrol was at a flooded roadway on Highway 48.\n\n\n\nHe went in to chest deep water to help rescue motorists stranded on top of their vehicles.\n\n\n\nHe didn’t hesitate to be the first one to help.\n\n\n\nHe showed what it really means to be a public servant; he showed what it really means to be a leader.\n\n\n\nPlease join me in recognizing Lt. Travis Plotzer from Dickson County.\n\n\n\nFor 35 years prior to becoming governor, I worked in a family-owned company that I led for 20 of those years.\n\n\n\nLast month, for the first time in 35 years, I missed our annual, all-employee gathering.\n\n\n\nI’ll be honest with you – it was bittersweet.\n\n\n\nBut that same day, Maria and I had the privilege to host at our new home the Governor’s Excellence in Service Award winners from each of Tennessee’s 23 departments.\n\n\n\nWe went around the room and listened as each one introduced themselves and explained their jobs but what struck me most was not what they did, but the passion with which they did it.\n\n\n\nThose dedicated individuals and others like them that I’ve met since remind me that government itself is not a solution to our problems; “we the people” must solve our own problems. 17\n\nAnd while our state government is far from perfect, one thing I have learned during my first two months in office is that Tennessee has the most committed, hard-working group of state employees in the country and I am proud to be serving alongside them.\n\n\n\nAs my daughter and I neared the end of our climb up the Grand Teton, we came to a place famous for its very narrow ledge.\n\n\n\nTo make it worse, there’s a section in part of the ledge that has a 1,000-foot “exposure”, which is evidently climber-speak for a 1,000-foot fall if you mess a step.\n\n\n\nThe point is, the only way to get across it was to set your face forward against the mountain and step sideways across the gap – and whatever you do, don’t look down.\n\n\n\nAs a state, we find ourselves in a very strong position, with a very nice view.\n\n\n\nWe can choose to sit here and enjoy it, or we can choose to step across the ledge and move to higher, better ground.\n\n\n\nBut if we decide to go higher and farther, we must resolve to not look back, and not look down.\n\n\n\nIf we lead Tennessee well, Tennessee may well lead the nation.\n\n\n\nMy prayer is that we will all work together to do just that.\n\n\n\nMay God bless you, and may God bless the great state of Tennessee.\n\n\n\nThank you and good night.\n\n\n\nMore coverage of Tennessee Gov.

Vasyk Didyk\n\nHe has no military training and came despite his parents, who do not live in Ukraine, weeping on the phone when they heard he was joining the fight.\n\n“I haven’t been back to Ukraine in four years – but it wasn’t even a choice,” he said. “I had to come and help my country.”\n\nThe world has watched in horror since Russia invaded Ukraine late last week, triggering what could be the largest land war in Europe since World War II. And Zelensky’s defiance has not only united Western opposition to Russia, but also inspired foreign volunteers and Ukrainians abroad to fight for the cause.\n\n“This is not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Zelensky said on Sunday. “This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules, and peaceful coexistence.”\n\nUkrainian embassies have been helping recruit foreign fighters, while at least one senior politician from a Western government that has previously prosecuted those who joined foreign wars indicated support for citizens taking up arms in Ukraine.\n\n“If people want to support that struggle, I will support them doing that,” UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nAsked by CNN whether it consented to French foreign fighters in Ukraine, the French government said: “Ukraine is a war zone, classified as a red zone in the travel advice, updated on a permanent basis and available under the following link (Travel advice). As a result, we formally advise against any travel to Ukraine.”\n\nThe question was not directly answered by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nWhen asked about American foreign fighters he said the US has been “clear for some time” in telling “Americans who may be thinking of traveling there not to go.”\n\nVasyk Didyk (left) and Igor Shehyni (right) arrive in Ukraine on Wednesday after more than 24 hours of travel from New York. AnneClaire Stapleton/CNN\n\nIf Americans want to help Ukraine, “there are many ways to do that, including by supporting and helping the many NGOs that are working to provide humanitarian assistance; providing resources themselves to groups that are trying to help Ukraine by being advocates for Ukraine,” he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Zelensky said the first of 16,000 foreign fighters were making their way to Ukraine “to protect freedom and life for us, and for all,” he said. CNN has not been able to confirm those numbers.\n\n“An attack on Europe”\n\nIn the English city of Milton Keynes, more than 1,200 miles west from Shehyni, British builder Jake Dale said the call for foreigners to join Ukraine’s International Legion inspired him to book a flight to Poland on Friday. He aims to cross into Ukraine by Saturday afternoon.\n\n“As soon as I heard his [Zelensky’s] call – it made me think he needs help,” the 29-year-old said from his home he shares with his girlfriend and two children. “I think it is a worthy cause to risk my life, and my girlfriend feels the same. Obviously, she gets upset, as anyone would, but she supports it as she can see I want to help.”\n\nBack in 2015, Dale wanted to join a Kurdish militia group, the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, which was leading the fight against ISIS in Syria, but decided against it due to warnings by the British government.\n\nThis time, he is not worried about the potential legal trouble he could face on his return from Ukraine. “I’m willing to deal with it,” he said after the British government distanced itself from Truss’s comments.\n\nDuring a trip to Poland, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was not “actively” supporting volunteers going to fight. “I can understand why people feel as they do, but we have laws in our country about international conflicts and how they must be conducted,” Johnson told reporters.\n\nDale is heading to Ukraine with Peter Hurst, a 36-year-old former infantry soldier with the British Army, who did a tour of Afghanistan before leaving the military in 2011.\n\nThe father of five, who lives in the northern English town of Pontefract, spoke to CNN on a video call while he picked out kit from an army supplies store in a nearby town. He said wanted to fight to protect democratic values and freedoms.\n\nBritish citizen Jake Dale (left) is pictured with his family. Peter Hurst (right) is pictured with his wife on their wedding day. Both men plan to be in Ukraine by Saturday.\n\n“It feels like an attack on Europe. If you don’t help stop war there [in Ukraine], it will probably spread,” he said.\n\nBoth Hurst and Dale met this week on a Facebook group – created to help supply British medical and military aid to Ukraine. They have been working with a liaison – whose name is listed on an information pack sent by the Ukrainian embassy – who will provide them with body armor and vests in Poland.\n\nDale has spent £300 ($400) buying kit and plane tickets and worries about the financial impact of him not working. “It will be a strain on my family when I leave,” he said. “But I am sure we will be fine.”\n\nNot everyone is supportive of the idea of foreign fighters in Ukraine.\n\nUS-based extremist tracking organization SITE Intelligence Group has warned of the involvement of outfits such as Azov, a paramilitary group whose logo is the Wolfsangel, a symbol appropriated by Nazi Germany.\n\n“Following Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, far-right communities online have rallied to the side of groups like Azov, both in terms of fundraising and stating their intent to fight alongside them,” a SITE report says.\n\nThe British government has told those without military training to avoid the fight.\n\nOn the Facebook group Hurst and Dale met on, one user warns: “That is absolutely no place to be for someone with no weapon handling skills and doesn’t speak the language. Apart from being a danger to others it’s not fair on the lads themselves.”\n\nDale says he is aware of such warnings but insists his skills as a qualified mechanic could be useful.\n\n“People can say it is wrong to go in without a military background, but I believe by fighting alongside Ukrainians, I am answering their call for help,” he said. “Putin’s regime is ruthless – it is not just Ukraine we are protecting.”\n\n“As long as we have to”\n\nUkrainian citizen Valery, who asked for his last name not to be published, lives in eastern France, but felt compelled to return to visit his elderly parents as Russia massed troops on Ukraine’s border.\n\nThe February 24 invasion began soon after he arrived in Kyiv, where it was heralded with pre-dawn warning sirens.\n\n“I woke up around five o’clock in the morning with the very strange sound,” he said. “I thought I was still dreaming. I couldn’t believe my ears. But the sound was so persistent I couldn’t fall asleep any further.”\n\nValery said his mind then turned to one thing: “How useful can I be to my country? The first thought was to join the army and check how useful I can be.”\n\nHow useful can I be to my country? The first thought was to join the army and check how useful I can be. Valery\n\nAfter enlisting at a conscription center, the 45-year-old said he “felt this sense of nausea” when he received his weapon, realizing normality had been shattered. “Kyiv has been a very peaceful town since 1943,” he said.\n\nValery is serving with five others in a military unit. “Many of them have families, have children. Nonetheless, they joined,” he said, adding that morale is high within the forces. “There is a lot of determination to defeat the enemy.”\n\nAll foreign fighters share that determination – but the people crossing into Ukraine vary wildly in terms of their organization and experience.\n\nCNN spoke to a group of six volunteers, made up of Americans and one Briton, with military equipment in a packed train station in Pzsemysl, Poland. “If more people would have joined the fight in 1936 we wouldn’t be dealing with fascism now,” the British man said. Most said they are veterans; one said he is not and has never fought in a war.\n\nNone speaks Ukrainian, Russian or Polish, and they did not have a translator or a plan to get to the conflict.\n\n“We’ve tried to get in touch with (the) embassy but (traffic) crashed all the websites,” one said. “There’s women and children dying indiscriminately and you know – we gotta be here,” said another.\n\nElsewhere, CNN spoke with a band of Brits and Canadians who had met each other in a Polish airport, all determined to cross the border and join the Ukrainians in battle.\n\nWali, who is French Canadian, said he had served as a sniper in Afghanistan and volunteered previously to fight against ISIS in 2015. He added that he has contacts in Ukraine who can supply him with weapons. “My friend … called me and said, OK, we really need you,” he said.\n\nBack at the border crossing in Shehyni, New Yorkers Didyk and Harmaii wrangle with their canvas backpacks and wheeled suitcases.\n\nWhen asked how long they plan on staying in Ukraine, they both pause and say almost at the same time: “As long as we have to.”", "authors": ["Tara John Anneclaire Stapleton Joseph Ataman", "Tara John", "Anneclaire Stapleton", "Joseph Ataman"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/31/pumpkin-boat-foie-gras-ban-library-raccoons-news-around-states/40513379/", "title": "Pumpkin boat, foie gras ban: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: A new facility has opened with the aim of reducing poverty and its effects on families. The Shoals Dream Center is envisioned as a hub for an array of services to aid the area’s families, The TimesDaily reports. Among them: providing food; academic tutoring and mentoring for at-risk kids. The center also plans to offer addiction recovery resources and life skills training. The Shoals Dream Center is an extension of the Chapel church. The social services components will offer after-school programs where students can engage in learning and developmental training, activities, and games three days per week, says Toyia Gourley, director of the Dream Center Academy. The food distribution is set up in the style of a supermarket, the newspaper reports.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The state agency overseeing air quality has agreed to submit a cleanup plan by mid-December for this city that has some of the nation’s most polluted winter air. A federal court judge, as part of a lawsuit, approved an agreement that set the deadline for the cleanup plan to be submitted by the state Department of Environmental Conservation to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Judge Thomas Zilly also approved a mid-January deadline for the EPA to make sure the plan complete. Clean air advocates sued in December, saying the state failed to submit a legally compliant plan to address particulate pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and other sources. Fine particulate is a pollutant that can cause heart and lung problems.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has announced it is changing its abbreviation from UA to UArizona in an effort to increase search engine optimization results for the college. The Tucson-based college in a statement Monday said the change would help distinguish the school from other national and international entities that use UA, including the University of Alabama, Under Armour and United Airlines. Officials say the southern Arizona school was not appearing high on Google results for “UA.” University officials say the college will now use UArizona for its communications. The college had already changed its Twitter handle to @uarizona. Officials say there are not yet any plans to use the new abbreviation on college merchandise or in chants at sporting events.\n\nArkansas\n\nJonesboro: An Arkansas State University alumnus says he was surprised to spot a few curious critters running around the campus library. Codie Clark, a math tutor, says he spotted at least two raccoons Sunday on the third floor of the university’s Dean B. Ellis Library while waiting for a student to arrive for a tutoring session. Clark says other students then cornered one raccoon. Associate Vice Chancellor for Marketing and Communications Bill Smith told KAIT-TV that the school’s facility management personnel humanely trapped the animals after being notified by library staff. Clark says an animal rescuer released the racoons back into the wild that night. Smith noted the raccoons likely came to campus because of recent rain. He encouraged anyone who encounters wild animals to contact the Facilities Management Department.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Some of the country’s largest ride-sharing companies proposed a state law Tuesday that would let them continue to treat drivers as independent contractors while also guaranteeing them a minimum wage and money for health insurance. The Legislature enacted legislation this year requiring such companies to treat drivers as employees, which would let them form a union and entitle them to benefits. But the law proposed Tuesday would exempt ride-sharing companies. The proposal must be approved by voters. If passed, it would supersede the Legislature’s action and any similar ordinances by local governments. It also would prevent lawmakers from passing another law to block it. The proposal will only get on the November 2020 ballot if supporters can gather about 660,000 signatures. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have already pledged $90 million to support the effort, making it one of the most expensive ballot measures ever.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Hundreds of state employees have prepared to have their emails eliminated to remove access to government records that would otherwise be public. The Denver Post reports the affected employees work for the Department of Regulatory Agencies, which regulates state industries including insurance, banks, electric utilities and real estate. Officials say the department’s 600 employees were notified multiple times of the upcoming purge set to begin Friday. Department officials say employees were instructed to preserve any vital emails, including pending litigation or existing open records requests. Officials say the purge is to ensure department emails are easily searchable. Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition says deletion of electronic records is a major problem for those seeking information. Colorado law gives state departments broad discretion in crafting their record-keeping policies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed an executive order that creates an entity charged with coming up with a plan for better coordination between state government agencies and the business community. The Democrat says he has a goal of transforming a workforce development system that’s currently designed to meet the needs of 20th-century jobs into one that serves 21st-century jobs. He says the state’s education and training system today is “too static and disconnected,” and there’s a need for better collaboration with business and labor so Connecticut’s teachers know what skills to teach. Lamont announced the creation of the Governor’s Workforce Council at Naugatuck Community College on Tuesday.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal magistrate is recommending dismissal of a lawsuit against Delaware State University officials by a woman who says she was sexually assaulted by a fellow student. The magistrate ruled Tuesday that the revised lawsuit by Mai-Ajah Keel is time-barred and that Keel has failed to state a claim. Keel says after she reported the assault in 2013, she was met with deliberate indifference by school officials and harassment and retaliation by her alleged attacker and other students. Keel’s alleged attacker, Jason Faustin, was charged in 2015 with fourth-degree rape. The charges were later dropped, but Faustin was suspended from campus after a school panel found him “responsible” for sexual assault. Faustin later served as an intern in the Dover office of Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: There was glam; there were costumes; there were high heels and a race. In a D.C. tradition that has made a statement since the 1980s, the 33rd Annual 17th Street High Heel Race took off Tuesday evening with a parade and race near Dupont Circle, WUSA-TV reports. The event is the district’s second-largest annual LGBTQ community event, filled with cheer as costumed drag queens and other participants race down the street. It was originally started by a group of 25 drag queens who decided to sprint down the road and strut their stuff. This year, the event brought out thousands of residents and visitors to join in on the fun. Even Mayor Muriel Bowser made an appearance at the event, serving as the grand marshal to kick off the celebration.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A memorial for the Pulse nightclub massacre will have a reflecting pool with rainbow-colored lines radiating from it, and a nearby museum will resemble a three-dimensional spirograph, according to design concepts announced Wednesday. Forty-nine people were killed and dozens more were injured when a gunman opened fire at the gay nightclub in June 2016. It was the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history until a gunman opened fire on Las Vegas concertgoers in 2017. The design concepts are only a starting point for discussions on the Pulse memorial and museum and are open to revisions, according to organizers. The designs were produced by several French architects and artists who worked with an Orlando architectural firm and a DePaul University professor. Plans call for the memorial to feature a garden with 49 trees in honor of the victims who were killed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials are moving forward with plans for some new parks in the city. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that the City Council last week approved the purchase of land from The Conservation Fund for a park in the Home Park neighborhood. The city will buy the land for a little more than $200,000. City officials also approved funding to purchase two properties for the $40 million Rodney Cook Sr. Park currently under construction in the Vine City neighborhood. The AJC says the park will feature 18 sculptures memorializing civil rights heroes, including Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Big Island neighborhood that was ravaged by the 2018 Kilauea volcano eruption has become a destination for tourists wanting to get a look at the damage caused by one of the largest eruptions in the volcano’s recent history. But the Hawaii Tribune Herald reports residents of the Leilani Estates neighborhood consider the visitors a nuisance and are relieved to see interest beginning to wane. Tourism increased as residents were trying to return to their homes and property after being forced to evacuate. More than 700 homes were destroyed. Leilani Estates Community Association president Andy Andrews says the number of tourists has fallen significantly since earlier this year, and there are fewer confrontations between locals and visitors, who he says ignore warning signs and parking rules.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Latino students make up 18% of the enrollment in the state’s public schools, but their achievement scores continue to lag state averages. The Idaho Statesman reports researchers and state officials say improving Latino students’ outcomes is an urgent need because of their importance to the state’s workforce. The Idaho Department of Education has set long-term goals to improve Latino outcomes. However, the department has left strategy for reaching those goals to districts and schools with little success in two years. Latino students are recording lower-than-average test scores and fewer postsecondary degrees. Rod Gramer, the CEO of Idaho Business for education, says if the Latino students are not successful, Idaho is not going to be successful.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s teachers union voted to approve a tentative contract agreement with city officials Wednesday but refused to end a strike that has canceled two weeks of classes unless the mayor adds school days to cover that lost time. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Wednesday night that she would not meet that demand. Lightfoot accused the union’s top leadership of “moving the goal posts” by raising the issue Wednesday rather than in a face-to-face meeting with her Tuesday. “Not once during that three-and-a-half-hour meeting did they raise compensation for strike days,” Lightfoot said heatedly. Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson said it would require cutting winter or spring break days or adding days to the end of the year. Union President Jesse Sharkey said the teachers are not asking to be paid for a strike but do credit the walkout for forcing the district to compromise on some contract issues.\n\nIndiana\n\nSeymour: John Mellencamp, the subject of a new mural in his hometown, endorsed the project by adding a few significant brushstrokes Tuesday afternoon. Indiana rock star Mellencamp painted his initials, “JJM,” on the exterior of a music store in Seymour, the community he immortalized in 1985 hit “Small Town.” Artist Pamela Bliss says Mellencamp was reserved and appreciative during his surprise visit, but he also flashed his signature ornery demeanor when Bliss offered a small paintbrush after he agreed to sign the work. “He said, ‘You call that a (expletive) brush? Give me another one,’ ” Bliss said, laughing. “I got a little piece of the real John right there.” Bliss says she’s a fan of Mellencamp’s paintings, some of which are currently on display at the Southern Indiana Center for the Arts in Seymour and at ACA Galleries in New York City.\n\nIowa\n\nWaukee: Authorities are investigating another explosion at a gender reveal party that happened one day after a blast at a similar gathering killed a 56-year-old woman in a nearby community. Authorities say no one was injured in the explosion Sunday in rural Waukee, a Des Moines suburb, but they are looking into unconfirmed claims that the blast broke a neighbor’s windows. Waukee Fire Capt. Tomme Tysdal says the Waukee explosion came from a commercially available gender reveal kit, unlike the homemade device that killed Pamela Kreimeyer on Saturday near Knoxville, a town 45 miles away. Authorities say Kreimeyer died instantly when her family’s device exploded, hitting her in the head from 45 feet away.\n\nKansas\n\nDodge City: A monkey that was injured last month trying to protect his offspring from being taken by an intruder during an apparent break-in at a zoo has died. Officials at the Wright Park Zoo say the 32-year-old tufted capuchin monkey was found unresponsive early Tuesday. City spokeswoman Abbey Martin says the zoo’s veterinarian was unable to revive the monkey, named Vern. The Hutchinson News reports a necropsy will be done to determine the cause of death. Vern underwent surgery for broken bones after the Sept. 3 break-in. A younger monkey named Pickett was found loose within the city limits and returned to the zoo. Vern and a female monkey named Charro arrived at the zoo in 1988. Their two youngest sons, Jack and Pickett, are part of the zoo’s current capuchin troop.\n\nKentucky\n\nMurray: Murray State University students are using GPS devices to track box turtles and learn about the technology’s value. Assistant wildlife biology professor Andrea Darracq says students work in the classroom to build the tracking devices and go into the field at an off-campus university property to locate the turtles. The university says the turtles are tracked with the GPS devices and a transmitter, allowing the students to determine a turtle’s location with a receiver and compare it to more precise GPS readings. The school says the capturing and marking of turtles was done with approval from its Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee and a state educational wildlife collection permit.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A $2.1 million research project at Tulane University is aimed at helping members of an American Indian tribe cope with climate change and economic inequality. In a news release, Tulane says the project aims to benefit the United Houma Nation. Challenges facing the south Louisiana tribe include coastal land loss that threatens fishing, trapping and even some homes. Part of the project will involve examining how tribal citizens move within and outside the state to manage these and other challenges. Tulane’s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine was awarded the project by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine’s Gulf Research Program.\n\nMaine\n\nGardiner: It looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and – if it gets a prosthetic leg – will once again walk like a duck. Loni Hamner, of Gardiner, recently adopted a female Mallard duck that was left with one leg and a stump after being attacked by a fox last year. Hamner says the duck she’s named Faith can hop and hobble around, but she wants her “to have a good duck quality of life and do all the things ducks like to do.” The Bangor Daily News reports that a query on the Maine Poultry Connection Facebook page led Hamner to the University of Maine Advanced Structure and Composites Center. Lab manager Paul Bussiere says he’ll create a prosthetic leg for Faith for free in his spare time.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Exelon Corp., the energy company that runs the Conowingo Dam, will invest more than $200 million in environmental projects, according to an agreement announced Tuesday by Gov. Larry Hogan. Officials have been focusing on how to address the environmental impact of trash and debris that has been swept downstream from Pennsylvania to Maryland through the dam after heavy rains. State officials also are concerned that sediment buildup behind the dam’s walls could be released and wreak havoc on the fragile Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The money in the proposed settlement will be used to improve water quality in the Lower Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay, the nation’s largest estuary, Hogan said. Parts of the agreement will be submitted for approval to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as part of the licensing renewal for the dam.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCarver: The cranberry industry is looking to solar power for relief as it struggles with plummeting fruit prices. Cranberry farmers in Massachusetts, the nation’s second-largest grower after Wisconsin, are proposing to build solar panels above their bogs. Jordan Macknick, an analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, says the novel approach to blending solar production with crop cultivation is being researched but hasn’t been tried before on a large scale anywhere in the world. Michael Wainio, a Massachusetts cranberry farmer proposing one of the projects, says revenue from solar power is essential to maintaining his family’s farm near Cape Cod. University of Massachusetts researchers have launched a study to examine the idea. Opponents argue there would be long-term environmental consequences.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The funeral for John Conyers, who served more than 50 years in Congress, will be held Monday at a church in the city. The public will get a chance to show their respect for Conyers on Saturday and Sunday at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. Conyers died Sunday at age 90, two years after resigning from the U.S. House. Monica Conyers tells The Detroit News that her husband’s funeral will be held at Greater Grace Temple. She anticipates former President Bill Clinton will attend, along with elected officials. On Twitter, Clinton called Conyers a “champion for justice & equality.” Conyers was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and is credited with creating the federal holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Data show that the University of Minnesota’s 2019 freshmen class is the biggest in 50 years and includes the most students of color in the school’s history. The Minnesota Daily reports the Office of Institutional Research’s numbers reveal that most freshmen – about 54% – are female. In 2010, 18% of the freshman class was students of color. Now, minority students make up more than a quarter of this year’s class. Vice provost and dean of the school’s Office of Undergraduate Education Bob McMaster says part of the rise is due to changes in Minnesota high schools, which have seen demographic shifts in recent years. Still, the number of black students remains relatively small. About 5% of new students are black, up slightly from over 4% a decade ago.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: With the nationwide closure of Fred’s Pharmacy, one county is taking it really hard. The residents of Kemper County in east-central Mississippi now find themselves without any pharmacy in the entire county. Residents will have to place and pick up prescriptions at pharmacies in Meridian or Philadelphia – about a 30-minute drive to each one. Mississippi Board of Pharmacy President Ryan Harper says that will be an issue for some of the state’s most critical patients. He says patients on multiple prescriptions also usually have a huge hurdle of having access to reliable transportation. Fred’s closed Oct. 18. It was located in the county seat, Dekalb, with a population of just over 1,000 residents.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The mayor is proposing an ordinance aimed at helping police keep firearms away from those with a history of domestic violence. The Kansas Star reports that the ordinance Quinton Lucas unveiled Wednesday would allow police to take firearms from domestic violence offenders or those who are the subject of restraining orders. A similar federal law exists, but backers say a local law would help police and prosecutors pursue the cases. Lucas and his staff wrote the proposal with help from the Rose Brooks Center, a shelter for victims of domestic violence. Shelter victim advocate Annie Struby says more than half of the most dangerous domestic abusers in Kansas City have access to firearms.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has spent more than $2 million on snow plowing so far this year, surpassing what costs were by this date for the past two years. The Independent Record reports snow plowing costs for the state Department of Transportation increased by more than 250% since last year. Department officials say they spent $575,577 from July 1 to Oct. 28 last year and $544,872 during the same period in 2017. Officials say record snowstorms have hit large regions just days into the fall season, breaking decades­long snowfall records in cities like Great Falls. Officials say about 277,800 miles have been plowed so far this season. Only a quarter of that was plowed this time last year. Officials say costs include labor, operating equipment and materials.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: Officials have begun the process to get the city’s downtown placed on the National Register of Historic Places. City officials convened an open house Monday to review the federal and state historic-district guidelines with members of an Omaha planning firm and the Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office. Omaha-based RDG will prepare North Platte’s nomination papers. Stephanie Rose, an urban planner for the firm, says residents are welcome to share their thoughts and historic information with her over the coming months. If the U.S. National Park Service adds downtown North Platte to the register, buildings that are at least 50 years old within the district could qualify for federal and state historic tax credits to help pay for rehabilitation projects.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s casinos took in nearly $1.06 billion in winnings last month – a high for 2019 and a record for September in a key index of state fiscal health. Nevada Gaming Control Board analyst Michael Lawton attributes Wednesday’s healthy “gaming win” report to an increase in slot machine play and results from Las Vegas Strip and Clark County casinos. Lawton says a 6.8% increase in the monthly figure compared with the same month a year ago was the fourth straight increase in the year-to-year comparison. The state took in almost $66.4 million in taxes on the September 2019 figures. The $1.059 billion tally topped the previous September best of $1.058 billion in 2007 by just $100,000. October 2007 was the best month ever for casino winnings, at $1.165 billion.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University System of New Hampshire has announced that tuition for in-state students will be frozen in place for the 2020-2021 academic year. The Concord Monitor reports that the state board of trustees announced Tuesday that it had unanimously voted to freeze tuition for undergraduate students. The freeze will go into effect for students at the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Keene State College and Granite State College. The New Hampshire House recently increased the state’s appropriation to the university system by $12 million over two years to freeze tuition. Gov. Chris Sununu called the announcement a “big win for New Hampshire students.” This is the system’s first tuition freeze since 2013.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWoodbridge: A small plane crashed through the roof of a home Tuesday, killing the pilot and causing an explosion that set two houses ablaze in a New Jersey suburb of New York City. No one was in the home in which the Cessna 414 crashed, but flames spread to another house, where a woman escaped injury, Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac said. The plane went down about 11 a.m. not far from an elementary school, according to National Transportation Safety Board investigator Adam Gerhardt. The crash sent flames into the air, belched smoke for hours and left neighbors thinking the earth was shaking. Gerhardt said the pilot was flying using instrument flight rules typically used by experienced pilots when flying with reduced visibility. The weather in the area was cloudy and misty at the time of the crash.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. House has approved legislation that would prohibit oil and gas development on federal land surrounding a national park held sacred by numerous Native American tribes. The vote came Wednesday to make permanent a buffer around Chaco Culture National Historical Park. U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico says there are some areas where drilling should not take place, and the area around Chaco is one of them. Aside from prohibiting new permits and canceling any existing nonproducing leases, the measure suggests additional studies and protective measures should be taken to address health, safety and environmental effects on nearby communities and tribal interests. The area includes land belonging to the Navajo Nation and individual tribal members. The legislation does not affect those parcels.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that bans restaurants and grocery stores from selling foie gras, the fattened liver of a duck or goose, considered a culinary delicacy for centuries. The bill, expected to be signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, would forbid the sale of the French specialty starting in 2022. Animal welfare activists had campaigned for a ban on the grounds that the methods used to produce foie gras are cruel, involving force-feeding a bird a corn-based mixture through a tube slipped down its throat. Farmers who produce foie gras – meaning fatty liver in French – say the birds are treated humanely and don’t suffer during the fattening process. The council vote was 42-6 for the final version of the bill that calls for a fine of up to $2,000 for each violation. With about 1,000 New York restaurants offering foie gras, top chefs did not take kindly to the news, including Momofuku’s David Chang, who called it “idiocracy.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSpencer: The state has received a federal grant to renovate a 1920s rail car that was built to comply with the racist Jim Crow laws of the 20th century. State officials say the National Park Service awarded a grant of more than $287,000 to renovate the railroad car that’s now at the N.C. Transportation Museum in Spencer. The 44-seat coach hasn’t been used since 1969. The car has 22 seats in the rear that were designated for African Americans so that it complied with segregation laws. It needs extensive renovation, including asbestos removal. The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources says it’s one of few such cars held by a museum for public viewing. Another one is at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor is retracting an audit critical of the city of Williston after officials provided more information to the state. Auditor Josh Gallion issued the audit report Monday but retracted it late Tuesday. Gallion says the audit “highlighted several areas of concern,” including a violation of the state’s open meetings law and $92 million in airport contracts that were not disclosed in financial statements. Gallion says the city auditor signed off on the report last week. But Gallion says the city has now provided more information for review. Gallion says auditors are reviewing the new information and will issue a revised audit later.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A federal civil rights lawsuit says a 10-year-old Muslim boy was questioned about his patriotism and religious beliefs by a student teacher at a school outside Cleveland and was ordered to undress to determine whether his parents had abused him. The lawsuit filed last week says the boy’s teacher, the student teacher and a nurse for the Lakeview Local School District in Cortland held him against his will in a room last November and coerced him into saying he’d been disciplined by his mother with a belt. Family attorney Matthew Abens says a county children’s services investigation quickly determined there was no wrongdoing by his parents. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, says the boy is being treated for trauma.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials say the frequency of congenital syphilis cases has risen sharply in the state during the past five years and continues to increase. The Oklahoma Department of Health said Tuesday that the state has experienced a 283% increase in the number of congenital syphilis cases among women since 2014 and a 92% increase since last year. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact, but health officials say congenital syphilis can be transmitted by an infected mother to her baby in the womb or through the birthing process. The disease can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, birth defects and death. Officials say health care providers should test pregnant women for the disease early in their pregnancy and again early in the third trimester.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The number of wolves in the state is growing, but not particularly fast. State biologists tallied a minimum of 124 wolves statewide last year, according to the annual wolf report released Wednesday. The number represented an 11% increase over the previous year, but only a growth of 14 animals since 2015. Four wolves were killed illegally in 2017, and another five were killed due to conflict with livestock. Wolves continued to expand their territory. A pair of resident wolves were documented in the Mount Hood area for the first time, meaning the apex predator has a foothold in every region of the state except the coast. Oregon is home to at least 12 wolf packs, according to the report, including 11 that have a breeding male and female with at least two pups that survived the winter.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBethlehem: A prosecutor says he will recommend dismissal of charges against a woman authorities say handed her 1-month-old baby to a bus driver and walked away in tears. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said Wednesday that 26-year-old Ashley Walters “clearly has some mental health issues.” He said she had displayed combative and erratic behavior and would be involuntarily committed for treatment. Walters was charged with child endangerment after authorities said she boarded a bus in Bethlehem, placed her son on the farebox and told the driver to call police because “this was her son that she can’t take care of.” Pennsylvania’s Safe Haven Law allows babies up to 28 days old to be left at a hospital or police station. Morganelli says Walters’ baby was 32 days old.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city has come up with what it calls a “climate justice plan” to reduce its carbon footprint while accounting for the needs of low-income and minority neighborhoods. The plan unveiled Friday by the city’s Office of Sustainability and Racial and Environmental Justice Committee includes getting 100% of municipal buildings’ electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and making all city vehicles and school buses run on renewable energy by 2040. Priorities outlined in the 88-page plan include planting more trees and expanding green spaces; investing in bike paths, trails and sidewalk improvements; and eliminating food waste. The plan says neighborhoods with the largest populations of people of color and lowest median incomes have the most pollution, the severe health effects from environmental causes, and the least amount of green space.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Environmental groups are taking steps toward suing a company they say is responsible for polluting the state’s waters with tiny plastic beads. News outlets report the groups represented by Southern Environmental Law Center sent Frontier Logistics a 60-day legal notice Monday on grounds it violated the Clean Water Act. The state environmental control department cited Frontier in July after the plastic bits, called nurdles, were found in its facility and thought to be the same ones spilled onto Sullivan’s Island. Environmental groups say they’re still washing up. But Frontier’s vice president contends the nurdles can’t be traced to it. An environmental control spokeswoman said Frontier installed preventative measures, so the agency closed the matter. The pellets are turned into plastic products, and environmentalists say marine animals mistake them for food.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: University leaders tell state lawmakers they’re working to implement a new law aimed at ensuring free speech and intellectual diversity on campus. A legislative committee summoned regents and university presidents to a meeting Wednesday to detail their efforts to comply with the law. Its passage last spring came after controversy over a “Hawaiian Day” party theme at the University of South Dakota revived conservative lawmakers’ complaints about political correctness on campus. The university presidents said they’re holding trainings for students and faculty on protecting speech. They say they’re also working to gauge students’ experiences on campus. The Board of Regents is required to give a written report on its implementation of the law by Dec. 1.\n\nTennessee\n\nCleveland: You’ve heard of a pumpkin being turned into a carriage, but what about into a boat? Justin Ownby has tried for years to grow the perfect giant pumpkin, with limited success. This year, though, he outdid himself. “We’ve pumpkin spiced everything else; why not pumpkin spice a boat?” he said. Ownby, 36, owns a family farm in Cleveland with his wife, Christin, 32, and their four children. A massive pumpkin in his patch grew to more than 900 pounds and several feet across this year, big enough to carve out space for a grown man to sit inside it and paddle across a pond – before it sank under him. “It’s fish food now,” Ownby said with a laugh. “There’s catfish in there. They’ll make short work of that thing.”\n\nTexas\n\nHarlingen: The critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle had an offseason for nesting this year along beaches in the state, with 190 nests recorded in Texas. The Valley Morning Star reports the number, which covers a geographic area from the Bolivar Peninsula south to Boca Chica beach, was down from 250 nests logged last year and 353 in 2017. But this year’s sharp drop-off in Kemp’s ridley nesting in Mexico has set off yellow-flag alerts among scientists who track and study the species. The Texas nesting numbers were not necessarily poor by the standards of the past decade, and they tend to fluctuate because adult females don’t return to their home beach every year to lay a clutch of eggs. Recent studies show female Kemp’s ridleys may come back to nest at three-plus-year intervals.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state liquor commission has announced it is running out of bar licenses for potential business owners again after a similar shortage two years ago. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control handed out its last 2019 bar permits Tuesday to two establishments in Lehi and West Valley City. Department authorities say five other business were placed on the waiting list, some of them planning to open in November and December. Officials say businesses must wait for a population increase after applying due to a state law allowing one bar for every 10,200 people. Officials say three permits are expected before July 2020 following new population information. Some owners say the Legislature should review the population quota.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has named a new poet laureate. Republican Gov. Phil Scott appointed Mary Ruefle to the honorary position this week. WCAX-TV reports she was recommended by a panel of judges. The poet laureate is picked every four years and serves as the state’s ambassador for the art of poetry, participating in ceremonies and readings in Vermont and nationwide. Ruefle said at the ceremony Monday that she was honored to join the ranks of those who served before her and was humbled and scared. She said she’s used to that and said that’s how she feels in the face of poetry and as “a member of that tribe.” Chard Deniord was the state’s last poet laureate. Robert Frost served as Vermont’s first in 1961.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats hoping to seize control of the Legislature in next month’s elections say passing the long-stalled Equal Rights Amendment will be a top priority next year. Passed by Congress in 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment would ban discrimination on the basis of sex, explicitly enshrining equality for women in the U.S. Constitution. Thirty-seven states have ratified it, and advocates say having 38 would meet the constitutional threshold for approval, though it would also likely spark court battles over a long-passed ratification deadline and other legal questions. Other states are working toward ratification, but advocates say the once solidly conservative Virginia, where every seat is on the ballot in November, appears closest. The measure has cleared Virginia’s GOP-controlled Senate before but stalled in the House, which Republicans also narrowly control.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: County officials have announced a proposal to turn a jail into a homeless shelter and use an additional sales tax for funding. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports the proposal would convert the 288-bed jail into a multi-care facility named the Yakima County Care Campus. Yakima County commissioners say the 0.3% countywide sales tax that generates more than $3.5 million a year could fund the care facility with commissioner approval. Officials say commissioners are expected to hold a city hall meeting Oct. 29 to decide. Commissioners say the facility would offer mental health services, substance abuse treatment and long-term housing. Officials say an 8,000-square-foot storage building on the jail’s property would be used as permanent shelter. Commissioners expect to fully convert the facility by 2026.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRichwood: An 11-foot python that was on the loose was found Tuesday, about a month after it got out of its tank, broke through a window screen and slithered outside. Richwood Police Chief Charles Burkhamer says a letter carrier saw the snake laying out in the sun next to a roadway Tuesday, about a block away from where it escaped a month ago. Authorities had been scouring the area trying to find the reptile, and Richwood residents had been notified to keep watch over small children and house pets. Burkhamer said he faced a practical question as he looked at the massive snake on the side of the road. “What am I going to do with it?” he wondered. “We didn’t have a dog crate big enough.” So Burkhamer stuck the snake in a trash can for safekeeping until it could be returned to its owner, who has been asked to register the animal with state officials and reinforce the reptile’s tank.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state has the widest achievement gap between black and white students of any state based on results of a test known as the nation’s report card. The National Assessment of Educational Progress test results released Wednesday show no significant change from statewide results a decade ago. However, declining scores for the lowest-performing students resulted in Wisconsin having the widest achievement gap of any state. State superintendent of schools Carolyn Stanford Taylor says the achievement gap is a crisis, and closing the gaps is “imperative for our state.” The test was given to students in fourth and eighth grades last spring. Wisconsin’s scores were higher than the national averages in both grades and in both subjects.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Farmers in the state are wrapping up a difficult year for sugar beets. A cold snap followed by a week of mild temperatures is threatening the harvest in the Bighorn Basin. A freeze followed by a thaw causes liquids to run out and spoil other beets when they’re stacked in piles. It also lowers the sugar content and price for beets. The Cody Enterprise reports a summer hailstorm and rainy weather also made for a difficult year. Farmer Cody Easum says harvest size and sugar content are both low this year. A local beet pile is growing by about 1,200 tons per day, down from 3,000-4,000 tons in a typical year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/23/rockets-last-blast-alaska-drought-million-dollar-ham-news-around-states/39999057/", "title": "Rocket's last blast, Alaska drought, million-dollar ham: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A Japanese automotive supplier plans to build a more than $60 million plant that will hire about 200 people. A statement from the governor’s office said Vuteq USA will produce parts for the Mazda-Toyota assembly plant being built in Limestone County. Construction on the Vuteq is scheduled to begin in October. The plant is expected to reach full employment in 2021. The factory will make plastic-injected parts and assemblies for vehicles. A partnership between Mazda and Toyota is spending about $1.6 billion on the Huntsville car factory, which will have as many as 4,000 workers. It’s supposed to produce as many as 300,000 vehicles when it opens in two years.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula has gone without rain for more than three weeks, although experts believe some precipitation could arrive this weekend, a report said. Kenai and the central peninsula have not received a measurable amount of rain since July, The Peninsula Clarion reported Tuesday.Rainfall was last measured at 1 inch between July 26 and July 28, officials said. Kodiak Island is also experiencing a drought. Kodiak officials issued a statement Monday asking residents to take steps to help avoid a water supply shortage. Kodiak receives its water from the Pillar Creek Reservoir and the Monashka Reservoir. The Monashka supplies an average of 6.3 million gallons of water per day, officials said. The dry weather has created conditions beneficial to wildland fires. The Swan Lake Fire near Sterling, which grew more than 62 square miles in recent days, was aided by dry, windy conditions, officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The National Weather Service tweeted that Phoenix broke its heat record for Aug. 20 on Tuesday afternoon, reaching a high of 113 degrees just after 2 p.m. The previous record was 112 degrees in 1986. Isaac Smith, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, told The Arizona Republic that the unusually high temperatures were the result of a high-pressure system. Smith said this was the second time Phoenix saw record-breaking heat this month, with the previous being on Aug. 5 with a high of 115 degrees, breaking the record of 114 degrees set in 1969. Smith advised people to limit the time they spend outside as much as possible. He also advised people to always check the backseat of their vehicle to avoid leaving children or pets inside.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas met with Twin Lakes Area business leaders at a round-table discussion held Tuesday at Arkansas State University-Mountain Home. The Republican began his day by touring the North Arkansas College Technical Center in Harrison and held a lunchtime roundtable with the Boone County Chamber of Commerce before traveling east for the ASU-MH roundtable and a tour of Baxter International. Cotton, who lives in Dardanelle, spent 45 minutes Thursday afternoon at the Vada Sheid Community Development Center meeting with more than 30 representatives from area businesses. Some of the subjects covered at the discussion included the availability of workers, government regulations on smaller banks and partnerships between educational facilities and local manufacturers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPorterville: Visitors to Sequoia National Forest in the southern Sierra Nevada area are being cautioned about the growth of a native plant that can cause severe irritation similar to poison oak and poison ivy. The U.S. Forest Service said poodle-dog bush appears in areas that have recently been burned by wildfire, which has been occurring more frequently in the forest and Giant Sequoia National Monument. Swelling, rashes and itching appear 12 hours to two days after contact and blisters can last longer than two weeks. The plant is covered in sticky hairs which can be easily passed on to passing hikers. Poodle-dog bush can grow almost 10 feet high and has purple, bell-shaped flowers. It emits an unpleasant, slightly pungent odor. It was recently found in the forest’s Converse Basin area.\n\nColorado\n\nBailey: A mountain lion attacked and injured an 8-year-old boy outside his rural home, prompting state wildlife officials to set traps and use search dogs to find the lion. Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesman Jason Clay said the boy was bitten on the head at about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in a rural subdivision near Bailey, southwest of Denver. The boy was hospitalized. His identity and the severity of his injuries were not made public. It’s the third attack by a mountain lion on a person in Colorado this year. A mountain lion last week attacked a hunter who fought it off with a pocket knife. And in February, a mountain lion attacked a runner who choked and bludgeoned it to death.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBloomfield: An animal rights organization is putting up advertisements in Connecticut to remember a calf that was slaughtered in public. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are running the ads on buses in Hartford for the next four weeks to honor a calf killed behind a Home Depot in Bloomfield. On July 13, a calf escaped the Saba Live Poultry butcher shop in Bloomfield and workers chased the animal to the back of hardware store parking lot where a worker slit the animal’s throat. The halal method of killing an animal includes cutting the throat. The incident sparked outrage and racist comments online against the halal butcher shop. The worker who killed the animal is expected to appear in court on charges related to animal cruelty.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Lifeguards drew criticism for placing a 4-foot-long dying shark into a trash can, but a beach official said the guards acted in the interest of public safety. The Delaware News Journal reported an unresponsive shark that washed up on Rehoboth Beach over the weekend drew a crowd of onlookers, some of which were unhappy when guards disposed of it in a lined bin. Beach Patrol Captain Kent Buckson said putting the shark in the can “wasn’t the right thing,” but that it was the only option for limiting beachgoers’ contact with the lesion-covered fish with a possible parasite infection. He added that lifeguards usually would put it into a trash bag until public works could bury it, but the guards didn’t have a bag that day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: George Washington University has announced that it plans to phase out fixed tuition for incoming on-campus undergraduate students. WTOP-FM reported the school will start setting tuition rates on an annual basis starting fall 2020. A school statement released Monday said that a review of “the undergraduate experience” led the university to decide the fixed tuition program isn’t realizing “the potential envisioned.” The statement doesn’t provide further detail on what school officials initially envisioned the program would do or how it falls short of that vision. It said the nixed program will lead to an increase in available funds for improving the “student experience.” The school said it will take into account any changes in attendance cost when reviewing need-based financial aid packages.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral: A rocket that’s the last of its kind delivered the newest, most powerful GPS satellite to orbit for the Air Force on Thursday. United Launch Alliance’s Delta IV medium-class rocket blasted into a hazy morning sky from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It was a fitting swan song for the rocket. Two hours later, the satellite separated from the upper stage and the company declared success. The Delta IV Medium ended its 17-year run with 29 launches. Denver-based United Launch Alliance said it will be replaced by the still-in-development Vulcan rocket. The Delta IV Heavy, meanwhile, will continue to soar. The newly launched GPS satellite is the second in a series of next-generation navigation spacecraft. It’s nicknamed Magellan after the 16th-century Portuguese explorer. Lockheed Martin, also based in Colorado, built the satellite.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia secretary of state’s office said Tuesday that it plans to reexamine the state’s new election system as required by law after receiving a request from voters. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced last month that the state plans to buy a $106 million election system from Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems. He certified the new system on Aug. 9 and said it will be in place in time for the March 24 primaries. The new system includes touchscreen voting machines that produce a paper record, including a human-readable summary of the voter’s selections and a machine-readable code used by a scanner to tally the votes. A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,450 Georgia voters was submitted Monday to Raffensperger’s office. It says the Dominion system doesn’t meet the requirements of Georgia’s voting system certification rules and doesn’t comply with the state election code. Georgia law allows voters to request that the secretary of state “reexamine any such device previously examined and approved by him or her” as long as at least 10 voters sign onto the request.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A woman was taken to a hospital Tuesday after being bitten twice by a shark while swimming, authorities said. The woman, 27, was reported to be in “good health” and was expected to be released after a shark bit her while she was swimming in Kealakekua Bay on the Big Island’s western side, leaving her with injuries to her lower back and right hip, police said. Officials didn’t provide her name. Soon after the woman was taken to a hospital in serious condition, preliminary information provided to firefighters listed her age as 26 and that the shark bit her in one of her legs and her torso, Hawaii Fire Department Battalion Chief William Bergin said. She was about 50 yards from shore, he said. Bergin didn’t know if she’s a tourist or a Hawaii resident. Police said witnesses described the shark as having a gray tip. Bergin said he was told it’s possibly a 6-foot black-tip reef shark.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A conservation group and hunting technology group said 110 square miles of state-owned land isn’t accessible because there’s no public access. The Idaho Statesman reported Tuesday that the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership and onX published the report after examining data. Idaho manages about 3,750 square miles of endowment lands it received in 1890 when it became a state. The groups also said Idaho has about 305 square miles of federal public land that’s inaccessible. Idaho contains about 54,000 square miles of federal public land. The Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership and onX said some access to public land with easements that aren’t documented might exist.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A lawyer said he city has benefited from 22,000 uncashed checks worth $11 million, some going back to the 1980s. The Chicago Sun-Times reported attorney Clint Krislov made the discovery through a public-records request during a legal dispute between the city and retirees. He said Chicago is supposed to notify the state of Illinois if a check from the city is uncashed after three years. The state has a website for people to look for unclaimed property. The checks include a $44,000 payment in 1991 to Commonwealth Edison. The Sun-Times apparently didn’t cash five small checks from the city. Law department spokesman Bill McCaffrey said Chicago is not bound by the state’s unclaimed property law and has its own procedures for uncashed checks. He didn’t elaborate.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Some jobs are melting at an ice cream distribution center in Fort Wayne. Nestle Dreyer’s Ice Cream said 40 jobs are being cut, but a large workforce will remain in place. A spokeswoman, Laura Davenport, said the state had been mistakenly told that an ice cream plant and distribution center would close. Nestle said it’s switching to a warehouse model of delivery. The Journal Gazette reported that Nestle acquired a majority stake in Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream in 2002. Dreyer’s ice cream is sold under the Dreyer’s brand in the western United States and as Edy’s in the east.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The National Weather Service said a tornado that damaged or destroyed several buildings in rural Warren County on Tuesday morning was rated an EF3, with peak winds of 150 mph. It touched down near Lacona and ran for nearly 6 miles. It damaged the Iowa Operator and Engineers training facility. No deaths or injuries have been reported. The Des Moines Register reported that another tornado spotted Tuesday touched down a little before 6:25 a.m. near Tracy. It was rated an EF1, with peak winds of 110 mph. It damaged several roofs and trees but didn’t injure anyone.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Large-scale wind power developments would not be allowed and commercial solar installations would be restricted in Sedgwick County under a proposal approved Wednesday by the county commission. The Sedgwick County Commission made the decision to protect aviation interests after planner Dave Yearout told commissioners that large windmills can affect airport and flight operations within a 5-mile radius, The Wichita Eagle reported. A map showing a 10-mile radius drawn around every airport and private landing strip in the county left only four small areas that would not be affected by a wind farm: in the extreme southwest, northwest and northeast corners of the county, and a small strip of land south of Clearwater. Yearout told the Associated Press that the large number of aviation facilities in the county, coupled with increasing nonagricultural development in rural areas and training activities at McConnell Air Force Base, makes large scale wind farms incompatible with the county’s needs.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Attendees of an annual breakfast and charity auction hosted by the Kentucky Farm Bureau were hamming it up with their bids for a prized meat Thursday morning. And with a winning bid of $1million, a Central Bank representative walked away with the Grand Champion Ham of the 2019 Kentucky State Fair. For comparison: you can buy about four 2019 Ferrari Portofinos for that, according to caranddriver.com. (The car is priced at about $215,000). Luther Deaton, the chairman, president and CEO of Central Bank, purchased the winning ham. Central Bank has branch locations across Kentucky. This is not Central Bank's first time betting big on the prized ham. Central Bank and Dr. Mark Lynn won the auction in 2018, each putting $1.4 million toward the ham for a record $2.8 million purchase. Since the start of the auction in 1964, the Kentucky Farm Bureau has raised about $13 million for charity. Blake Penn, of Penn's Country Hams, produced this year's winning ham.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A summer filled with train disruptions has reached its end as Amtrak will restore full service on its Chicago-to-New Orleans line. The McComb Enterprise-Journal reported the line was restored Wednesday after months of terminating in Jackson, Mississippi. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said the opening of the Bonnet Carre spillway near New Orleans cut off service to the city because the tracks are on the flood plain. He said riders were put on buses in Jackson to complete the route to New Orleans. Magliari said track maintenance in parts of Mississippi also lead to ride disruptions going south from Memphis, Tennessee. Amtrak is offering buy-one, get-one fares to celebrate the restoration of full service. Magliari said he’s glad passengers are off the buses and can now experience a real train ride.\n\nMaine\n\nHartland: Officials said they are trying to stop a rat infestation that has hampered their community for more than six months. Hartland residents said garbage and manure left at one home attracted dozens of rats. Resident Michelle Cole told WGME that rats have bitten her dog three times. The rats have also bitten several neighbors. Neighbors voiced their concerns at a town council meeting on Monday. WABI reported that the home is located next to Somerset Elementary School, so the town is aiming to solve the problem before the school year begins next Tuesday. The town manager and attorney said they are working to find a solution, but they are still not sure if the property has been abandoned.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: On July 28, Jeff Wright did something no other angler had done in nearly 35 years. He broke the state record for heaviest mahi-mahi, reeling in a 72.8-pounder. But less than a month later, another massive dolphinfish was caught, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources declared a new record had been set in the mahi-mahi division. Kristy Frashure of Pasadena caught a 74.5-pounder on board the Haulin N’ Ballin as a participant in the Poor Girls Open fishing tournament. The catch gave Frashure first place in the dolphin category, weighing nearly 35 pounds more than the runner-up. “It took nearly 20-30 minutes to reel in … it felt like an eternity,” Frashure said in a news release. “We were taking bets on how much it weighed.” The department maintains state records for sport fish in four divisions – Atlantic, Chesapeake, Nontidal and Invasive – and awards plaques to anglers who achieve record catches, according to a release. Fish caught from privately owned, fee-fishing waters are ineligible for consideration.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gambling regulators said Massachusetts took in more than $23 million in taxes during the first full month in which all three of the state’s licensed casinos were open. The July revenue report released Thursday by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission sid the Wynn Resorts-owned Encore Boston Harbor casino, which opened in late June, took in about $48.6 million in revenue from table games and slots. MGM Springfield, open since last August, reported about $20.4 million from table games and slots and the Plainridge casino, which does not have table games, reported $12.5 million in revenue. Gambling revenues at Encore and MGM are taxed at 25%, and the Plainridge slots parlor is taxed at 49%. State officials expect to take in nearly $300 million in casino taxes during the current fiscal year.\n\nMichigan\n\nHowell: Authorities have released the names of two men who were killed in a small plane crash in southeastern Michigan. The Livingston County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday that the men who were killed were 68-year-old James Tafralian, of Webberville and 64-year-old Philip Henry Colmer of Chelsea. The Federal Aviation Administration said the single-engine Aero Commander M200 aircraft was taking off at Spencer J. Hardy Airport near Howell when it crashed Tuesday morning. Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy said the plane was landing when it crashed. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota Department of Public Safety officials said officers cited 678 drivers across the state during the first week of a hands-free cellphone law. The Star Tribune reported that officers handed out 286 citations in Hennepin County, or about 40% of the total tickets issued. State Patrol Lt. Gordon Shank said he hopes to see the number of citations decline as people realize police are pulling over drivers who fail to put down their devices while behind the wheel. He said he issued a warning to a driver from out of state who didn’t know about the law. Minnesota became the 19th state with a hands-free law when it took effect Aug. 1. Fines are $50 for the first offense and $275 for each subsequent violation, plus court costs.\n\nMississippi\n\nAmory: A new company has begun making boats in northeast Mississippi and hired 75 people. Avid Boats in Amory said it’s investing $1.6 million to make aluminum bass boats and center console bay boats. Avid plans to make 750 boats next year and 1,500 annually by 2022. President Phillip Faulkner previously founded Amory boat maker NauticStar. Mississippi Development Authority spokeswoman Tammy Craft said the state is giving Avid $218,000 for building improvements and $75,000 for worker training. Amory and Monroe County are giving property tax breaks estimated at $400,000 over 10 years. Avid will be eligible for a state worker income tax rebate because average workers will earn more than $43,300 a year. Avid could collect $1.3 million over 10 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Two hippo sisters are getting ready to return to their newly remodeled home in Colorado after spending nearly two years at a Missouri zoo. The Springfield News-Leader reported that the hippos came to the Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield in October 2017 because the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs needed a place to put them while it created a new habitat. The Springfield zoo had space for the sisters, named Zambezi and Kasai, because its beloved Henry the hippo was moved in 2016 to a new $8 million enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo. The Springfield zoo’s spokeswoman, Joey Powell, said the sisters were originally just supposed to spend a year in Missouri but construction delays made the stay last longer. She said they’ve been on “an extended vacation.”\n\nMontana\n\nKlaispell: Glacier National Park has reopened three trails days after they were closed because of grizzly bear activity. The Flathead Beacon reported that officials have reopened the Highline, Loop and Swiftcurrent Pass trails in the Granite Park area. Officials said the Granite Park Campground area remains closed. Park staff received several reports from visitors of encounters with a bear or bears Sunday. The park said the behavior was consistent with bears being disturbed and frustrated by humans. Officials at the park said visitors should remain aware and watch for signs indicating bear activity and take precautions, including carrying bear spray.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials at Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium said Tuesday that a 21-year-old rhino, Marina, was euthanized Monday after surgeons discovered an inoperable colonic obstruction. She was being treated for symptoms similar to colic when staffers noticed that she appeared lethargic. The 4,000-pound rhino arrived at the zoo in 1999. Her death leaves the zoo with another female and a male. White rhinos are listed as near-threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. In the wild, most white rhinos live in South Africa.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A team of researchers from the Desert Research Institute detected microplastics at several locations around Lake Tahoe earlier this year. Microplastics, a term for tiny pieces of plastic that come from everything from water bottles to synthetic fleece sweaters, are ubiquitous around the world, so it’s not surprising to find them in Lake Tahoe. Still, researchers are digging deeper into the issue to learn more about potential ramifications for Nevada. The study of microplastics is relatively new but their ubiquity is alarming to scientists. They have been found in fish in the oceans and raining down from the sky in the Pyrenees. The work at Lake Tahoe is part of an effort the DRI Foundation funded to learn more about microplastics in Nevada. In addition to lakes and streams in the Tahoe Basin, the Las Vegas wash in southern Nevada, which drains into Lake Mead, is being studied.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSunapee: A woman has celebrated her 111th birthday in New Hampshire with a bunch of cupcakes and a tribute from singers. Hazel Nilson was born Aug. 21, 1908, in Chicago. A lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, she liked to say she was born the last time the team won the World Series before their big comeback in 2016. Nilson, a former physical education teacher, has been a resident of Sunapee Cove since October 2014. Before that, she lived in Stone Lake, Wisconsin. Wearing a cake-shaped hat, Nilson sampled a peach cupcake at her party Wednesday. The Sunapee Singers sang “Take Me out to the Ball Game” in her honor. When asked if she has any secret to her longevity, she said smile, enjoy life and don’t fret.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPemberton Township: Officials believe off-road vehicle riders in New Jersey’s Pinelands ripped up 400 trees days after they were planted by teenagers. Jason Howell of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance told NJ.com he returned to the site to install barriers at the Bucks Cove Run Preserve in Pemberton Township and found the site “completely torn up” and a trash fire still smoldering. Off-road vehicle tracks were on the ground. The state Environmental Protection Department said it is aware of the vandalism and park police at nearby Brendan T. Byrne State Forest are increasing enforcement. Off-road vehicles are prohibited on Pinelands land managed by nonprofits and the state. However, licensed and registered vehicles can be driven on roadways.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New restrictions on wildlife foot traps and wire snares are being proposed by New Mexico Game and Fish officials amid conflicts arising from trapping traditions, evolving attitudes about animal suffering and outdoor enthusiasts with dogs. The agency that oversees trapping rules and regulations on Thursday suggested a prohibition on traps and snares for public lands on the outskirts of Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Cruces and Taos. It also suggested a half-mile no-trapping buffer at certain hiking trailheads, as well as training requirements for trappers. The proposal initiates a monthslong rulemaking process with opportunities for public comment. Rule changes are decided by the New Mexico State Game Commission, appointed by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. Trapping regulations hold implications for wildlife and recreation across an estimated 30 percent of New Mexico.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A top-rated New York City pizza restaurant has reopened two days after it was shuttered by state officials over unpaid taxes. The New York Post reported that Brooklyn’s Di Fara Pizza reopened Thursday after its owners worked out a payment plan to settle a $167,000 tax bill. Di Fara opened in 1965 and has long been a favorite with New Yorkers and out-of-town visitors. Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Thursday that he was glad “the best slice in town” would be around “for years to come.” The Democratic mayor had tweeted Wednesday that he wanted to help resolve Di Fara’s tax situation. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on TV station NY1 that the resolution of the restaurant’s tax dispute is “the perfect outcome from everyone’s point of view.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judicial panel ruled Thursday that a mentally ill man who wore a Superman-like cape in police interviews and compared himself to Dracula did not kill a North Carolina college student in a dorm 40 years ago. Three judges declared James Blackmon, 66, innocent in the death of Helena Payton, who was stabbed in the neck in a dormitory bathroom of what is now St. Augustine’s University in Raleigh in September 1979. The ruling, which is final, came as part of the unique process under which the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission rules on innocence claims from convicted people and sends the cases it finds credible to a three-judge panel. Prison officials said, following the exoneration, that they were working Thursday afternoon to release Blackmon, who was serving a life sentence for second-degree murder.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s Health Department disregarded its own policy in updating the volume of pipeline spill at a natural gas processing plant. In July 2015, Oneok Partners reported a 10-gallon spill of natural gas condensate from a pipeline at a plant near Watford City. The estimated size of the spill was never updated, even as Oneok updated the state on cleanup. In October, Oneok told the state it had recovered 240,000 gallons of the liquid gas. State Environmental Quality Chief Dave Glatt said Thursday that a spill report should have been made public to reflect the severity of the spill. It’s also unclear whether promised quarterly inspections of the site have been done in the past two years. Glatt said he is investigating whether the inspections occurred.\n\nOhio\n\nLordstown: An Ohio electricity company said it is canceling plans to build a gas-fired power plant because of the state’s recent nuclear bailout. The Vindicator reported that the plant would have been Clean Energy Future’s third in Lordstown in northeastern Ohio. The company had spent more than $1 million in development and permitting costs. The company’s president, Bill Siderewicz, said the gas-fired plant would have produced $29 billion of economic benefit over its 50-year lifespan, as well as full-time jobs, local supplies and services. Siderewicz said plans were canceled because of the recent passage of a bill that gives $150 million a year to nuclear power plants near Cleveland and Toledo. State Rep. Gil Blair called Siderewicz’s announcement “certainly not good news.” Lordstown is in Blair’s district.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: The Cherokee Nation’s newly elected chief formally announced his plan to send a delegate to the U.S. House, but acknowledged the first such attempt by a tribal nation will take time, as well as cooperation from Congress. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. on Thursday called on Congress to recognize the tribe’s right to a delegate outlined in two treaties with the U.S. government and the tribe’s constitution. Hoskin sent a letter last week to the tribe’s governing council announcing his plan to nominate Kimberly Teehee, a former adviser to President Barack Obama. Republican U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a Cherokee Nation citizen, said in a statement the Cherokee’s plan was “unprecedented,” but said he supports tribal sovereignty and that treaties must be honored.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Cremated remains found in a mortuary box on a Portland street belong to a World War II veteran who lived in a house that hs been demolished and who worked at a concrete and steel company that no longer exists. The Oregonian/OregonLive said Thursday it tracked down the details of Floyd Leslie Hill’s life and found some estranged family members in the Midwest. Those family members said they don’t want his ashes. Hill died in 2000 at age 80. For now, Hill’s remains have been returned to the mortuary where they originated. Chris Hawes, a volunteer with the Missing in America Project, said that when no one claims the remains of veterans, his organization can coordinate interment at a national cemetery.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTinicum Township: A small community near Philadelphia that managed to save the oldest surviving quarantine station in the Western Hemisphere from the wrecking ball is now transforming the 18th-century structure into township offices. For Tinicum Township, renovating the Lazaretto Quarantine Station was part of a broader plan to draw visitors to the community. For historians, saving the Lazaretto offers a chance to tell stories of immigration and public health in America’s early days. Built in 1799, the quarantine station protected the Port of Philadelphia against the introduction of diseases that could lead to epidemics for nearly a century. Township officials stopped a developer from tearing it down to build a parking lot. Now, they’ve restored it and will move offices into the stately building in September.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWesterly: The Rhode Island fire marshal is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible for blowing up two portable toilets last weekend. The first explosion happened at about 12:30 a.m. Saturday at a residential construction site in the coastal town of Westerly. The second incident occurred in a private parking lot in Charlestown. Police said a fisherman heard an explosion at about 11 p.m. Saturday, but the damage was not reported until Sunday morning. There were no reports of injuries in either explosion. The state bomb squad, which is overseen by Office of the State Fire Marshal, is investigating. The office said there’s no indication of any terrorist links to the explosions.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWalhalla: WSPA-TV reported the Oconee County Sheriff’s Office announced a new deputy to their staff on Wednesday: K-9 Thor. Thor, who will be a tracking and explosives canine for the sheriff’s office, is a yellow lab and was accompanied by his handler, Deputy Justin Stokes, at a swearing-in ceremony Wednesday. According to a sheriff’s office news release, Stokes and Thor have completed their required training and are ready to serve the county. Officials said Thor received his badge at the ceremony and then retired K-9 handlers received plaques commemorating their dogs’ service to Oconee County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The first round of homes in the flood-prone Rose-Lotta neighborhood near the Big Sioux River and Tomar Park could be demolished or relocated as early as this fall. Spring flooding put dozens of homes in the area southeast of Interstate 229 and Minnesota Avenue underwater – again. And because flooding there has grown increasingly frequent during large rain events and spring thaws, Mayor Paul TenHaken and the City Council set aside $1 million in leftover money from the prior year's budget to create a voluntary buy-out program in hopes of creating more green space. The idea is fewer homes, and more permeable surface area near Tomar Park could alleviate yearly flooding and improve drainage for other nearby properties. Those eight homes ranged in price from $72,000 to $186,000, with the average sale price to the city of $119,500.\n\nTennessee\n\nCleveland: State officials have broken ground on a $47 million state veterans nursing home. Gov. Bill Lee was among the ceremony’s attendees Wednesday. The single-story, 108-bed intermediate and skilled care nursing facility will span 110,000 square feet. It will include six 18-bedroom residential houses connected by interior shared support spaces. In 2003, the Bradley County Commission and Cleveland City Council passed resolutions to support a nursing facility for long-term veteran care. A $3 million anonymous donation was pledged in 2006, and the city and county have contributed $2 million each since. The state has added $10 million. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is contributing a $30.5 million grant. The families of Steve Williams, Thomas Williams, and Robert Wright donated 28 acres in Cleveland in 2010.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: The city has a new main fire station as recovery continues since Hurricane Ike swamped parts of the city in 2008. The Galveston County Daily News reported the $9.6 million Fire Station No. 1 was one of the last large projects funded by Ike disaster relief money. Construction continues on a public works building and a wastewater treatment plant. Visitors on Wednesday toured the nearly 28,000-square-foot fire station. The base is 11 feet above ground level. Fire Chief Mike Wisko said the station was reinforced to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. Forecasters said such storms include winds of at least 157 mph. All six Galveston fire stations were damaged by Ike, which had top winds of 110 mph and a 15-foot storm surge.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Legislators are drafting a proposal to scrap a planned state-run medical marijuana dispensary system after facing pressure from county attorneys who said the system put public employees at risk of being prosecuted under federal drug laws. Republican Senate Majority Leader Evan Vickers said medical cannabis would instead be distributed through up to 12 private dispensaries. Gov. Gary Herbert has hinted about calling a special session where those changes could be approved, though no date has been announced. The law now calls for seven private dispensaries with a state-run “central fill pharmacy” distributing the remainder of medical marijuana orders through Utah’s 13 local health departments. But some county attorneys argued using health departments as pickup points would make the employees de facto drug dealers. Some cannabis advocates applauded the proposed change for increasing patient access. Others worry 12 dispensaries still won’t meet demand.\n\nVermont\n\nSwanton: Biologists are trying to figure out why American eels are washing up dead on the shores of northern Lake Champlain. Vermont Public Radio reported at least 15 dead eels have appeared from Swanton south to Milton in the past few weeks. State Fish and Wildlife Department fisheries biologist Bernie Pientka said it’s not clear what’s causing the die-off. He said an invasive nematode, or roundworm, has harmed eel populations in the U.S. Southeast, so that might be a cause. Pientka said other fish species in the lake do not seem to be affected. Lake Champlain once supported a commercial eel fishery. The population declined in the 1980s and 1990s, but rebounded after eel ladders were upgraded on the Richelieu River, which flows north from Champlain to the St. Lawrence River.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: All students in Newport News Public Schools will receive free breakfast and lunch under a federal program. News outlets reported the district received approval from the state’s Education Department to use a federal program that reimburses meals at schools with a certain proportion of low-income students. District child nutrition official Cathy Alexander announced the news Tuesday. The Virginian-Pilot reported it’s the largest public system in the state to give all meals to students for free.Federal funding eligibility depends on the percentage of students who participate in public benefit programs that make them eligible for free meals. If at least 40% of students fall into that category, the schools are eligible for funding. The newspaper said about 47% of students in the district met the criteria.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: What authorities described as a homeless camp on the water in Seattle has sunk. KOMO-TV reported the floating camp was made up of three boats rafted together and tied up illegally to a fishing net piling belonging to the Duwamish Tribe. Two of the boats sank last week in the Duwamish Waterway and a third boat remained afloat. The Port of Seattle is investigating after it was asked to by the City of Tukwila last month. Mike DeSota, environmental compliance manager for the Marine Division for the Port, said there was a “homeless concentration” of people going back and forth from the vessels. Officials said the Coast Guard pumped out fuel and removed hazardous chemicals on board. On Wednesday, a salvage crew removed both boats.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMineral Wells: Japanese truck maker Hino Motors Manufacturing has marked the opening of its new West Virginia assembly plant. Hino Motors held a ceremony Wednesday in Mineral Wells at a former retail distribution center. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said on Twitter before the ceremony that one of his first trade trips as governor in 2005 was to Japan to recruit Hino Motors to North America. Manchin said “it’s been a wonderful, wonderful success story.” Company President Takashi Ono has said the $100 million investment could create up to 250 new jobs. For 12 years, Hino Motors had assembled medium-duty trucks at a smaller facility 20 miles away in the Wood County community of Williamstown. Hino Motors is owned by the Toyota Group and its American headquarters are in Novi, Michigan.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources board is considering an emergency rule to shorten Wisconsin’s ruffed grouse season to protect the population. Drumming activity declined 34% statewide from 2017 to 2018. Hunters took only 173,347 grouse last year, the lowest total in the 35 years the DNR has been surveying small-game hunters about their success. The department said the decline’s cause is unknown. The season runs from mid-October through Dec. 8 in southeastern Wisconsin and from mid-September through Jan. 31 in the rest of the state. The rule’s description doesn’t lay out new season end dates. DNR spokeswoman Sarah Hoye said the rule would affect only the out-state season, ending it Jan. 5 instead of Jan. 31. The board is scheduled to vote on the rule description Tuesday. Approval would authorize the DNR to develop the rule language.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A video shows employees at a rental car agency all they need to know about how a car got damaged in Yellowstone National Park. The footage shows one of the dozens of bison stampeding through the park as it rams the rental and cracks the windshield. No injuries were reported. The Casper Star-Tribune reported that a family member caught the scene on video on Aug. 13 after the animals brought traffic to a standstill. Bison weigh up to 2,000 pounds and run up to 30 mph. A video shot earlier this summer showed a man petting a bison’s head in Yellowstone. No one was injured, but park officials warned visitors to keep their distance. In July, a bison threw a 9-year-old girl into the air in Yellowstone.

That’s because the self-governed democratic island of 24 million people is a global leader in the supply of semiconductor chips.\n\nBut as tensions escalate between Taipei and Beijing, the fate of that industry has become a global concern. Experts have warned that any disruption to Taiwan’s chip supply could paralyze production of key equipment, impacting almost everyone in the world.\n\nThe island has been facing growing military aggression from China in recent months. In response, Taiwan has stepped up its own military training, and committed a record amount of defense spending this year.\n\nThe advanced chips Taiwan makes are an indispensable part of everything from smartphones to washing machines.\n\nIf conflict were to happen on the Taiwan Strait, “it will be disastrous not only for Taiwan, not only for China, but also for the US, EU, and everyone else,” said Roy Lee, a deputy executive director at Taiwan’s Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research.\n\nThe chaos in global automaking triggered by a pandemic-related shortage of chips over the past year gives a sense of just how bad it could get.\n\n“With the auto shortage, now you have to wait for six months for European made cars,” he added. “If Taiwan stopped supplying chips for other products, then probably you have to wait for over 12 months for a new mobile phone, or even longer for a laptop.”\n\nTaiwan’s ‘sacred mountain’\n\nOne Taiwanese company in particular — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) — is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips and plays a critical role in powering products designed by tech companies like Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia.\n\nWith a market cap of nearly $500 billion, TSMC is one of Asia’s most valuable companies, and accounts for 90% of the world’s super-advanced chips, Reuters said in a recent report citing industry estimates.\n\nThe firm — widely dubbed in Taiwan as its “sacred mountain” — is so important to the island that its employees can apply to be exempted from military reservist training — even if they are called upon, the defense ministry has said.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment by CNN Business.\n\nSuper-advanced semiconductor chips — like the ones produced by TSMC — are difficult to make because of the high cost of development and the level of knowledge required, meaning much of the production is concentrated in just a handful of suppliers.\n\nEmployees work at the entrance of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) Museum of Innovation in Hsinchu. Photographer: I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg via Getty Images I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe global semiconductor industry has already been under pressure because of a growing supply shortage, with many technology companies reporting delays in securing chips for their production activities. This makes Taiwan even more important, especially as the United States and China engage in a bitter rivalry over developing advanced technologies of the future, such as artificial intelligence and 5G.\n\nIf Taiwan were to fall to the Communist authorities in Beijing, Western nations could potentially lose access to the island’s valuable semiconductor chips.\n\nGrowing concerns\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has heightened concerns about the risk that China could increase its military force against Taiwan. The Communist leadership in Beijing has long claimed the island as part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it.\n\nIn recent months, China has stepped up its military pressure on Taiwan, including sending a record number of warplanes near it last October. Chinese President Xi Jinping has refused to rule out the use of force to achieve what he called “national reunification.”\n\nBut as comparisons are being drawn between Kyiv and Taipei, the Taiwanese government has repeatedly emphasized the strategic role of its semiconductor industry.\n\n“Taiwan and Ukraine are fundamentally different in geopolitics, geography and the importance to international supply chains,” President Tsai Ing-wen said as she condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month.\n\nLast month, Taiwan announced it had begun imposing economic sanctions against Russia. Authorities said major Taiwanese chipmakers, which account for more than half of the world’s output of semiconductor chips, have all pledged to comply with the move.\n\nWhen asked about the differences between Taiwan and Ukraine, J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with Global Taiwan Institute said that the island’s indispensable role in global supply chains, “changes how countries — the international community — will calculate their response to the threat of, or the invasion against Taiwan.”\n\nChina’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nWhile Taiwan’s role as a leading semiconductor hub may be indispensable to the world right now, experts believe there are challenges for the island to keep up its advantage.\n\nThe global supply shortage of chips has already prompted many countries to take steps to break their dependency on Taiwan.\n\nLast week, the US Senate passed a $52 billion plan to invest in the research, design and manufacturing of semiconductor chips in the United States.\n\nChina’s largest chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) has pledged to invest $5 billion in extra capacity this year.\n\n“Right now, China, US and the European Union are all pursuing the so-called next generation semiconductor technologies,” Lee said.\n\n“We understand the challenges are coming, and we need to keep our leadership in semiconductors through research and development, and most importantly, cultivating qualified talents that support Taiwan’s success,” he added.\n\nIn response to the challenges, Taiwan recently committed $300 million to chip-focused graduate programs to train the next generation of semiconductor engineers. Last month, it also passed new legislation that requires those working in key tech roles to seek permission from authorities before visiting mainland China.\n\nAs discussions about the future of Taiwan grow, Lee believes the best way to keep the island safe is via powering a combination of military and economic strength.\n\n“That strength comes not only from military strength, but also economic strength.”\n\n— Will Ripley and Wayne Chang contributed reporting from Taipei, Taiwan.", "authors": ["Eric Cheung"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/business/ups-teamster-union-strike/index.html", "title": "UPS: One of the biggest strikes in American history is brewing | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOver the past year, the nascent labor movements at mighty corporations like Starbucks and Amazon have grabbed national attention. But less well-known is a looming high-stakes clash between one of America’s oldest unions and the world’s biggest package courier.\n\nContract negotiations are set to begin in the spring between UPS and the Teamsters Union ahead of their current contract’s expiration at the end of July, 2023. Already, before the talks have even started, labor experts are predicting that the drivers and package handlers will go on strike.\n\n“The question is how long it will be,” said Todd Vachon, professor of Labor Relations at Rutgers. “The union’s president ran and won on taking a more militant approach. Even if they’re very close [to a deal], the rank and file will be hungry to take on the company.”\n\nIf that happens, a strike at UPS would affect nearly every household in the country. An estimated 6% of the nation’s gross domestic product is moved in UPS trucks every year. The explosive growth of online retail has made the company and its drivers more crucial than ever to the nation’s struggling supply chain. Beyond the company’s home deliveries, it also delivers many of the goods found in stores, factories and offices.\n\nAbout 350,000 Teamsters work at UPS as drivers and package sorters out of a global workforce of 534,000 permanent employees. And that’s growing fast — the company has added some 72,000 Teamster-represented jobs since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile there are competing services at FedEx (FDX), the US Postal Service and Amazon’s own delivery service, none of them have the capacity to handle more than a small fraction of the 21.5 million US packages that UPS moves daily.\n\n“We want a contract that provides wins for our employees and that provides UPS the flexibility to stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry,” the company said in a statement this month. “UPS and the Teamsters have worked cooperatively for almost 100 years to meet the needs of UPS employees, customers, and the communities where we live and work. We believe we’ll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that’s good for everyone involved.”\n\nThe union has not gone on strike against UPS since a nearly two-week protest in 1997. If the union does go on strike, it would be the largest strike against a single business in nation’s history.\n\nAnger over current contract\n\nThere are certainly signs of strain in relations between the company and the union — both its leadership and its rank-and-file members.\n\nA majority of members voted against ratifying the current contract in 2018, only to see the previous Teamster leadership, led by then-President James Hoffa, put it in place because not enough of the membership participated in the ratification vote to trigger a strike.\n\nThe union’s new president, Sean O’Brien, won his office earlier this year by making the UPS contract a central focus of his campaign. He has vowed to make UPS pay Teamster members far more this time and he often talks about a $300 million strike fund the union has accumulated to pay members in case they go on strike.\n\n“Do our members wake up every day wanting a strike. I’d say no. But are they fed up? Yes they’re fed up,” O’Brien told CNN Business last week. “Whether or not there is a strike, that’s totally up to the company. We’re going to utilize as much leverage as we can to get our members the contract they deserve.”\n\nUPS said the average pay for its delivery drivers is $95,000 a year, with benefits such as a traditional pension plan, worth an additional $50,000 a year. UPS’ semi-tractor drivers are paid even more. That’s far higher than most wages at FedEx and Amazon, where many drivers work for small independent contractors.\n\nThe current contract expires at 12:01 am August 1. O’Brien vows the union will not grant any kind of contract extension past that deadline.\n\nAnd he added that on top of improved pay and benefits, the union will demand better working conditions, including adding air conditioning in the panel trucks used for UPS deliveries which the union says poses a health risk for drivers.\n\n“It’s not a heavy lift for the company to install air conditioning,” he said. “There’s a lot of heat stroke going on.”\n\nRecord profits at UPS\n\nThe company often speaks about how much it values its Teamster-represented workforce.\n\nAnd in one important way – employment numbers – UPS is one of the best friends labor has in the ranks of US corporate management, despite the obvious tensions. UPS is one of the few unionized employers that is significantly adding payrolls, and to union membership. At other businesses, union membership numbers have been steadily declining or decades.\n\nThe increase in Teamsters jobs at UPS has come from the steady growth in online purchases, especially during the pandemic-era surge. Last year, it took only nine months to report what was already a record profit for a full year. UPS ended 2021 with operating income up 50% to $13.1 billion. In the first half of this year, earnings rose another 10% compared with a year ago.\n\n“Everyone keeps getting richer except for our members,” said O’Brien.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tome, who started that job just as the pandemic began, says that the company’s union contract is a competitive advantage at a time of worker shortages.\n\nShe also is trying to assure both investors and UPS customers that the company will be prepared in case the union does go on strike. She declined to comment on what those preparations are.\n\n“Our goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win,” she told investors in July. But she added that UPS is “building contingency plans.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}]}

Upon the Queen’s death, Charles, who had been the Prince of Wales, a title traditionally reserved for the heir to the throne, became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He is also King of 14 other Commonwealth realms. His wife, Camilla, officially became Queen Consort in accordance with the wishes of the Queen, who said during her Platinum Jubilee celebrations that it was her “sincere wish” that Camilla would use the title. Until now, Camilla had been known as the Duchess of Cornwall, using the female equivalent of one of her husband’s titles. She was also able to use the title Princess of Wales, but was “thought to not use [it] out of respect for Charles’s ex-wife Princess Diana”, reported the Daily Mail. Who else has a new title? Prince William was given the title of Duke of Cambridge in 2011, when he married Kate Middleton, who became Duchess of Cambridge. Upon the Queen’s death William was given the titles previously held by his father, with the royal couple becoming the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge. As the Daily Mail noted, there is “no automatic succession” to the Prince of Wales title, which is traditionally given to the heir apparent. But in his first address to the nation as the new King, Charles named William and Catherine the new Prince and Princess of Wales. “With Catherine beside him, our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations,” said the monarch. The couple’s three children will also receive new titles, becoming known as Prince George of Wales, Princess Charlotte of Wales and Prince Louis of Wales. Skip advert The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are likely to retain their current titles, although a 1917 edict by King George V means their children Archie and Lilibet “are technically now a ‘prince’ and ‘princess’”, said Time. Known as the Letters Patent, the edict said that all children and grandchildren of the sovereign through a male line can hold the titles of prince and princess.\n\nPrince Edward, the youngest of the Queen’s children and currently the Earl of Wessex, could become the Duke of Edinburgh, with his wife Sophie becoming the Duchess of Edinburgh, although no official title change has yet been made. Can titles be removed? The Queen stripped Prince Andrew of his honorary military titles and patronages after a US judge ruled that a civil lawsuit over sex abuse allegations against him could proceed to trial in January 2022. Buckingham Palace announced the decision following the publication of an open letter signed by more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans that urged the Queen to remove her second son’s eight British military titles. Some of these titles were inherited by Andrew from his late father, Prince Philip, including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, described by the BBC as “one of the most senior infantry regiments in the British army”. But Andrew “has not lost everything”, wrote Craig Prescott, a law lecturer at Bangor University, in an article on The Conversation. Along with his rank of vice admiral in the Royal Navy, Andrew retains his birth title of “prince” and “remains the Duke of York, which is a peerage”, Prescott explained. And he is also still ninth in line of succession to the throne. How the peerage works The peerage is a centuries-old ranking system for British nobility. Five ranks of the peerage still exist today: duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron. Duke is the “highest and most important rank”, explained online history magazine Historic UK. Edward III created the first duke, in 1337, when he made his eldest son the Duke of Cornwall – a title now held by Prince William. Dukes (and duchesses, the female counterpart) are addressed as “your grace”. Skip advert Andrew became Duke of York when he married Sarah Ferguson in 1986. The title is traditionally granted to the monarch’s second son and has previously been held by the Queen’s father, George VI, and her grandfather, George V. Unlike military titles, Andrew’s peerage can only be removed by an Act of Parliament. A peerage removal “can only be done by statute, passed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and receiving royal assent, which means the agreement of the Queen”, said the i news site. Calls for Andrew to lose his dukedom have been growing, particularly in York, where a city council member has launched a campaign backing the move. But there is no historical precedent for the removal of a title of peerage by the Queen: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are still the Duke and Duchess of Sussex despite quitting royal life in January 2020. Other ranks of the peerage A marquess, which is next in the line of nobility after a duke, is formally addressed as “lord”, and the wife of a marquess is a marchioness, addressed as “lady”. Only one woman in history has been created a marchioness in her own right: Anne Boleyn, prior to her marriage to Henry VIII.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/957059/prince-charles-boris-johnson-souring-relationship-rwanda", "title": "Prince Charles and Boris Johnson: the 'souring' relationship ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Matches were mainly played in minor venues in the north of England and few were televised. Things have changed, and women’s team sport has been thriving on increased media exposure, particularly on free-to-air channels.\n\nInfamously, the FA effectively banned women’s football in England in 1921 and it took more than 70 years for the governing body to embrace the women’s game. But the public profile of UK women’s sport has increased considerably. The live TV coverage in Britain of the FIFA Women’s World Cup in Canada in 2015 was the first time a UK national broadcaster, the BBC, had covered an international women’s sporting event on this scale.\n\nI took my own football-playing ten-year-old granddaughter to see Germany beat France in the semi-final at Stadium MK in Milton Keynes last week. Women and girls outnumbered men and boys comfortably at that game – and booze was of less-than-secondary significance. Inclusivity, participation and diversity were the watchwords here, rather than partisanship and casual abuse of the opposition and its fans.\n\nAnd the games themselves are attracting a whole new set of fans. Watching women’s international football feels like – and is – a different world from the men’s version. Crowds at men’s football are ageing, but at women’s football, price, civility and increased safety means that around half the crowd can often be children.\n\nEngland’s women footballers have not just won the championship , though. The team has captured the public imagination. Attendance at the match was 87,192, the biggest crowd for a Euros football match for either men’s or women’s football. Newspapers are devoting multiple pages to women’s sports coverage and England’s key players are becoming well known.\n\nEngland’s women have won the European football championship, bringing a major international trophy home for the first time since the men’s team won the World Cup in 1966, more than a lifetime ago for many of the fans who crowded into Wembley Stadium for the match. They beat Germany, English football’s bitterest rival by two goals to one, in a tense and hard-fought match that was not decided until the second period of extra time.\n\nIs this a “sea-change” in the attitudes of the UK government, television companies and the British public to women’s sport? Or simply a commercial response to the dearth of live men’s sport on non-subscription channels? Or is it, perhaps, a convenient confluence of all?\n\nOvercoming prejudice\n\nAlong with colleagues, Stacey Pope and Jamie Cleland, I conducted online research on women and men’s reactions to coverage of the women’s game soon after the 2015 World Cup finals. Some of this work has only recently been published.\n\nWe found that some men – a substantial minority – were highly critical of the extensive TV coverage, arguing that it far outstripped public interest in women’s sport. For them, a small “politically-correct lobby” was ensuring that “worthless” women’s team sport was increasingly widely covered and was now beyond critique on the BBC.\n\nBut other men contended that ingrained prejudice remained the key barrier to greater acceptance for women in sport. “Many football fans remain misogynistic,” affirmed a male Birmingham City fan (36–45), while a Gillingham fan (male, 46–55) was similarly pessimistic, claiming that: “There is still the lingering ‘stone age’ thinking from some men regarding women in football, which is so entrenched that you will never change them.”\n\nSome of our female respondents were angry at the anti-women sentiments commonly expressed on social media: “Not just sexism, downright misogyny. Some of the comments I saw on Twitter during the women’s World Cup were a disgrace.” (Female, 46–55, Norwich City). Will this also be part of some men’s responses to the current finals? We will need to review the evidence.\n\nRespondents who had attended women’s football matches often reflected very positively on the game and its social impact: “The clubs seem to encourage families and children to attend by having mascots and fun fairs before the game” said a female Wrexham fan (22–25). She went on: “The atmosphere was great and no need for segregation. It was nice to sit and watch a game of football without bad language too.”\n\nIt was also argued that the women’s game was different, not inferior, to the men’s equivalent: “I have watched football my whole life and the stereotype [that] women’s football is slow and boring is rubbish. Different styles of football occur all over the world; you still want your team to win and it’s still exciting.” (Female, 22-25, Bolton Wanderers).\n\nBetter sports?\n\nTop women’s football is far better resourced in England today and it is also consciously promoted by the Football Association as a “cleaner”, more wholesome, version of the sport. As one fan (male, 36–45, Liverpool) put it back in 2015: “One of the main things I have noticed in the woman’s game is the lack of diving and the higher level of respect and sportsmanship. This is even evident in the junior football I watch where the girls are lot more respectful to the ref and other players than in the boys’ junior game.”\n\nAs top women players start to earn higher salaries, perhaps negatives identified above will start to show more in women’s football too? I certainly saw signs in Germany v France, for example, of more conscious attempts by women, professionally, to “game” the referee.\n\nAnd how will the summer of 2022 affect crowds next season at domestic Women’s Super League matches? Problems identified in 2015 were that WSL club venues were small with poor facilities, were difficult to reach and unfamiliar to regular football attenders. All these remain an issue today.\n\nWomen’s football (and women’s sport more generally) is likely to be demanding much more press coverage and air time in the future. It will also perhaps provide new role models for sporting girls – such as my granddaughter – who may begin to see, more realistic job prospects in women’s team sport. Perhaps football in England is coming home in more ways than one.\n\nJohn Williams, Senior Lecturer, Department of Sociology, University of Leicester\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
