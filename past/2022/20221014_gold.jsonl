Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe life cycle of plastic begins underground, where oil and gas are extracted from deep below the surface of the planet. These fossil fuels are then refined in facilities, using extreme temperatures and significant amount of water and energy, where they are transformed into pellets that are eventually melted and molded into things like water bottles, packaging, garbage bags and clothes.\n\nAnd the widespread use of single-use plastic — the stuff we use once and then throw away — is only made worse by its disposal. Plastics do not break down once they’re thrown into nature. And, alarmingly, only around 9% plastic in the US is actually recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency — even the stuff you specifically threw into the recycle bin.\n\nWhat you might not realize is this isn’t just a pollution problem. It’s a climate problem. And by the time we start talking about recycling, the damage is already done.\n\nThe process of making plastic is so energy intensive that if the plastics industry were a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, according to a 2021 report from Beyond Plastics.\n\nPlastics are the “new coal,” said Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator and now president of Beyond Plastics. Generating energy from coal — the most polluting fossil fuel — is already being phased out. But Enck said it’s likely that plastics may be sticking for a while longer, unless consumers significant cut their plastic use.\n\n“It’s a climate killer,” Enck told CNN. “We’re finally seeing an increase in renewable energy and energy efficiency. And the fossil fuel industry knew that they were losing market share on transportation and electricity generation, so plastic production is the plan B for the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nFrom its production to its end-of-life, plastic belches greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its life cycle. Here’s why experts say the convenience of plastic comes at a terrible cost for the climate, and what you can do to help reduce its impact.\n\nQuantifying the impact\n\nSwitch to reusable bags for shopping to cut down on single-use plastic. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\n\nThe plastic industry is responsible for at least 232 million tons of planet-warming emissions each year, according to the Beyond Plastics report.\n\nThat’s the same amount as the average emissions released by 116 coal-fired power plants in 2020, according to the report’s authors. It’s also the same annual emissions as around 50 million cars, according to the EPA. And more plastic-making facilities continue to come online.\n\n“Remember that when you’re making plastic, there’s the greenhouse gas emissions, but these facilities also emit massive amounts of air toxins and particulates,” Enck added. “It’s really a health threat.”\n\nRefineries and production facilities also tend to set up shop in marginalized communities of color, Enck said.\n\n“If you look at where more than 90% of the climate pollution is released by the plastic industry, it’s in 18 communities in the whole country, and they’re all low-income communities and the residents are more likely to be people of color,” Enck said, outlining other findings in the report. “Plastic production is an environmental justice issue.”\n\nAnd plastic recycling doesn’t work, Enck said, because most of what we think we’re recycling just ends up in the landfill. It also doesn’t address the planet-warming emissions that comes from making it in the first place.\n\nJacqueline Savitz, chief policy officer for Oceana in North America, said people should think of the plastic crisis as an overflowing bathtub.\n\n“When the bathtub is overflowing, you don’t want to just run for the mop; first, you want to turn off the faucet,” Savitz said. “Recycling is the mop. You’re not going to get very far, if the faucet is still on. So what we have to do is reduce the amount of plastics that we’re producing at the source, and that’s turning off the faucet.”\n\nWhat you can do about it\n\nSaying \"no\" to plastic cutlery is one way to limit your use of single-use plastic. Adobe Stock\n\nRecycling alone will not solve this massive problem, Enck said, but we should still do it — bearing in mind what can and cannot be recycled.\n\nThe number system on the bottom of plastic items are not a guarantee they will be recycled. Only things marked 1 and 2 — and on rare occasion, 5 — are sure bets, depending on what your municipality can handle.\n\nThis is why it’s so important to focus on reducing plastic use in the first place, Enck said, and our individual changes can add up.\n\n“It’s just not going to solve the problem unless we change the law,” Enck said. “But with individual actions, what I urge people to do is look at their own home or their worksite — what is your heaviest use of plastic?”\n\nYou won’t know what you can change until you take stock. Make note of all of the plastics in your home. Most of the single-use stuff you’ll find around the kitchen and the bathroom. Then, armed with a list of where you use single-use plastic the most, you can start to make replacements.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nSay no to bottled water — Get a couple of canteens and cut a major source of plastic out of your life.\n\nReusable grocery bags — You can easily go a step further by not using the plastic produce bags the store provides for your apples and broccoli. If you’re uncomfortable putting produce directly in the cart, have a special bag to carry it in until you get to the checkout. There’s no rule that says you have to wrap your fruits and veggies at the store.\n\nChoose paper (or no) packaging over plastic — If you’re looking at two versions of the same product and one is packaged in paper or cardboard and the other is in plastic, then the choice is obvious. And look for plastic-free options like bar shampoo.\n\nBuy in bulk to reduce plastic waste — Nuts, rice and beans are all things that come in plastic bags, but they don’t need to. Bring your own reusable containers to fill with your favorite bulk foods. (Just make sure to zero-out the scale before you start filling them, so you don’t pay for the weight of your container.)\n\nRefuse plastic cutlery — Take your own utensils to restaurants that typically provide plastics. Or, if you’re ordering takeout, tell the restaurant they don’t need to add it to your bag.\n\nAnd Enck’s group has more suggestions for how to cut your personal plastic use.\n\nThink bigger\n\nWe can do our part to minimize our own plastic use, but the world needs big solutions for this big problem. Natan Dvir/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nUltimately, the world needs large-scale change to address the climate impact of the fossil fuel and plastics industries, Savitz said. Oceana, for example, is working with local volunteers from cities and counties around the country to help pass new laws to reduce single-use plastics, in hopes of sparking change at the national level.\n\n“We think that if we could start to reduce single-use plastics at the local level with local ordinances, that can start to become more of the norm,” she said. “Then we can start taking it to higher levels of government, even getting to the point of getting national policies that will drive reductions in plastic use.”\n\nUltimately, Savitz said consumers need to continue urging major corporations to provide plastic-free solutions and help support refill and reuse programs to encourage society to shy away from plastic use and stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\n“Our country is burning and flooding and hurricanes are coming earlier and earlier,” she told CNN. “I really think it’s shocking that one of the things that’s really leading to that is plastics, and it’s hurting us in other ways, too. So if we could find a way to reduce our production of plastics as a country and as a global society, we’d be taking a bite out of climate change.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}]}

A recent study showed Chick-fil-A had the slowest one — but only because it’s so popular and there are so many cars in line.\n\nTaco Bell led the pack in speed of service, with an average time of about 221 seconds, followed by Dunkin’ Donuts, KFC and Arby’s. But this metric doesn’t factor the number of cars in line. In that category, Chick-fil-A is the clear leader, with 16% of its lines surveyed counting ten or more cars. McDonald’s, which was in second place, only had 2% with that many customers.\n\nBased on the total time cars spent in line, Chick-fil-A came out on top, with an average of about 107 seconds. McDonald’s came in second at 118 seconds, followed by Taco Bell and Arby’s.\n\nQSR and Intouch Insight published its annual Drive-Thru Report, surveying more than 1,000 consumers who ranked ten industry leaders: Wendy’s, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Dunkin’, McDonald’s, Arby’s, Carl’s Jr., Hardee’s, Taco Bell, and KFC.\n\nDrive-thrus got bogged down last year mostly because of a shortage of restaurant workers, as thousands left the industry. The pandemic surge of drive-thru and pickup and delivery orders only exacerbated the issue\n\nBut luckily for customers, drive-thrus have gotten nearly 10 seconds faster compared to last year — and that can be a big advantage in this highly competitive industry.\n\n“Mere seconds can be a make-it or break-it in terms of where a consumer decides to order,” Amanda Topper, a research director at Mintel, said to CNN Business last year.\n\nHowever, the current average is still about 45 seconds slower than the 2019 pace. The study said pre-sell menu boards, order accuracy and friendliness helped decrease the wait times at drive-thrus this year.\n\nService and speed\n\nDuring peak Covid, Chick-fil-A was one of the first brands to close its dining rooms, focusing its attention on bringing hospitality to the drive-thru outside.\n\n“We believe that looking eye-to-eye with the customer allows for a connection that happens at the beginning of the drive-thru,” Matt Abercrombie, Chick-fil-A’s senior director of service and hospitality, said in the study.\n\nThe researchers found that Chick-fil-A had fine tuned the “check-point system,” which keeps customers engaged through different interactions with employees.\n\nAnd that’s clear in consumer sentiment too — 88% of respondents said Chick-fil-A had friendly service, placing it at the top of the industry. Only 1.7% said the service was “not friendly.”\n\nBut when it comes to customer satisfaction, respondents said Arby’s had the most accurate orders filled, at 89.6%. McDonald’s and Burger King closely followed.\n\nWendy’s\n\nWendy’s founder Dave Thomas named the first modern drive-thru in 1970, coining the term “Pick-Up Window.” And though the company this year announced a makeover that places an “emphasis on convenience, speed and accuracy,” it has lagged behind its competitors in the survey.\n\nThe chain plans to redesign its interiors and implement new pick-up windows and a more technologically advanced kitchen.\n\nThe pandemic has opened up a new consumer demand for the drive-thru, pressuring fast food companies to upgrade signage, sanitation and technology.\n\nIn the survey, Wendy’s came in 7th for speed of service and was also the lowest for order accuracy, at 79.4%.

Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nWhat is the LIV Golf series?\n\nIt’s a new tour organized by LIV Golf Investments which consists of eight events across the world, which began in London on Thursday.\n\nFronted by former world No. 1 Greg Norman, the team-based series runs from June to October with the aim, it says, to “holistically improve the health of professional golf on a global scale to help unlock the sports’ (sic) untapped potential.”\n\nIt is backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) – a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Each of the first seven events will have a total prize purse of $25 million, with $20 million split between individual players and the remaining $5 million shared between the top three teams at the end of each week.\n\nAhead of the first event in London, the 12 teams were announced, as well as their captain. On Tuesday, captains selected the rest of their teams in a draft format akin to the NFL and NBA drafts.\n\nUnlike typical golfing events, London’s event is over three days, not four, with the 48-man field beginning with a shotgun start – all at the same time – in the hopes of being a more engaging, action-packed style event.\n\nCompeting in a traditional stroke play format, the lowest score will be the winner.\n\nWhereas in the first two rounds, the best two scores will count for each team, in the final round, the best three scores will count, with the lowest overall team score after 54 holes being named the team winner.\n\nFor the final event – a team championship – the format changes to a four-round, match-play knockout tournament.\n\nGreg Norman smiles on the first tee on the first day of the LIV Golf series at the Centurion Club. Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhich golfers have signed up?\n\nThe eye-watering money on offer has attracted a mix of golfers to sign up for the opening event in London, from all ages, backgrounds and success on the golf course.\n\nSix-time major winner Phil Mickelson and former world No. 1 Dustin Johnson are amongst those to headline the event, while other major winners Sergio Garcia, Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell, Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel also participated.\n\nRyder Cup stalwarts Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood also were part of the first cohort to sign up, and the field includes 18 players ranked in the top 100 in the world.\n\nOn the other hand, it also provided a platform for other golfers just making their first strides in the sport, including Thailand’s 15-year-old Ratchanon Chantananuwat.\n\n2020 US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau was the next blockbuster name to sign up, adding his name on Friday to the ever-growing list of players to join.\n\nAnd according to multiple reports, 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed will be the next big name to sign up to the breakaway tour.\n\nJohnson attends a press conference ahead of the LIV Golf series event at the Centurion Club.

In March, Saudi Arabia executed 81 men in the biggest mass execution in decades. Rights groups have criticized the country for executing people who were minors at the time of the offenses for which they were convicted.\n\nAnother avenue of controversy surrounding the league is the breakaway nature from golf’s established tours.\n\nThe PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – formerly the European Tour – have long been where players have plied their trade across the golfing calendar, outside of the four majors.\n\nBut, providing monetary and life balance issues as excuses, the decision from a faction of players who broke away to play in the LIV Golf series has been met with mixed reaction from their fellow tour members.\n\nMembers of the HY Flyers GC team (from left) Thailand's TK Chantananuwat, South Africa's Justin Harding, Mickelson and the US' Chase Koepka pose for pictures during a press conference ahead of the LIV Golf series event at the Centurion Club.

Biography of Golf’s Most Colorful Superstar,” as saying that he would consider joining the proposed Super League because it is a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.”\n\nShipnuck quoted Mickelson as saying disparaging things about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record and asserting that the kingdom killed journalist Khashoggi.\n\nIn his opening answer in Wednesday’s press conference, when asked about the human rights record of the country providing funding for the venture, Mickelson appeared to be remorseful.\n\n“I don’t condone human rights violations at all,” he repeatedly said.\n\nMickelson attends a press conference ahead of the LIV Golf series event at the Centurion Club. Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJohnson – the highest-ranked player in the competition at 15 in the world – resigned his PGA Tour membership and said on Tuesday: “I don’t want to play for the rest of my life, this gives me an opportunity to do what I want to do.”\n\nEurope’s Ryder Cup stalwart Graeme McDowell was also asked about the killing of Khashoggi during his press conference.\n\n“We all agree that was reprehensible. No one’s going to argue that fact but we’re golfers. We’re not politicians.\n\n“If Saudi Arabia want to use the game of golf as a way for them to get to where they want to be, we’re proud to help them on that journey, using the game of golf and the abilities we have to help grow the sport.”\n\nWhat about those not taking part?\n\nThe first LIV event is taking place at the Centurion Club. That and the PGA Tour’s Canadian Open are being held almost simultaneously and is the first head-to-head showdown between the two tours.\n\nThe Centurion’s $25 million purse almost triples the Canadian Open’s $8.7 million. Defending his title in Canada will be Rory McIlroy, the world No. 8.\n\n“Any decision that you make in your life that’s purely for money usually doesn’t end up going the right way,” said McIlroy on Wednesday, as reported by Reuters.\n\n“Obviously, money is a deciding factor in a lot of things in this world, but if it’s purely for money, it’s not, it never seems to go the way you want it to.”\n\nIn terms of star power, the Canadian Open will easily trump the Centurion line-up. Among the headliners in Toronto will be world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas.\n\n“People are entitled to choose as they wish,” said Thomas. “I don’t dislike DJ now. I don’t think he’s a bad dude. I’m not going to treat him any differently.\n\n“He’s entitled to choose as he wishes.\n\n“Now, I’m disappointed and I wish that he and others wouldn’t have done it, but that’s their decision.”\n\nWhat does it mean for the future of golf?\n\nIt is unclear what this will mean for the future of golf, and where players will choose to ply their trade in the future.\n\nMany of the players impacted by the ban – Mickelson, Westwood and Poulter – are in the twilights of their careers, perhaps reducing the severity of the suspension.\n\nA few players, including Johnson, Garcia and Kevin Na, resigned their PGA Tour status before play started on Thursday in London.\n\nBut for six-time major winner Mickelson, who has already earned lifetime status on the PGA Tour, it throws into question his long-term commitment to the tour. He said in his press conference on Wednesday ahead of the inaugural LIV Golf series event that he didn’t want to give up his lifetime membership of the PGA Tour, saying: “I’ve earned that, and I don’t plan on just giving it up.”\n\nJohnson and Mickelson walk off the first tee after playing their shots during the first round of the inaugural LIV Golf series event at the Centurion Club. Alastair Grant/AP\n\nAnd for the young talent in the game, the suspension offers a conundrum.\n\nThe PGA Tour is the preeminent golf tour in the world at the moment, and therefore seen as the pinnacle. However, the new, big-money tour offers a significant earning opportunity for players around the globe, in particular the up-and-coming talent.\n\nDo younger players decide to commit to the LIV Golf series, thereby ruining their chances at playing on the PGA Tour, or stick to the ‘traditional’ route and play on the PGA Tour and potentially reduce their earning capabilities?\n\nThe DP World Tour – the sport’s current second biggest tour – has yet to announce any potential sanctions to players. When contacted by CNN, it said it had “no comment to make” on the LIV Golf series.\n\nAs for golf’s four majors, players’ appearances on the LIV Golf series have also thrown their participation in those into disarray.\n\nAlthough next week’s US Open has said players are free to play if they’re qualified, next month’s Open Championship at St. Andrew’s has yet to make a public decision.\n\nShortly after the announcement, LIV Golf released a strongly worded response, calling the suspension “vindictive.”\n\n“Today’s announcement by the PGA Tour is vindictive and it deepens the divide between the Tour and its members,” it said.\n\n“It’s troubling that the Tour, an organization dedicated to creating opportunities for golfers to play the game, is the entity blocking golfers from playing. This certainly is not the last word on this topic. The era of free agency is beginning as we are proud to have a full field of players joining us in London, and beyond.”", "authors": ["Ben Morse Aimee Lewis", "Ben Morse", "Aimee Lewis"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nNASA has set a date for another attempt at launching its Artemis I mission, after Hurricane Ian forced the space agency to roll back its massive rocket into its hangar at Kennedy Space Center in Florida late last month.\n\nThe 69-minute launch window for the Space Launch System or SLS, will open at 12.07 a.m. ET on Monday, November 14, NASA said Wednesday.\n\nIf the launch is successful, the 322-feet tall rocket will send the uncrewed Orion spacecraft around the moon and back to earth to test its systems. The mission is expected to last 25 days with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean Friday, December 9.\n\nThe space agency said “minimal work” was required to prepare the rocket and Orion spacecraft for roll out to the launch pad, a slow, 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) journey that could take place as early as Friday, November 4.\n\nThe overall goal of NASA’s Artemis program is to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century. And the Artemis I mission — which is expected to be the first of many — will lay the initial groundwork, testing the rocket and spacecraft and all its subsystems to ensure it’s safe enough for astronauts to fly.\n\nBut getting this first mission off the ground has proven to be a trying endeavor. Technical issues thwarted the first two attempts, while Hurricane Ian scuppered the third try.\n\nNASA said it had requested back-up two-hour launch windows for Wednesday, November 16, at 1:04 a.m. and Saturday, November 19, at 1:45 a.m.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}]}
