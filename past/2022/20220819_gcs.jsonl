Gun violence\n\nIn a passionate address to the nation yesterday, President Joe Biden called for stricter gun laws -- including a ban on assault weapons, tougher background check laws and a higher minimum age of purchase if lawmakers cannot agree on an outright ban. His plea to lawmakers comes as many Americans remain rattled by the recent deadly mass shootings in Oklahoma Texas and New York . \"How much more carnage are we willing to accept?\" Biden asked during his speech, demanding Republicans end their blockade of gun control votes. Both Biden and his advisers have suggested they have exhausted their options on executive action to address guns. In Congress, the House Judiciary Committee approved a wide-ranging bill that would likely pass the Democratic-controlled House but wouldn't overcome a Republican-led filibuster in the Senate.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nAfter 100 days of war, about 20% of Ukraine's territory is now under Russian control, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said yesterday, adding that the Donbas region is \"almost entirely destroyed.\" About 800 people, including some children, are hiding in several bomb shelters underneath a chemical factory in Severodonetsk, which has been targeted by Russian missile attacks, the head of Luhansk region military administration said. Those in hiding are locals who were asked to leave the city but refused. Separately, the US military's hacking unit confirms it has conducted offensive cyber operations in support of Ukraine and to potentially deter Russia from conducting cyberattacks against US infrastructure.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'A huge problem': Retired colonel identifies danger area for Ukraine's military Replay More Videos ...

Tulsa shooting\n\nThe gunman who killed two doctors and two others at an Oklahoma medical building Wednesday did so after he blamed one of the physicians for causing him pain from a recent back surgery, a police chief said yesterday. Earlier that afternoon before the rampage, the shooter purchased an AR-15 style rifle used in the slaughter, city Police Chief Wendell Franklin said. He killed himself after the shooting, Franklin added. Officials also found a letter on the shooter that \"made it clear that he came in with the intent to kill [the physician] and anyone who got in his way .\" The Tulsa shooting is one of the 233 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nJUST WATCHED Tulsa gunman bought assault-style weapon the day of shooting Replay More Videos ...

January 6\n\nDuring the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows received a series of urgent pleas from Republicans who believed then-President Donald Trump had the power to stop the violence. One of the key questions the House select committee is expected to raise during high-profile hearings next week is why Trump failed to publicly condemn the attack for hours, and whether that failure is proof of \" dereliction of duty \" and evidence that Trump tried to obstruct Congress' certification of the 2020 election. CNN obtained the 2,319 text messages that Meadows selectively handed over to the January 6 committee in December before he stopped cooperating with the investigation.\n\nJUST WATCHED Reporter follows up with people who texted Meadows on Jan. 6.

Coronavirus\n\nCovid-19 shots for kids under 5 could begin in the US as soon as June 21 , the White House said yesterday. The vaccination program for the youngest Americans would come more than 18 months after vaccines were first authorized for adults. Despite some reluctance from parents , White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha expects \"the vast majority\" of kids will be vaccinated by their primary care providers. The good news, Jha said, is the US has \"plenty of supply\" of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to start the vaccination program for kids younger than 5, and 10 million additional doses would be made available for states, pharmacies, community health centers and federal entities to order starting today.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\n14-year-old wins Scripps National Spelling Bee after a historic spell-off\n\nC-o-n-g-r-a-t-u-l-a-t-i-o-n-s are in order for Harini Logan\n\nAn opossum wanders into a bar... and gets tossed out\n\nLeBron James is now a billionaire\n\nA rare, 5-planet alignment will take over the sky\n\nCalling all stargazers.

January 6\n\nThe latest hearing from the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection focused on the links between former President Donald Trump and the far-right extremist groups that were at the vanguard of the violent effort to stop the transition of power and keep him in office, despite his election loss. The panel repeatedly highlighted a Trump tweet from December 2020 to make the case that the former President courted the extremists and saw them as his troops on the ground during the Capitol riot . The tweet claimed that it was \"statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,\" and said there would be a \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th.\" Trump infamously added, \"Be there, will be wild!\" The committee also unveiled evidence showing how Trump's call for his supporters to march to the Capitol had been planned in advance.\n\n2. Uvalde\n\nLeaked surveillance video showing moments of the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, was published on Tuesday, fueling immense scrutiny over the delayed law enforcement response . The families of the victims reacted with anger and outrage to what is now the clearest account of how officers waited outside a classroom as the gunman continued firing, killing 19 students and 2 teachers on May 24. The video was obtained by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper, which published portions of it despite the Texas House Committee already announcing it would publicly release the full video on Sunday after showing it to victims' family members. Texas officials and families of the victims called the early release of the video appalling and painful to watch. The newspaper, however, defended its decision to publish the leaked footage, saying in a statement that \"unrelenting reporting is a way to bring change.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Screw you!': Uvalde parents lash out at surveillance video leak Replay More Videos ...

Elon Musk\n\nTwitter has sued billionaire Elon Musk in an effort to force him to follow through with his deal to buy the social media company. This comes just days after Musk told Twitter he wants to terminate his $44 billion acquisition agreement. The deal is now likely headed for a lengthy court battle to determine whether Twitter can force Musk to close the deal and become its owner, or at least get him to pay the $1 billion breakup fee set out in the original agreement. After initially saying he wanted to buy Twitter to eradicate bots, Musk has in recent weeks expressed concerns (without any apparent evidence) that there are more bots on the platform than Twitter has publicly reported. Some analysts, however, have suggested that Musk simply wants an excuse to get out of a deal that now seems overpriced following the downturn in Twitter shares and the overall tech market.\n\nJUST WATCHED Elon Musk may be on the hook for $1B to get out of Twitter purchase Replay More Videos ...

The stores are in Seattle; Los Angeles; Philadelphia; Washington, DC, and Portland, Oregon. They will be closed by the end of July. In a letter to employees this week , Starbucks executives said a rising number of workers are \"seeing firsthand the challenges facing our communities -- personal safety, racism, lack of access to healthcare, a growing mental health crisis, rising drug use, and more.\" The move comes as Starbucks employees across the country have been voting to unionize.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nSee what happens when you put a group of introverted dogs together\n\nDogs usually unleash their excitement at the park, but these pups clearly fur-got their energy at home.

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for serving on the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. The RNC referred to that day as \"legitimate political discourse\" in the resolution, but in a rare break with the RNC, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said what occurred was \"a violent insurrection.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, meanwhile, defended the RNC's choice of words. Separately, liberal activists are mounting a legal case to block Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn from running for reelection in North Carolina, arguing he stoked violence by telling the insurrectionists it was \"time to fight\" days before the attack.\n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nStates are pulling back on Covid-19 restrictions despite warnings from the CDC that it is too early to do so . There are about 290,000 new coronavirus cases every day, and hospitalization rates are higher than they were at the peak of the Delta surge, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said yesterday, adding it's too early to lift mask mandates. Despite calls to keep restrictions in place, several states -- including California and Delaware -- have already announced updated guidance to drop indoor mask mandates in the coming days. And in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to lift the state's strict Covid-19 mitigation requirements for businesses today. That mandate requires businesses to ask customers for proof of vaccination and for them to wear masks indoors, except when eating or drinking.\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear doctor's grim prognosis for unvaccinated Covid-19 patient Replay More Videos ...

US Postal Service\n\nThe House of Representatives yesterday passed a sweeping bipartisan bill that would overhaul the US Postal Service's finances and allow the agency to modernize its service after years of crippling losses. The Postal Service Reform Act would require retired postal employees to enroll in Medicare when eligible, while dropping a previous mandate that forced the agency to cover its health care costs years in advance. Those two measures would save the USPS nearly $50 billion over the next decade, according to the House Oversight Committee. The US Postal Service's \"dire financial condition\" has kept the agency from modernizing and prevented plans to replace the vast majority of its aging vehicle fleet with electric trucks, according to a USPS spokesperson. The bill, which cleared the House by a 342-92 vote, now heads to the Senate, where it's expected to be voted on by the end of next week.\n\nJUST WATCHED USPS labor shortage may mean Covid tests may not arrive in time Replay More Videos ...

TikTok also announced a new \"dangerous acts and challenges\" campaign that will ask creators to make videos asking their followers to follow specific steps when viewing content: stop, think, decide and act.

At least seven missile launches have occurred since last month, including their most powerful test since 2017-- which was believed to be capable of striking US territories in the Pacific Ocean. The US State Department issued a statement urging North Korea to return to peaceful dialog, calls that Pyongyang has persistently ignored.\n\nJUST WATCHED Expert: Everything we've seen, they warned us was coming Replay More Videos ...

Ukraine\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is warning that his country -- which has a much smaller military than Russia -- needs more help to prevent the crisis from spreading across Europe . Key cities in Ukraine were attacked from several sides yesterday, with Russia launching rockets that struck buildings in the center of the capital Kyiv . After days of heavy fighting and shelling, Russian troops have taken the southern city of Kherson, according to Russian state media, but the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense denies those claims. CNN was unable to immediately verify Russia's claims, although video and social media posts verified by CNN provided new evidence that the Russians are moving throughout the city apparently unimpeded. At least 136 people, including 13 children, have been killed since Russia invaded Thursday -- and another 400 civilians have been injured, according to the United Nations, though it cautioned the real toll was likely to be much higher.

Coronavirus\n\nAmericans can order another round of free at-home Covid-19 tests next week, Biden announced during his State of the Union address. In January, the government launched its effort to provide free rapid antigen tests to any household that requested them through the website COVIDtests.gov . Initially, there was a limit of four tests per residential address, but the website now says every home in the US can order an additional set of four tests. The Biden administration initially made 500 million free tests available, but fewer than 300 million have been ordered, according to the White House. Covid-19 has killed more than 952,000 people and infected about 79.1 million in the US since January 2020, according to data by Johns Hopkins University.\n\n5.

That agreement determines players' terms and conditions of employment. \"I want to assure our fans that our failure to reach an agreement was not due to a lack of effort by either party,\" Commissioner Rob Manfred said yesterday. The work stoppage stems from declining salaries among some MLB athletes and disagreements over how to divide up an estimated $11 billion in annual revenue . On the other side, owners say they have been battered by the decline of in-person attendance due to Covid-19, and are pushing to sign a new agreement to reflect those changes.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nHow to talk to your kids about Ukraine, according to psychologists\n\nIt's not an easy discussion, but a very important one.

Turkey is one of several nations -- including Israel, China and India -- that have shown interest in mediating a resolution to the invasion. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expects \"solid outcomes\" from the talks, and wants an immediate ceasefire. Russian forces have largely stalled on the ground in parts of Ukraine , but evacuations are underway in the port city of Mariupol, where the mayor says Russia controls most of the points of exit. More than 3.8 million people have fled Ukraine since the war began, according to the United Nations -- and half of them are children. On the nuclear question, a Kremlin spokesperson has ruled out Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine , saying Moscow would only use them if there was a threat to the country's existence.\n\n2. Budget proposal\n\nPresident Joe Biden has rolled out his budget proposal for fiscal year 2023 . The proposal includes almost $7 billion to counter Russian aggression, as well as an increase in military spending and more than $33 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention. The plan also includes $26 billion for NASA -- the largest request for science in the space agency's history -- setting the stage for human exploration on Mars. Overall, the proposal would cut the federal budget by $1.3 trillion. In order to reach such a massive cut and cover areas of increased funding, the proposal also calls for a new \"minimum tax on billionaires.\" The new tax plan applies to anyone worth more than $100 million -- the very wealthiest 0.01 percent of American households. How would such a plan work? Here's an in-depth explanation . In short, making sure the ultra-wealthy pay more taxes could bring in $360 billion over the next decade.\n\n3. LGBTQ rights\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed the controversial piece of state legislation, dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by critics, that bans certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom . The new law will go into effect in July, and states that \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\" Proponents say it will help parents regulate what students learn and discuss in school, but critics say it is another in a long line of measures to further silence and marginalize LGBTQ individuals. DeSantis has a history of supporting anti-LGBTQ legislation, including an anti-trans sports ban last year.\n\nJUST WATCHED State Senator broke down in tears discussing Florida bill and coming out as gay Replay More Videos ...

Gun regulation\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced a new firearm regulation yesterday meant to contain the use of so-called \"ghost guns\" -- which are unregulated, untraceable weapons made from kits. The new regulation will address a critical gap in the government's ability to track such guns by requiring background checks before purchase and serial numbers on some of the components. Up until now, anyone -- no matter their age or criminal record -- could buy the kits and assemble a weapon. Biden's move comes as gun violence and crime have ticked up in the US. Separately, Biden also named former federal prosecutor Steve Dettelbach as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- setting up what will likely be a tough confirmation fight.\n\n3.

The mandates, which go back into effect on April 18, will require Philadelphians to wear masks in all indoor public places, including schools, businesses, restaurants and government buildings. The number of people hospitalized in Philadelphia is low, but yesterday's case count was more than 50% higher than it was 10 days ago, averaging 142 cases per day. Meanwhile, pressure is building in China as Shanghai, a city of 25 million, remains on lockdown where no one is allowed to leave their residential compounds, even to buy food\n\n4. PG&E\n\n5.

The sources said members of former President Donald Trump's campaign team were far more involved than previously known in the plan, a core tenet of the broader plot to overturn President Joe Biden's victory. Giuliani and his allies coordinated the process on a state-by-state level, the sources told CNN. One said there were multiple planning calls between campaign officials and GOP state operatives, and that Giuliani participated in at least one call. The source also said the Trump campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots, secured meeting rooms in statehouses for the fake electors to meet, and circulated drafts of fake certificates that were ultimately sent to the National Archives.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nTensions surrounding the situation in Ukraine appear to be escalating following President Biden's comments earlier this week that a \"minor incursion\" by Russia into Ukraine would prompt a lesser response than a full-scale invasion . Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pushed back, saying there are \"no minor incursions and small nations.\" Multiple rounds of diplomatic talks between the US, its NATO allies and Russia failed to yield any results, but Russia now says it would welcome another conversation with Biden. Meanwhile, with approximately 100,000 troops amassed along the Ukrainian border, the head of the International Energy Agency is warning that if Russia invades Ukraine, it will have major implications on the oil industry -- driving up oil and gas prices\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear Blinken lay out case for why world should care about Ukraine Replay More Videos ...

The controversial law, which brings a halt to most abortions in the country's second-largest state, has been in effect for five months. Last month, the Supreme Court allowed the controversial law to remain in effect but it cleared a limited path forward for the providers to sue a handful of licensing officials in Texas in order to block them from enforcing the law. The court's ruling was a devastating blow to supporters of abortion rights who had hoped the justices would block the law outright. Instead, the case was returned to the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nJUST WATCHED Supreme Court upholds TX abortion law, but says providers can sue Replay More Videos ...

The four officials, including the director of the state's air navigation agency, called in a fake bomb threat to Minsk air traffic control and then covered up the move by directing air traffic controllers to falsify incident reports about the airplane's diversion. The diversion led to the arrest of leading Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich , sparking a global uproar calling for his release.

Irpin, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, has been the site of intense shelling by the Russia in recent days. The UN said yesterday that more than 360 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, while acknowledging that the real figure is likely \"considerably higher.\" The UN also said more than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24. Meanwhile in Russia, more than 4,600 people were detained during protests yesterday, according to an independent monitoring group.

Coronavirus\n\nDemocrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are gearing up for a showdown over Covid-19 relief funding this week. House Democrats plan to introduce a massive spending bill as soon as tomorrow that includes roughly $10 billion to help bolster Ukraine, but also tacks on about $22.5 billion in coronavirus relief money that Republicans widely oppose. The move would put Republicans in a tough spot -- essentially daring them to block a package that includes money for Ukraine -- according to a Democratic source familiar with the matter. The pressure is on for both parties to secure a deal before Friday, when government funding expires. If a broad funding package doesn't move quickly, lawmakers may be forced to pass another short-term stopgap funding measure to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n4.

Some prosecutors, including the two that resigned, believed there was sufficient evidence to charge Trump, while others, including some career prosecutors, were skeptical that they could win a conviction at trial -- in part because of the difficulty in proving criminal intent, people familiar with the investigation said.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nJCPenney and Tide tried to get rid of coupons.

Following the speech, President Biden is expected to unveil a new $800 million assistance package for Ukraine. Officials familiar with the plan said the aid will include anti-tank missiles and other defensive weapons, bringing the total to $1 billion announced in just the last week.

To date, more than 960,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the US since the pandemic began. In an effort to help, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has disbursed more than $2 billion in funeral assistance to those who have lost loved ones to the virus. The funds were distributed to more than 300,000 applicants, according to FEMA, with the average amount of assistance totaling roughly $6,500.

The 18-year-old gunman was not confronted by police before he entered the school, a Texas law enforcement official said yesterday. This new detail comes after a representative with the Texas Department of Public Safety on Wednesday said a school resource officer had \"engaged\" with the shooter before he went into the school. Among the many urgent questions that have caused anger and dismay from the public, it is still unclear why it took an hour for a tactical team to assemble and force its way inside.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong (CNN) More than two years have passed since China sealed off an entire city of more than 11 million people to curb the world's first Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nBut in many parts of the country, tough coronavirus restrictions are still making it difficult for people to travel just days before the biggest festival of the year.\n\nSunday marked the second anniversary of the start of the Wuhan lockdown -- a drastic move that stunned the nation just two days before Lunar New Year.\n\nChina has long since recovered from the initial devastation wrought by the pandemic, while Beijing's uncompromising zero-Covid policy -- which relies on mass testing, extensive quarantines and snap lockdowns -- has enjoyed widespread public support.\n\nBut with the prospect of another Lunar New Year homecoming canceled, some people are growing frustrated.\n\nKnown as Spring Festival in China, Lunar New Year -- which falls on February 1 this year -- is the most important time for families to get together, likened by some to Christmas, Thanksgiving and New Years combined.\n\nEvery year, hundreds of millions of people who have left their hometowns to build a life in China's fast growing cities pour into trains, buses and planes to see their family -- a weeks-long travel rush known as the largest annual human migration on Earth.\n\nThis year, China's Ministry of Transportation expects 1.18 billion trips to be made during the Lunar New Year travel season, a 35% increase from last year -- but still much lower than the 3 billion trips taken in 2019 before the pandemic.\n\nAnd across China, a growing list of local authorities are discouraging residents from traveling to curb the spread of the coronavirus -- especially the highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nBacklash over local restrictions\n\nLast week, an official in the central province of Henan sparked an outcry after threatening to detain returning travelers.\n\nIn a viral video, Dong Hong, head of Dancheng county, was heard saying at a meeting that \"anyone returning home from medium- or high-risk areas will be quarantined and then detained.\"\n\nAmid a firestorm of criticism, Dong later said he was only referring to people who don't obey local prevention policies and \"maliciously return home.\" But many questioned how the desire to reunite with one's family could be seen as malevolent.\n\n\"Is it wrong for a migrant worker who toils day and night, who lives far away from home, to return to his hometown and reunite with his family during his only few days of annual holiday?\" asked a widely shared post on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform. \"We can all understand the severity of the (Covid) situation, and we can abide the prevention and control rules, but we should also be able to fulfill our wishes to go home for the Lunar New Year.\"\n\nAs the backlash mounted, even state media weighed in. \"It is only human nature to want to return home for reunions during the Spring Festival, so why is it malicious?\" the Communist Party's official mouthpiece, People's Daily, said in a social media post Saturday.\n\nIn a commentary Friday, state broadcaster CCTV accused local authorities of \"deliberately creating obstacles and difficulties for people to return home,\" adding that many were \"ignoring the requirements of scientific epidemic prevention and control and adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.\"\n\nTo be able to board trains, flights, buses and pass highway checkpoints, travelers in China must hold a green health code on their phone -- indicating they have not recently been in any areas with Covid infections. But local authorities often impose their own requirements, preventing people from returning or subjecting them to lengthy quarantine even if their health code is green.\n\nLast week, a worker in the southern metropolis of Shenzhen was traveling on a homebound train to Guangxi province when local authorities in her hometown told her that upon arrival she must spend a week in hotel quarantine followed by a week of home isolation, according to Chinese state media.\n\nUnwilling to spend the festival in isolation at a cost of 2,100 yuan (about $330) for hotel quarantine, the woman got off the train and bought a ticket for the next one back to Shenzhen.\n\nTravelers wearing masks wait in the main hall of Shanghai's Hongqiao Railway Station ahead of Lunar New Year, on January 23, 2022.\n\nChina's Covid outbreaks\n\nThe stringent local restrictions partly stem from the tremendous political pressure for local authorities to prevent Covid flare-ups -- often under the threat of harsh punishment should they fail. With the Lunar New Year and the Beijing Winter Olympics just around the corner, such pressure has only intensified.\n\nIn recent weeks, China has been grappling with a flurry of Covid outbreaks, from a Delta outbreak in the northwestern city of Xi'an to an Omicron outbreak in the northeastern port city of Tianjin. At one point, more than 20 million residents in three Chinese cities were under full lockdown, prevented from leaving their homes.\n\nOn Monday, Xi'an authorities announced the city is beginning to lift its lockdown, which had confined its 13 million residents to their homes for a month. The stringent measures had caused food shortages and denied medical care to critical patients, causing widespread anger among residents.\n\nBeijing, scheduled to host the 2022 Winter Olympics from February 4, has reported 43 Covid cases since January 15. They include six Omicron infections -- which authorities have blamed on mail from Canada -- and a cluster of Delta cases in the southwestern district of Fengtai, which have spread to two nearby provinces. On Sunday, Fengtai launched a mass testing campaign, aiming to collect samples from its 2 million residents in one day.\n\nThe Chinese capital has advised residents against traveling home for the holiday, as have Shanghai and other big cities where a large part of the population come from the countryside or smaller cities.\n\nIn Dongguan, a southern manufacturing hub that's home to nearly 7 million migrant workers, the government said it would give 500 million yuan (about $80 million) to non-local employees who stay in the city for Lunar New Year, with each person receiving digital vouchers worth 500 yuan, state media reported.", "authors": ["Analysis Nectar Gan", "Steve George"], "publish_date": "2022/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/28/navaratri-festival-9-nights/713200001/", "title": "Navaratri: What is the Indian festival of 9 nights?", "text": "Kimberly Winston\n\nReligion News Service\n\nMany non-Hindus are at least vaguely aware of Diwali, the Hindu holiday marked by lights, dressing up and the exchange of gifts. But some Hindus say Diwali gets overemphasized outside India because of some similarities to Christmas. (Sound familiar, Hanukkah?)\n\nMore important than Diwali is, in fact, Navaratri, which Hindus around the world are celebrating right now. What is this religious holiday, sacred to the more than 1 billion Hindus worldwide yet relatively unknown by non-Hindus, all about? Let us explain:\n\nWhat is Navaratri?\n\nNavaratri means “nine nights” in Sanskrit and is always celebrated near harvest time. It honors Shakti, the Hindu version of the divine feminine. Shakti takes many forms and each day of the festival is focused on one of her qualities. In some parts of India, celebrants don a different, specific, color for each day and perform different daily rituals. At night there are special Navaratri dances (called “garba” and “dandiya raas”), street processions, feasts and fun. The whole festival lasts 10 days, this year from Sept. 21-30.\n\nNavaratri is the longest-running dance festival on the planet. With multiple mythological and historical roots, the festivities are a celebration of the feminine, wherein the revelers dance to the tunes of traditional folk music.\n\nNavaratri may have originated from several Hindu myths. One tells of a nine-day battle Shakti had with a demon before trouncing him on the 10th day. Another says the god Rama fasted and prayed to Shakti for nine days to win her help in defeating a 10-headed demon. He did — also on the 10th day — so the last day of Navaratri, called the “Day of Victory,” marks the triumph of good over evil.\n\nHow important is this holiday?\n\n“It is probably the most important Indian festival you have never heard of,” Balaji Viswanathan, a writer in Karnataka, India, wrote on the website Quora. It is also, he noted, one of the few Indian holidays where women take center stage — part of the festival honors Shakti as mother, with the placement of pots and other vessels as symbolic of her womb. There are at least as many different customs and traditions associated with Navaratri as there are Indian states. (Fun fact: There are 29 Indian states.)\n\nIn western India, people dance in the streets with specially decorated batons. In Karnataka, elephants are dressed up and paraded through the streets. In south India, families arrange dozens — sometimes hundreds — of small figurines into elaborate tableaus depicting the lives of the gods. Across the country people fast, give sweets to children (like Halloween, another harvest festival), buy gold as a sign of good luck, burn demon effigies and give gifts to young girls, seen as special to Shakti.\n\nWhat are the nine “faces” of Shakti?\n\nShakti is the source of primal energy (day one), repentance and rebirth (day two), slayer of evil (day three), creator of the universe (day four), mother of warriors (day five), daughter of wisdom (day six), the bringer of death (day seven), the giver of calmness and wisdom (day eight) and the fulfiller of wishes (day nine).\n\nI am not Hindu and I don’t live in India. Are there Navaratri festivities I could attend here?\n\nWe could all use a little dancing in the streets and some sweets, no? There are Navaratri concerts, dance performances and cultural festivals slated for metro New York; New Jersey; Atlanta; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Houston; Dallas; San Jose, Calif.; and more. In a sign of how integral Indians have become in the U.S., even Peoria, Ill., once the banner city for mainstream American culture, has a Navaratri festival. Its Hindu community is holding it at an Episcopal church.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/05/27/memorial-day-history-explained/9931640002/", "title": "What is Memorial Day and why do we celebrate it in the US?", "text": "No, Memorial Day isn't about a long weekend road trip, backyard barbecue or sales. The real meaning of the national holiday is much more somber.\n\nOriginally called Decoration Day, Monday's holiday honors all soldiers who died during service to the nation.\n\nMemorial Day was declared a national holiday through an act of Congress in 1971, and its roots date back to the Civil War era, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs.\n\nUnlike Veterans Day, Memorial Day honors all military members who have died in while serving in U.S. forces.\n\nAhead of this year’s holiday, here are some Memorial Day facts you might not know:\n\nWhat is Memorial Day and why do we celebrate it?\n\nThe origins of the holiday can be traced back to local observances for soldiers with neglected gravesites during the Civil War.\n\nThe first observance of what would become Memorial Day, some historians think, took place in Charleston, S.C., at the site of a horse racing track that Confederates had turned into a prison holding Union prisoners. Blacks in the city organized a burial of deceased Union prisoners and built a fence around the site, Yale historian David Blight wrote in The New York Times in 2011.\n\nThen on May 1, 1865, they held an event there including a parade – Blacks who fought in the Civil War participated – spiritual readings and songs, and picnicking. A commemorative marker was erected there in 2010.\n\nOne of the first Decoration Days was held in Columbus, Mississippi, on April 25, 1866 by women who decorated graves of Confederate soldiers who perished in the battle at Shiloh with flowers.\n\nOn May 5, 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the tradition of placing flowers on veterans’ graves was continued by the establishment of Decoration Day by an organization of Union veterans, the Grand Army of the Republic.\n\nGeneral Ulysses S. Grant presided over the first large observance, a crowd of about 5,000 people, at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on May 30, 1873. The orphaned children of soldiers and sailors killed during the war placed flowers and small American flags atop both Union and Confederate graves throughout the entire cemetery.\n\nThis tradition continues to thrive in cemeteries of all sizes across the country.\n\nUntil World War I, Civil War soldiers were solely honored on this holiday. Now, all Americans who’ve served are observed.\n\nAt least 25 places in the North and the South claim to be the birthplace of Memorial Day. Some states that claim ownership of the origins include Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, according to Veterans Affairs.\n\nDespite conflicting claims, the U.S. Congress and President Lyndon Johnson declared Waterloo, New York, as the “birthplace” of Memorial Day on May 30, 1966, after Governor Nelson Rockefeller's declaration that same year. The New York community formally honored local veterans May 5, 1866 by closing businesses and lowering flags at half-staff.\n\nWhat is the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day?\n\nMemorial Day and Veterans Day both honor the sacrifices made by U.S. Veterans but serve different purposes.\n\nVeterans’ Day, originally called “Armistice Day,” is a younger holiday established in 1926 as a way to commemorate all those who had served in the U.S. armed forces during World War I. Memorial Day honors all those who’ve died.\n\nVeterans Day is observed on Nov. 11 to signify the Armistice that ended combat in World War I in 1918.\n\nAfter World War II, Armistice Day's purpose broadened and changed in 1954 to recognize those who have served in all American wars.\n\nWhat's open and closed on Memorial Day?:What to know about mail delivery, store hours\n\nWhy is Memorial Day in May?\n\nThe day that we celebrate Memorial Day is believed to be influenced by Illinois U.S. Representative John A. Logan, who was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in November 1858, and served as an officer during the Mexican War.\n\nIt is said that Logan, a staunch defender of the Union, believed Memorial Day should occur when flowers are in full bloom across the country, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Army.\n\nCongress passed an act making May 30 a holiday in the District of Columbia in 1888, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service.\n\nNow Memorial Day is observed as the last Monday of May.\n\nIn 2000 The National Moment of Remembrance Act – which created the White House Commission on the National Moment of Remembrance and encourages all to pause at 3 p.m. local time on Memorial Day for a minute of silence – was signed into law by Congress and the President.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/24/europe/ukraine-orthodox-easter-celebrations-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Ukrainians celebrate Easter in the shadow of war | CNN", "text": "Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) They've endured intense battles, brutal airstrikes and unimaginable loss, but this weekend many Ukrainians will attempt to celebrate one of their most important holidays of the year: Orthodox Easter .\n\nTraditionally a time of reflection and rebirth, this Sunday will also mark exactly two months since the country was thrust into a devastating war after Russian forces invaded on February 24.\n\nIn his nightly address Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ruminated on the significance of the date. \"Today was Holy Saturday for Christians of the Eastern Rite. The day between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. It seems that Russia is stuck on such a day,\" he said.\n\n\"On the day when death triumphs and God is supposedly gone. But there will be a Resurrection. Life will defeat death. The truth will defeat any lies. And evil will be punished,\" added Zelensky.\n\nAs fighting escalates in the south and east , many in Ukraine are leaning into their faith in search of solace, while others are opting to journey home from neighboring Poland to be among loved ones for Easter commemorations.\n\n\"I've never been this happy in my life. When I finally saw my husband again, on my first night here, I still felt like this was a dream,\" Anna-Mariia Nykyforchyn, 25, tells CNN from Lviv, a western city largely spared from the Russian assault\n\nNine months pregnant when the war broke out, Nykyforchyn was one of more than five million who have made the difficult call to leave. She returned two days ago with her baby Marharyta.\n\n\"For me, it was extremely important to come back home before Easter,\" she says, before sharing her joy over the prospect of the couple's grandparents meeting the new addition to the family. \"I really wanted us to be together. It's such a ray of hope that everything is going to be okay.\"\n\nPerched on the sofa in her apartment in central Lviv, Nykyforchyn glances over at her 27-year-old husband Nazar, whose attention is firmly fixed on the tiny, infant girl napping on his lap.\n\n\"I had a very tough experience of staying in Poland both physically, because of the baby, and mentally. It was more than difficult, unbearable,\" she says.\n\nNykyforchyn left Ukraine for Poland when the war started where she gave birth to her daughter soon after.\n\n\"I moved to uncertainty: to strange people, to a strangers' house, to a city I've never been to before, to a country with a language I don't speak fluently. I understood that I would have to give birth in a clinic where no one knows me and where I haven't made any agreements. I didn't know how it would be. But the main thought which kept me afloat was that my child has to be born in safe conditions,\" says Nykyforchyn.\n\nAware of the toll on his wife, Nazar chimes in: \"She is not just a woman, she is a hero ... if I were in her shoes I wouldn't be able to ... I would've broken down. And she didn't break down.\"\n\nWhile the proud father is clearly delighted to be reunited with his wife and daughter, this young family are some of the more fortunate. Not all will get the same chance to reunite with loved ones.\n\nA priest reminds parishioners of Jesus' sacrifice from the steps of the Church of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin in Lviv, Ukraine on April 23, 2022.\n\nThe Ukrainian government announced new curfews for Easter weekend , amid warnings from authorities about the potential for increased Russian military activity during holiday celebrations. And earlier this week, officials in the Luhansk and Sumy regions urged residents to attend virtual services , citing possible Russian \"provocations,\" while noting many churches have been destroyed in the invasion.\n\nDespite concerns, residents in Lviv descended on churches in the city for blessings of protection and prayer on Saturday. At the Church of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin, the faithful ignored the calls to stay at home and instead queued with decorated baskets of food ready to be blessed with Holy Water by parish priests.\n\nYoung and old line up with decorated food baskets.\n\nVolodymyr, 53, stands patiently alongside his family as they wait for the priest to make his way down the line.\n\n\"People often think that holidays should be merry, bring relief, and make it easier -- and when they feel good they don't turn to real faith ... Now we are going through hard times, people are starting to come closer to God, there are more people here than before, and that's good for us,\" he says, before showing us the homemade paska (a traditional Easter bread), sausage, ham and cheese nestled among candles and decorative eggs in his basket.\n\n\"Today in the morning there was an air alarm, but now thank God it's calmer and we could come. It's very important for us. It's the church we visit often,\" he adds.\n\nEaster baskets will be sent to soldiers complete with decorative eggs featuring messages of encouragement. Here one note reads: \"Come back alive\" while another says \"Glory to Ukrainian armed forces and the air defense system.\"\n\nNearby, 35-year-old church volunteer Andrii is dutifully loading collection boxes of Easter food for Ukrainian troops. \"We are trying to keep a festive mood and hope for justice and peace. This holiday, Easter gives even more hope.

For some communities, the day after Diwali also marks the beginning of the new year,\" says Deven Patel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's South Asia Studies department.\n\nThe dates change each year because they are based on the Hindu lunar calendar, but it typically happens in October and November. This year, Diwali will be on Thursday, Nov. 4. The festivals and celebrations usually last for several days.\n\nDiwali in the time of COVID\n\nWhile Diwali is typically a joyous occasion heralding new beginnings, this particular year will be different.\n\n\"There has been so much devastation with COVID. I don't think there is any family that has been untouched by COVID,\" says Inni Kaur, creative director at the Sikh Research Institute.\n\nFirst detected in October 2020, the deadlier and highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus ravaged India in the past year. In April and May, the country’s health system collapsed under a severe spike in cases that caught the government unprepared and led to mass fatalities.\n\n\"When we have a death in the family, these types of celebrations are not celebrated with exuberance,\" Kaur points out. \"We have a year of mourning in most cultures and in most homes. So it's going to be a subdued celebration.\"\n\nHowever, vaccinations have made a difference in how people might celebrate as opposed to last year, points out Mat McDermott, senior director of communications for the Hindu American Foundation.\n\n\"Now that hopefully everyone eligible for a vaccine has gotten one, COVID shouldn’t change celebrations as much as was the case in 2020. For people going to their nearest temple for a puja, people will follow whatever local appropriate COVID restrictions and precautions are in place,\" McDermott says.\n\nCOVID vaccine for kids:Everything to know about COVID-19 vaccine and children\n\nFlu + COVID vaccines:Is it safe to get a flu shot and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time? Experts explain\n\nHow do people celebrate?\n\nThe literal translation of Deepavali is \"a row of lamps and lights.\"\n\nPeople will often line candles and lamps throughout their house and along their driveway to illuminate their surroundings. They might also buy colorful new clothes or host gatherings of friends and family to celebrate together.\n\nFor Hindus, Diwali is a time for dana (charitable giving) and seva (selfless service), and according to the Hindu American Foundation, Hindus traditionally perform a deep cleaning of their homes and surroundings, as cleanliness is believed to invoke the presence and blessings of deities related to wealth and prosperity.\n\nHindus also celebrate with colorful patterns of flowers, powder, rice or sand on the floor, an artistic practice called rangoli meant to bring good luck, says the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nFor Sikhs, Diwali celebrates sixth Guru, who serves as a source of inspiration and a symbol for freedom, according to Kaur. The guru was in prison and refused to leave prison without the other 52 political prisoners being released. The day of Diwali celebrates his release, along with the other political prisoners he fought for, says Kaur.\n\n\"The inspiration is to stand with the oppressed. It's not about your freedom. It is about the freedom of everyone,\" Kaur says.\n\nKaur says the Sikhs celebrate Diwali as a holiday to serve others and help the oppressed, similar to how the sixth Guru helped the other political prisoners. It's a holiday for people to reflect what they are grateful for and how they can shine light on others as well, Kaur says.\n\nKaur encourages people to honor Diwali by thinking, \"What are you going to do to make that light shine the brightest in you?\"\n\nSome sweet recipes\n\nDiwali is also known for its sweet treats. Patel recommended a few recipes to USA TODAY if you plan on honoring Diwali:\n\nMotichur Laddu is a sugary concoction that melts in your mouth. Start with gram flour batter and fry it into tiny balls. Then drizzle it with sugary syrup and mix in nuts and spices for the perfect bite-sized treat. Find the full recipe on veganrecipesofindia.com.\n\nJalebiis a spiral-shaped sweet made of all-purpose flour, gram flour and sugar syrup. Boil sugar and water to make the syrup, and mix maida, corn flour, tumeric and curd to make the batter. Using a sauce bottle, draw spirals of the batter onto a frying pan, then drizzle the sugar syrup on top. Find the full recipe on indianhealthyrecipes.com.\n\nGulab jamun is a dessert made of small balls (like the size of donut holes) dipped in a pool of rose-flavored sugar syrup. You can make the syrup with a combination of cardamom, sugar and water, and the dough for the balls is made up of flour, yogurt, milk and milk powder. Once the dough is shaped into balls, fry them and drown them in syrup.

But he has ...", "text": "(CNN) President Vladimir Putin takes Russian anniversaries seriously. It was no coincidence that his invasion of Ukraine came a day after Defender of the Fatherland Day, a celebration of Russia's military achievements. It was on that same occasion in 2014 that Putin took the first step in annexing Crimea from Ukraine, through orchestrated pro-Russian protests on the peninsula.\n\nThe leader had clearly hoped to have more to celebrate by this Victory Day on Monday , the country's most patriotic of dates, marking the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II. It was on May 8, 1945, (May 9 in Moscow's time zone) that Germany signed its Instrument of Surrender in Berlin, ending the fighting in Europe. The USSR suffered the biggest losses of any nation -- around 27 million soldiers and civilians died.\n\nRussia's justification for war in Ukraine suggested a deadline for success by Victory Day. Putin and his government have repeatedly said the aim of their so-called \"special operation\" is to \"denazify\" Ukraine, and that freeing the country of Nazis is a matter of Russian survival. It's an argument that has no real weight; a blatant cover for Russian revanchism.\n\nEven though the Kremlin's well-oiled propaganda machine has been going at full steam since the February invasion, it will be difficult for Putin to twist Russia's losses into true victory on Monday.\n\nIf anything, the operation in Ukraine has been an embarrassment for him -- at least on the international stage.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attending the 2019 Victory Day military parade at Red Square in Moscow.\n\nRussia's military outsizes Ukraine's by every measure -- even with the heavy weapons the West is sending in -- yet it failed to take territory in the north, let alone the capital, Kyiv, and is struggling to make gains even in the east, where it is now focused.\n\nUkraine's armed forces claim that Russia has lost more than 24,000 troops in just over two months, and more than 1,000 tanks, over 2,600 armored vehicles and hundreds of aircraft. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers, and there are likely to be heavy losses on the Ukrainian side too. Still, it's undeniable that Russia military is weakened.\n\nRussia's guided-missile cruiser the Moskva -- once the crown jewel of its Black Sea fleet -- is now a wreck, sitting destroyed in the depths of the sea.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin's foes in the West, whom Russia had tried so hard to divide over years, are increasingly united, all for the cause of ensuring victory for Ukraine.\n\nEmily Ferris, a research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute, said that Russia's failures had been largely logistical.\n\n\"Some of the logistical problems they had were partly because they never really managed to take major railway hubs at all, frankly, in the whole country,\" Ferris told CNN. \"And because the Russian motorized ground forces rely on the railways to move all of their troops, their hardware and their tanks. Because they never really managed to control those hubs, they never really managed to push particularly far into Ukrainian territory, and it meant that they then had to rely on off-road capabilities.\"\n\nRussian forces instead moved by trucks and slow-moving tanks, many of which were bogged down in mud, as warmer weather prevented the ground from freezing and allowing freer movement, Ferris said.\n\n\"Then it meant that it was tricky to tow the tanks back to Russia for repairs, because they were far away, and so a lot of them were abandoned. Lots of their equipment started breaking because the tanks can only take so much moving around,\" she said. \"And, of course, you have the very well-documented resistance from local Ukrainians, who didn't take too well to being occupied.\"\n\nDestroyed and burned Russian tanks along a highway near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.\n\nEven in the east, where Russian forces are trying to advance through the Donbas region, their gains have been limited. Pro-Russian rebels have been installed in the self-declared separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk for years, but still, Russia hasn't annexed those areas, and its forces are struggling to get through a stiff Ukrainian resistance in big cities.\n\n\"We're still talking about huge amounts of territory -- Ukraine is massive -- even if they are just focusing on the east and the south. Some of the claims from senior commanders that they're going to be establishing a land corridor across the south of Ukraine, it's still a huge task,\" Ferris said. \"The fact that they've not been able to take major cities and major rail hubs before is still a problem. I think that's going to persist.\"\n\nAn alternate universe\n\nSitting in Russia, however, it's easy to think that the war is going to plan. Russian propaganda is flooding the media, which is almost entirely state-controlled, but in March the government also passed a law making \"false news\" about the military illegal, a crime that comes with a maximum 15-year jail term.\n\nAs a result, the antiwar protests that happened in Russia in the early weeks of the invasion have all but ended. And the media is largely complying with the new law.\n\nPolice officers detain a man during a protest against the conflict in Ukraine, in Manezhnaya Square in central Moscow on March 13, 2022.\n\nIndeed, Russia is pushing ahead with force. It's in the midst of a prolonged battle in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, where its forces are intensely shelling a huge steel plant that it has failed to seize. If the plant falls, the city is more or less in their hands.\n\nIntelligence reports show that Russia could be planning to annex Luhansk and Donetsk \"sometime in mid-May\" and could also declare and annex a so-called \"people's republic\" in the southeastern city of Kherson, according to US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Michael Carpenter, who spoke to reporters on Monday.\n\nAny advancements are amplified in Russian media, where the messaging of success is very clear, Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, told CNN.\n\n\"The message is that Russia is moving according to plan and everything is going as it should, that there are some gains. Russia has declared that it took Mariupol, and so everything is going according to the plan,\" she said.\n\nThat messaging is filtering through to the Russian people effectively, according to Levada Center polls, which show that not only do the vast majority of Russians support the war, but 68% of Russians think the operation is proceeding successfully . Putin's popularity has also soared to 82% , after remaining stubbornly in the 60s since the Covid-19 pandemic hit right up until February, the month of Russia's invasion. Polling in Russia must be taken with a grain of salt, however, given people are subject to a stream of propaganda and dissent is not tolerated.\n\nStanovaya added that there was an additional narrative in state media that Russia is the victim in this war and that the country is acting defensively.\n\n\"When you're watching Russian TV for several days, you can really start believing that we are in a huge danger of Ukrainian Nazis. That we are vulnerable, that we should, we must get up and protect ourselves, otherwise it's a matter of Russian existence,\" she said.\n\nPutin doesn't even need to use Monday to declare any kind of victory, Stanovaya argued. He will just need to bank on the anti-Nazi emotions of the holiday to consolidate his justification for war.\n\nThe world waits\n\nAs Russians will be listening in on Putin's Victory Day speech, so too will global leaders and observers, eager to learn where Putin might take his war next. There has been much speculation, but as always with the Russian President, no one really knows.\n\nThere's a growing sense of nervousness that with so little to show the world -- if not Russians -- more than two months into the war, Putin may double down on his \"special operation.\"\n\nUK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace even suggested last week on a UK radio station that Putin may drop his guise of a \"special operation\" and outrightly declare war . Doing so could trigger a huge mobilization of Russian fighters, even civilian conscripts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday dismissed Wallace's suggestion as \"nonsense.\" But if Russia's military continues to deplete at the rate it is, it's not impossible that Putin will make that decision at some point.\n\nRussian service members marching on Red Square in central Moscow on May 9, 2021, to mark Victory Day.\n\nAndrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he thinks Putin's original plan was to declare victory and an end to hostilities on Monday.\n\n\"But it is obvious that the war is dragging on, and Putin's plan is not getting any clearer. But he must make some symbolic or practical gesture,\" he said, speaking to CNN from Moscow.\n\n\"Everyone here is scared that he will announce a partial or full mobilization. Although such a measure might prove unpopular: the Russians have become militarists, but they are lazy militarists, sofa troops.\"\n\nWhile Victory Day is about World War II, it has also become a source of legitimacy for Putin, who has found ways to associate himself with the day, said Kolesnikov, who accuses the leader of simplifying the historical details and \"turning the celebration into a pompous ritual.\"\n\nIn the Putin years, the mythology around World War II has metamorphosized. Historians note it glorifies Soviet sacrifice, while downplaying Stalin's willingness to squander human lives. It glosses over the darkest chapters of the war: The USSR's pact with Nazi Germany that served as a prelude to war; the wholesale deportation of entire populations deemed untrustworthy by the Soviets; and mass rapes by Soviet soldiers in occupied Germany during the waning days of the war.\n\nEven a grassroots parade known as the \"Immortal Regiment\" to honor those who died in the war has been co-opted by the government. Putin now routinely leads marches himself. Stalin -- who refused to believe Adolf Hitler's army would invade the Soviet Union when it did --- is increasingly being celebrated as a hero on May 9, not as the leader who was caught off guard in the 1941 German attack.\n\n\"Of course, the new generations do not really understand the significance of the holiday,\" Kolesnikov said. \"Those who do understand and know history are horrified by the way Putin has privatized it.\"\n\nAnd on Monday, the significance of May 9 may change yet again, depending on what Putin has to say.", "authors": ["Analysis Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/10/19/what-diwali-festival-lights-and-how-celebrated/779643001/", "title": "What is Diwali, the Festival of Lights, and how is it celebrated?", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWhat is Diwali?\n\nDiwali, or Deepavali, a Sanskrit word meaning “rows of lighted lamps,” is a Hindu-originated festival celebrated in India and by the Indian diaspora. During the five-day celebration — also known as the “festival of lights” — clay lamps known as diyas are lit to signify the victory of good over evil, according to the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nOver time, Diwali has become a national festival marked by most Indians regardless of faith, with Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs also celebrating. Diwali also celebrates the goddess of wealth and prosperity, Lakshmi. Some believe it falls on her birthday and the day she married Lord Vishnu, another Hindu god.\n\nHindus interpret the Diwali story based on where they live, according to National Geographic. In northern India, they mark the story of King Rama's return to Ayodhya after he defeated Ravana by lighting rows of clay lamps. In southern India, people celebrate it as the day Lord Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura. In western India, the festival marks the day Lord Vishnu, one of the main gods of the Hindu trinity, sent the demon King Bali to rule the nether world.\n\nMeanwhile, in Jainism it marks the nirvana or spiritual awakening of Lord Mahavira, National Geographic reported. And for Sikhs, it celebrates the day a major guru was freed from imprisonment.\n\nWhen is it this year?\n\nDiwali falls between October and November, but the exact dates change each year based on the Hindu lunar calendar, according to England’s Independent newspaper. It lasts five days, with the major celebrations occurring on the third day, which this year falls on Oct. 19.\n\nWhat happens during Diwali?\n\nIn India and other places where the holiday is celebrated, residents leave their windows and doors open to allow Lakshmi to find her way into their homes, the Independent reported. Every home is lit with diyas, leaving no room for darkness to enter, and doorsteps are decorated to welcome guests, according to the Hindu American Foundation. In addition, many people wear new clothing to thank Lakshmi for providing prosperity and good fortune. And, as evening comes, firecrackers are set off.\n\nIsn’t there some eating involved?\n\nOf course. Throughout the festival, traditional sweets and savory items are eaten as well as full meals, particularly on the third and fifth days, according to the American Hindu Foundation.

Others, still follow the tradition of sticking to bare eyes to see the moon's shape.\n\nEid al-Fitr is celebrated to commemorate the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and takes place over three days. Eid al-Fitr means “the celebration of breaking the fast.”\n\nRamadan marks the time when the Quran, the Muslim holy book, was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Devout Muslims fast during daylight hours and spend time in self-reflection, prayer and giving charity.\n\nThere are two Eids celebrated in the year: Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr.\n\nEid al-Adha, or \"feast of the sacrifice,\" celebrated this year from July 9-10, marks the willingness of the Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son to Allah.

Muslims are obligated to pay zakat yearly toward feeding and helping those in need.\n\nAhead of the day of Eid, before the morning prayer at the latest, there's a special charity required called zakat al-Fitr. The exact amount differs according to the state of the economy. The donations help people celebrate Eid no matter their financial situation, Tareq Alkhudari, a Kuwaiti human rights activist, told USA TODAY.\n\nHow is Eid celebrated?\n\nOn Eid, Muslims traditionally have a light breakfast and then head to the mosque for a special prayer and a sermon, according to Mozaffar.\n\nAfter praying, Muslim families gather and exchange gifts. Traditional dishes and sweets are also made and exchanged.\n\n\"If you visit different families, you're gonna get fed a lot,\" said Mozaffar.\n\nDuring this celebration, some Muslims volunteer at soup kitchens or food pantries, according to Mozaffar, to help those less fortunate.\n\nLooking for Ramadan recipe inspiration?These dishes use dates to sweet-savory effect\n\nCelebrating in the US\n\nAlkhudari and Mozaffar expressed their frustration that Eid al-Fitr doesn't get more attention in the U.S., even though Muslims make up more than 1% of the population.\n\nIn Islamic countries, people usually get all three days of the celebration off from work. In the U.S., some are able to request time off while others can't.\n\n\"If we're lucky enough to have one day, we try to get as much of the celebration done in that one day,\" said Mozaffar.\n\nMozaffar mentioned how his mosque puts particular effort to make this holiday fun for kids so that they do not feel as excluded when Christmas comes around.\n\nA graduate student in New York City, Alkhudari takes the day off from his institution to practice his religion.\n\n\"There's a sense of being singled out, almost in humiliating fashion, by having to personally ask for the day off,\" he said. \"It's almost like one is pleading to have their faith and culture respected and acknowledged from those in power to grant you the celebratory day off.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/30"}]}

Now she can finally disappear into the depths of political oblivion.\"\n\nCheney, meanwhile, told supporters she will continue to speak out, and do everything she can to keep Trump out of the White House after 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCheney v.

I called her to concede the race. This primary election is over but now the real work begins.”\n\nCheney again denounced Trump for \"lies\" about the 2020 election, and indicated she would work against other Republican \"election deniers\" who are seeking offices across the country in this year's election.\n\nThe three-term lawmaker did not allude to a presidential campaign of her own in 2024, nor did she discuss in detail her ongoing work on the Jan. 6 congressional committee investigation.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nHageman, once a Cheney supporter, defeats the incumbent\n\nHarriet Hageman, a trial lawyer and Trump ally who challenged the Cheney political dynasty, defeated the incumbent congresswoman in one of the most-watched House Republican primaries in the country.\n\nHageman’s win was expected, coming days after a University of Wyoming poll showed Rep. Liz Cheney trailing by 29 points.\n\nBut they weren’t always political foes. Hageman campaigned for Cheney during previous congressional runs, calling her a “friend” and “constitutional conservative” who could fight for Wyoming.\n\nIn this cycle, it was Cheney’s commitment to the constitution that the congresswoman said would cost her a seat. She said she knew her loss was imminent when she put her oath of office above loyalty to former President Trump.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nWhy she did it:Republican Rep. Liz Cheney is on track to lose her Wyoming primary. Here's how she's chasing a bigger win\n\nHageman: Trump ‘propelled us to victory tonight’\n\n“By our vote today, Wyoming has put the elites on notice - we are no longer going to tolerate representatives who don’t represent us,” Hageman plans to say in a victory speech tonight.\n\n“I will be accountable to the voters and citizens of Wyoming because I am one of you, and just like you, I am sick and tired of having no voice in the U.S. House of Representatives,” read her prepared remarks.\n\nHageman also plans to thank Trump, who endorsed her bid and was instrumental to the win.\n\n“We are all grateful for President Donald Trump, who understood Wyoming has only one congressional representative and we need make sure it counts.

Liz Cheney, the highest profile Trump GOP target this primary season, has lost her primary to Trump-endorsed challenger Harriet Hageman, CNN and NBC projected.\n\nTrump singled out Cheney after she voted to impeach him over the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021. Trump and Hageman also criticized Cheney for working on the Jan. 6 congressional committee investigating the attack.\n\nCheney promoted her disdain of Trump throughout the campaign, saying Republican Party members in Wyoming and across the country need to move on from volatile and oft-investigated ex-president.\n\nHageman, an attorney and one-time supporter of Cheney, said during the campaign that the House member first elected in 2016 was more interested in pursuing Trump than in serving the needs of Wyoming voters.\n\n–- David Jackson\n\nHageman takes huge lead; Cheney backers brace; no call yet\n\nAs expected, Harriet Hageman has taken a huge lead over Liz Cheney in the Wyoming race, though the Associated Press and the networks have not yet projected a winner.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCheney plans speech on democracy, win or lose\n\nHundreds of supporters have gathered in Jackson for what many expect to be a concession speech - a unique one.\n\nCheney is expected to deliver an address about the threat to the country posed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nSignaling her approach in remarks with reporters earlier today, Cheney said democracy itself is at stake.\n\n“Those of us across the board – Republicans, Democrats and independents – who believe deeply in freedom and who care about the Constitution and the future of the country, I think, have an obligation to put that above party,\" Cheney said after casting her vote in Jackson\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow it happened:How Liz Cheney went from Trump backer and GOP leader, to his fiercest critic and GOP outcast\n\nHow have House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump fared?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's vow to seek revenge on the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him for alleged incitement of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack is being tested in key primary elections this season.\n\nThe second House impeachment vote against Trump was the most bipartisan ever when those 10 Republicans defected from their party and joined with 222 other House Democrats to impeach him.\n\nTrump has dedicated much of his post-presidency to purging the GOP of anyone he sees as disloyal.\n\nFour of those 10 Republicans are retiring from Congress, while the other six faced re-election bids, including primaries in which Trump often loomed larger than their actual opponent.\n\nTonight, one of those Republicans, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, learns her fate.\n\n-- Kenneth Tran\n\nLearn about them here:10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump. How are they faring now?\n\nPolls close in Wyoming; Cheney and Hageman await results\n\nThe voting is over in Wyoming, as U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and Donald Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman await their fates.\n\nRecent polls established Hageman as a favorite, but Cheney hopes enough Democrats and independents cross over to the Republican primary to make things interesting.\n\nThis is probably the most watched race of the night, another test of Trump's dominance within the Republican Party.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nWho is Kelly Tshibaka?\n\nA former Alaska state official who has the endorsement of Donald Trump will try to unseat Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski on Tuesday.\n\nRepublican-supported Kelly Tshibaka and Murkowski are both expected to advance beyond Tuesday's primary in Alaska's new voting system.\n\nKelly Tshibaka was born and raised in Alaska. She received a bachelor's degree from Texas A&M University in 1999 and earned a law degree from Harvard University in 2002.\n\nHer father worked as a union electrician and her mother as one of the first workers at the startup of Alaska’s largest oil field, according to her campaign website.\n\n-- Merdie Nzanga\n\nRead more about her:What to know about Kelly Tshibaka, who is trying to unseat Alaska GOP Sen.

The rest have lost or declined to seek reelection. Cheney would be just the third to return to Congress if she defies expectations Tuesday.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nWhere are they now:10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump. How have things gone for them since?\n\nFlashback:Senate acquits Trump in historic second impeachment trial over Capitol riot\n\nAlaska voting changes could help Murkowski\n\nIn Alaska, winner-take-all party primaries, like the one Cheney is facing, have been replaced by a voter-approved process in which all candidates are listed together. The four who get the most votes, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election in which ranked voting will be used.\n\nMurkowski benefits from avoiding a Republican primary, “which she would have had a zero percent — I mean zero percent — chance of winning,” said Alaska pollster Ivan Moore.\n\nMurkowski was censured by Alaska Republican Party leaders last year over numerous grievances, including the impeachment vote and speaking critically of Trump and her support of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s nomination.\n\nTuckerman Babcock, a former state Republican Party chair who is running for state Senate, said Murkowski has lost the support of many Alaska Republicans, which he called a “political reality over a record of many years.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nDouble Palin on Alaska ballot\n\nSarah Palin is on the ballot twice in Alaska: once in a special election to complete Young’s term and another for a primary for a full two-year House term starting in January.\n\nVoters approved an elections overhaul in 2020, ending party primaries and instituting ranked voting in general elections. Endorsed by Trump, Palin finished first among 48 candidates to qualify for a special election. They were seeking to replace Young, who died in March at age 88, after 49 years as Alaska’s lone House member.\n\nPalin is now trying to secure the win against the No. 2 and 4 finishers, Republican Nick Begich and Democrat Mary Peltola. The third-place vote-getter pulled out of the race after the special primary.\n\nThe House primary, meanwhile, has 22 candidates, including Palin, Begich and Peltola.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEarlier this year:Sarah Palin has early lead in Alaska special primary for U.S. House seat\n\nA voter theme in the Cheney-Hagerman race: No comment\n\nJACKSON, Wyo. – The most frequent comment that voters have made about the Liz Cheney-Harriet Hageman race is ... no comment.\n\nMany voters said they did not want to discuss the primary because it has brought harassment from people who don't share their opinion of Cheney, Hageman, or, especially, Donald Trump.\n\nThe political tensions of the Trump era have come to Jackson Hole, much to the dismay of residents of a community that prides itself on being a laid-back mountain-and-forest resort.\n\n\"It's not good to be anti-Trump in this state,\" said a voter who would identify herself only as Deborah. \"And I don't want to be a target.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nMurkowski and Palin show deepening fissures in GOP\n\nWASHINGTON – The almost continual daylight in Alaska this month is revealing more than the state's sweeping mountains and shorelines. It's also showing the deep fissures in the Republican Party.\n\nTwo candidates on the ballot for two different offices – Sen. Lisa Murkowski and former Gov. Sarah Palin – represent a growing divide in the GOP that is largely decided by a candidate's allegiance to former President Donald Trump. Murkowski is fighting off a Trump challenger. Palin is fighting as a Trump challenger.\n\nMurkowski is a moderate Republican who has crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats on some big issues. In February 2021, she was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote in favor of convicting Trump during his second impeachment, drawing ire from the former president and others in her party. She is the only one of the seven on the ballot this year.\n\nPalin, once John McCain's running mate in 2008, leans to the far right. She has been in lock step with Trump and joined him and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell last month at a \"Save America\" rally in Anchorage. After the FBI search last week of the former president's Florida residence, she called the country's top law enforcement agencies \"dangerous thugs.\"\n\nWho else is in Jackson Hole? Liz Cheney nemesis Kevin McCarthy\n\nLiz Cheney isn't the only prominent member of Congress in Jackson Hole on this primary Tuesday.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who turned on Cheney during her battle with Donald Trump, is reportedly hosting a two-day fundraiser in Teton Village, Wyo. That's about 10 miles from Jackson, where Cheney is expected to address supporters about her primary battle with Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman.\n\n10 Republicans voted to impeach Trump:Will any be left in Congress after November?\n\nNBC News reported that McCarthy would be in Wyoming on Monday and Tuesday \"raising money for both the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund.\"\n\nOther Republican lawmakers who now oppose Cheney are also at the resort where McCarthy is holding court, according to news reports. (So is Elon Musk, reportedly.)\n\nMcCarthy, who is hoping to become speaker of the House after the midterm election, initially supported Cheney after she voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6. He later changed his mind and backed Cheney's expulsion from House GOP leadership over the Trump issue.\n\nCheney said McCarthy sold out to Trump and is part of the problem Republicans face moving forward.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAnother break between Cheney and GOP: criticism of FBI\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., called out fellow Republicans on Thursday for their criticism of the FBI in the hours and days after its agents searched the Florida home of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I have been ashamed to hear members of my party attacking the integrity of the FBI agents involved with the recent Mar-a-Lago search. These are sickening comments that put the lives of patriotic public servants at risk,\" Cheney tweeted on Thursday, shortly after Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke at the Justice Department about the search.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday denounced the threats circulating online against federal agents and the Justice Department, calling them \"deplorable and dangerous.\"\n\nRead the whole story:GOP Rep. Liz Cheney criticizes Republicans 'attacking the integrity of the FBI'\n\nBracing for results in Wyoming\n\nJACKSON, Wyo. – Liz Cheney's political world, based in this valley resort town, is bracing for the worst – largely because Wyoming as a whole has become Donald Trump country.\n\nTrump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman is heavily favored to win the Republican primary for Cheney's U.S. House seat and end Cheney's three-term congressional career.\n\n\"It will be closer than most people think, but I think Hagesman will win ... unfortunately,\" said Hal Wheeler, 40, the owner of a bicycle shop in the quaint western-themed downtown of Jackson.\n\nHageman supporters said that Cheney, in her zeal to get Trump, has ignored the needs of people in Wyoming, on issue ranging from energy production to drug abuse.\n\n\"I think she went clear overboard,\" said Dan Winder, 69, a local property manager who stood in a long line at the Teton County administration building to cast an early vote for Hageman. \"She represents Wyoming – she's not representing Liz Cheney.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPreviously:Trump glued to TV, Secret Service fears, Cheney forecasts 'dam' break: Takeaways from the Jan. 6 hearing\n\nAlaska's new ranked choice voting system\n\nIn the 2020 general election, Alaskans voted to rid their elections of partisan primaries, instead implementing a ranked choice voting system across all parties.\n\nThe new system has lowered the stakes in races like Alaska's Senate primary, where incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is all but guaranteed one of four spots in the November general election.\n\nTwo other candidates, Trump-backed Republican Kelly Tshibaka and Democrat Pat Chesbro, are expected to make the cut for the fall general election, the Anchorage Daily News reported.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nLearn more:Alaska to use final-four primary, ranked-choice general election for Congress.

Sarah Palin — came out on top after an unprecedented 48-candidate primary, held under the state's new election laws got rid of partisan primaries, the Anchorage Daily News reported.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nCheney touts Kevin Costner's endorsement\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., tweeted actor Kevin Costner's endorsement of her, noting \"real men put country over party.\"\n\nCheney, who has been in the spotlight for her position on the House Jan. 6 committee investigating the Capitol attack and her criticism of former President Donald Trump, tweeted a photo of Costner in a T-shirt that read \"I'M FOR LIZ CHENEY.\"\n\n– Merdie Nzanga\n\nEndorsement count:Liz Cheney gets Kevin Costner's endorsement and adds, 'real men put country over party'\n\nLiz Cheney: Democracy is 'under attack and under threat'\n\nLiz Cheney showed up at the polls Tuesday with a special guest – father and former Vice President Dick Cheney – and a special message: Win or lose this primary, the fight for democracy goes on.\n\nSpeaking briefly with reporters, Cheney said that, win or lose, the primary is the only the start of a long-term battle for the future of democracy and against her nemesis, Donald Trump.\n\nIt is “certainly the beginning of a battle that is going to continue to go on,\" Cheney told CBS News. \"And as a country, we’re facing a moment where our democracy really is under attack and under threat.”\n\nThe Cheneys stood in line with other voters before casting ballots in a primary in which Liz Cheney is a decided underdog.\n\nDick Cheney made a much-discussed ad during the campaign, saying: “In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who has been a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\"\n\nAfter casting her ballot, Cheney tweeted: \"Proud to cast my ballot today. The challenges we are facing require serious leaders who will abide by their oath and uphold the Constitution- no matter what.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMoney likely won't help Cheney win Wyoming primary\n\nMany elections are won by the best-funded candidate, but the money hasn't shown signs of helping Cheney.\n\nThrough June 30, Cheney raised $11.3 million, and Hageman raised $3.7 million. That’s $15 million in a state with about 280,000 registered voters. And yet, a July 15 poll from the Casper Star Tribune showed Cheney 22 points behind Hageman and an Aug. 11 University of Wyoming survey found that just over one quarter of GOP primary voters support incumbent candidate Cheney.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Cheney received 76% of her donations from large donors, and 73% were from out of state residents and political actions committees, or PACs, which are often formed to raise money for a candidate or group of candidates.\n\nHageman is getting 40% of her donations from Cowboy State residents and PACs. Hageman also has more pull with small donors, who make up 43% of her donations, a signal of grassroots support.\n\n– Erin Mansfield, Ella Lee\n\nMore campaign finance news:Trump PAC formed to push debunked voter fraud claims paid $60K to Melania Trump's fashion designer\n\nWho is Harriet Hageman, Cheney's Trump-backed opponent?\n\nWyoming lawyer Harriet Hageman is the leading Republican challenger for Cheney’s congressional seat. She unsuccessfully ran for governor of Wyoming in 2018.\n\nA former supporter of Cheney, having donated to her 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns, Hageman unsuccessfully ran for governor of Wyoming in 2018 and sat on the Wyoming state Republican committee until announcing her challenge to Cheney.\n\nThe main difference between the two candidates is their relationship with Trump. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to vote for Trump’s impeachment over his alleged incitement of a riot, and she lost her spot as head of the House GOP conference after refusing to endorse the former president’s false claims of election fraud. Hageman, on the other hand, has Trump's endorsement and is vocal in her support of him.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nWhere are they now:10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump.

Liz Cheney and former President Donald Trump will play out Tuesday as Cheney faces Trump-backed lawyer Harriet Hageman for the state's sole House seat.\n\nCheney — whose leadership on the Jan. 6 House committee and persistent criticism of Trump has landed her on the former president's political hit list — is not expected to win the race. But she's made it clear that, no matter the outcome Tuesday, she won't stop her mission to eradicate Donald Trump from American politics.\n\n\"I clearly put my oath of office above political calculations,\" Cheney told USA TODAY. \"What surprises me is there are so few who have done that.\"\n\n-- Ella Lee, Candy Woodall\n\nLearn more about her:How Liz Cheney went from Trump backer and GOP leader, to his fiercest critic and GOP outcast\n\nDick Cheney calls Trump a ‘coward’ and a ‘threat’ in ad for Liz Cheney\n\nWASHINGTON – Cutting a campaign ad for daughter and embattled Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney blistered ex-President Donald Trump on Thursday as a threat to the nation's future.\n\n“In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our Republic than Donald Trump,\" the former vice president said in an extraordinary attack on a former president from the same party.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nRead the rest here:Dick Cheney calls Trump a ‘coward’ and a ‘threat’ in ad for Liz Cheney\n\nWhen do the polls close\n\nJust two states hold primaries Tuesday: Wyoming and Alaska.\n\nWyoming's polls close at 9 p.m. ET, and Alaska's polls close at midnight ET.\n\n-- Ella Lee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/21/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-republican-georgia-primary/index.html", "title": "This Marjorie Taylor Greene opponent is Republicans' best shot at ...", "text": "Rome, Georgia (CNN) Jennifer Strahan walked up and down the main street of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's hometown with a mission -- to make sure as many potential voters as possible know who she is before Tuesday's Republican primary.\n\nA first-time candidate and the most formidable of Greene's five primary opponents, Strahan has the backing of the Republican Jewish Coalition PAC and the PACs of some major local and national businesses, including UPS and International Paper. VIEW PAC -- the leading organization dedicated to recruiting and electing Republican women to Congress -- is opposing an incumbent for the first time by endorsing Strahan against Greene.\n\nThe controversial Greene is often mentioned in the same breath as other Donald Trump acolytes in the US House, such as North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his primary earlier this week . But unlike in the Tar Heel state, where Republicans -- including the state's junior GOP senator -- mobilized against Cawthorn, Greene hasn't encountered the same level of organized opposition -- or spending -- against her.\n\nVIEW PAC's independent expenditure arm has been mostly alone in making small investments in mail and digital advertising. Some Republicans in Congress have been helpful to Strahan behind the scenes, but few will go public.\n\nAnd even many of the GOP voters whom CNN met in the 14th Congressional District who had qualms about Greene -- \"I like her politics but not her demeanor\" was a frequent refrain -- hadn't heard of the Republicans running against her for this northwest Georgia seat.\n\n\"As long as there's a Republican in that spot, I'm OK,\" said Lorrie Heiken, a 54-year-old self-described \"MAGA\" supporter who does not believe President Joe Biden won the 2020 election but also thinks the QAnon conspiracy theory -- and Greene's promotion of it -- goes too far.\n\nGreene moved to Rome last cycle to run for the 14th District when it became open, abandoning an earlier bid for a suburban Atlanta seat. Her district, which she won with 75% of the vote in 2020 after the Democrat dropped out , remains overwhelmingly Republican, albeit slightly less so after redistricting so it's unclear how that will affect the primary electorate. Greene's campaign signs are more easily spotted on the outskirts of Rome, where eclectic restaurants and shops quickly give way to Dollar Generals and open land. But even in this bustling downtown, her influence could be felt.\n\nOne business owner, who had trepidatiously put a Strahan sign in her shop window, said Strahan would be more effective in Washington but requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation -- specifically the fear of receiving a threatening voicemail from the congresswoman.\n\n\"My stomach is churning just talking to you,\" the shop owner said.\n\nGreene's campaign did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\n'Joe Biden is our President'\n\nThe owner of a health care consulting company, Strahan often introduces herself to voters as the mom of a son, two dogs and a tortoise. At a recent tele-town hall, she told participants the district needs someone who's not a \"social media celebrity,\" a not-so-subtle jab at the congresswoman.\n\nStrahan's most dedicated supporters crave that contrast. \"Our current representative is everything the left wanted Trump to be in that she's just ineffective and loud,\" said 39-year-old Josh Brown of Rockmart, who recognized Strahan at a local coffee shop and stopped her to say hello. He's enthusiastic about her candidacy, calling her \"mature and resolved.\"\n\nJosh Brown, 39, from Rockmart, Georgia, is supporting Strahan in the GOP primary because he thinks she'll work well with others.\n\nHouse GOP leadership condemned Greene for speaking at a White nationalist conference in February. It wasn't too long ago that House Republicans voted to kick then-Rep. Steve King of Iowa off his committees in Congress after he made comments that were sympathetic to White supremacists. Soon after, King was defeated in a 2020 primary. But party leadership has largely tolerated Greene, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently traveling to the US-Mexico border with her -- a sign of just how closely House Republicans have embraced Trump's most loyal followers in their conference ahead of what could be another Trump White House bid in 2024.\n\nThe Democratic majority in the House, along with 11 Republicans , voted to strip Greene of her committee assignments last year after her past statements indicating support for political violence as well as anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic comments were unearthed. While Strahan says she disagrees with that decision to punish Greene, she's used the outcome to try to paint the congresswoman as an ineffective legislator. It's a position that underscores the difficult balancing act she's trying to strike between not alienating Republicans who may have voted for Greene last cycle and dislike decisions coming from Washington, while still calling for new representation in the district.\n\nAs for House Republican leadership, Strahan said she's not surprised they haven't gotten involved in her race against the incumbent, despite the fact that McCarthy is backing a primary challenger to another sitting incumbent, Rep. Liz Cheney, in Wyoming.\n\nCNN has reached out to McCarthy's political team.\n\nFor the leadership of VIEW PAC, taking Greene on is about more than just the 14th District -- it's also about the reputation of other Republican women in the House.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that in 2020, we elected some really tremendous Republican women and the only one people talk about is the only one who has no business being in Congress,\" the group's executive director, Julie Conway, told CNN.\n\nA person holds a campaign flyer for Strahan in Rome on May 12, 2022.\n\nStrahan is critical of many of Greene's controversial comments, including about Russia and Ukraine, saying she recognizes that \"Russia is the aggressor.\" But when it comes to conservative policy, Strahan said there's a lot of \"overlap\" with their positions.\n\nLess so when it comes to the last presidential election, though. \"Joe Biden is our president,\" Strahan said, not directly answering a question about whether she would have voted to certify the 2020 results. Advocacy groups had recently tried unsuccessfully to get Greene disqualified from the ballot for her alleged role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\nStrahan praised Trump's policies -- particularly the 2017 tax law -- but she wouldn't commit to supporting him for the Republican nomination in 2024. \"If he's our nominee, I would support him,\" she said twice when asked whether she'd back him in a primary.\n\nStrahan tours a law firm in dowtown Rome.\n\nHer strongest public support among elected leaders in Washington has come from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who was one of seven Republican senators , including outspoken Trump critic Mitt Romney of Utah, to vote to convict the former President at his impeachment trial after January 6.\n\nAt a Capitol Hill fundraiser for Strahan last month, Cassidy framed the race as a battle for the future of the GOP -- and the country. Romney's leadership PAC has also donated to Strahan's campaign.\n\nA strong base for Greene\n\nTrump held one of his final rallies of 2020 in Rome -- a testament to his popularity in this part of the state.\n\nAnd while Greene's outspokenness seems to have turned some voters off, for her supporters, it's exactly what they like about her and Trump -- reflecting a burgeoning divide over whether elected officials should work within traditional norms or blow them up.\n\nCampaign signs for Strahan, center, and Greene, right, are seen just outside of Rome in Silver Creek, Georgia, on May 12, 2022.\n\n\"They hate her so I like,\" 66-year-old Steve Walker said of Greene as he walked out of the local Crossfit gym after his Friday morning workout and headed for his pickup truck.\n\nWho are \"they\"? \"People in charge up there,\" Walker said. He'd already voted early for the congresswoman, a former Crossfit gym owner who's been known to frequent this location.\n\n\"I love her because she's bold,\" said 55-year-old Audrey Burch, who was playing with her grandson in a fountain downtown. \"Most everything she has said I agree with.\"\n\nAnd Stephanie Howard, a 56-year-old from nearby Chattooga County, said she'd heard some controversial things Greene had said but it didn't bother her.\n\n\"I like that she voices her opinion,\" Howard said as she loaded groceries into her SUV at an Ingles supermarket in Summerville, about 30 miles northwest of Rome.\n\nLooking for an alternative\n\nBut from behind the counter at Dogwood Books, Kenneth Studdard can see across Broad Street to the popular Harvest Moon Cafe, where Greene sometimes lunches when she's back in Rome.\n\nKenneth Studdard, 56, seen in his book store, says Strahan would represent \"the people as we are.\"\n\nA 56-year-old Republican, Studdard has opposed Greene, who he said \"makes everything a circus,\" since before the 2020 election, when he backed local neurosurgeon John Cowan in the GOP primary.\n\nSporting an orange \"I'm a Georgia voter\" sticker, Studdard said he had cast his ballot earlier that day for Strahan, even if he recognizes how hard it will be to unseat an incumbent.\n\n\"If you're Strahan, you're trying to do two things: Hold her under 50 (percent) and come in second,\" said longtime Georgia Republican strategist Chip Lake, referring to the state's runoff rule, which requires surpassing 50% of the vote to win the primary outright.\n\nOn the Democratic side, cowboy hat-wearing Army veteran Marcus Flowers has raised more than $8 million -- an enviable sum for a Republican like Strahan when the primary is the best chance at unseating Greene.\n\n\"If they'd given Strahan all the money Flowers has, this would be a completely different conversation,\" Lake said. (Strahan raised $392,000 through May 4, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission, compared with $11.9 million for Greene.)\n\nAmong a trio of polo-clad businessmen strolling down Broad Street during lunchtime, two had voted for Strahan in the GOP primary the day before, while one had voted in the Democratic primary.\n\nBob Finnell, the Democratic primary voter, was an aide to Republican Sen. Mack Mattingly, who served a single term in the 1980s. Finnell isn't pleased with the direction of the GOP -- or the district. He suggested, only half-jokingly, that the only way to beat Greene would be for a candidate to film a TV ad of themselves aggressively pretending to stop immigrants from crossing state lines.\n\nNeither Republican voter thought Greene would lose the primary. \"Slim to none\" was how 34-year-old Collin Doss described Strahan's chances.\n\nHis father, David Doss, said he had thought the 2020 primary runoff between Greene and Cowan wouldn't be close.\n\n\"I was right,\" he said, but he got the winner wrong: It was Greene who ended up defeating Cowan by 14 points.\n\nStill, he thinks -- or hopes -- this year's race against Strahan will be closer.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/25/liz-cheney-wyoming-republican-primary/10098801002/", "title": "Liz Cheney is up for reelection in Wyoming.

Ohio voted first, followed by a near weekly stream of contests that are shaping the midterm campaign for control of the chamber. At the close of the month, the general election matchups in almost half of this year's most competitive races are nearly set, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Republican primary has gone to a recount.\n\nRepublicans only need a net gain of one seat this fall to win the Senate, and much of the intrigue about primaries has so far been on the GOP side. Former President Donald Trump endorsed in all four Senate contests that were on the ballot in May that are expected to be competitive in the fall -- Ohio , where his chosen candidate won on May 3; North Carolina , where his chosen candidate won on May 17; Georgia , where his chosen candidate won on May 24, and in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate leads by roughly 900 votes. Those primaries cemented his hold on the party because of the way so many GOP candidates, even those without his endorsement, tried to appeal to him -- in some cases, twisting themselves into almost unrecognizable versions of their former selves.\n\nTrump's support played differently in each state. In Ohio, it helped \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author J.D. Vance win the primary, likely blunting the biggest attack attack on him -- the candidate's past criticism of Trump.\n\nThe former President's backing of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania did not have as clear of an immediate impact, especially considering voters might have already associated the two celebrity Republicans together. Near the end of the race, the millions of dollars spent attacking Oz and former hedge fund executive David McCormick seemed to open a lane for conservative commentator Kathy Barnette , but she's in a distant third place behind Oz and McCormick.\n\nTrump weighed in on the North Carolina primary nearly a year ago, but his backing of US Rep. Ted Budd didn't clear the GOP field immediately. In Georgia, however, his commitment to Herschel Walker likely kept other top-name Republicans out of the race, leaving the former NFL star gliding to the GOP nomination.\n\nDemocrats argue that messy and expensive GOP primaries will leave Republican nominees bruised heading into the general election. (Democrats also had a crowded primary in Pennsylvania , but it didn't attract anywhere near the level of spending or vitriol as the GOP contest.)\n\nAfter watching Republican candidates run to the right to try to win their party nods, Democrats are hoping to make general election matchups a contrast in candidates. But that gets harder to do if the national environment continues to work against the party. President Joe Biden 's approval rating was at 41%, with 59% disapproving, according to a CNN poll , conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1. Democrats know Republicans will tie them to him, which is one reason why a number of them broke with the White House on lifting Title 42 , a Trump-era public health authority that allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nSenate contests are increasingly becoming nationalized affairs, so while candidate quality does matter (see No. 10 on this list), Democrats face a tough challenge in holding their razor-thin Senate majority, regardless of which Republicans they're facing.\n\nCNN's ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip saw a few changes in May, all in Republicans' favor. But the states that held May primaries remain in the same positions for now, with uncertainty still reigning in Pennsylvania. The ranking, which will be updated in June, is based on CNN's reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nPennsylvania -- a state Biden won in 2020 -- has long been the seat most likely to flip, but the May 17 GOP primary hasn't yet given us an answer to what the general election matchup to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey will look like in November. Celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz , who has Trump's backing, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick finished in a near tie -- with a margin close enough to trigger the state's automatic recount process.\n\nCounties need to finish recounting -- which they must do using a different device than the one used in the initial tabulation -- by noon on June 7 and submit their results by noon on June 8. CNN has not made a projection in the race.\n\nThe winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who easily won the Democratic nomination on May 17.\n\nOz has declared himself the \"presumptive\" nominee , following the lead of Trump, who urged him to declare victory while counting was still underway. While Oz had tried to capitalize on the former President's support after receiving his endorsement in early April, McCormick and his allies argued that McCormick is the real conservative. \"I like Trump ... but not his Senate pick,\" voters said in one McCormick ad ahead of the primary.\n\nJUST WATCHED See tense exchange in Dr. Oz's first Senate primary debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See tense exchange in Dr. Oz's first Senate primary debate 02:02\n\nPolitical commentator Kathy Barnette emerged as a late electoral threat to both men, with the political arm of the Club for Growth announcing a nearly $2 million investment to boost her candidacy, as well as the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote backing her. That late surge wasn't enough, though. Barnette trailing Oz and McCormick.\n\nThe lingering question in the Keystone State is whether Trump's backing of Oz will have made a difference if he holds on to his narrow lead after the recount -- and what that means for the general election. Oz's negatives were notably high compared with his opponents in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. Forty-six percent had an unfavorable view of Oz, while 27% and 12% had unfavorable views of McCormick and Barnette, respectively.\n\nFetterman already debuted a general election message in one of his ads ahead of the primary, in which he vowed to \"take on Washington,\" coming across as a progressive trying to run as a populist outsider . His primary opponents had trained their attacks on him in debates , especially over a 2013 incident in which he brought along his shotgun to confront someone who later turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. And the primary had been rocked in the final days by news that Fetterman had suffered a stroke , leaving him in the hospital on election night.\n\nThe former Braddock mayor finished with about 59% of the vote to 26% for US Rep. Conor Lamb, who's also from western Pennsylvania, but ran as more of a moderate and highlighted his success defeating \"Trump Republicans\" in his Pittsburgh-area House seat.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nDespite enduring attacks from GOP opponents, former NFL player Herschel Walker , who has the backing of both Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, easily won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock\n\nHaving won a special election runoff in January 2021, Warnock is now seeking a full six-year term. He raised an astounding $13.6 million in the first three months of the year, which follows impressive earlier quarterly hauls, and is running direct-to-camera ads on issues with bipartisan appeal such as jobs, infrastructure and health care. Meanwhile, Democrats hope that Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will generate the base turnout they desperately need in a midterm year.\n\nBut Warnock is in serious jeopardy, even against a wildcard candidate like Walker, who faces a myriad of questions about his business background and allegations of threats he made against women. Much of the GOP establishment viewed Walker as a liability at the beginning of the cycle but have, publicly at least, come around, while his team has worked to keep him relatively on script. Democrats' road to Senate control ran through Georgia last cycle, but it's still challenging political terrain for them, especially in a midterm year with an unpopular Democratic President.\n\nOne unknown wrinkle, however, is how the loss of Trump's endorsed candidates for other statewide offices in the Peach State's GOP primaries could shape turnout in the fall. Georgia proved that Republican voters, even committed Trump supporters, won't necessarily follow his lead at the ballot box. They chose to stick with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, despite the former President railing against him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election. But some GOP strategists are still afraid of a repeat of the January 2021 Senate runoffs, when Trump's outspoken criticism of the election system may have kept some of his voters home, allowing Democrats to pick up both of the state's Senate seats.\n\n3. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nThe Silver State moved up two slots in May's ranking. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a tough race in a transient state that Biden won by 2 points in 2020. The President's approval rating has sunk since then, and Nevada has some of the highest gas prices in the nation, which could play into the GOP messaging that's trying to pin steep daily living costs on the party in power. Even if Cortez Masto manages to differentiate herself from generic Democrats, that effort could be overtaken by a bad national environment, especially if Republicans are able to make more inroads with Latino voters . It doesn't help that the state Democratic Party is fractured.\n\nCortez Masto, the former chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, outraised likely GOP nominee Adam Laxalt in the first quarter of the year -- $4.4 million to $1.6 million. But money isn't expected to be an issue for Laxalt, a former state attorney general -- he succeeded Cortez Masto in that role -- and grandson of a former senator and governor, who will benefit from GOP outside spending. Democrats argue that Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump's 2020 campaign in the state, has gone too far down the election conspiracy road and that his anti-abortion positions will alienate voters. But that may not matter as much if voters decide it's time for a change in Washington.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nHolding steady in fourth position is Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He's one of the best-positioned Democratic incumbents when it comes to his personal story and campaign coffers. But the former astronaut has a voting record now and is running in a purple border state that only narrowly backed Biden. Kelly is trying to stake out differences from the White House -- such as his opposition to lifting Title 42. But regardless of any real separation between him and Biden, messaging those nuances is an arguably tougher job than it is for Republicans to blanketly tie him to an unpopular President.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nThat's not why Wisconsin slides down two spots on this list. The senator remains unpopular -- 36% of registered voters viewed Johnson favorably while 46% viewed him unfavorably, according to a Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday. (In February, the same poll found him underwater by a slightly worse 12 points.) Half of voters in the April Marquette survey said the phrase \"cares about people like me\" did not describe Johnson. That explains why Democrats continue to believe this seat is a better pickup opportunity with Johnson running than had it been an open seat.\n\nBut Biden is also unpopular in Wisconsin. After winning the state with about 49% in 2020, his approval rating has hovered at about 43%, with some 53% disapproving, since last fall. The winner of the Democratic primary in August will likely be tied to Biden, especially with inflation emerging as a top concern, according to the Marquette poll, and worries over the coronavirus (about which Johnson has said plenty of controversial things) reaching a new low.\n\nThe Democratic field is still uncertain. Support for Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes , who has been seen as the front-runner, declined slightly among likely primary voters in the Marquette poll, while support for Milwaukee Bucks basketball team executive Alex Lasry ticked up. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson remained in the single digits. Nearly half of those likely primary voters, however, said they hadn't picked a candidate. Lasry and Godlewski are pouring their own resources into the race to go up on TV. Barnes, who raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of the year, went up with his first TV ad in mid-May. But none of the candidates has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse the way other Democrats challenging unpopular Republicans (think Sens. Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham) have in cycles past.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nNew Hampshire remains at No. 6 as the Republican field -- upended late last year by Gov. Chris Sununu's decision not to seek the nomination -- develops. Republicans looking to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan include state Senate President Chuck Morse, former Londonderry town manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the state's other Senate seat in 2020. And other Republicans have been throwing their hats in the ring ahead of New Hampshire's late primary in September.\n\nHassan, a former two-term governor, is seeking a second Senate term in a state that, on paper, should be more favorable to Democrats than any other state on this list. Biden carried New Hampshire by 7 points in 2020. An unfavorable national environment, however, could hurt her reelection chances, even without an opponent of Sununu's caliber. Hassan has come out against the Biden administration's plan to lift Title 42, making her own trip to the border last month that angered several Latino leaders back home.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nOne of Trump's earliest Senate primary endorsements -- for US Rep. Ted Budd last June -- resulted in victory here on May 17, with Budd easily dispatching former Gov. Pat McCrory and former US Rep. Mark Walker for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.\n\nThe Trump endorsement didn't clear the field for Budd, but heavy spending from the conservative Club for Growth Action helped boost him. One spot ahead of the primary featured Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson praising Budd and knocking McCrory. \"Pat's a nice guy, but he's no conservative,\" Robinson says, admitting that he'd voted for McCrory in the past \"but not this time.\" McCrory and his allies touted his record on immigration and argued that Budd is \"weak\" on a host of issues.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who won 81% of the vote in the primary, had essentially already cleared the primary field and pivoted to the general election. \"Looking at Washington, I think both parties are doing the job wrong,\" she said in an ad ahead of the primary. Beasley had outraised all the Republicans in the first quarter of this year, but money won't be enough in a state Trump won twice, especially in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout has often waned. Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell, made ad reservations in the state ahead of the primary to help the GOP nominee. The Democratic equivalent, Senate Majority PAC, announced an ad buy defending Beasley after the primary, despite leaving North Carolina off its list of initial reservations earlier this spring.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings , a former Orlando police chief with a compelling story, continues to outraise Republican incumbent Marco Rubio, bringing in more than $10 million during the first three months of the year to Rubio's $5.8 million. Her campaign recently announced a Hispanic outreach effort and a $3 million investment in a state bilingual coordinated campaign.\n\nBut while money is important in this expensive state, it won't be enough to flip the seat. And none of the major outside groups have made ad reservations here, signaling that they view the race as less competitive. Demings already started at a disadvantage in a state where Trump expanded on his victory margin in 2020 from four years earlier, but her job would be even harder if the national mood continues to sour on Democrats this fall. She and Rubio have traded barbs on gas prices and immigration. Rubio's campaign has tried to tie Demings to Biden's decision to rescind Title 42 . Demings' team recently said she does not support lifting the measure \"until there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.\"\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nThe first major test of Trump's endorsement in a Senate primary this year was a success for the former President. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author J.D. Vance , who received Trump's backing in mid-April, won the nomination on May 3 with about 32% of the vote , finishing ahead of former state treasurer Josh Mandel (24%) and state Sen. Matt Dolan (23%).\n\nVance's public criticism of Trump from 2016 had been a treasure trove for his primary opponents and their ad-makers. The former President, though, was willing to look past that. And it paid off for Vance, who saw his support double in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. It was a topsy-turvy race, but it's likely that Vance landed on top at just the right moment for it to matter.\n\nOnly Dolan ran truly outside the Trump election conspiracy lane in the GOP primary. Interestingly, his stock had risen in polling right before the election, presaging his third-place finish ahead of candidates who had tried to tie themselves more closely to Trump, including former state party chair Jane Timken, who had the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, and businessman Mike Gibbons.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tim Ryan easily won his party's nomination but starts at a disadvantage in this reddening state.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nIt's still all about Eric Greitens in Missouri -- does the former governor, who resigned in disgrace in 2018, stay in the Republican race? Does he score Trump's endorsement? And does he win the GOP nod in August? Those are the series of questions that will determine whether Missouri -- a red state that shouldn't otherwise be competitive -- remains on this list.\n\nSome Democrats smell opportunity. Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and Anheuser-Busch beer heiress, jumped into the race this spring. She hasn't said how much she'll invest in her campaign, but should this race become competitive, Democrats may benefit from having a candidate with her own money to spend. But Valentine first has a primary to win -- while one Democrat dropped out of the race and endorsed her, the top fundraiser, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, doesn't look like he's going anywhere.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details in Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/us/five-things-august-16-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for August 16: Primaries, Gas prices, Air travel ...", "text": "If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Liz Cheney -- vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and the GOP's most outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump -- is trying to hold on to her seat . But if the latest polling is any guide, she faces a major uphill battle. Cheney is one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former President last year and also lost her party leadership position after repeatedly criticizing Trump. Today, she is running against a primary challenger backed by Trump in a state where he won 70% of the vote in the 2020 election. Experts say this race underscores how Trump's hold on the Republican Party is tightening even as the former President's legal challenges are mounting. Separately, voters in Alaska are casting ballots today in two separate elections for the same seat, and Sarah Palin is among those on the ballot.\n\n2. Gas prices\n\nHere's some good news: the average price of gas could drop below $3 a gallon in much of the US by the end of the year. Gas prices have fallen for 62 consecutive days and will likely continue to steadily decline . The national average for a gallon of regular gas stood at $3.96 Monday, down $1.06 -- or 21% -- since hitting a record high on June 14. The average price is somewhat inflated in some high-priced states, such as California, where the average is $5.37 a gallon. But even in states with high gas prices, the average price is down more than $1 a gallon since the June peak . Plus, as students return to school and the summer driving season comes to an end, gas prices will likely decline even further, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks prices for AAA.\n\n3. Air travel\n\n4. Recalls\n\n5. Ukraine\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the world to introduce tough sanctions in response to Russia's increased shelling around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. \"Any radiation incident at the Zaporizhzhia NPP can be a blow to the countries of the European Union, and to Turkey, and to Georgia, and to countries from more distant regions,\" Zelensky said Monday. \"If a catastrophe occurs due to Russia's actions, the consequences can hit even those who remain silent for the time being,\" he added. Meanwhile, Russia's defense minister said today that the advanced US-supplied arms to Ukraine are not having a \"significant impact\" on the war. Ukrainian officials, however, have previously said these arms and other multiple rocket systems are \"affecting the course of the war\" -- a view shared by top US military personnel and diplomatic officials.\n\nHAPPENING LATER\n\nBiden to sign Inflation Reduction Act into law today\n\nPresident Joe Biden will sign a sweeping $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill into law at the White House today -- marking a major victory for his administration and the Democratic Party ahead of the midterm elections. The Inflation Reduction Act accomplishes several key Biden legislative agenda items and represents the largest climate investment in American history.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nA baby hippo at the Cincinnati Zoo just got its official name after a contest\n\nAfter 200,000 suggestions, an adorable baby hippo received an equally cute name.

(\"Putin's price hike,\" he has called it.) But Republicans are hammering Democrats for rising inflation , which they argue predates the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats point to the pandemic and stuck supply chains for the current inflation woes, blaming corporations for pocketing profits while Americans pay the price at the pump. The most vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbents -- Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire -- have tried to get ahead of the inevitable GOP attacks by introducing legislation that would suspend the federal gas tax through the end of the year.\n\nIn a sign they're trying to distance themselves from the national party, most of them also sided with Republicans on a recent vote to overturn the requirement that passengers wear masks on public transportation. Establishing their own brands in their states, independent of Biden, will be a challenge for Democrats running in November if the President's approval rating remains in the low 40s . The party in the White House traditionally loses seats during the first midterm of a new president's term.\n\nDespite those obstacles, the Senate seat most likely to flip is still a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Pennsylvania has led this list since its incarnation -- a testament to it being an open seat in a state Biden carried in 2020. The ranking is based on CNN's reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Two seats have traded places on the latest list, however, which underscores the difficult environment for Democrats: New Hampshire slides above North Carolina as more likely to flip.\n\nRepublicans have their own challenges, though, mostly candidate-driven. May primaries in Ohio and Pennsylvania are heating up as GOP candidates jockey for former President Donald Trump 's blessing. At the same time, candidates who do have his backing are finding that it doesn't solve all their problems. (Trump just rescinded his endorsement for the open Senate seat in Alabama, where Rep. Mo Brooks' campaign was underwhelming.) He's backed candidates in two competitive states with May primaries -- Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nMuch to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's chagrin, the chair of the GOP committee charged with flipping the Senate recently released an 11-point plan that calls for all Americans to pay income tax. Expect Democrats to tie all Republicans, even those who have disavowed the tax proposal, to Florida Sen. Rick Scott's plan (released by his campaign, not the National Republican Senatorial Committee). It's a tactic that House Democrats successfully used against the GOP in 2018, when they tied even Republicans who had voted against repealing Obamacare to that effort, and that Republicans used against Democrats in 2020 in linking the entire party to the \"defund the police\" movement.\n\nThe paid media (i.e., television advertising) portion of the campaign is just taking off in many of these races, so we'll see how much that message sticks in the months to come.\n\nHere are the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip with less than eight months to go before Election Day:\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nPennsylvania once again tops the list of seats most likely to flip. Republican candidates and super PACs have spent nearly $40 million in the open-seat race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey ahead of the May 17 primary, with much of it coming from Mehmet Oz and David McCormick and their allies. Trump has yet to weigh in after his chosen candidate dropped out in November, which is fueling even more spending as Republicans try to prove their loyalty to the former President.\n\nAs the GOP field has grown, the Democratic one has thinned with Val Arkoosh -- a doctor and the only woman in the primary -- dropping out in February. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and US Rep. Conor Lamb , both from Western Pennsylvania, are on the air, mostly with positive bio spots that give the primary a noticeably different tone than the GOP contest. Fetterman is seen as the current front-runner because of his fundraising advantage and statewide name recognition. But Lamb has a record of winning tough House races, with his ads touting that he's previously beaten \"the Trump machine.\" Lamb has also picked up the endorsement of the Philadelphia Democratic Party. State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who hails from the vote-rich city, has some significant labor endorsements but is not on TV.\n\nThe bottom line here is that both parties think the other side's primary will take the eventual nominee too far to the extremes. But, given how much the GOP primary is pushing candidates toward Trump in a state Biden won (and all the millions of dollars putting that message in front of voters), this Democratic pickup opportunity is still the most likely to change party hands.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election runoff last year. He has impressed with strong fundraising and is on the air with positive spots leaning into his background as a pastor and touting the legislation he's co-sponsored that would temporarily suspend the federal gas tax.\n\nFormer NFL star Herschel Walker is the prohibitive Republican favorite in the May 24 primary, with both McConnell and Trump behind him. But attacks from his primary rivals and recent negative headlines over his business record could preview some of the scrutiny to come in the general election as Democrats gear up to face a first-time candidate whom much of the GOP establishment was bad mouthing this time last year.\n\nBut even with an untested likely opponent and a fundraising prowess that bests longer-serving Democratic incumbents on this list, Warnock is highly vulnerable because of the fundamentals of Georgia. He narrowly overperformed Biden in 2020, but both won by close margins in this purple state. And given Biden's sagging approval ratings, the senator will need to maintain -- and grow -- his margins over the President. Turnout will be a crucial question in a midterm year, but in that regard, Democrats are excited that Stacey Abrams' candidacy for governor may help energize nonwhite voters.\n\n3. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nAs the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020, Sen. Ron Johnson remains the most vulnerable GOP incumbent this year. A Marquette University Law School poll conducted at the end of February found that 45% of registered Wisconsin voters had an unfavorable view of him with only 33% seeing him favorably.\n\nDemocrats were ecstatic that Johnson decided to break a pledge to serve only two terms, and they see political hay in his penchant for controversial remarks. See, for example, his recent call for Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they win control of Congress. That's a debate Democrats are happy to have after running on defending Obamacare in the 2018 midterms, when the law was much more popular than when Johnson last faced voters, in 2016. (Johnson later issued a clarifying statement, saying he he did not mean to suggest that repealing and replacing Obamacare should be a top priority for his party.)\n\nStill, Republicans note that Johnson has been underestimated before and has come from behind to win. And while Biden narrowly carried the Badger State, his approval rating is at 43% (with 52% disapproving), according to the same Marquette poll.\n\nThe Democratic field remains largely unknown. Even Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, whom the Marquette poll found in the lead among Democratic primary voters with 23%, was unknown to 53% of them. Two of his challengers who have poured their own money into their campaigns -- Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski -- are on TV, so voters' familiarity with them could grow ahead of the August primary.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nThe biggest news in Arizona over the past month is that GOP Gov. Doug Ducey said (again) that he would not run for Senate , which was a major relief for Democrats as Sen. Mark Kelly runs for a full six-year term in the purple state.\n\nThe crowded field of GOP challengers, all jockeying for a Trump endorsement, is pulling the candidates to the right, potentially complicating the eventual nominee's ability to make a general election pivot after the August primary. (Former Sen. Martha McSally, whom Kelly defeated in a 2020 special election, struggled with this dynamic in her races for Senate.)\n\nState Attorney General Mark Brnovich is seen as the GOP front-runner, considering he's already won statewide, but he's struggled with fundraising. Venture capitalist Blake Masters picked up the backing of the anti-tax Club for Growth and already had the support of a super PAC funded by tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, his onetime boss, so he's not suffering for lack of outside assistance. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon, who had loaned his campaign $8 million by the end 2021, is up with plenty of ads talking about immigration.\n\nWith the GOP primary still in flux, Kelly's using his massive fundraising advantage to run positive spots about infrastructure and his work to address supply chain issues , with Democrats also spending on Spanish-language ads . Like Warnock, Kelly overperformed Biden in 2020, but the national environment has gotten worse for Democrats since and they cannot count on presidential-level turnout this year.\n\n5. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto is running ads featuring hospitality and restaurant workers touting her pandemic recovery efforts -- another Democratic incumbent who's using her campaign coffers to go up with positive spots while she has the airwaves to herself. Her campaign and Democratic outside groups are also running Spanish-language ads -- an important early investment in the Silver State.\n\nFormer state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who has the backing of Trump and McConnell, is expected to win the June Republican primary, but he still faces a well-funded opponent. Laxalt is the grandson of a former governor and senator with the same last name, but he lost his most recent election, the 2018 governor's race. Voters may know him more recently for serving as Trump's state campaign co-chair and echoing his election fraud claims, which Democrats point to in calling Laxalt too extreme for the state.\n\nBut Biden didn't win Nevada by all that much (about 2 points), and in a challenging national environment -- with voters here especially worried about inflation and the economy -- Cortez Masto is likely in for a tough race. The former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair hasn't raised nearly as much money as two of her higher-profile colleagues up for reelection (Warnock and Kelly) and has less recent experience trying to distance herself from the national party when facing voters. She won with about 47% of the vote in 2016, underperforming Hillary Clinton, to become the first Latina elected to the US Senate\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is in for a competitive race, even without a challenge from GOP Gov. Chris Sununu. Yes, the Granite State has gone blue in every federal election in the past six years. And yes, by the numbers, it's the most daunting for Republicans given that Biden carried it by 7 points. But given Biden's low approval rating and a sour national mood, even a Republican with a much lower profile than Sununu should be able to keep this one close.\n\nFifty-five percent of New Hampshire adults disapproved of Biden's job performance while 43% approved, according to a University of New Hampshire poll conducted in late February. Ratings of his handling of the economy were worse. Those may be difficult numbers for Hassan, a first-term senator, to overcome in an era when Senate races are increasingly nationalized.\n\nJust how competitive November's race is, however, may depend on what kind of campaigns Republicans Chuck Morse and Kevin Smith put together. There's still time for these relatively unknown candidates to introduce themselves, but a September primary also doesn't give them much time to position for the general election.\n\nDemocrats think New Hampshire is one state where the abortion issue may prove to be particularly salient if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this year, because of the higher concentration of college-educated voters in the Granite State. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire adults in that UNH poll (which was taken before Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court) said they wanted him to pick a justice who would vote to uphold Roe v. Wade.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nTrump took sides in the GOP primary in June, but his chosen candidate, US Rep. Ted Budd, hasn't cleared the field. \"He's loved by, especially, the conservative wing of the party — highly respected guy,\" Trump told the Washington Examiner earlier this month. Budd has had plenty of help on the airwaves from the political arm of the Club for Growth, which has spent millions attacking former Gov. Pat McCrory ahead of the May 17 Republican primary.\n\nThe latest back-and-forth in this race is about Putin. McCrory's first statewide TV ad accused Budd of being \"friendly\" toward Russia, selectively splicing comments the congressman has made about the Russian President, including calling him a \"very intelligent actor.\" The club responded with an ad calling McCrory's attack a \"low-down, dirty hit job\" and surfacing footage of Budd calling Putin \"evil\" and expressing support for Ukraine.\n\nFormer Rep. Mark Walker and combat veteran Marjorie K. Eastman are still in the race but even if they peel some votes away from Budd or McCrory, it may not be enough to spoil an outright victory since the threshold needed to avoid a primary runoff is only 30%.\n\nThe Democratic field is essentially set, with Cheri Beasley seeing her most viable opponents drop out. The former state Supreme Court chief justice hasn't raised as much money as some Democrats in other races. And even though she doesn't have a voting record, her judicial record could provide fodder for Republicans to try to paint her as soft on crime, similar to the way they've gone after Jackson since her Supreme Court nomination. Democrats are hopeful that a Black woman who's previously been elected statewide will help mitigate the turnout problem they've often faced in North Carolina, especially in midterm years, but that may not be enough to overcome any anti-Democratic headwinds in a Trump state.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nGOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who's likely to face Democratic Rep. Val Demings in the fall, starts this race ahead in a state that Trump carried twice. The war in Ukraine has brought plenty of earned media opportunities for the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. His campaign has attacked Biden and Democrats for not doing more to increase domestic oil production amid a surge in gas prices.\n\nDemings, who has impressed with her fundraising, has a compelling profile -- she's a former Orlando police chief with firsthand experience fighting crime, a detail that appears prominently in her campaign media. But Republicans are signaling they will continue to tie her to the national party, even on the issue of rising crime rates.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nThe Buckeye State is playing host to one of the nastiest Republican primaries of the election cycle. But regardless of how badly dinged the eventual nominee emerges from the primary, he or she will start with the advantage for this open seat in an increasingly red state that Trump twice won by 8 points. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan faces a primary, too, but he's largely consolidated party support.\n\nIt's possible the May 3 primary will be delayed because of uncertainty over state legislative and congressional maps. That would only give Republicans more time for the kinds of attacks that have made this a topsy-turvy race, with poll leads fluctuating depending on who's on the receiving end of the most televised vitriol.\n\nBy far the biggest motif in GOP advertising isn't Russia, but something a little closer to home, although still some 1,500 miles away from Ohio -- the US southern border with Mexico.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nThe prospect of former Gov. Eric Greitens winning the GOP nomination was already causing headaches in a red state that has no other reason to go blue. Those pains got more intense when Greitens' ex-wife alleged he was physically abusive toward his children and her, according to court documents filed last week. (Greitens has denied this.) His primary opponents immediately called for him to drop out of the race, with some members of GOP leadership in Washington, DC, echoing that.\n\nLater in the week, Trump, who had previously left the door open to endorsing Greitens, gave US Rep. Billy Long reason to hope when he issued a positive statement about the former auctioneer. \"Have the great people of Missouri been considering the big, loud, and proud personality of Congressman Billy Long for the Senate?\" Trump said. \"This is not an Endorsement, but I'm just askin'?\"", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/peter-meijer-impeachment-vote-trump/index.html", "title": "Meijer voted to impeach Trump. The ex-President's revenge tour ...", "text": "Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) It was just three days into Republican Rep. Peter Meijer's term when a pro-Trump mob ransacked the Capitol. A week later, the freshman voted to impeach Trump.\n\nNow, that vote could end his House career.\n\nA week before his primary, Republicans in Michigan and Washington say that Meijer's vote has made him the clear underdog in his primary race against John Gibbs, a former Housing and Urban Development department official backed by Trump, the latest sign that loyalty to the former President remains paramount in GOP intraparty battles.\n\n\"I think it was the biggest career-ending move in history, possibly, for him to do that,\" Gibbs told CNN, saying it \"catastrophically\" hurt the congressman's chances of reelection.\n\nMeijer, 34, says he would do it again.\n\n\"Not for a second,\" he told CNN when asked if he regretted the vote.\n\nAs he barnstorms his district, Meijer said he confronts questions from voters about why he cast his vote -- even as he tries to explain that his first two years in office were far more than just being one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump . But when he's asked why he voted to charge Trump with inciting the insurrection, he says he's perfectly blunt.\n\n\"For three hours after the Capitol was attacked, when myself, the House chamber and several hundred of my colleagues were having to flee from a mob, when the vice president, his wife, his daughter were running from crowds screaming 'hang Mike Pence,' when the next two individuals in the presidential line of succession were unsecured and had to be taken to secure locations, for three hours the President did nothing,\" Meijer said.\n\n\"I think that was a shameful dereliction of duty,\" Meijer said of Trump.\n\nBut what is alarming Republicans in Washington is that Meijer's West Michigan district stands at serious risk of flipping to Democrats, thanks to redistricting which shifted the district from one that Trump narrowly carried to one that Biden won by nine points. In an area once represented by Gerald Ford, Hillary Scholten could emerge as the first Democratic woman to represent the traditionally conservative region -- a rare bright spot for their party in a grim midterm environment.\n\nNational Democrats have begun pouring money into the race in a bid to prop up Gibbs, despite railing on him and other MAGA Republicans as \"too extreme,\" a strategy pushed by Democratic leaders who are struggling to maintain their paper-thin House majority.\n\nJohn Gibbs, a candidate for congress in Michigan's 3rd Congressional district, speaks at a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump in April near Washington, Michigan.\n\nGibbs, in the interview with CNN, made claims that could become general election fodder.\n\nAs he parroted Trump's false claims that 2020 election was stolen, he downplayed the fact that there was no evidence to back it up, comparing it instead to the \"mafia\" -- meaning people knew the mob were murderers but there wasn't evidence at the time to prove it. He claimed most people were peaceful on January 6, 2021, and was sympathetic to those who have been jailed for receiving tough sentences. He said he didn't know if Trump supporters were the ones who breached the Capitol, while saying \"no,\" Trump didn't deserve any blame.\n\nGibbs suggested they should look \"look at everything\" about the 2020 election, even if voting machines changed votes, while asserting that House GOP majority should probe it.\n\nAs to whether he's watched any of the hearings from the House select committee on January 6, which have provided evidence of Trump's role behind the attack and failure to stop it: \"No, I haven't. I'd rather pull my toenails out.\"\n\nGibbs also expressed strong anti-abortion views, saying \"it's really unfair\" to \"kill a baby\" if the mother has been raped, saying she should bring the baby to term and the rapist should be prosecuted. He also argued that saving the life of the mother is often used as a \"red herring\" since technology exists to save a mother's life and the baby so it \"is not really an issue.\" He criticized Meijer over supporting aid to Ukraine, which he believes will lose the war against Russia.\n\nBut Gibbs maintained that it was Meijer who was more vulnerable in a general election.\n\n\"So there's a huge amount of just betrayal that people feel on an emotional level, and it's palpable,\" Gibbs said of Meijer.\n\nHe added: \"If Peter Meijer wins the primary, he can't win the general,\" Gibbs said. \"He's going to lose too much of the Republican vote.\"\n\nDemocrat candidate for Michigan's 3rd district Hillary Scholten poses for a portrait at her Grand Rapids home in September 2020.\n\nYet GOP leaders don't seem to agree. Even as Trump has stumped for Gibbs, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy's leadership PAC just quietly dropped into $10,000 into Meijer's campaign, who got the boost of another $5,000 from his super PAC, according to campaign finance records. And while Meijer and his super PAC have run ads promoting his candidacy, Gibbs has yet to run an ad on TV given that he has raised just a fraction of the money as Meijer.\n\nMeijer has criticized Gibbs for moving to West Michigan to run for the seat, something that Gibbs dismisses by pointing out how he was born and raised in Michigan though he worked in Japan and in Washington. And Gibbs singles out Meijer's vote for bipartisan bills to provide $40 billion aid to Ukraine and stem gun violence. But the impeachment vote stands above the rest of the issues, according to Republican officials.\n\nDespite his financial advantages and hailing from a storied Michigan family -- he's the grandson of Hendrik Meijer, who founded the grocery store chain that bears their name -- Meijer, a US Army veteran who served in Iraq, is still trying to explain to voters where he stands.\n\n\"I have a lot of folks who start out hostile and then when they have an opportunity to hear a little bit more, they get it,\" Meijer said in a boxing gym where he was meeting with voters. \"And they say, 'thank you.' However, that's harder to convey in a three quick bullet points, it's harder to convey in 87 words in a TV spot.\"\n\nGibbs compares lack of 'rigged' election evidence to the 'Mafia'\n\nSo far, Trump has won his revenge against some of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him. Four lawmakers -- Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, Michigan Rep. Fred Upton and New York Rep. John Katko -- have chosen to retire. South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice lost his primary, and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney is encouraging Democrats to vote for her as she polls far behind her Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman.\n\nOf the 10, only California Rep. David Valadao has won his primary, where Trump did not endorse. Trump has endorsed challengers to Washington Reps. Dan Newhouse and Jaime Herrera Beutler, but those members could benefit from their state's open primary system against fractured fields on August 2.\n\nIn November, Trump endorsed Gibbs, saying, \"Unlike Peter Meijer, he will not turn his back on Michigan.\" In April, the former President traveled to Michigan, rallied the faithful and made fun of how to say Meijer's name. (Meijer said, \"It was pretty clear he wasn't entirely sure who I was by the 92nd digression on how to pronounce my last name,\" which rhymes with \"fire.\")\n\nWhen Gibbs first met with Trump in Mar-a-Lago, the first thing the former President said to him: \"I didn't know that you'd be good looking,\" according to Gibbs. But he earned Trump's praise as he embraced the ex-President's false claims that he actually won the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAsked by CNN whether the election was stolen, Gibbs said, \"I do think there was enough shenanigans to change the result, yeah.\"\n\nGibbs said there were \"anomalies.\" Asked about the conspiracy that voting machines changed the votes in 2020, Gibbs said, \"I think we need to look at everything and see what's going on.\" Even though the country's voter population grew between 2016 and 2020 and vote-by-mail became more prevalent, he claimed, \"if a President gets more votes the second time than they get the first time, you always win the election.\"\n\nJoe Biden won the 2020 election, a fact affirmed in court and in Congress, and acknowledged by Trump's attorney general, White House counsel and daughter, among many others. But when confronted with the fact that no evidence of widespread voter fraud ever materialized, Gibbs compared Biden's victory to a criminal scheme cooked up by the mafia.\n\n\"I think one analogy that you could look at here is the mafia,\" Gibbs told CNN. \"For many years, you could never arrest them. You knew they were throwing guys off roofs and stuff but all you could get them for was tax evasion and money laundering because you don't quite have the legal and investigative framework in place to catch them.\"\n\nGibbs added: \"And just because there's no convictions and no court cases, that doesn't mean they weren't doing stuff. So I think there's some similarities there with this election stuff we're seeing. We are working towards, I think, the right kind of legal framework and prosecutorial framework to get to the bottom of it, but we're still not quite there yet. But I think we will get there, just like they did with the mafia.\"\n\nRep. Peter Meijer is seen in his office in July 2021 in Washington, DC. Meijer has served as representative of Michigan's third district since 2021.\n\nGibbs also said that Trump was not responsible for the attack on the Capitol and \"the vast, vast majority of people behaved perfectly fine\" that day while expressing sympathy to those who have been jailed.\n\n\"I think there's some problematic aspects with what's going on with the prosecutions,\" Gibbs said. \"But I think, overwhelmingly, what I've heard is that the people that were there were peaceful and they were protesting peacefully. So I don't see President Trump in any way responsible for anything.\"\n\nMeijer, who was in the Capitol on January 6, says Gibbs is creating an alternate reality.\n\n\"These fictions have consequences,\" Meijer said.\n\n\"I will say one of the frustrations is ... there's a lot of 'Well, no, it was either not that bad, or if it was bad, it was an FBI inside plot' or something else,\" Meijer said. \"I mean, because the reality I think is so damning that sometimes you need to create an alternate.\"\n\nScholten, who says that she has played no part in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's strategy to prop up Gibbs, says the candidate has energized the right-flank with those claims.\n\n\"I think that Gibbs has certainly fired up a certain portion of the electorate over those claims,\" she said. \"And I think it's dangerous.\"\n\nScholten is looking to take advantage of the intraparty fight, and the newly redrawn district, after losing to Meijer in 2020 by six points, yet she too will have to contend with a problem from her party's leader: Biden and his unpopularity.\n\nAsked if she believes Biden should run for President in 2024, Scholten said, \"I'm focused on this race right here right now in Michigan's Third Congressional District and getting them the representative -- the representation that they deserve from here in West Michigan.\"\n\nWhile she criticized Meijer's position on abortion rights and for voting against Congress' $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, she praised his vote to impeach Trump.\n\n\"I reached out to him the day of that vote and thanked him,\" Scholten said.", "authors": ["Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/03/donald-trump-holds-rally-macomb-county/7208593001/", "title": "Trump hammers at false claims of voter fraud in return to Michigan", "text": "Former President Donald Trump returned to Michigan on Saturday night to boost support for two Republican candidates he wants to see elected as the state's chief law enforcement officer and election official, inserting himself into the nominating process three weeks before state GOP delegates endorse their picks for down-ballot races.\n\nThe two Trump-backed candidates — Matt DePerno for attorney general and Kristina Karamo for secretary of state — are political newcomers who gained prominence after the 2020 election for peddling misinformation and unproven claims of corruption in that year's presidential balloting, which Trump lost to Joe Biden in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes.\n\nBeginning his speech about 7:30 p.m., Trump immediately attacked President Joe Biden and began hammering at false claims that the 2020 election in the state was rife with fraud and corruption.\n\n\"The presidential election was rigged and stolen and because of that our country is being destroyed,\" he said as the speech began. \"We did win, we did win. … We won by a lot, not just a little.\" Touting DePerno and Karamo, Trump said the pair \"will protect us from a corrupt election.\"\n\nIn his remarks at the Michigan Stars Sports Center in Washington Township, which lasted about an hour and 45 minutes, Trump talked about high inflation and a surge in migrants along the southern border, as well what he described as a botched withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. He also claimed that, if he had remained in office, Russia never would have invaded Ukraine and inflation wouldn't have gone up.\n\n\"The only thing they (Democrats) are good at is fixing elections,\" Trump said. \"That's about the only thing they do.\"\n\nHe also got huge applause when he teased another run for president in 2024.\n\n\"Would anybody like to see me run?\" he asked and the crowd of about 5,700 people exploded with cheers.\n\nMore:Donald Trump rally in Michigan on Saturday, April 2: Everything you need to know\n\nMore:Trump putting his prestige on line with Macomb County rally\n\nTrump's relentless disinformation campaign about the last election has left Michigan Republicans divided. While some continue to push for another review of the last presidential election, as Trump and his allies have demanded, others have condemned attempts to relitigate the contest, saying it's time to move on.\n\nDuring the speech, Trump said, \"We have to get to the bottom of what happened in 2020,\" though he wasn't more specific than that.\n\n\"This is about making sure Michigan is not rigged and stolen again in 2024,\" he said. \"So whatever you do, make sure you send a slate of delegates to support Kristina Karamo and Matt DePerno.\"\n\nThroughout the speech, Trump also attacked Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as well as Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. He called DePerno \"a tough cookie\" and Karamo \"a fearless champion for election integrity.\"\n\nHe urged Republicans to support both, calling their nominations \"critical.\"\n\nFollowing the speech, the Democratic National Committee put out a statement saying Trump “took the stage alongside some of the most extreme members of the Republican Party to remind the people of Michigan what today’s Republican Party stands for.”\n\nTrump's endorsement of candidates before the endorsement convention for down ballot races, including these, has also upset some Republicans, however, as has the fact that a party co-chair, Meshawn Maddock, who appeared at the rally, has followed his lead.\n\nBut those feelings clearly were not in evidence Saturday at the event in Macomb County: Trump supporters lined up hours early to attend the rally, sporting Make America Great Again apparel and waving signs.\n\nKaramo prompted some of the loudest applause of the evening when she promised those attending that if elected secretary of state she would ensure \"your vote isn't nullified by illegal ballots.\" She didn't specify what she meant, but reiterated unsubstantiated claims that the election was marked by voting irregularities.\n\nTaking the stage for a brief speech, DePerno, who led a failed lawsuit questioning the accuracy of voting machines in a northern Michigan county claimed to prove \"how fraud occurred in this state.\" But he did no such thing: A judge dismissed the case last year but DePerno is appealing the ruling.\n\nHe did not provide that proof Saturday.\n\nDePerno also said, when elected, that he would take action against Whitmer, Benson and his would-be opponent, Nessel, to hold them \"accountable.\"\n\n\"For far too long, we've allowed these radical, leftist Democrats to destroy our state and it's time we take it back,\" he said. \"I've fought for everyone in this state.\"\n\nHe also contradicted himself by saying on the one hand the Republican Party in the state was unifying behind his candidacy while on the other calling for supporters to \"storm\" upcoming local conventions to elect delegates to determine who will be the party's nominees for attorney general, secretary of state and other down-ballot races.\n\nMany Republicans have voiced concerns that DePerno and Karamo could be viewed as too extreme and too linked to Trump by voters and cost them chances to win with more mainstream voters in November.\n\nDePerno also spoke out against vaccine and mask mandates as well as the teaching of critical race theory in schools — taking up themes that have motivated Republican voters in other states.\n\nTrump attacks DePerno's opponent by name, has trouble with 'Meijer'\n\nIn his remarks, the former president continued to go after the candidate many consider the most likely threat to DePerno's nomination for attorney general, former state House Speaker Tom Leonard.\n\nFollowing up on a letter he wrote attacking the DeWitt Republican as a weak candidate, Trump said Leonard \"had a chance\" to correct election fraud \"but he didn't have the guts to do so.\" But it's far from clear what the president meant, given that Leonard wasn't in office at the time of the 2020 election.\n\nIt's also strange given that Trump had previously nominated Leonard to be a U.S. attorney in Michigan. Leonard, however, does have close ties with mainstream Republicans.\n\nTrump said Leonard is a RINO, or a \"Republican-in-name-only.\"\n\nThe former president also went after U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Grand Rapids, who voted to impeach Trump for instigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump made fun of Meijer's name and its pronunciation, saying he had never heard it before.\n\n\"What the hell kind of spelling is that? Nobody knows him,\" he said. But Meijer's family name — and its pronunciation — is extraordinarily well known in Michigan, given that his family founded the huge grocery store chain of the same name.\n\nKaramo calls Benson 'authoritarian'\n\nThe event began about an hour later than expected, around 5 p.m. Oakland County Republican Party Chairman Rocky Raczkowski led the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance and Maddock gave a brief message, calling for party unity.\n\n“Join together. Lay down all your differences,” she said. “Whoever wins these races, we are marching forward to win in August in November together.”\n\nIn her speech, Karamo, a community college teacher from Oak Park, decried what she called the demonization of election skeptics by the news media and Democrats, saying both are corrupt.\n\nAs for Benson, who she would face if she wins the nomination, she said: \"She's not even a Democrat. She's an authoritarian leftist who treats the people of Michigan like they're the unwashed masses.\n\n\"The problem is corrupt people,\" she said. \"The MAGA movement isn't about a person, it isn't about a party. It's about defending our republic, the United States of America.\"\n\nOutside before the event began, Karamo drew crowds seeking photographs and wanting to shake hands with her. Speaking with reporters, she declined to say whether she would take any specific action to review the 2020 election if elected. But she took issue with characterizations of conservatives who want more security around balloting as racist, calling it \"insulting.\"\n\n\"As a Black American I take it extremely personally insulting,\" she said. She added that she feels the charge of racism is used \"to pretend like we care about Black people\" when it really masks election corruption \"that disenfranchises all Americans.\"\n\nExperts agree that while election fraud exists, there is little evidence that it is widespread. Numerous audits, reviews and other studies have not found any indication of widespread corruption in the 2020 election in Michigan, including an investigation led by Republican state legislators.\n\nTrump has attacked those he considers disloyal\n\nTrump has lashed out at Republicans he has deemed insufficiently loyal by not supporting his claims of a stolen election, including those in Michigan. And he has thrown his support behind candidates like DePerno and Karamo, who have backed efforts to keep looking at that election, even if that could hurt the party's chances in November.\n\nAlong with Leonard, state Rep. Ryan Berman, R-Commerce Township, is also running for attorney general. Vying for the party's secretary of state nomination are Chesterfield Township Clerk Cindy Berry and state Rep. Beau LaFave, R-Iron Mountain.\n\nBefore the rally, Kevin Miller, 40, of Croswell, a small city in the Thumb, said he had never heard of DePerno or Karamo but that he was excited to learn more about their platforms. Although both candidates are running on promises to make elections more secure, Miller said that wasn't a top priority of his in the upcoming election.\n\n“Small business, bring the small businesses back up,\" Miller said. \"The bottom is suffering terrible. I’m at the bottom, suffering, we’re suffering.\n\n“We can take care of (election fraud). That’s something we can take care of. But there’s other more important things.”\n\nReginia Kubeck, 61, of Howell, said she supports Karamo and wants her to do away with mail-in voting despite Michigan voters overwhelmingly approving a constitutional amendment to allow no-reason absentee voting in 2018.\n\nJohn Cipriano, 54, of Macomb Township, said he hadn't heard of Karamo. But the last election was \"absolutely\" fraudulent, and the results should not have been certified, he said.\n\n\"I'm happy it played out this way to be honest with you, because it woke a lot of people up,\" he said.\n\nDePerno, Karamo thrust into spotlight after 2020 election\n\nNeither DePerno nor Karamo were considered political players before the 2020 election.\n\nDePerno, a Kalamazoo lawyer, led the legal effort that advanced conspiracies about voting machines in tiny Antrim County in northern Michigan after a human error briefly led to inaccurate results reported on election night. Trump easily won in the county as expected, but early results initially showed Biden winning. The issue was quickly fixed but DePerno's lawsuit caught Trump's attention.\n\nKaramo, meanwhile, has claimed she personally witnessed election fraud while working as an election challenger in Detroit on election night. She also participated in legal efforts to try to delay the certification of the vote and overturn the election.\n\nThat Karamo has spent much of her campaign focused on the 2020 election is in itself far different from past campaigns. Michigan candidates for secretary of state have traditionally been seen as somewhat apolitical, focusing on branch office services such as applying for driver's licenses and renewing vehicle registrations.\n\nBoth are controversial candidates within the Republican Party. Some, like Maddock — an avid Trump supporter who was seated next to the stage Saturday with her husband, state Rep. Matt Maddock, R-Milford — say DePerno and Karamo embody the spirit of the former president and can carry on his \"America First\" policies that have resonated with many in the GOP base.\n\nOther local, state and national party leaders are concerned that making the false claims of election fraud in 2020 the hallmark of every campaign and promoting candidates who’ve championed election conspiracies could backfire with more mainstream voters.\n\n\"We can't always be looking in the rearview,\" said Michelle Smith, a Republican state House candidate who currently chairs the local Republican Party's 9th District Committee, before Saturday's rally. She blamed Trump's endorsement of DePerno for creating infighting among Republicans.\n\nNorm Shinkle, a GOP member of the state panel responsible for certifying elections, said Trump erred in backing DePerno instead of Leonard, who narrowly lost the attorney general's race to Nessel in 2018.\n\n\"I mean Trump made a mistake. Everybody's entitled to make a mistake and in this case the (former) president made one,\" Shinkle said.\n\nThe Michigan GOP will hold its first-ever endorsement convention on April 23 when a few thousand delegates will decide which candidates to back for attorney general, secretary of state and other down-ballot races. The party will officially nominate candidates for the 2022 general election at a separate convention in August but rely on the April convention results for their choices. Other nominees, including for governor and U.S. House seats, will be determined by voters in an Aug. 2 primary.\n\nTypically, party officials remain publicly neutral before its members or voters decide so as not to appear to be favoring one candidate over another unfairly.\n\n\"It's going to be very interesting to see what happens in this convention,\" said Mark Forton, the chair of the Macomb County GOP, a vocal critic of Republican politicians he says have not done enough to investigate the 2020 election. \"All we know is this, when it comes to the Republican Party in Michigan, we’re going to have a new one.\"\n\nAhead of Saturday's rally, Benson said that Trump's visit was part of a campaign to elect officials who might overturn the results of future elections.\n\n\"This election year will decide the future of our democracy in a moment where democracy is under threat like never before,\" she said. She called Michigan \"ground zero\" for attacks on voting rights and efforts to subvert elections.\n\nCounty Republican parties will select the GOP delegates at conventions across the state on April 11. Those selected will attend the state party's convention in Grand Rapids on April 23 and ultimately decide which candidates receive the Michigan GOP's endorsement.\n\nContact Dave Boucher: dboucher@freepress.com or 313-938-4591.

January 6\n\nThe latest hearing from the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection focused on the links between former President Donald Trump and the far-right extremist groups that were at the vanguard of the violent effort to stop the transition of power and keep him in office, despite his election loss. The panel repeatedly highlighted a Trump tweet from December 2020 to make the case that the former President courted the extremists and saw them as his troops on the ground during the Capitol riot . The tweet claimed that it was \"statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,\" and said there would be a \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th.\" Trump infamously added, \"Be there, will be wild!\" The committee also unveiled evidence showing how Trump's call for his supporters to march to the Capitol had been planned in advance.\n\n2. Uvalde\n\nLeaked surveillance video showing moments of the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, was published on Tuesday, fueling immense scrutiny over the delayed law enforcement response . The families of the victims reacted with anger and outrage to what is now the clearest account of how officers waited outside a classroom as the gunman continued firing, killing 19 students and 2 teachers on May 24. The video was obtained by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper, which published portions of it despite the Texas House Committee already announcing it would publicly release the full video on Sunday after showing it to victims' family members. Texas officials and families of the victims called the early release of the video appalling and painful to watch. The newspaper, however, defended its decision to publish the leaked footage, saying in a statement that \"unrelenting reporting is a way to bring change.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Screw you!': Uvalde parents lash out at surveillance video leak Replay More Videos ...

This comes just days after Musk told Twitter he wants to terminate his $44 billion acquisition agreement. The deal is now likely headed for a lengthy court battle to determine whether Twitter can force Musk to close the deal and become its owner, or at least get him to pay the $1 billion breakup fee set out in the original agreement. After initially saying he wanted to buy Twitter to eradicate bots, Musk has in recent weeks expressed concerns (without any apparent evidence) that there are more bots on the platform than Twitter has publicly reported. Some analysts, however, have suggested that Musk simply wants an excuse to get out of a deal that now seems overpriced following the downturn in Twitter shares and the overall tech market.\n\nJUST WATCHED Elon Musk may be on the hook for $1B to get out of Twitter purchase Replay More Videos ...

Gun violence\n\nIn a passionate address to the nation yesterday, President Joe Biden called for stricter gun laws -- including a ban on assault weapons, tougher background check laws and a higher minimum age of purchase if lawmakers cannot agree on an outright ban. His plea to lawmakers comes as many Americans remain rattled by the recent deadly mass shootings in Oklahoma Texas and New York . \"How much more carnage are we willing to accept?\" Biden asked during his speech, demanding Republicans end their blockade of gun control votes. Both Biden and his advisers have suggested they have exhausted their options on executive action to address guns. In Congress, the House Judiciary Committee approved a wide-ranging bill that would likely pass the Democratic-controlled House but wouldn't overcome a Republican-led filibuster in the Senate.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nAfter 100 days of war, about 20% of Ukraine's territory is now under Russian control, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said yesterday, adding that the Donbas region is \"almost entirely destroyed.\" About 800 people, including some children, are hiding in several bomb shelters underneath a chemical factory in Severodonetsk, which has been targeted by Russian missile attacks, the head of Luhansk region military administration said. Those in hiding are locals who were asked to leave the city but refused.

January 6\n\nDuring the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows received a series of urgent pleas from Republicans who believed then-President Donald Trump had the power to stop the violence. One of the key questions the House select committee is expected to raise during high-profile hearings next week is why Trump failed to publicly condemn the attack for hours, and whether that failure is proof of \" dereliction of duty \" and evidence that Trump tried to obstruct Congress' certification of the 2020 election.

Despite some reluctance from parents , White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha expects \"the vast majority\" of kids will be vaccinated by their primary care providers.

Turkey is one of several nations -- including Israel, China and India -- that have shown interest in mediating a resolution to the invasion. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expects \"solid outcomes\" from the talks, and wants an immediate ceasefire. Russian forces have largely stalled on the ground in parts of Ukraine , but evacuations are underway in the port city of Mariupol, where the mayor says Russia controls most of the points of exit. More than 3.8 million people have fled Ukraine since the war began, according to the United Nations -- and half of them are children. On the nuclear question, a Kremlin spokesperson has ruled out Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine , saying Moscow would only use them if there was a threat to the country's existence.\n\n2. Budget proposal\n\nPresident Joe Biden has rolled out his budget proposal for fiscal year 2023 . The proposal includes almost $7 billion to counter Russian aggression, as well as an increase in military spending and more than $33 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention. The plan also includes $26 billion for NASA -- the largest request for science in the space agency's history -- setting the stage for human exploration on Mars. Overall, the proposal would cut the federal budget by $1.3 trillion. In order to reach such a massive cut and cover areas of increased funding, the proposal also calls for a new \"minimum tax on billionaires.\" The new tax plan applies to anyone worth more than $100 million -- the very wealthiest 0.01 percent of American households. How would such a plan work? Here's an in-depth explanation . In short, making sure the ultra-wealthy pay more taxes could bring in $360 billion over the next decade.\n\n3. LGBTQ rights\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed the controversial piece of state legislation, dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by critics, that bans certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom . The new law will go into effect in July, and states that \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\" Proponents say it will help parents regulate what students learn and discuss in school, but critics say it is another in a long line of measures to further silence and marginalize LGBTQ individuals. DeSantis has a history of supporting anti-LGBTQ legislation, including an anti-trans sports ban last year.\n\nJUST WATCHED State Senator broke down in tears discussing Florida bill and coming out as gay Replay More Videos ...

Texas school shooting\n\nConflicting reports from authorities are raising further questions about the police response to the massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas on Tuesday. The 18-year-old gunman was not confronted by police before he entered the school, a Texas law enforcement official said yesterday. This new detail comes after a representative with the Texas Department of Public Safety on Wednesday said a school resource officer had \"engaged\" with the shooter before he went into the school. Among the many urgent questions that have caused anger and dismay from the public, it is still unclear why it took an hour for a tactical team to assemble and force its way inside. It is also currently unknown why the shooter was able to access the classrooms through an unlocked door at the school that morning.\n\n2. NRA convention\n\nIn the wake of the deadliest US school shooting in nearly a decade , the National Rifle Association is set to hold its 2022 annual convention in Houston, Texas, today. Several notable conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, are scheduled to speak at the meeting. Some other speakers have canceled their planned appearances, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who will instead attend a news conference in Uvalde, according to his spokesperson. Several musicians who were set to sing in a concert at this weekend's convention have also canceled their performances. The annual meeting is only open to NRA members. The organization currently has over five million members, according to its website.\n\nJUST WATCHED Musician says he's a proud gun owner, but canceled on NRA anyway Replay More Videos ...

Ukraine\n\nThe Biden administration is preparing to approve sending an advanced long-range rocket system to Ukraine , multiple officials say. Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers -- much farther than any of the systems Ukraine has -- which the Ukrainians argue could be a game-changer in their war against Russia . The administration is leaning toward sending the systems with a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week. This comes as Ukrainian officials today reported heavy fighting across several fronts, including in the Luhansk region where a local military chief describes \"fierce battles\" are currently taking place.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'City of ghosts': What's become of Mariupol after Russian occupation Replay More Videos ...

Extreme weather\n\nSnow, severe storms and triple-digit heat are expected across the US this Memorial Day weekend . More than a foot of snow will likely stick to the higher elevations above 8,000 feet in the northern Rockies. Cooler temperatures and wet conditions will impact the entire Northwest from Oregon to North Dakota. Some western coastal areas will receive wet weather first starting Saturday -- and it will slowly crawl east through the beginning of next week. On the other hand, triple-digit heat is expected to descend on Texas and other neighboring states, where temperatures will climb into the 100s, the National Weather Service said. To make matters worse, this region will dry out again and winds will pick up as the weekend goes on, elevating fire weather conditions.\n\n5. Air Travel\n\nDelta Air Lines announced yesterday it will cut about 100 flights a day from its summer schedule to \"minimize disruptions and bounce back faster when challenges occur.\" The company's decision to scale back will primarily affect markets in the US and Latin America between July 1 and August 7, Delta said in a statement . Delta, however, isn't the first airline to trim its summer schedule due to operational issues and decreased staffing. JetBlue announced in April that it would cut 8% to 10% of its summer schedule due to \"continued industry challenges.\" Alaska Airlines also reduced its schedule by about 2% through June to match \"pilot capacity.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Airlines are slashing flights due to staffing shortage Replay More Videos ...

Zelensky's speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. Separately, the top US military officer told lawmakers yesterday that the world is becoming more unstable and the \"potential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing.\" Later today, the US will announce new sanctions on Russia in coordination with several other nations and the European Union , according to an administration official.\n\n2. Severe storms\n\nMore than 45 million people are under an enhanced severe weather threat across the Southeast US this morning, where a powerful storm could deliver a triple threat of wind, tornadoes and flooding. Parts of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and the western Carolinas could see damaging winds and a few tornadoes in the coming days, according to the latest forecasts. A flood watch is also in effect for about 2 million people in the region, with some isolated areas getting around 5 inches of rain. The storm system is hitting the region at an unfortunate time, as most areas remain in recovery mode from recent tornadoes and treacherous thunderstorms. At least two people were killed yesterday by the storms, local officials said.\n\n3. Abortion\n\nThe Oklahoma legislature yesterday passed a near-total ban on abortion , making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. The bill would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both. The legislation passed the state Republican-led House by a 70-14 vote, without debate or questions on the floor. The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who previously promised to sign every bill limiting abortion that came across his desk. This comes as several state legislatures have advanced bills restricting abortion access . Last week, Arizona's Republican governor signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest.\n\n4. Student loans\n\nThe Biden administration is planning to extend its pause on federal student loan repayments through August 31. The repayment freeze, which has been in place since the beginning of the pandemic, was scheduled to expire on May 1. But due to increased pressure from other Democrats and consumer advocate groups, President Joe Biden will move the date yet again as inflation and ongoing supply chain issues continue to make everyday items more expensive. Borrower balances have effectively been frozen for more than two years, with no payments required on most federal student loans since March 2020. The administration is expected to announce the extension today, according to an administration official familiar with the matter.\n\nJUST WATCHED Have student debt?

Recession\n\nDeutsche Bank is the first major bank to forecast a US recession that will begin late next year . The Federal Reserve's fight against rising inflation and its \"aggressive tightening of monetary policy will push the economy into a recession,\" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a new report. Hopes that inflation would rapidly cool off have been dashed, in part because of the war in Ukraine. Energy and food commodity prices have spiked since the start of Russia's invasion and there are still looming concerns that the Fed will have to rapidly raise interest rates to get prices under control. The exact severity of recession is uncertain, but Deutsche Bank expects it to be \"mild\" compared to the past two downturns. Unemployment, for example, is expected to peak at 5% in 2024 -- but reached far higher levels of 14.7% in 2020 and 10% in 2009 during the Great Recession.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why the US could be headed toward a recession Replay More Videos ...

Coronavirus\n\nDemocrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are gearing up for a showdown over Covid-19 relief funding this week. House Democrats plan to introduce a massive spending bill as soon as tomorrow that includes roughly $10 billion to help bolster Ukraine, but also tacks on about $22.5 billion in coronavirus relief money that Republicans widely oppose. The move would put Republicans in a tough spot -- essentially daring them to block a package that includes money for Ukraine -- according to a Democratic source familiar with the matter. The pressure is on for both parties to secure a deal before Friday, when government funding expires. If a broad funding package doesn't move quickly, lawmakers may be forced to pass another short-term stopgap funding measure to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n4.

The new regulation will address a critical gap in the government's ability to track such guns by requiring background checks before purchase and serial numbers on some of the components. Up until now, anyone -- no matter their age or criminal record -- could buy the kits and assemble a weapon. Biden's move comes as gun violence and crime have ticked up in the US. Separately, Biden also named former federal prosecutor Steve Dettelbach as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- setting up what will likely be a tough confirmation fight.\n\n3.

Liz Cheney -- vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and the GOP's most outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump -- is trying to hold on to her seat . But if the latest polling is any guide, she faces a major uphill battle. Cheney is one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former President last year and also lost her party leadership position after repeatedly criticizing Trump. Today, she is running against a primary challenger backed by Trump in a state where he won 70% of the vote in the 2020 election. Experts say this race underscores how Trump's hold on the Republican Party is tightening even as the former President's legal challenges are mounting. Separately, voters in Alaska are casting ballots today in two separate elections for the same seat, and Sarah Palin is among those on the ballot.\n\n2. Gas prices\n\nHere's some good news: the average price of gas could drop below $3 a gallon in much of the US by the end of the year. Gas prices have fallen for 62 consecutive days and will likely continue to steadily decline . The national average for a gallon of regular gas stood at $3.96 Monday, down $1.06 -- or 21% -- since hitting a record high on June 14. The average price is somewhat inflated in some high-priced states, such as California, where the average is $5.37 a gallon. But even in states with high gas prices, the average price is down more than $1 a gallon since the June peak . Plus, as students return to school and the summer driving season comes to an end, gas prices will likely decline even further, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks prices for AAA.\n\n3.

Meanwhile, Russia's defense minister said today that the advanced US-supplied arms to Ukraine are not having a \"significant impact\" on the war. Ukrainian officials, however, have previously said these arms and other multiple rocket systems are \"affecting the course of the war\" -- a view shared by top US military personnel and diplomatic officials.\n\nHAPPENING LATER\n\nBiden to sign Inflation Reduction Act into law today\n\nPresident Joe Biden will sign a sweeping $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill into law at the White House today -- marking a major victory for his administration and the Democratic Party ahead of the midterm elections.

January 6\n\nThe latest hearing from the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection focused on the links between former President Donald Trump and the far-right extremist groups that were at the vanguard of the violent effort to stop the transition of power and keep him in office, despite his election loss. The panel repeatedly highlighted a Trump tweet from December 2020 to make the case that the former President courted the extremists and saw them as his troops on the ground during the Capitol riot . The tweet claimed that it was \"statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,\" and said there would be a \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th.\" Trump infamously added, \"Be there, will be wild!\" The committee also unveiled evidence showing how Trump's call for his supporters to march to the Capitol had been planned in advance.\n\n2. Uvalde\n\nLeaked surveillance video showing moments of the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, was published on Tuesday, fueling immense scrutiny over the delayed law enforcement response . The families of the victims reacted with anger and outrage to what is now the clearest account of how officers waited outside a classroom as the gunman continued firing, killing 19 students and 2 teachers on May 24. The video was obtained by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper, which published portions of it despite the Texas House Committee already announcing it would publicly release the full video on Sunday after showing it to victims' family members. Texas officials and families of the victims called the early release of the video appalling and painful to watch. The newspaper, however, defended its decision to publish the leaked footage, saying in a statement that \"unrelenting reporting is a way to bring change.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Screw you!': Uvalde parents lash out at surveillance video leak Replay More Videos ...

The deal is now likely headed for a lengthy court battle to determine whether Twitter can force Musk to close the deal and become its owner, or at least get him to pay the $1 billion breakup fee set out in the original agreement. After initially saying he wanted to buy Twitter to eradicate bots, Musk has in recent weeks expressed concerns (without any apparent evidence) that there are more bots on the platform than Twitter has publicly reported. Some analysts, however, have suggested that Musk simply wants an excuse to get out of a deal that now seems overpriced following the downturn in Twitter shares and the overall tech market.\n\nJUST WATCHED Elon Musk may be on the hook for $1B to get out of Twitter purchase Replay More Videos ...

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for serving on the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. The RNC referred to that day as \"legitimate political discourse\" in the resolution, but in a rare break with the RNC, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said what occurred was \"a violent insurrection.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, meanwhile, defended the RNC's choice of words. Separately, liberal activists are mounting a legal case to block Republican Rep.

Despite calls to keep restrictions in place, several states -- including California and Delaware -- have already announced updated guidance to drop indoor mask mandates in the coming days. And in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to lift the state's strict Covid-19 mitigation requirements for businesses today. That mandate requires businesses to ask customers for proof of vaccination and for them to wear masks indoors, except when eating or drinking.\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear doctor's grim prognosis for unvaccinated Covid-19 patient Replay More Videos ...

US Postal Service\n\nThe House of Representatives yesterday passed a sweeping bipartisan bill that would overhaul the US Postal Service's finances and allow the agency to modernize its service after years of crippling losses. The Postal Service Reform Act would require retired postal employees to enroll in Medicare when eligible, while dropping a previous mandate that forced the agency to cover its health care costs years in advance. Those two measures would save the USPS nearly $50 billion over the next decade, according to the House Oversight Committee. The US Postal Service's \"dire financial condition\" has kept the agency from modernizing and prevented plans to replace the vast majority of its aging vehicle fleet with electric trucks, according to a USPS spokesperson. The bill, which cleared the House by a 342-92 vote, now heads to the Senate, where it's expected to be voted on by the end of next week.\n\nJUST WATCHED USPS labor shortage may mean Covid tests may not arrive in time Replay More Videos ...

Gun violence\n\nIn a passionate address to the nation yesterday, President Joe Biden called for stricter gun laws -- including a ban on assault weapons, tougher background check laws and a higher minimum age of purchase if lawmakers cannot agree on an outright ban. His plea to lawmakers comes as many Americans remain rattled by the recent deadly mass shootings in Oklahoma Texas and New York . \"How much more carnage are we willing to accept?\" Biden asked during his speech, demanding Republicans end their blockade of gun control votes.

One of the key questions the House select committee is expected to raise during high-profile hearings next week is why Trump failed to publicly condemn the attack for hours, and whether that failure is proof of \" dereliction of duty \" and evidence that Trump tried to obstruct Congress' certification of the 2020 election.

The vaccination program for the youngest Americans would come more than 18 months after vaccines were first authorized for adults. Despite some reluctance from parents , White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha expects \"the vast majority\" of kids will be vaccinated by their primary care providers. The good news, Jha said, is the US has \"plenty of supply\" of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to start the vaccination program for kids younger than 5, and 10 million additional doses would be made available for states, pharmacies, community health centers and federal entities to order starting today.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\n14-year-old wins Scripps National Spelling Bee after a historic spell-off\n\nC-o-n-g-r-a-t-u-l-a-t-i-o-n-s are in order for Harini Logan\n\nAn opossum wanders into a bar... and gets tossed out\n\nLeBron James is now a billionaire\n\nA rare, 5-planet alignment will take over the sky\n\nCalling all stargazers.

Irpin, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, has been the site of intense shelling by the Russia in recent days. The UN said yesterday that more than 360 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, while acknowledging that the real figure is likely \"considerably higher.\" The UN also said more than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24. Meanwhile in Russia, more than 4,600 people were detained during protests yesterday, according to an independent monitoring group.

Coronavirus\n\nDemocrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are gearing up for a showdown over Covid-19 relief funding this week. House Democrats plan to introduce a massive spending bill as soon as tomorrow that includes roughly $10 billion to help bolster Ukraine, but also tacks on about $22.5 billion in coronavirus relief money that Republicans widely oppose. The move would put Republicans in a tough spot -- essentially daring them to block a package that includes money for Ukraine -- according to a Democratic source familiar with the matter. The pressure is on for both parties to secure a deal before Friday, when government funding expires. If a broad funding package doesn't move quickly, lawmakers may be forced to pass another short-term stopgap funding measure to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n4.

Trump\n\nTwo top prosecutors leading the criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump and his business resigned last month after the Manhattan district attorney said he was not prepared to move forward with an indictment against Trump, a person familiar with the investigation said. Prosecutors have been investigating whether Trump and the Trump Organization misled lenders, insurers, and others by providing them false or misleading financial statements about the value of properties. Some prosecutors, including the two that resigned, believed there was sufficient evidence to charge Trump, while others, including some career prosecutors, were skeptical that they could win a conviction at trial -- in part because of the difficulty in proving criminal intent, people familiar with the investigation said.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nJCPenney and Tide tried to get rid of coupons.

The sources said members of former President Donald Trump's campaign team were far more involved than previously known in the plan, a core tenet of the broader plot to overturn President Joe Biden's victory. Giuliani and his allies coordinated the process on a state-by-state level, the sources told CNN. One said there were multiple planning calls between campaign officials and GOP state operatives, and that Giuliani participated in at least one call. The source also said the Trump campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots, secured meeting rooms in statehouses for the fake electors to meet, and circulated drafts of fake certificates that were ultimately sent to the National Archives.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nTensions surrounding the situation in Ukraine appear to be escalating following President Biden's comments earlier this week that a \"minor incursion\" by Russia into Ukraine would prompt a lesser response than a full-scale invasion . Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pushed back, saying there are \"no minor incursions and small nations.\" Multiple rounds of diplomatic talks between the US, its NATO allies and Russia failed to yield any results, but Russia now says it would welcome another conversation with Biden. Meanwhile, with approximately 100,000 troops amassed along the Ukrainian border, the head of the International Energy Agency is warning that if Russia invades Ukraine, it will have major implications on the oil industry -- driving up oil and gas prices\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear Blinken lay out case for why world should care about Ukraine Replay More Videos ...

The controversial law, which brings a halt to most abortions in the country's second-largest state, has been in effect for five months. Last month, the Supreme Court allowed the controversial law to remain in effect but it cleared a limited path forward for the providers to sue a handful of licensing officials in Texas in order to block them from enforcing the law. The court's ruling was a devastating blow to supporters of abortion rights who had hoped the justices would block the law outright. Instead, the case was returned to the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nJUST WATCHED Supreme Court upholds TX abortion law, but says providers can sue Replay More Videos ...

The four officials, including the director of the state's air navigation agency, called in a fake bomb threat to Minsk air traffic control and then covered up the move by directing air traffic controllers to falsify incident reports about the airplane's diversion. The diversion led to the arrest of leading Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich , sparking a global uproar calling for his release. The incident took place as Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko had been fending off opposition protests since claiming victory after a hotly disputed election widely condemned by the international community.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nAdele tearfully postpones Las Vegas residency due to Covid among crew\n\nTwitter is rolling out verified NFT profile pictures\n\nFirst, it was the blue check.

Here's what you need to do next", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nTaking recent headlines is the recall of more than 2 million MamaRoo swings and 220,000 RockaRoo rockers, but on any given week a product you’ve come to know, love, and rely on in your parenting journey can be subject to recall.\n\nGet deals and shopping advice delivered straight to your phone. Sign up for text message alerts from the experts at Reviewed.\n\nIf you’re the owner of one of these infant swings and rockers—or any other recently recalled baby product—you may be wondering what to do next. For each product, it can vary greatly, but there are some very specific—and important steps you need to take to both ensure your baby’s safety, and the safety of others.\n\nHere is how to keep on top of product recalls and what to do if you own a recalled baby product.\n\n►More: Safer baby swings to replace your recalled MamaRoo\n\nBe in-the-know\n\nLet recent recalls be a reminder to set your google alerts to include baby and infant recalls. Staying up-to-date on all product recalls and the details of the recall is the first step in ensuring your child is safe.\n\nKids In Danger is a non-profit organization that was formed to inform and advocate for the public about product safety and they send out a regular newsletter with listings of recalled kids’ products as well as what to do next if your item has been taken off the shelves.\n\nYou can also visit the Consumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC) recall database. The CPSC is the government agency that reviews products that may pose hazards to consumers. They have a searchable database that you can refine to keep abreast of all recalls.\n\nThe second step is researching any hand-me-downs or second-hand items before you purchase them. While it’s technically illegal to sell a recalled item, if it’s second-hand it’s basically on you, the purchaser, to make sure you aren’t buying something that should have been sent to the landfill.\n\nFix it and forget it\n\nNot all recalls are created equal. While some items need to be pulled from shelves and destroyed, others are deemed safe with a simple snip of a drawstring or repair of a wonky wheel. Pay careful attention to the details of the recall notice.\n\nFor the MamaRoo models included in the rocker and baby swing recalls, the company is sending out a free strap fastener solution to reduce the risk of infants getting entangled in the straps as they hang below the seat.\n\nIn other instances, your item will need to be sent back to the manufacturer for expert repair.\n\nIn still other scenarios the company will recommend the product be destroyed or returned to the manufacturer.\n\nReturn to sender\n\nIf a product is fairly new and on the market, you may be entitled to a refund. Sadly, however, that may not always be the case. When it comes to taking recalled items off the market, companies can sometimes be pretty stingy with encouraging people to do the responsible thing.\n\nOnce a few years have passed, you may get little to nothing from the company for the recalled item you once spent hundreds of dollars on. Even though that can be a bitter pill to swallow, it’s still best to remove an item from any possibility of reuse.\n\nNancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, encourages you to send the item back if it’s an option. “We encourage people to send [the product] back to the company. Even if they are only going to give you a small amount, it’s so important to make that item disappear from any sort of circulation—even if it’s second-hand,” says Cowles.\n\nMake a fuss\n\nWhile a company may not be advertising any incentives for removing a baby item from circulation, Cowles says you shouldn’t be afraid of putting on the pressure. She recommends you make a fuss.\n\n“Look, if you bought a Pack-‘n-Play five years ago and you planned to use it on your newborn, it’s not good enough that you only got [one] use out of it,” she says.\n\nAsk for a replacement product, a voucher for a new item, or even free UPS pickup to deliver their recalled baby products back to them.\n\nDestroy and dispose\n\nIt’s illegal to resell a recalled product. You may get away with it, but that purchase may put another child in danger.\n\nIt’s encouraged that you do your best to destroy the offending product. Destroy doesn’t mean just throwing it in the trash or tossing it in the donate pile, it means dismantling it as best as you can and disposing of it piecemeal.\n\n“You’d be surprised at what people will take from your trash. If [a recalled baby product] looks good to them, it could go home with them and another child may end up in danger,” says Cowles. She says to hold onto parts with the first trash removal to make reassembly either impossible or too difficult to bother with.\n\nIf you absolutely must resell or consign your item, make sure it comes with a recall kit and you sell your recalled product either repaired or with the kit attached, otherwise—if the next child who uses it is hurt—you and the consignment store will absolutely be liable.\n\nThere’s a lot more where this came from.

Turkey is one of several nations -- including Israel, China and India -- that have shown interest in mediating a resolution to the invasion. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expects \"solid outcomes\" from the talks, and wants an immediate ceasefire. Russian forces have largely stalled on the ground in parts of Ukraine , but evacuations are underway in the port city of Mariupol, where the mayor says Russia controls most of the points of exit. More than 3.8 million people have fled Ukraine since the war began, according to the United Nations -- and half of them are children. On the nuclear question, a Kremlin spokesperson has ruled out Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine , saying Moscow would only use them if there was a threat to the country's existence.\n\n2. Budget proposal\n\nPresident Joe Biden has rolled out his budget proposal for fiscal year 2023 . The proposal includes almost $7 billion to counter Russian aggression, as well as an increase in military spending and more than $33 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention. The plan also includes $26 billion for NASA -- the largest request for science in the space agency's history -- setting the stage for human exploration on Mars. Overall, the proposal would cut the federal budget by $1.3 trillion. In order to reach such a massive cut and cover areas of increased funding, the proposal also calls for a new \"minimum tax on billionaires.\" The new tax plan applies to anyone worth more than $100 million -- the very wealthiest 0.01 percent of American households. How would such a plan work? Here's an in-depth explanation . In short, making sure the ultra-wealthy pay more taxes could bring in $360 billion over the next decade.\n\n3. LGBTQ rights\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed the controversial piece of state legislation, dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by critics, that bans certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom . The new law will go into effect in July, and states that \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\" Proponents say it will help parents regulate what students learn and discuss in school, but critics say it is another in a long line of measures to further silence and marginalize LGBTQ individuals. DeSantis has a history of supporting anti-LGBTQ legislation, including an anti-trans sports ban last year.\n\nJUST WATCHED State Senator broke down in tears discussing Florida bill and coming out as gay Replay More Videos ...

If you feel caught off-guard, you aren't alone.\n\nAfter the Omicron tidal wave washed over the United States in January and the smaller rise in cases in the spring caused by the BA.2 subvariant, it might have seemed like the coronavirus could be ignored for a while. After all, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in December that nearly all Americans had been vaccinated or have antibodies from a past infection. Surely all that immunity bought some breathing room.\n\nBut suddenly, many people who had recovered from Covid-19 as recently as March or April found themselves exhausted, coughing and staring at two red lines on a rapid test. How could this be happening again -- and so soon?\n\nThe culprit this time is yet another Omicron offshoot, BA.5. It has three key mutations in its spike protein that make it both better at infecting our cells and more adept at slipping past our immune defenses.\n\nIn just over two months, BA.5 outcompeted its predecessors to become the dominant cause of Covid-19 in the United States. Last week, this subvariant caused almost 2 out of every 3 new Covid-19 infections in this country, according to the latest data from the CDC.\n\nLab studies of antibodies from the blood of people who've been vaccinated or recovered from recent Covid-19 infections have looked at how well they stand up to BA.5, and this subvariant can outmaneuver them. So people who've had Covid as recently as winter or even spring may again be vulnerable to the virus.\n\n\"We do not know about the clinical severity of BA.4 and BA.5 in comparison to our other Omicron subvariants,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing Tuesday. \"But we do know it to be more transmissible and more immune-evading. People with prior infection, even with BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5.\"\n\nA 'full-on' wave\n\nThe result is that we're getting sick in droves. As Americans have switched to more rapid at-home tests, official case counts -- currently hovering around 110,000 new infections a day -- reflect just a fraction of the true disease burden.\n\n\"We estimate that for every reported case there are 7 unreported,\" Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, wrote in an email.\n\nOther experts think the wave could be as much as 10 times higher than what's being reported now.\n\n\"We're looking at probably close to a million new cases a day,\" Dr. Peter Hotez said on CNN. \"This is a full-on BA.5 wave that we're experiencing this summer. It's actually looking worse in the Southern states, just like 2020, just like 2021,\" said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nThat puts us in the range of cases reported during the first Omicron wave, in January. Remember when it seemed like everyone everywhere got sick at the same time? That's the situation in the United States again.\n\nIt may not seem like a very big deal, because vaccines and better treatments have dramatically cut the risk of death from Covid-19. Still, about 300 to 350 people are dying on average each day from Covid-19, enough to fill a large passenger jet.\n\n\"That is unacceptable. It's too high,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator for the White House Covid-19 Response Team, said at Tuesday's briefing.\n\nDaily hospitalizations are also climbing in the United States. The fraction of patients needing intensive care is up by about 23% over the past two weeks. And other countries are experiencing BA.5 waves, too.\n\n\"I am concerned that cases of Covid-19 continue to rise, putting further pressure on stretched health systems and health workers. I am also concerned about the increasing trend of deaths,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, at a news briefing Tuesday after the agency's decision to maintain its emergency declaration for Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic, he said, is \"nowhere near over.\"\n\nWhat's at stake with continued spread\n\nThere are also more insidious health risks to consider. A recent preprint study that compared the health of people who'd been infected one or more times with Covid-19 found that the risk of new and sometimes lasting health problems rose with each subsequent infection, suggesting that reinfections are not necessarily benign.\n\nAlthough vaccination reduces the risk of getting long Covid, a certain percentage of people have lasting symptoms after a breakthrough infection.\n\nThat's another reason why high numbers of Covid-19 cases are a big deal: Because the virus is still spreading wildly, it has every opportunity to mutate to make even fitter and more infectious versions of itself. It's doing this faster than we can change our vaccines, leaving us stuck in the Covid-rinse-repeat period of the pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pleaded with Americans to use all available tools to stop the spread of the virus, including masking, ventilation and social distancing.\n\n\"We need to keep the levels of virus to the lowest possible level, and that is our best defense. If a virus is not very robustly replicating and spreading, it gives it less of a chance of a mutation, which gives it less of a chance of the evolving of another variant,\" Fauci said in a news briefing.\n\nIn fact, this is already happening.\n\nMeet BA.2.75\n\nEven as the US comes to terms with BA.5, variant hunters around the world are closely watching another Omicron descendant, BA.2.75. It's been detected in about 10 countries, including the United States, and seems to be growing quickly in India.\n\nBA.2.75 has nine changes in its spike region that distinguish it from BA.2 and about 11 changes compared with BA.5, according to Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSeveral of the mutations in BA.2.75 are in a region of the spike protein known to be an important place for antibodies to bind to stop the virus, said Ulrich Elling, a scientist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences who monitors coronavirus variants for that country.\n\nThere's little information to go on: It's still not known, for example, how BA.2.75 may compete against BA.5 or whether it causes more severe illness. But experts say it has all the hallmarks of a variant that could go global.\n\n\"It spread to many different countries already, so we know that it has some sort of staying power,\" said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease for Helix Labs, which decodes virus samples for the CDC and other clients.\n\nBecause of that, and because of changes in the region of the virus that our antibodies look for to shut it down, \"we sort of know ahead of time that this one will cause some trouble,\" Luo said.\n\nBased on what we know now, she expects that this subvariant could drive a fall Covid-19 wave in the United States.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the meantime, Jha said, people should get boosters that are available to them to keep their immunity as strong as possible. US health officials emphasized that people who are boosted now will still be able to get an updated shot this fall that includes the BA.4 and BA.5 strains.\n\nJha specifically urged Americans who are 50 and older, \"if you've not gotten a vaccine shot this year, go get one now.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 94.7% of the US population ages 16 and older have antibodies against the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 through vaccination, infection, or both.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 caused an estimated 35% of new Covid-19 infections in the United States last week, up from 29% the week before, according to data shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the fastest spreading variants reported to date, and they are expected to dominate Covid-19 transmission in the United States, United Kingdom and the rest of Europe within the next few weeks, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\n'COVID-19 still has the capacity to mutate further'\n\nIn the New England Journal of Medicine paper, among 27 research participants who had been vaccinated and boosted with the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, the researchers found that two weeks after the booster dose, levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron subvariants were much lower than the response against the original coronavirus.\n\nThe neutralizing antibody levels were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 7 against BA.2; by a factor of 14.1 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 21 against BA.4 or BA.5, the researchers described.\n\nJUST WATCHED How much protection does a previous Covid-19 infection provide?

But the good news is that we are in, I think, a much better spot than we were without the vaccines,\" said Pavitra Roychoudhury, an acting instructor at the University of Washington's Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, who was not involved in the New England Journal of Medicine paper.\n\n\"There's so much of this virus out there that it seems inevitable,\" she said about Covid-19 infections. \"Hopefully the protections that we have in place are going to lead to mostly mild infection.\"\n\nEfforts underway to update Covid-19 vaccines\n\nModerna's bivalent Covid-19 vaccine booster, named mRNA-1273.214, elicited a \"potent\" immune responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, t he company said Wednesday\n\nThis bivalent booster vaccine candidate contains components of both Moderna's original Covid-19 vaccine and a vaccine that targets the Omicron variant. The company said it is working to complete regulatory submissions in the coming weeks requesting to update the composition of its booster vaccine to be mRNA-1273.214.\n\n\"In the face of SARS-CoV-2's continued evolution, we are very encouraged that mRNA-1273.214, our lead booster candidate for the fall, has shown high neutralizing titers against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, which represent an emergent threat to global public health,\" Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in Wednesday's announcement. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\n\"We will submit these data to regulators urgently and are preparing to supply our next generation bivalent booster starting in August, ahead of a potential rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections due to Omicron subvariants in the early fall,\" Bancel said.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting next week to discuss the composition of Covid-19 vaccines that could be used as boosters this fall.\n\nThe data that Moderna released Wednesday, which has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed that one month after a 50-microgram dose of the mRNA-1273.214 vaccine was administered in people who had been vaccinated and boosted, the vaccine elicited \"potent\" neutralizing antibody responses against BA.4 and BA.5, boosting levels 5.4-fold in all participants regardless of whether they had a prior Covid-19 infection and by 6.3-fold in the subset of those with no history of prior infection. These levels of neutralizing antibodies were about 3-fold lower than previously reported neutralizing levels against BA.1, Moderna said.\n\nThese findings add to the data that Moderna previously released earlier this month, showing that the 50-microgram dose of the bivalent booster generated a stronger antibody response against Omicron than the original Moderna vaccine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nModerna's data suggest that \"the bivalent booster might confer greater protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron strains than readministering the original vaccine to increase protection across the population. Although the information is based on antibody levels, the companies comment that similar levels of antibody protected against clinical illness caused by other strains is the first suggestion of an emerging 'immune correlate' of protection, although it is hoped that this ongoing study is also assessing rates of clinical illness as well as antibody responses,\" Penny Ward, an independent pharmaceutical physician and visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, said in a statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Wednesday. She was not involved in Moderna's work.\n\n\"It has been reported previously that the bivalent vaccine is well tolerated with temporary 'reactogenic' effects similar to those following the univalent booster injection so we can anticipate that this new mixed vaccine should be well tolerated,\" Ward said in part. \"As we head towards the autumn with omicron variants dominating the covid infection landscape, it certainly makes sense to consider use of this new bivalent vaccine, if available.\"", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/health/under-50-second-boosters/index.html", "title": "Officials urge Americans over 50 to get Covid-19 booster right away ...", "text": "(CNN) The White House's Covid-19 response team sent a clear message to the nation this week on the spread of the Omicron subvariant BA.5 and the importance of second vaccine booster doses for adults over the age of 50.\n\n\"If you have not gotten a vaccine shot in the year 2022, if you have not gotten one this year, please go get another vaccine shot,\" response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said Tuesday. \"It could save your life.\"\n\nSecond boosters have been authorized for US adults 50 and up, as well as certain people with weakened immune systems, since March . But for anyone under the age of 50, only one booster is authorized.\n\nThe officials had less to offer younger adults at the briefing, other than to say that the US Food and Drug Administration is considering second boosters for this age group.\n\nAs of the end of June, adults under age 50 had the highest rates of Covid-19 cases compared to other age groups, according to preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I know that the FDA is considering this, looking at it,\" Jha said Tuesday of second boosters for younger adults. \"And I know CDC scientists are thinking about this and looking at the data, as well. The decision is purely up to them.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed Wednesday in an appearance on CNN that the idea was being \"actively considered.\" But beyond that, he made no promises, saying the OK on expanding eligibility had to come from the FDA.\n\nIn the meantime, Americans under 50 are watching the lightning spread of the BA.5 subvariant and wondering about their own protection.\n\n'Frustrating and scary'\n\n\"It's frustrating and, frankly, scary,\" said Jennifer O'Neill, 42, who lives in Boston with her 74-year-old mother. O'Neill says she's been waiting on the government to expand eligibility for boosters to younger adults and doesn't understand why it hasn't happened yet.\n\nBoth O'Neill and her mom have had all the boosters they're eligible for, but O'Neilll's last shot was around Thanksgiving. She believes that booster protected her during their first family dinner in two years. Four of the 10 guests at Thanksgiving dinner caught Covid-19, but O'Neill and her mom didn't get sick.\n\n\"I know it's not the same variant. I know in my head it won't prevent transmission entirely, but I am just so concerned with her not getting sick that I'll do whatever I can,\" O'Neill said of her mother, whose age puts her at high risk of more severe illness. \"And it frustrates me that I can't because of eight years.\"\n\nAbout 139 million adults in the US are between 18 and 50, according to Census data. Many of them followed public health guidance and got boosters as soon as they became eligible last fall, when the original Omicron strain was tearing across the country.\n\nData from the UK shows that the effectiveness of booster shots against symptomatic disease caused by the Omicron variant is higher than 60% starting about four weeks after a third dose. After eight weeks, though, it starts to decline, and by five months post-booster, people have almost no protection against symptomatic infections.\n\nSo whatever protection young adults had against infection from last fall's booster is probably long gone.\n\nThat may be disheartening, but it's also not really what the vaccines were designed to do, says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOther ways to protect yourself\n\nIf protection against Covid-19 is your goal, you may be better served by using a combination of other tools, like wearing high-quality masks, making sure you're spending time in well-ventilated spaces with clean air and, if you have the luxury, being choosy about your social contact.\n\n\"These vaccines don't prevent mild infection,\" Shaffner said, and they don't keep you from infecting others. \"These are personal protection vaccines, rather than vaccines that prevent transmission in any substantial way.\"\n\nThe vaccines and boosters continue to offer stronger protection against Covid-19 infections that are severe enough to need hospital or ICU care, or that might be fatal.\n\nHowever, this protection is also slipping over time.\n\nFor adults ages 18 to 64, the effectiveness of a booster against Covid-19 hospitalization peaks around 82.4%, but it drops to about 53.6% about four months after the third shot, according to UK data. For adults over the age of 65, boosters are initially about 86% effective at keeping people out of the hospital, but that protection drops to 77% after roughly four months.\n\nProtection against death from Covid-19 falls to about 48% roughly six months after a second vaccine dose in adults 50 and older. Boosters initially restore that protection to about 94%, but that falls to 88% after 10 weeks or so, according to UK data. There was comparable data available for younger adults.\n\nIn the US, CDC data presented at the White House Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday shows that adults over the age of 50 who've had one booster dose had four times the risk of dying from Covid-19 compared with those who've had at least two booster doses.\n\nSchaffner says people who are under 50 and generally healthy are still in good shape when it comes to severe outcomes from Covid-19.\n\nBut, he says, if you are under 50 and have an underlying health condition like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, you should ask for a second booster even if you're not officially eligible.\n\n\"People are not usually quizzed too thoroughly,\" Shaffner said. \"I would just come up and say 'Hi, I've got bad diabetes' or 'I have underlying heart disease' and stuff like that, and at least in our neck of the woods, you'll be able to get a vaccine.\"\n\nHow to feel safe?\n\nthat qualify people for additional doses if they're under 50. O'Neill tried to get a fourth shot. She didn't lie; she has asthma and pleaded her case at two pharmacies, but they pointed her to a narrow list of conditions that qualify people for additional doses if they're under 50.\n\n\"I'm in Massachusetts, but the two pharmacists were very adamant, like I could get in trouble if I don't follow guidelines,\" she said.\n\nHer friends have told her to lie, but she doesn't feel comfortable doing that. \"I want to follow protocol,\" she said.\n\nShe's frustrated by what she sees as mixed messaging from the Biden administration on Covid-19.\n\n\"It's like 'Get out! Get back to normal!' OK. But I'm only comfortable actually getting out if I feel like I'm fully protected, and I know that the booster won't prevent transmission, it would just make me feel much more safe,\" she said. So she'll continue to limit her activities until she can get a booster.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWith or without vaccines, Jha said, there are things people can do to protect themselves if they do fall ill, including seeking treatment.\n\n\"We have highly effective treatments that work against BA.5, including Paxlovid.

The current vaccines are based on the coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, but the experts will discuss Tuesday if vaccines should also target the Omicron variant.\n\nIn their meeting, VRBPAC members will vote on the question: \"Does the committee recommend inclusion of a SARS-CoV-2 Omicron component for COVID-19 booster vaccines in the United States?\"\n\nThis is a moment of transition for the approach to the coronavirus vaccines. Anticipation is mounting that vaccinations could be needed annually -- similar to how seasonal flu shots are administered each year.\n\n\"There's anticipation that we would need a fall booster and what that framework would look like and if a vaccine is needed due to a different variant,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN.\n\n\"This becomes challenging, because is it really a booster if it's not the same formulation? And should we be talking about it in that way or is it simply a new vaccination?\" Freeman added. \"We don't discuss that we have received boosters of flu shots over the years. It's just part of getting your flu shot every year. So this transition is an important one.\"\n\nIn May, a trio of top FDA officials wrote in the medical journal JAMA that the United States might need to update its Covid-19 vaccines each year and \"a new normal\" may include an annual Covid-19 vaccine alongside a seasonal flu shot.\n\n\"By summer, decisions will need to be made for the 2022-2023 season about who should be eligible for vaccination with additional boosters and regarding vaccine composition,\" wrote Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research; Principal Deputy Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock; and FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf.\n\n\"Administering additional COVID-19 vaccine doses to appropriate individuals this fall around the time of the usual influenza vaccine campaign has the potential to protect susceptible individuals against hospitalization and death, and therefore will be a topic for FDA consideration,\" they wrote.\n\n'This is going to be ... a transitional year'\n\nThe FDA's vaccine advisers previously met in April to discuss how the composition of Covid-19 vaccines could change to target any new and emerging coronavirus variants. The committee agreed that there needs to be a framework for how and when such changes take place.\n\nFDA's Marks has called this year a \"transitional\" one in how we view the evolving Covid-19 vaccine schedule.\n\n\"The hypothesis now is that this is going to look somewhat like influenza. In this 2022-23 season, instead of just getting vaccinated against influenza, you'll also get your booster for Covid-19. And we'll see how that goes,\" Marks told Bloomberg in an opinion article earlier this month.\n\n\"If people who get that boost do well and we seem to have avoided another big wave from October to March-April of next year, we will have gotten people used to that,\" he said.\n\nPeople age 5 and older are already eligible for booster doses, and certain immunocompromised people and adults 50 and older are eligible for additional doses of Covid-19 vaccine\n\n\"We have to start thinking about vaccines that we can adjust strains of once a year and make it more of a flu model rather than saying, OK, every five months or four months, you'll get another booster,\" Marks told Bloomberg. \"The idea here is that next year we have one campaign, and we don't have to follow it up with another booster campaign. Ultimately, next-generation vaccines would ideally help hold us for that full year.\"\n\nCurrently, the original versions of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccines are used in the United States -- but vaccine makers have been working on updated versions of their vaccines.\n\nT Moderna has developed a bivalent Covid-19 vaccine booster, named mRNA-1273.214, which the company announced this month has been shown to elicit \"potent\" immune responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. This bivalent booster vaccine candidate contains components of both Moderna's original Covid-19 vaccine and a vaccine that targets the Omicron variant.\n\nOn Saturday, Pfizer and BioNTech said their two Covid-19 vaccine boosters targeting Omicron showed a substantially higher immune response than its current Covid-19 vaccine, and preliminary lab studies suggest the vaccines could neutralize the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nAnother vaccine maker, Novavax, has received VRBPAC's support for emergency use authorization in the United States, but has not not yet been authorized by the FDA. Novavax scientists also have been developing variant-specific updated versions of their Covid-19 vaccine as well as a Covid-19 and flu combination vaccine.\n\n'Booster uptake so far isn't that great'\n\nPublic health experts worry that there might be a sluggish uptake of any modified Covid-19 vaccines in the future.\n\n\"Our booster uptake so far isn't that great, and so another booster is not going to necessarily cause people to run out and get the boosters they've already missed,\" Freeman said.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the US population -- 67% -- is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with at least their initial series of vaccine, but less than a third -- 32% -- have received their booster, according to data from the CDC, as of Friday.\n\nVaccination rates for children still lag far behind other age groups -- just 30% of children ages 5 to 11 and 60% of those ages 12 to 17 are fully vaccinated, compared with nearly 77% of adults. National data on vaccination rates for children under 5, who became eligible this month , will likely not be available for a few weeks.\n\nThe CDC still considers receiving two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as being fully vaccinated. Any additional doses are called \"boosters,\" and completing all recommended boosters of vaccine is considered being \" up to date .\"\n\nBut that language and messaging around completing booster doses -- and considering them as being up to date instead of as part of being fully vaccinated -- \"is not working,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, vaccine scientist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN. That is evident in the slow uptake of additional doses.\n\n\"Since the beginning of January 2021, I've said this was always a three-dose vaccine,\" he said.\n\nNow, people who have not yet completed their booster doses are becoming more vulnerable to Covid-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\n\"There's heavy consequences because we're starting to see not only breakthrough hospitalizations, but even breakthrough deaths in people getting only two doses of the vaccine and not getting the booster -- especially those over the age of 65 -- so this is more than a theoretical discussion. Lives are being lost because of the messaging,\" Hotez said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAt the moment, vaccine-induced protection against Covid-19 seems to not stay durable for as long as vaccine experts would hope, but it is not so clear why. Waning protection could be due to the vaccines themselves or due to the emergence of coronavirus variants evading the vaccines.\n\nHotez said that he thinks the White House should convene a panel of vaccine experts -- outside of FDA's VRBPAC -- in a special meeting to determine whether the Covid-19 vaccine technology has a weakness when it comes to durability and what that means for future vaccine strategies.\n\n\"There's two things happening at once. There could be waning immunity,\" Hotez said, but at the same time, there have been variants like Delta and Omicron arriving on the scene.\n\n\"If all we had to worry about was Delta, would we be having a problem? Or would things have held up? And so I don't know the answer to that,\" Hotez said. \"That's why you want to convene the experts.\"", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/ba-2-covid-severity/index.html", "title": "Coronavirus: As BA.2 subvariant of Omicron rises, lab studies point ...", "text": "(CNN) The BA.2 virus -- a subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant -- isn't just spreading faster than its distant cousin, it may also cause more severe disease and appears capable of thwarting some of the key weapons we have against Covid-19, new research suggests.\n\nNew lab experiments from Japan show that BA.2 may have features that make it as capable of causing serious illness as older variants of Covid-19, including Delta.\n\nAnd like Omicron, it appears to largely escape the immunity created by vaccines. A booster shot restores protection, making illness after infection about 74% less likely.\n\nBA.2 is also resistant to some treatments, including sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody that's currently being used against Omicron.\n\nThe findings were posted Wednesday as a preprint study on the bioRxiv server, before peer review. Normally, before a study is published in medical journal, it is scrutinized by independent experts. Preprints allow research to be shared more quickly, but they are posted before that additional layer of review.\n\n\"It might be, from a human's perspective, a worse virus than BA.1 and might be able to transmit better and cause worse disease,\" says Dr. Daniel Rhoads, section head of microbiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Rhoads reviewed the study but was not involved in the research.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is keeping close watch on BA.2, said its director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky.\n\n\"There is no evidence that the BA.2 lineage is more severe than the BA.1 lineage. CDC continues to monitor variants that are circulating both domestically and internationally,\" she said Friday. \"We will continue to monitor emerging data on disease severity in humans and findings from papers like this conducted in laboratory settings.\"\n\nBA.2 is highly mutated compared with the original Covid-causing virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. It also has dozens of gene changes that are different from the original Omicron strain, making it as distinct from the most recent pandemic virus as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were from each other.\n\nKei Sato, a researcher at the University of Tokyo who conducted the study, argues that these findings prove that BA.2 should not be considered a type of Omicron and that it needs to be more closely monitored.\n\n\"As you may know, BA.2 is called 'stealth Omicron,' \" Sato told CNN. That's because it doesn't show up on PCR tests as an S-gene target failure, the way Omicron does. Labs therefore have to take an extra step and sequence the virus to find this variant.\n\n\"Establishing a method to detect BA.2 specifically would be the first thing\" many countries need to do, he says.\n\n\"It looks like we might be looking at a new Greek letter here,\" agreed Deborah Fuller, a virologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but was not part of the research.\n\nMixed real-world data on subvariant's severity\n\nBA.2 has been estimated to be about 30% more contagious than Omicron, according to the World Health Organization. It has been detected in 74 countries and 47 US states.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 4% of Americans with Covid-19 now have infections caused by BA.2, but many other parts of the world have more experience with this variant. It has become dominant in at least 10 other countries: Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Denmark, Guam, India, Montenegro, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines, according to World Health Organization's weekly epidemiological report.\n\nHowever, there's mixed evidence on the severity of BA.2 in the real world. Hospitalizations continue to decline in countries where BA.2 has gained a foothold, like South Africa and the UK. But in Denmark, where BA.2 has become the leading cause of infections, hospitalizations and deaths are rising, according to WHO.\n\nResistant to monoclonal antibody treatments\n\nThe new study found that BA.2 can copy itself in cells more quickly than BA.1, the original version of Omicron. It's also more adept at causing cells to stick together. This allows the virus to create larger clumps of cells, called syncytia, than BA.1. That's concerning because these clumps then become factories for churning out more copies of the virus. Delta was also good at creating syncytia, which is thought to be one reason it was so destructive to the lungs.\n\nWhen the researchers infected hamsters with BA.2 and BA.1, the animals infected with BA.2 got sicker and had worse lung function. In tissues samples, the lungs of BA.2-infected hamsters had more damage than those infected by BA.1.\n\nSimilar to the original Omicron, BA.2 was capable of breaking through antibodies in the blood of people who'd been vaccinated against Covid-19. It was also resistant to the antibodies of people who'd been infected with Covid-19 early in the pandemic, including Alpha and Delta. And BA.2 was almost completely resistant to some monoclonal antibody treatments.\n\nBut there was a bright spot: Antibodies in the blood of people who'd recently had Omicron also seemed to have some protection against BA.2, especially if they'd also been vaccinated.\n\nAnd that raises an important point, Fuller says. Even though BA.2 seems more contagious and pathogenic than Omicron, it may not wind up causing a more devastating wave of Covid-19 infections.\n\n\"One of the caveats that we have to think about as we get new variants that might seem more dangerous is the fact that there's two sides to the story,\" Fuller says.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe virus matters, she says, but as its would-be hosts, so do we.\n\n\"Our immune system is evolving as well. And so that's pushing back on things,\" she said.\n\nRight now, she says, we're in a race against the virus, and the key question is, who's in the lead?\n\n\"What we will ultimately want is to have the host be ahead of the virus. In other words, our immunity, be a step ahead of the next variant that comes out, and I don't know that we're quite there yet,\" she said.\n\nFor that reason, Fuller says, she feels like it's not quite time for communities to lift mask mandates.\n\n\"Before this thing came out, we were about 10 feet away from the finish line,\" she said. \"Taking off the masks now is not a good idea. It's just going to extend it.

They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron's BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n\"If you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it's really, really rare,\" Al-Aly said. That's not true anymore, though.\n\n\"So we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you're on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.\"\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded -- meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that's not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n\"There is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you're getting it again, maybe it doesn't affect you that much, but that's not really true,\" he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn't mean there aren't people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn't get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, and it could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren't, either.\n\n\"It is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,\" Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn't interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n\"The most relevant question to people's lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,\" he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can't determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person's underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n\"There is this idea that I think a lot of people have that 'if I survived my first infection, that I'm really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn't be any problem,' \" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n\"The popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,\" Griffin said of the study on the podcast \"This Week in Virology.\" But that's not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it's supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift -- as influenza does -- our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n\"A year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,\" Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he's seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it's not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he's seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n\"We don't really see much of that with the flu,\" Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic.

Look out for your roundup every Wednesday. If you haven't subscribed yet, sign up here\n\n(CNN) Nearly two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic began, the most infectious and transmissible variant yet has arrived.\n\nRepeated Covid-19 waves have left millions of people dead, with only vaccines helping to blunt the toll. Now the virus is spreading again — evolving, escaping immunity and driving an uptick in cases and hospitalizations. The latest version of its shape-shifting, BA.5, is a clear sign that the pandemic is far from over.\n\nThe newest offshoot of Omicron, along with a closely related variant, BA.4, are fueling a global surge in cases — 30% over the past fortnight, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn Europe , the Omicron subvariants are powering a spike in cases of about 25%, though Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, has said that number may actually be higher, given the \"almost collapse in testing.\" BA.5 is on the march in China , ratcheting anxieties that major cities there may soon re-enforce strict lockdown measures that were only recently lifted. And the same variant has become the dominant strain in the United States, where it accounted for 65% of new infections last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\"We have been watching this virus evolve rapidly. We've been planning and preparing for this moment. And the message that I want to get across to the American people is this: BA.5 is something we're closely monitoring, and most importantly, we know how to manage it,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House's Covid-19 response coordinator, in a news briefing on Tuesday.\n\nOn the same day, WHO's Emergency Committee said Covid-19 remained a Public Health Emergency of International Concern — its highest level of alert, first declared on January 20, 2020 — amid rising cases, ongoing viral mutation and increasing pressure on already overstretched health systems. In a statement, the committee, which is made up of independent experts, highlighted challenges to the ongoing global Covid-19 response, including a drop-off in testing and spotty genome sequencing, raising the question of just how accurately any nation might reasonably be able to monitor BA.5.\n\nOfficial data dramatically undercount the true number of infections in the US, epidemiologists say, leaving the nation with a critical blind spot as the most transmissible coronavirus variant yet takes hold. Some experts think there could be as many as 1 million new infections every day in the broader US population — 10 times higher than the official count.\n\nAs for how to manage the new wave, Jha urged Americans aged 50 and older to get second booster shots. Adults who are up to date with vaccinations are less likely to be hospitalized than those who are unvaccinated. But only about one in four adults in the US over 50 have gotten their recommended second boosters, data collected by the CDC show.\n\nUS health officials are urgently working on a plan to allow second Covid-19 boosters for all adults, a senior White House official confirmed to CNN on Monday, amid fears that younger adults' immunity may be waning as Covid-19 cases rise with the dominance of BA.5.\n\nWhat makes BA.5 different? Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, has called BA.5 Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, has called BA.5 \"the worst version of the virus we've seen.\" He explained in a recent newsletter: \"It takes immune escape, already extensive, to the next level, and, as a function of that, enhanced transmissibility,\" well beyond earlier versions of Omicron.\n\nIn other words, BA.5 can easily evade immunity from previous infections and vaccines, increasing the risk of reinfection. Though the variant does not appear to lead to more severe illness, in an interview with CNN on Monday, Topol said that given the extent of BA.5's immune evasion, he expects to see an escalation in hospitalizations, as we've seen in Europe and elsewhere that the variant has taken root. \"One good thing is it doesn't appear to be accompanied by the ICU admissions and the deaths as previous variants, but this is definitely concerning,\" he added.\n\nPublic health experts in the US may take some solace from the trajectory of the variant in Europe. WHO's Ryan said last week that while many European countries are experiencing a jump in hospitalizations, \"what we're not seeing is an increase in intensive care unit admissions, so the vaccines are very much still working and it is those gaps in immunity that are causing the problem.\"\n\nBut still, steep reductions in Covid-19 surveillance worldwide are hindering epidemiologists' efforts as they race to trace the virus' evolution.\n\n\"Sub-variants of Omicron, like BA.4 and BA.5, continue to drive waves of cases, hospitalization and death around the world,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a media briefing on Tuesday. \"Surveillance has reduced significantly -- including testing and sequencing -- making it increasingly difficult to assess the impact of variants on transmission, disease characteristics, and the effectiveness of counter-measures.\"\n\n\"New waves of the virus demonstrate again that the Covid-19 [pandemic] is nowhere near over,\" he added.\n\nYOU ASKED.

On the other hand, those with underlying health conditions or who have concerns about long-haul symptoms are still trying to play it safe. Given just how contagious the new Omicron subvariants are, avoiding infection does require some planning and consideration , CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen explains.\n\n\"I don't think that most people should have to change their daily activities, but I do think people need to be aware of their risk of contracting Covid-19 if they don't take additional precautions,\" Wen said. The question to ask yourself, she added, is this: How much do I want to continue to avoid infection?\n\nFor individuals who want to reduce their risk, Wen advises that they stay up to date with their boosters (in the US, everyone age 5 and older can receive a first booster, and those 50 and older can receive a second booster for a total of four shots). She also recommends wearing a high-quality N95 mask or equivalent in indoor, crowded settings, and staying outside for large gatherings as much as possible — something easier to do in the summertime.\n\n\"For those who find masks uncomfortable, I'd encourage mask-wearing in the highest-risk settings — for example, mask while in a crowded security line at the airport and during boarding and deplaning,\" she said.\n\nSend your questions here .

Those who are \"not suitable\" for vaccination will be exempt from the requirement, a city official said, without clarifying how they can provide the proof needed for exemption.\n\nThe vaccine mandate comes as Beijing reported three cases of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant. Several Chinese cities have imposed new curbs after detecting BA.5. Shanghai, which only recently emerged from a two-month lockdown, identified its first case on Friday and will perform two rounds of Covid tests this week. An outbreak of BA.5 has already shut down the northwestern city of Xi'an , home to 13 million people, where entertainment, sports and religious venues have been closed, and restaurants limited to takeaway and delivery services.\n\nCasinos in the gambling hub of Macao were ordered to shut for the first time since February 2020 because of a Covid outbreak, sending shares of their operating companies plunging, and fears of new lockdowns in Shanghai undermined the broader China market. Chinese stocks remained under pressure after Monday's sell-off fueled by the threat of new Covid restrictions, especially the tech sector, Laura He reports.\n\nPeople stand in line at a coronavirus testing site in Beijing on July 4.\n\nDrug-resistant infections and deaths have risen among hospital patients\n\nThe US had made significant progress in fighting drug-resistant infections in recent years. But those gains were largely erased during the Covid-19 pandemic, with hospital-acquired infections and resulting deaths rising 15% in 2020, according to new data, Deidre McPhillips reports.\n\nA special report released Tuesday by the CDC found that more than 29,400 people died from antimicrobial-resistant infections in the first year of the pandemic — nearly 40% of those deaths were among people who got the infection while in the hospital. The full number is probably even higher, given that data for half of the 18 pathogens identified as threats are unavailable or delayed.\n\nWHO has called antimicrobial resistance a \"silent pandemic,\" and drug-resistant infections were linked to nearly 5 million deaths globally in 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic probably contributed to the increased risk in the US, particularly because many people delayed care or left infections untreated — either because of closed clinics or fear of exposing themselves to Covid-19 — which can increase the risk of developing drug resistance.\n\nPulse oximeters don't work as well for people of color\n\nOften when Dr. Thomas Valley sees a new patient in the intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor, he clamps a pulse oximeter on their finger — one of the many devices he uses to gauge their health and what course of care they require, whether they are a child having seizures, a teenage car accident victim or an older person with Covid-19.\n\nBut recently, Valley, an assistant professor in the University of Michigan's Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, realized that the small device may yield less accurate oxygen readings in patients with dark skin. If the device isn't calibrated correctly, the darker pigmentation can affect how the light is absorbed by the sensor, leading to flawed oxygen readings and patients being discharged when they shouldn't.\n\nThe findings of Valley and his colleagues add to a growing body of research -- dating back to the 1980s -- that suggests flawed pulse oximeter readings among Black and brown patients can be a real and life-threatening issue in medical care. But the public has only recently been made more aware of this health disparity, and US health officials have announced plans to investigate the accuracy of pulse oximeters , Jacqueline Howard reports.\n\nTOP TIP\n\nAdvice for anxious new moms\n\nEdith Bracho-Sanchez, director of pediatric telemedicine and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, didn't think she'd be an anxious mom. But that changed when she had her son. \"I stress over every decision I make for William. I make long pro and con lists, I discuss everything with my partner, sleep on things and ultimately, I pray,\" she wrote in a recent column for CNN.\n\nKnowing how difficult it is to make decisions — big and small — she said she understood why some parents might struggle with the choice to vaccinate their children against Covid-19. This is why she says she did it, and her advice to anxious new moms like her\n\nFirst, Covid-19 is an unpredictable illness. While most children have minor symptoms and recover well, many have landed in hospitals and emergency rooms, and to date, more than 400 children under the age of 5 have died from the illness in the US alone, according to the CDC. We also don't yet fully understand the long-term effects of the disease.\n\nSecond, I know the vaccine is in the body for a short period of time and with a specific mission. It instructs the body to make protective antibodies against Covid-19, and the body's own cellular mechanisms quickly break it down soon after. Because of this, there really is no plausible way it will interfere with my little William's development, something about which I am constantly thinking.\n\nLISTEN TO OUR PODCAST", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/omicron-booster-vaccine-coronavirus-wellness/index.html", "title": "Should you get your booster now or wait until the fall? | CNN", "text": "(CNN) Covid-19 cases are increasing across the United States once again, driven by the most contagious strain of the coronavirus yet, BA.5. Federal health officials are urging Americans to stay up to date on their vaccines by getting additional boosters if they are due for them, but many people are confused.\n\nWho is eligible for boosters now? Will all adults be able to get a second booster soon? If new boosters are being developed for the fall, should people wait until then or get boosted now? How long should people wait for their booster after having contracted Covid-19? And what about kids — should they get boosters now or wait until school starts?\n\nTo help us navigate these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \" Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health .\"\n\nCNN: Can you start by reminding us who is eligible for booster doses at this time?\n\nThe latest guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are as follows: If you are 50 and above, you are eligible for two booster doses of the mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna). The first booster dose is given at least five months after your primary vaccination (which is either two doses of the mRNA vaccine or one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine). The second booster dose is given at least four months after your first.\n\nIf you are between 5 and 49, you are eligible for your first booster dose, if it's been at least five months since your primary series. Children younger than 5 just started receiving their initial vaccinations and therefore are not eligible for additional boosters yet.\n\nThere are a couple of exceptions. The first is if you are moderately or severely immunocompromised. Those individuals are generally able to get a third booster dose, with an interval between booster doses that's slightly condensed compared with the intervals for people who aren't immunocompromised. Another exception is for those who received an initial Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine, then subsequently got another J&J vaccine as their first booster. Those people, no matter their age, are able to get a second booster of an mRNA vaccine if it has been four months since their second J&J shot.\n\nCNN: Will adults who are under 50 be able to get their second booster anytime soon?\n\nWen: Federal health officials are discussing expanding the eligibility of second boosters. My best guess is that in the next month or so, they will make at least a permissive recommendation, meaning that those who want to get another booster should be able to receive one.\n\nThe decision about who should get a booster and how often is not straightforward. At the end of the day, there is a fundamental disagreement among scientists and public health experts on the purpose of the Covid-19 vaccinations. Some believe that the goal of these vaccines is to prevent severe illness, and as long as the vaccines continue to protect against hospitalization and death, additional boosters aren't needed. Others point to vaccines also being able to reduce symptomatic illness. That effect is not as long-lasting as the protection against severe illness, so those who hold this second point of view would advocate for more frequent boosters. The answer isn't straightforward.\n\nCNN: Are there certain people you'd say really need to get boosted now, if they haven't already?\n\nWen: Here's how I think about the three groups for whom boosters are more urgent if they have not received them.\n\nA nurse preps a syringe at a pop-up Covid-19 vaccination site at the Albanian Islamic Cultural Center, April 8, 2021, in the New York borough of Staten Island.\n\nWe know that age is a major risk factor for severe illness, and also that the protection against severe illness wanes in older individuals. People 60 and older, and who are 50 and older with chronic medical conditions, should really receive the two boosters that they are eligible for.\n\nThose who are immunocompromised and are eligible for more boosters should get them, since they, too, are among those who are most vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid-19.\n\nBeyond that, all adults should receive their first booster. We know that the first booster really increases protection, including against severe disease. If you are 18 and older and have not yet had any vaccines beyond your primary vaccination, you should get your booster now.\n\nCNN: What about children? Should they also get their boosters if they're eligible?\n\nWen: The data for boosting kids is much less compelling than for adults. The CDC does recommend boosters for children 5 and older, and I think a lot of parents and caregivers will want to follow that guidance. But the urgency is not the same as it would be for adults, especially older adults, who have not yet been vaccinated.\n\nCNN: Let's talk about timing. Some people are worried that if they get vaccinated now, they won't be able to get the Omicron-specific vaccines that may be coming out in the fall. Should that be a reason to wait?\n\nWen: For most people, I don't think this is a reason to wait. Here's why.\n\nFirst, federal health officials have said that getting vaccinated now won't preclude you from getting an updated vaccine in the fall. It's worth stating here that it's not certain that these updated vaccines will become available. The one likely to become authorized is the \"bivalent\" vaccine, meaning that it will be a combination of the original vaccine and an Omicron subvariant vaccine.\n\nSecond, there is a lot of virus surging around now. Getting boosted now will protect you now, and if you need an additional level of protection in the fall and winter, you could get another dose then.\n\nThird, it's not entirely clear that the updated vaccine is going to be better than the vaccines available. The updated vaccine is intended to target the Omicron subvariants, which would be great if the vaccines were currently available, since those are the dominant variants in circulation. However, if they are going to be given in the fall, there is no guarantee that the Omicron subvariants are still going to be the main strains at that point. Of course, we hope that the updated boosters will be more effective than what we have now, but we don't know that's going to be the case — which is even more reason not to wait until then.\n\nCNN: I've heard some people say, I'll wait to get a booster until right before a big trip. Does that make sense?\n\nWen: I can understand why some people might go with this approach. The booster does enhance protection against infection for a short time period after it's given, probably with maximal effect from about 10 days to three months. Someone who just got boosted could still contract Covid-19, but chances would be lower than if they got the booster, say, six months before.\n\nOf course, there are other ways to reduce your risk of contracting Covid-19, too. If you are very concerned about getting the coronavirus, you should also wear a high-quality N95 or equivalent mask in indoor spaces and avoid crowded settings.\n\nCNN: If someone has just recovered from Covid-19, how long should they wait before their booster?\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWen: They are able to receive a booster as soon as they are 10 days past when they first started having symptoms and no longer have a fever, though I'd recommend that they wait a bit longer. That's because recent infection conveys good protection for a short period of time and reinfection within a three-month window is rare. To get the longest protection out of your next shot, you could wait three months after your infection to get the additional booster.", "authors": ["Deblina Chakraborty"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/16/health/fauci-covid-second-boosters-adults-under-50/index.html", "title": "US will get an answer on second boosters for adults under 50 ...", "text": "(CNN) US health officials have been in active discussions with the Food and Drug Administration on whether the agency will authorize a second booster vaccine for Americans under 50 years old, the nation's top infectious disease expert shared Saturday.\n\n\"Hopefully we'll get an answer reasonably soon,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN's Laura Coates.\n\nSecond boosters have been authorized for US adults 50 and up, as well as certain people with weakened immune systems, since March. But for anyone under the age of 50, only one booster is authorized.\n\nFauci's comments come amid a worrisome time in the pandemic for many across the country. Daily Covid-19 case rates have surged again and hospitalizations and deaths are also up, fueled by the Omicron offshoot BA.5, which experts have said is the most contagious variant yet.\n\nLast week, the subvariant caused almost two out of every three new Covid-19 infections in the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky recently said while experts don't yet know much about the severity of the variant, \"we do know it to be more transmissible and more immune-evading.\"\n\n\"People with prior infection, even with BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this week, the White House Covid-19 response team urged Americans who were over 50 to get a second vaccine booster but had less to offer Americans under that age range, saying the FDA is considering second boosters for that age group.\n\nAs of the end of June, adults under 50 had the highest rates of Covid-19 cases compared to other age groups, according to preliminary data from the CDC.\n\nResponse coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said FDA and CDC experts were \"thinking about this and looking at the data.\" And as they do, some Americans have expressed frustration at having to wait for the government to expand booster eligibility to younger adults.\n\nIn addition to staying up to date with vaccinations when eligible, Americans can also help bring down the levels of circulating virus by masking up and testing \"so that you can keep people separated who are infected.\"\n\n\"You cut down on that likelihood that you're going to get new variants,\" Fauci said Saturday. \"And, in regard to the vaccines, it's important that you try to not only get a booster but, as you get more variants, we're going to be upgrading and updating the next level of boosters so that by the time we get to the fall, it is very likely we'll have an updated booster that will address better the circulating variant at that time.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Biden administration also extended the Covid-19 public health emergency (PHE), which will help \"provide us with tools and authorities needed to respond to the highly transmissible Covid-19 subvariants that are currently circulating around the country,\" one administration official told CNN.\n\n\"The PHE provides essential capabilities and flexibilities to hospitals to better care for patients, particularly if we were to see a significant increase in hospitalizations in the coming weeks,\" the official said.", "authors": ["Carma Hassan", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/07/16"}]}

The request opens up the possibility for a team to make a major move for Durant, which could yield a significant return on assets for the Nets.\n\nPhoenix and Miami are two of Durant's preferred destinations, according to Yahoo and ESPN.\n\nFULL STORY: Kevin Durant requests trade from Brooklyn Nets\n\nWho are the top free agents available?\n\n1. Zach LaVine, Chicago Bulls (unrestricted): One of the game's elite shooters and scorers, LaVine is in line for a max deal of five years and about $212 million from the Bulls or four years and about $157 million from other teams.\n\n2. James Harden, Philadelphia 76ers (unrestricted): Harden was expected to exercise his $47.3 million player option but elected to decline it to reportedly work on a new deal with the Sixers that would give the team more financial flexibility.\n\n3. Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards (unrestricted): Beal declined his $36.4 million player option in a move widely expected to clear the three-time All-Star to re-sign with the Wizards on a five-year max deal. But could he finally change his mind and look to play elsewhere?\n\n4. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix Suns (restricted): The situation appears to have soured in Phoenix after the Suns elected not to extend Ayton last offseason when they had the chance. Still only 23, Ayton will have suitors, but the Suns can still match any offer.\n\n5. Miles Bridges, Charlotte Hornets (restricted): Coming off a career year, Bridges is set for a substantial raise after he and the Hornets couldn’t reach terms on an extension before last season.\n\n6. Jalen Brunson, Dallas Mavericks (unrestricted): Brunson is also set for a big pay raise after a breakout season, and the Knicks are expected to make a big offer. But look for the Mavs to made every effort to re-sign Brunson.\n\nFULL LIST: Best free agents available in 2022 offseason\n\nPlayer option decisions impact free agency landscape\n\nOn the eve of NBA free agency, a pair of superstars declined the player options on the final years of their contracts to become unrestricted free agents.\n\nHowever, teams with money to spend probably shouldn't get their hopes up about signing James Harden or Bradley Beal to a big, splashy contract once free agency opens. Both appear likely to return to their old teams.\n\nWednesday was the deadline for Harden, Beal and others to make decisions on their player options ahead of free agency. Harden declined his $47.3 million option to reportedly work with the Sixers on a new deal that would give the team more financial flexibility to make improvements to the roster this offseason. Beal declined his $36.4 million player option in a move widely expected to clear the three-time All-Star to re-sign with the Wizards on a five-year max deal.\n\nFULL STORY: What Harden and Beal decision mean for free agency", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2015/07/01/nba-free-agency-tracker/29563891/", "title": "NBA free agency tracker: End of moratorium brings moves", "text": "By Associated Press\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have acquired two-time All-Star center Roy Hibbert from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for a future second-round draft pick.\n\nThe Lakers and the Pacers formally completed the trade Thursday.\n\nThe Pacers dumped their 7-foot-2 big man and his $15.5 million salary for the upcoming season after Hibbert spent the past seven years with Indiana, averaging 11.1 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.9 blocked shots.\n\nThe Lakers welcomed Hibbert into their ample salary cap space after striking out on the biggest names in free agency, including LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan and Greg Monroe.\n\nHibbert is among the NBA's top defensive centers, but his offensive game is perceived to be in decline despite numbers that are roughly comparable to his best seasons.\n\nKanter signs 4-year, $70M offer sheet from Blazers\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells the Associated Press that Oklahoma City center Enes Kanter has signed a four-year, $70-million max offer sheet from the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Trail Blazers did not announce the terms of the offer.\n\nThe Thunder now have three days to decide whether they will match the offer and retain Kanter, or let him go to Portland.\n\nKanter averaged 18.7 points and 11.0 rebounds per game after the Thunder acquired him from Utah last season. He will be entering his fifth year in the league.\n\nThe Blazers have the cap space to make the massive offer after losing All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nSuns, Teletovic reach 1-year deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says the Phoenix Suns have reached a one-year, $5.5 million contract with forward Mirza Teletovic.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract has yet to be signed.\n\nThe acquisition of Teletovic is the latest in a series of moves by the Suns to try to bolster their outside shooting. The 6-foot-9 power forward shot 39% from 3-point range for Brooklyn in 2013-14. It dropped to 32% last season, which was cut short by blood clots in his lungs.\n\nTeletovic tweeted a photo of himself in a Suns uniform Thursday, shortly after the Nets reportedly withdrew a qualifying offer of one year for $4.2 million.\n\nBrazilian point guard goes to Utah\n\nThe Utah Jazz have signed point guard Raul Neto to a multi-year contract.\n\nThe team announced the deal Thursday.\n\nThe Brazilian was selected in the second round of the 2013 draft by the Atlanta Hawks. The Jazz traded the Brooklyn Nets' 2015 second-round pick for Neto during that draft.\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 172-pounder averaged 8.9 points, 3.9 assists, 2.1 rebounds and 1.2 steals for Universidad Catolica De Murica of the Liga ACP in Spain last season. He was on the Brazil national team that played in the 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2012 Olympics.\n\nThe Jazz now have four point guards on the roster — Dante Exum, Trey Burke, Bryce Cotton and Neto. It's unlikely all four will be on the roster when the season begins.\n\nLeBron signs up for two more years with Cavs\n\nTwo people familiar with the negotiations say LeBron James has agreed to a one-year, $23 million contract with the Cavaliers for next season. The deal includes a player option for 2016-17.\n\nThe people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday because the contract has not been signed. James has informed the team he will return.\n\nThe agreement is not a surprise since James has said he intends to finish his career with Cleveland. He re-signed as a free agent with the Cavaliers last summer after four years in Miami.\n\nThe 30-year-old James led the Cavs to the NBA Finals in his first season back. Cleveland lost in six games to Golden State. James was forced to carry the load after All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving injured his knee in Game 1. Forward Kevin Love was injured earlier in the postseason and missed the finals.\n\nJordan spurns Mavericks for Clippers\n\nDeAndre Jordan has backed out of a verbal agreement to join the Dallas Mavericks and chosen to remain with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nJordan made the switch after a face-to-face meeting at his Houston home with a contingent of Clippers, including Blake Griffin and Paul Pierce, two people with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nThe Clippers announced Jordan's retention late Wednesday and also tweeted \"WE'RE OFFICIALLY CENTERED.\"\n\nIt was a surprising reversal for Jordan, the defensive pillar who agreed to a four-year, $80-million deal with the Mavericks last week. The Clippers can offer a fifth year on a max contract at more than $100 million.\n\nHornets sign free agent point guard Jeremy Lin\n\nCharlotte Hornets signed free agent point guard Jeremy Lin on Thursday in hopes of improving a sagging offense.\n\nTerms of the deal were not released.\n\nThe 6-foot-3 Lin has played in 291 NBA games for the Warriors, Knicks, Rockets and Lakers in five seasons, averaging 11.7 points, 4.8 assists, 2.6 rebounds and 1.3 steals in 26.9 minutes.\n\nThe 26-year-old Lin is expected to backup Kemba Walker in Charlotte and run the second-team offense.\n\nHe's the latest offseason addition as general manager Rich Cho looks to upgrade an offense that finished in the bottom five in the league in almost every major offensive statistical category last season. The team previously acquired Nicolas Batum, Jeremy Lamb and Spencer Hawes in trades and drafted Wisconsin's Frank Kaminsky.\n\nGerald Green agrees to 1-year deal with Heat\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations says shooting guard Gerald Green has agreed a one-year deal to join the Miami Heat.\n\nThe person says Green will sign for $1.4 million. The person spoke to The Associated Press Thursday on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized. It's not expected to be signed before Friday.\n\nGreen spent the past two seasons in Phoenix, and his move to Miami will reunite him with newly resigned Heat point guard Goran Dragic. Green has averaged 10.2 points in 428 regular-season games with the Suns, Boston, Minnesota, Houston, New Jersey and Indiana, mostly coming off the bench.\n\nGreen has made 341 shots from 3-point range over the last two seasons, the ninth-most in the NBA during that span.\n\nRaptors sign Carroll, Joseph, Scola\n\nToronto signed forward DeMarre Carroll on Thursday, a week after the forward originally announced his deal with the Raptors on Twitter.\n\nThe team held a news conference for the 28-year-old Carroll, who agreed to a four-year deal worth $60 million.\n\nCarroll, who averaged 12.6 points and 5.3 rebounds in 70 games for the Atlanta Hawks last season, was touted as one of the top players available at his position. Carroll had been a top free agent target of the Pistons.\n\nThe Raptors also signed Canadian guard Cory Joseph and Luis Scola and waived oft-traded guard Luke Ridnour on Thursday.\n\nJoseph, the Pickering, Ontario, native agreed to a four-year contract. The 23-year-old spent his first four NBA seasons with the San Antonio Spurs, helping them win the title in 2014.\n\nJoseph played in 79 games this past season with the Spurs, averaging 6.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists.\n\nSan Antonio selected Joseph 29th overall at the 2011 draft, out of Texas.\n\nLopez, Young stay with Nets, Robinson, Larkin join them\n\nBrook Lopez has been with the Nets his whole career and didn't want to look anywhere else. Thaddeus Young has been here just a few months and felt the same way.\n\nLopez and Young said Thursday they both quickly committed to re-sign with Brooklyn, wanting to stay together after they played well down the stretch in leading the Nets into the playoffs last season.\n\nLopez has been a Net for seven seasons, dating to their time in New Jersey. The 27-year-old center averaged 19.7 points and 9.2 rebounds after the All-Star break, which is about the time Young arrived in a trade from Minnesota.\n\nLopez and Young were joined at a Barclays Center news conference by newcomers Thomas Robinson and Shane Larkin. General manager Billy King said he called both players shortly after free agency opened on July 1 as he looked for youth and athleticism that the team sorely needs.\n\nLarkin played last season for the New York Knicks and could have a larger role if the Nets are able to trade either Deron Williams or Joe Johnson to trim their payroll. Robinson was nearly a Net last season, but the 76ers claimed him off waivers just before the Nets were able to sign him.\n\nClippers sign free agent forward Wes Johnson\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have signed free agent forward Wes Johnson, who played for the Lakers last season.\n\nHe averaged 9.9 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 76 games, including 59 starts for the other NBA team that plays in Staples Center.\n\nJohnson's five-year NBA career includes stints with Minnesota and Phoenix.\n\nThe Timberwolves drafted him with the fourth pick in the first round of the 2010 draft. He played two years at Iowa State before transferring to Syracuse, where he was the Big East player of the year in his lone season with the Orange.\n\nHawks finalize trade for Spurs' Splitter\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks have finalized their trade with San Antonio for Tiago Splitter to add depth to center and power forward.\n\nSplitter averaged 8.3 points, 5.3 rebounds in his first five NBA seasons with the Spurs.\n\nAtlanta sent the draft rights to Georgios Printezis and a future second-round pick to San Antonio.\n\nTo make room for Splitter, the Hawks requested waivers on former Pistons forward Austin Daye, who was signed to a multiyear contract in April.\n\nThe 6-foot-11, 245-pound Splitter is expected to back up center Al Horford (Grand Ledge) and forward Paul Millsap. He has two years remaining on his contract and will earn a total of $16.8 million.\n\nMagic sign Watson, send O'Quinn to Knicks in sign-and-trade\n\nOrlando Magic front office officials promised to be active in free agency this off-season and began the signing period Thursday by acquiring free agent veteran point guard C.J. Watson, and sending big man Kyle O'Quinn to the New York Knicks in a sign-and-trade\n\nTerms of the Watson deal were not released. But in the O'Quinn deal the Magic will receive cash and the option to swamp second-round draft picks with the Knicks in 2019.\n\nThe 31-year-old Watson, who will compete to serve as the primary backup to second-year guard Elfrid Payton, is entering his ninth NBA season. He spent the past two in Indiana and averaged 10 points and 3.6 assists in 57 appearances last season.\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press last week that restricted free agent forward Tobias Harris had agreed to sign a four-year, $64 million deal to remain in Orlando.

He will make just over $2.8 million this coming season.\n\nPrice agreed Wednesday to a one-year deal at the veteran's minimum of $1.5 million.\n\nVillanueva going back to Mavs\n\nCharlie Villanueva will return for a second season in Dallas after earning a reserve role as a 3-point threat and making the playoffs for the first time in his 10-year career.\n\nVillanueva announced his decision Tuesday on Twitter. He reportedly will get a one-year contract for the veteran minimum of $1.5 million after making the roster on a non-guaranteed deal out of training camp last season.\n\nThe 30-year-old Villanueva averaged 6.3 points and 2.3 rebounds in 64 games for the Mavericks, including one start. He was fourth on the team with 83 3-pointers.\n\nThe former top-10 pick started his career with a season in Toronto before spending three years with Milwaukee and five in Detroit. Villanueva's career averages are 10.9 points and 4.8 rebounds.\n\nFormer Spartan Anderson going to D.C.\n\nFree-agent shooting guard Alan Anderson has agreed to a $4 million, one-year contract with the Washington Wizards that should become official later this week.\n\nAnderson's agent, Mark Bartelstein, confirmed the terms of the deal on Tuesday.\n\nTeams cannot sign deals with free agents until Thursday.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Anderson played the past two years with the Brooklyn Nets, averaging 7.4 points and 2.8 rebounds last season.\n\nHe has spent a total of six seasons with three teams in the NBA, but also has played professionally overseas.\n\nAnderson, 32, represents the latest new face for a Wizards team that reached the second round of the playoffs last season.

ESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nLee injured his left hamstring in the final preseason game and his role diminished with the emergence of Michigan State alumnus Draymond Green, the runner-up for defensive player of the year. The NBA champion Warriors have been looking to trade Lee this summer to limit the team's luxury tax hit next season.\n\nLee is due about $15.4 million in the final year of his contract.\n\n2 more years for Garnett with Timberwolves\n\nKevin Garnett is returning for season No. 21.\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the discussions tells The Associated Press that Garnett has agreed to terms on a two-year contract to remain in Minnesota.

The person spoke Monday on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nThe 7-foot-1 Spaniard is coming off the best season of his seven-year NBA career, earning a starting spot in the NBA All-Star game. He also became the first Grizzlies' player voted to the All-NBA first team .\n\nGasol averaged 17.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.62 blocks this past season.\n\nThe contract cannot be signed until Thursday.\n\nWest takes chance to win with Spurs over more money\n\nDavid West is sacrificing millions to chase that elusive championship.\n\nA person with knowledge of the deal tells The Associated Press that the veteran forward is taking a one-year, minimum salary contract worth $1.4 million to join the San Antonio Spurs. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nWest walked away from a $12 million pay day with the Indiana Pacers to chase a title with the Spurs in his 13th NBA season.

He was traded to Minnesota by Charlotte in February.\n\nBy agreeing to a one-year deal with Washington, Neal gets a chance to increase his value with a strong season and return to the free-agent market.\n\nWade sticks with Heat\n\nAfter 12 years with the Miami Heat, Dwyane Wade needed a reminder of how much the franchise valued him.\n\nOnce he found out, any chance of him leaving vanished.\n\nWade accepted a $20-million, one-year deal on Thursday to stay with the Heat next season, ending his latest foray into free agency and wrapping up a weekslong saga that had him seriously wondering about leaving for the first time. A pair of conversations, first with Heat CEO Nick Arison and then another with managing general partner Micky Arison, reminded Wade of what he meant to the team and from there it was a matter of just making numbers work.\n\nPer NBA rules, the Heat could not comment other than saying that they intend to enter into a contract with Wade once the NBA moratorium period ends. Wade cannot sign his new deal until July 9.\n\nDuncan won't retire, still a Spur\n\nTim Duncan is returning to San Antonio for a 19th season.\n\nDuncan, 39, tells the San Antonio Express-News that \"I'll be on the court next year.\" Until Duncan made his announcement Thursday, there was speculation that he could call it a career after the Spurs lost to the Los Angeles Clippers in a thrilling seven-game series in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nMany expected him to return, particularly since he was coming off such a strong season. Duncan averaged 13.9 points, 3.0 assists and 2.0 blocks and earned third team All-NBA and second team All-Defense honors.\n\nDuncan turned 39 in April and accompanied the Spurs on a recruiting trip for star free agent LaMarcus Aldridge on Wednesday.\n\nThe Spurs are still waiting to hear if Manu Ginobili, another member of the franchise's Big Three with Duncan and Tony Parker, will return next season.\n\nInjured Wes Matthews agrees to sign with Dallas\n\nFree agent guard Wesley Matthews and the Mavericks have agreed on a four-year deal.\n\nA person with knowledge of the deal says Matthews and the Mavericks reached an agreement in principle late Thursday night and will wait on the decision from Jordan, who is apparently choosing between the Mavericks and his original team, the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nMatthews is coming off a ruptured left Achilles tendon sustained in a game against the Mavericks in March. It is unclear if he will be ready to start the season, but the Mavericks targeted him from the beginning of free agency as a potential replacement at shooting guard for Monta Ellis.\n\nMatthews turned down a $64-million, four-year offer from Sacramento.\n\nDudley to Wizards in trade\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations tells the Associated Press that the Washington Wizards are close to acquiring forward Jared Dudley from the Milwaukee Bucks for a future second-round draft pick.\n\nEarlier this week, Dudley decided to exercise his player option for a $4.25-million contract with Milwaukee next season, rather than become a free agent.\n\nThe veteran forward averaged 7.2 points and 3.1 rebounds and made 38.5% of his three-point attempts in 72 games with the Bucks last season.\n\nBlazers reach 5-year max extension with Lilliard\n\nWhen Damian Lillard agreed to a new maximum contract extension with the Trail Blazers on Thursday, it may have been the beginning of a changing of the guard in Portland.\n\nLillard agreed to terms on a five-year contract worth more than $120 million, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told the Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nThe full value of the contract could wind up ranging between $125 million and $129 million and won't be determined until the salary cap is established. That makes it the richest contract in league history for a guard.\n\nEx-Piston Afflalo goes to N.Y.\n\nArron Afflalo is about to team up with Carmelo Anthony again.\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations tells the Associated Press that Afflalo, a former Detroit Pistons guard, has accepted a two-year, $16-million offer from the New York Knicks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no NBA deals can be completed before July 9.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nA shooting guard, Afflalo spent parts of two seasons as Anthony's teammate in Denver. Afflalo also has spent time with Detroit, Orlando and Portland, averaging 11.4 points per game in his first eight NBA seasons.\n\nThe Knicks are coming off of a 17-65 season, the second-worst record in the NBA. Anthony played in only 40 games because of left knee problems.\n\nPelicans, Asik agree on 5-year contract\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations says the New Orleans Pelicans and center Omer Asik have agreed on a five-year contract worth a minimum of $44 million and rising up to $58 million if incentives and benchmarks are met.\n\nThe team will have the option of voiding the final year of the deal.\n\nThe 7-foot Asik, who turns 29 on Saturday, started 76 games and averaged 7.3 points and 9.8 rebounds this season, his first with New Orleans following a trade from Houston.\n\nAsik now returns to a Pelicans front court that feature's All-Star forward Anthony Davis (more below).\n\nThe Pistons were expected to have some interest in Asik.\n\nPacers give Monta Ellis 4 years, $44 million\n\nMonta Ellis has found a new home in Indiana.\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Ellis has agreed to terms with the Pacers on a four-year deal worth $44 million. The deal includes a player option for the final year. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced. The contract cannot be signed until July 9.\n\nEllis averaged 18.9 points and 4.1 assists in his second season with the Dallas Mavericks last year.\n\nEllis only shot 28.5% on three-pointers last year, but his ability to score will help the Pacers, who ranked 24th in scoring last season.\n\nPaul Pierce headed to Clippers\n\nPaul Pierce and Doc Rivers are reuniting.\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations tells The Associated Press that Pierce has agreed to a three-year, $10 million deal to join the Los Angeles Clippers. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because no contracts can be finalized until July 9.\n\nPierce spent this past season with the Washington Wizards, and they wanted him back for a second year. But the lure of going back to Southern California — he went to high school in a Los Angeles suburb — and playing for Rivers again was apparently too strong to ignore.\n\nNext season will be Pierce's 18th, the first 15 with Boston. Rivers coached him for nine of those Boston seasons, and they helped the Celtics win the 2008 NBA title.\n\nAgent: Ed Davis agrees to 3-year, $20M deal with Blazers\n\nEd Davis is leaving Los Angeles for the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nDavis' agent, David Bauman, says his client has agreed to a three-year, $20-million contract to join the Blazers. He averaged 8.3 points and 7.6 rebounds in his first season with the Lakers last year.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding free agent power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, the Blazers grabbed the athletic and versatile Davis to add to a roster in flux. If Aldridge does return, Davis would be a valuable role player off the bench.\n\nIf Aldridge chooses to move elsewhere, Davis could slide into the starting lineup for a role that he has been craving since breaking into the league with Toronto in 2010.\n\nDavis cannot sign his contract until July 9, per league rules.\n\nGrizzlies agree to terms with Brandan Wright\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have agreed to terms with free-agent forward Brandan Wright, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity Wednesday because the deal hasn't been formally announced. Yahoo Sports first reported the deal.\n\nWith teams across the NBA spending or offering huge sums of money on the opening day of free agency, the Grizzlies' deal with Wright looks like a potential bargain. The Grizzlies used their full mid-level exception - three years and about $18 million - to land the 6-foot-10 forward.\n\nThe 27-year-old averaged 7.3 points and 4.3 rebounds this season while spending time with the Dallas Mavericks, Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns. The former lottery pick from North Carolina also has played for the Golden State Warriors and New Jersey Nets since beginning his NBA career in 2007.\n\nCeltics, Amir Johnson agree to $24-million deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says the Boston Celtics have landed Amir Johnson with a two-year deal worth $24 million.\n\nThe veteran power forward and former Piston agreed to leave Toronto and stay within the Atlantic Division on Wednesday.\n\nJohnson averaged 9.3 points and 6.1 rebounds for the Atlantic champions last season, his sixth in Toronto. The 6-foot-9 Johnson began his career in Detroit, where he was a second-round pick in 2005.\n\nHe can now look for minutes in a Boston forward-center rotation that includes Brandon Bass, Jared Sullinger, Kelly Olynyk and Tyler Zeller.\n\nBucks give Middleton 5 years, $70 million\n\nKhris Middleton was a little-known second-round draft pick when he broke into the NBA with the Detroit Pistons in 2012.\n\nThree years later, the versatile forward has become an integral part of a Milwaukee Bucks team on the rise in the Eastern Conference.\n\nMiddleton has agreed to terms on a five-year contract worth $70 million, a person with direct knowledge of the agreement told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nMiddleton played in 27 games as a rookie with the Pistons in 2012-13 and was almost an afterthought when he was packaged with Brandon Knight and sent to the Bucks for point guard Brandon Jennings in Middleton's second season. His scoring average rose from 6.1 points as a rookie to 12.1 in his second year, but his breakout season came in Year 3.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Middleton emerged as an essential two-way forward, teaming with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Michael Carter-Williams and a herd of young Bucks that range from 6-6 to 6-11 and give coach Jason Kidd a versatile core capable of locking down on defense.\n\nMiddleton averaged 13.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and shot better than 40% from three-point range last year to cement himself as a major part of the team's plans. So with the salary cap set to skyrocket next season when the new television contracts kick in, the Bucks wasted little time in locking up a deal with one of their young building blocks.\n\nSuns keep Brandon Knight, nab Tyson Chandler\n\nThe Phoenix Suns took care of their top off-season priority by bringing back former Pistons guard Brandon Knight and added veteran frontcourt leadership in the form of Tyson Chandler.\n\nKnight agreed to a five-year, $70 million deal, people with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nChandler agreed to a three-year, $52-million deal, the people said on condition of anonymity because the deals can't be finalized until July 9.\n\nDunleavy, Butler staying with Bulls\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations told AP that Mike Dunleavy and the Chicago Bulls have agreed on a new three-year, $14 million contract.\n\nThe person confirmed the deal Wednesday to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no contracts can be signed until July 9. Yahoo Sports first reported the agreement, and Dunleavy later confirmed it to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nDunleavy was expected to get interest from several other clubs, including Cleveland.\n\nHe turns 35 in September, and averaged 9.4 points in 63 games — all starts — and shot 41 percent from 3-point range last season. In the playoffs, he averaged 10.9 points and shot 48 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nThe No. 3 pick in the 2002 draft has averaged 11.7 points in 902 career games.\n\nMeanwhile, a person familiar with the situation tells the Associated Press that All-Star guard Jimmy Butler and the Bulls have agreed to a five-year contract that could be worth about $90 million. Butler also holds an option for the fifth year.\n\nThe deal comes on the heels of a breakout season in which Butler made his first All-Star team and was selected the NBA's Most Improved Player.\n\nGreen stays with Warriors\n\nNo need to seek out an offer sheet in restricted free agency. Draymond Green is coming back to the Golden State Warriors on his own terms.\n\nThe Saginaw native and Michigan State alum announced on Bleacher Report's Uninterrupted website Wednesday night he has agreed to a five-year deal with the Warriors. A person with knowledge of the agreement told the Associated Press the contract is worth about $85 million.\n\nWarriors general manager Bob Myers confirmed in a statement that the team intends to re-sign Green when the NBA's moratorium on free agency ends July 9.\n\nGreen was a restricted free agent, meaning the NBA champion Warriors could match any offer he received. But Golden State always expected to pay whatever salary he commanded, even if that meant dipping into the league's luxury tax, which it will almost surely do now.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons had been interested in Green but didn't believe that the Warriors would let him go.\n\nSpurs keeping Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green\n\nKawhi Leonard is going to be a fixture for the San Antonio Spurs for years to come.\n\nLeonard agreed to the basic parameters of a five-year contract to stay with the Spurs early Wednesday, a deal that could be worth $90 million according to a person with direct knowledge of the agreement. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contract cannot be finalized until July 9, per NBA rules.\n\nKeeping Leonard, the 2014 NBA Finals MVP, is the first of many things the Spurs hope to accomplish in the coming days. Leonard will sit in when the Spurs meet with free agent LaMarcus Aldridge on Wednesday, part of the group that will make a sales pitch to one of the most coveted members in this year's class.\n\nLeonard averaged 16.5 points this past season for the Spurs, and followed that up by averaging 20.3 points in San Antonio's seven-game loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. His scoring average — and his role — has grown each year with the Spurs, who still hope to have their core of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili together for at least one more season.\n\nDanny Green isn't going anywhere, either.\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Green has agreed to terms with the San Antonio Spurs on a four-year contract worth $45 million. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been officially announced. Per league rules, it cannot be signed until July 9.\n\nGreen was one of the most coveted shooters on the market. And the Spurs' pursuit of free agent power forward LaMarcus Aldridge led some to believe that they would have to let Green leave for a big money deal with another team.\n\nBut after agreeing to a max contract extension with Kawhi Leonard, the Spurs locked down Green, who is also one of the best perimeter defenders in the league.\n\nGreen had been one of the top free agent targets of the Pistons.\n\nStauskas part of Kings-76ers trade\n\nThe Sacramento Kings have agreed to send Nik Stauskas (Michigan), Jason Thompson and Carl Landry to the Philadelphia 76ers as part of a salary-shedding move to pursue free agents, a person with knowledge of the trade told the Associated Press on Wednesday night.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear who the Kings were receiving in return or whether draft picks were involved.\n\nStauskas thanked the Kings and their fans on his Twitter page and wrote that he was excited to start a new chapter of his career in Philadelphia. He struggled after being drafted by the Kings eighth overall last year, but it was a difficult season for any rookie as the team fired two coaches and had a front-office shakeup.\n\nThompson just completed his seventh season and was Sacramento's longest-tenured player, having appeared in a franchise-record 541 games. Landry, an eight-year veteran, has battled injuries since coming to Sacramento two years ago.\n\nThe move clears more than $16 million in salary cap space for the Kings next season. Sacramento has been pursuing free agent guards Rajon Rondo, Wesley Matthews and Monta Ellis, among others, to join DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay. Now the Kings have space to add possibly two of those players.\n\nIman Shumpert staying in Cleveland\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Iman Shumpert has agreed to terms on a four-year, $40 million contract that will keep him in Cleveland.\n\nShumpert and the Cavaliers came to agreement on Wednesday evening. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced. A contract cannot be signed until July 9.\n\nShumpert came to the Cavaliers with J.R. Smith in a trade midseason with the New York Knicks. Shumpert's perimeter defense helped LeBron James take an injury plagued team to the NBA Finals.\n\nShumpert averaged 7.2 points and 3.8 rebounds in 38 games with the Cavaliers in the regular season.\n\nShumpert's signing comes after the Cavs gave Kevin Love a five-year, $110 million deal and Tristan Thompson a five-year, $80 million contract.\n\nKevin Love pens piece saying he's staying in Cleveland\n\nAfter all the speculation and intrigue surrounding Kevin Love's foray into the free agent market, the star power forward ended up right where he said he would all along — in Cleveland.\n\nLove announced in The Players Tribune on Wednesday that after his uneven first season ended with a serious shoulder injury, he is coming back to help LeBron James finish what they started together last season.\n\n\"We're all on the same page and we're all in,\" Love wrote. \"We have unfinished business and now it's time to get back to work.\"\n\nLove agreed to terms on a maximum contract of five years that could be worth more than $110 million, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details have not been released. No NBA contract can be signed until July 9.\n\nLove opted out of the final year of his existing contract to hit the open market, a financially motivated decision aimed at getting more security after suffering some significant injuries over the last few years.\n\nHawks reach agreement to re-sign Paul Millsap\n\nPaul Millsap became an All-Star in his first two years with Atlanta and helped lead the Hawks to their first Eastern Conference finals.\n\nHe's back for at least two more years on a new contract which doubles his annual pay.\n\nThe Hawks have reached an agreement to re-sign Millsap, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The person requested anonymity because the deal can't be finalized until July 9.\n\nThe person said the agreement is a two-year deal with a player option for a third year that makes the contract worth $58.9 million.\n\nMillsap, who came to Atlanta from Utah on a two-year, $19 million deal, will make $38 million in the first two years of his new contract.\n\nDragic, Heat agree on $90M deal\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations told the Associated Press that Goran Dragic has agreed to a five-year contract worth about $90 million with the Miami Heat.\n\nThe person says the deal includes a player option for Dragic to return to free agency a year earlier if he so chooses. The person spoke to The Associated Press Wednesday on condition of anonymity because the deal cannot be finalized until July 9 per NBA rules.\n\nIt was long assumed the Heat would keep the 29-year-old Dragic, especially after giving up two future first-round selections to land the point guard in a deal with Phoenix this past season.\n\nDragic averaged 16.6 points on 50 percent shooting in 26 games with the Heat. Between Miami and Phoenix, he averaged 16.3 points in 78 games.\n\nTrail Blazers agree with forward Aminu\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that the Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to terms with veteran forward Al-Farouq Aminu on a four-year, $30 million deal.\n\nThe Blazers and Aminu quickly reached accord on Tuesday night, shortly after free agency opened. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced.\n\nAminu joins a revamped Blazers team that has already traded Nicolas Batum and is in a fight to retain star forward LaMarcus Aldridge.\n\nAminu averaged 5.6 points and 4.6 rebounds in 74 games for the Dallas Mavericks last season. He has never scored 20 points in a game in his five-year career. But he gives the Blazers a versatile defender to a team that ranked in the bottom third in points allowed and field goal percentage defense.\n\nAgent: Pelicans, center Alexis Ajinca agree on 4-year deal\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans and 7-foot center Alexis Ajinca have agreed on a four-year, $20.2-million extension.\n\nThe 27-year-old Ajinca's new contract was confirmed by his agent, Mark Bartelstein, in an email to the Associated Press.\n\nAjinca, who is French, was used last season primarily as a reserve. But when he received more minutes, he usually produced.\n\nHe reached double figures in scoring and rebounding on several occasions, pouring in as many as 24 points in a victory over Miami last season and grabbing as many as 14 rebounds in a loss at Philadelphia.\n\nAjinca has been in the NBA for parts of five seasons, including all of the past two with New Orleans. He appeared in 68 games last season, starting eight, and averaged 6.5 points and 4.6 rebounds.\n\nMeanwhile, a person with knowledge of the details says All-Star power forward Anthony Davis and the Pelicans have agreed on a five-year extension worth more than $140 million.\n\nDavis tweeted: \"NOLA, I am here to stay! Just getting started\" shortly after free agency opened late Tuesday night, and the person confirmed the agreement to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal cannot yet be signed.\n\nThe 22-year-old Davis is entering the final season of a four-year contract he signed after being drafted first overall out of Kentucky in 2012. He had until Oct. 31 to accept the offer or could have become a restricted free agent next off-season.\n\nDavis averaged 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds and 2.9 blocks this season. The exact value of his extension can't be determined until the salary cap has been set next week.\n\nMore deals to come as they take place.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2017/07/01/nba-free-agency-tracker/426705001/", "title": "NBA free agency tracker: Derrick Rose agrees to join Cavaliers", "text": "Detroit Free Press Staff Reports and News Services\n\nWe'll keep updating this story as players across the NBA sign this month.\n\nA person familiar with the decision says free agent Derrick Rose has agreed to sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nRose, a former league MVP who has struggled with knee injuries, will get a one-year contract at the veteran’s minimum of $2.1 million, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team has not announce the agreement.\n\nRose played for the New York Knicks last season and averaged 18 points and 4.4 assists. The 28-year-old Rose’s role with the Cavs is still to be determined. He could be used as a backup or start depending on what the team does with All-Star Kyrie Irving, who recently asked for a trade.\n\nRose drew interest from other teams. He met with Cleveland’s front office on Monday, when the team promoted Koby Altman to be their full-time general manger after he served as the interim GM since mid-June.\n\nGasol stays with Spurs after all\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Pau Gasol has agreed to terms on a three-year contract with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe 7-foot Spaniard and the Spurs came to agreement on a deal that is partially guaranteed for the third season.\n\nGasol declined the $16 million option on his contract in June the intent of signing a longer-term deal with the Spurs. The Spurs re-signed Patty Mills and added free agents Rudy Gay and Brandon Paul.\n\nGasol averaged 12.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 25.4 minutes per game for the Spurs last season.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\n• Live: Pistons, NBA free agency rumor mill\n\nMore:Stan Van Gundy gambles by swapping Avery Bradley for KCP\n\nHaslem stays with Heat one more year\n\nUdonis Haslem believes he can still play, and the Miami Heat apparently agree.\n\nThe three-time NBA champion has signed a one-year, $2.3 million deal to remain with the Heat for what will be his 15th season. Haslem was already the longest-tenured player in Heat history, with all of his NBA seasons coming for his hometown team.\n\nAmong active players, only Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili have spent the entirety of a career spanning at least 15 years with one franchise.\n\n“It is a great, great, day to have Udonis Haslem sign a contract for his 15th season with the Miami Heat,” team president Pat Riley said Thursday, when the contract was announced. “He isn’t just Mr. 305, he is a true patriarch of the team. Today we are proud to announce that he is back to lead the Heat again.”\n\nHaslem and Dwyane Wade are the only players who were on all three Heat championship teams, 2006, 2012 and 2013. Haslem is extremely popular with the Miami fan base, and 150 children attending a Heat summer basketball camp erupted into cheers when it was announced there Thursday that he had re-signed.\n\nHaslem is Miami’s career leader in rebounds with 5,701, and has appeared in 830 regular-season games — 25 shy of Wade’s record. He’s also seventh on the Heat scoring list.\n\nRondo joins Pelicans\n\nRajon Rondo, who spent last year dipping in and out of the Chicago Bulls' rotations, has agreed on a one-year deal with the New Orleans Pelicans, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nRondo, an 11-year vet, had a tumultuous run with the Bulls last season before suffering a fractured thumb in their first round postseason matchup against the Boston Celtics. It was largely Rondo who helped engineer a 2-0 lead before the injury occurred.\n\nRondo fell completely out of the Bulls' rotation last season for a stretch of five games in January before coach Fred Hoiberg came to rely on him as a veteran presence. Rondo was routinely praised by his teammates for mentoring the team's younger players.\n\nRondo averaged 7.8 points and 6.7 assists last year with the Bulls, marks that were significantly lower than his career averages of 10.7 points and 8.5 assists.\n\nThe 31-year-old will back up incumbent starter Jrue Holiday, who recently agreed to a 5-year, $126 million dollar deal to stay in New Orleans.\n\nEx-Spurs wing Simmons to join Magic\n\nThe Orlando Magic and 27-year-old shooting guard Jonathon Simmons have agreed to a three-year deal, a person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed to USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick.\n\nThe Spurs renounced their rights to Simmons — a former D-League player who reportedly once paid $150 to try out for the Austin Toros — making him an unrestricted free agent.\n\nSimmons — who made a name for himself with some big performances for the San Antonio Spurs in the 2017 playoffs, including a 22-point outing in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals against the Golden State Warriors — averaged 6.1 points on 45.1% shooting in his two seasons with the Spurs.\n\nWizards match Nets offer for Porter\n\nThe Washington Wizards have matched the Brooklyn Nets’ $106 million, four-year offer sheet to keep forward Otto Porter.\n\nUnder NBA rules, the Wizards had two days to match Brooklyn’s offer sheet for the 24-year-old restricted free agent.\n\nPorter becomes Washington’s highest-paid player for the time being, ahead of guards Bradley Beal and John Wall. He set career highs with 13.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.5 steals and shooting and 3-point percentages of .516 and .434 last season, his fourth as a professional.\n\nThe Wizards drafted Porter third overall in 2013 out of Georgetown. Grunfeld said Porter, who has averaged 9.3 points a game in his career, has developed into a vital part of the team’s young core.\n\nJazz add ex-Piston Jerebko, ex-Wolverine Udoh\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the deals says the Utah Jazz have reached agreements to sign free agents Thabo Sefolosha, Jonas Jerebko and Ekpe Udoh. The Jazz also released Boris Diaw, whose 2017-18 salary would have been guaranteed Saturday.\n\nSefolosha heads to Utah after three seasons with the Atlanta Hawks. The 2006 No. 13 overall pick averaged 7.2 points, 4.4 rebounds and shot 34.2% from three-point range last season.\n\nJerebko spent the last two seasons with the Celtics and averaged 3.8 points and 3.5 rebounds last year. He was drafted by the Pistons in 2009.\n\nUdoh spent the last two seasons in Turkey, where he won a Euroleague championship with Fenerbahce. Udoh was the No. 6 overall NBA pick in 2010 out of Baylor, though he started his collegiate career at Michigan.\n\nKCP bets on himself with Lakers\n\nFree-agent guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope reached an agreement on a one-year, $18 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nCaldwell-Pope, who became an unrestricted free agent when the Pistons pulled his qualifying offer, played well this season until receiving a vicious pick from Golden State Warriors center Zaza Pachulia, which caused Caldwell-Pope to miss four games with a shoulder injury.\n\nHe averaged 13.8 points per game in 2016-17.\n\nThe Pistons took him with the eighth pick in the 2013 NBA draft.\n\nPistons relieve financial pressure by adding Bradley, shedding KCP\n\nEx-Piston Baynes goes to Boston\n\nThe Vertical's Shams Charania reports that former Detroit Pistons center Aron Baynes has reached an agreement with the Boston Celtics on a one-year, $4.3-million deal.\n\nBaynes had opted out of his $6.5 million deal with the Pistons in June.\n\nHe averaged 5.6 points and 4.6 rebounds in 156 games over two seasons with the Pistons.\n\nRaps send Carroll to Nets, get Miles from Indy\n\nThree people with knowledge of the dealings tell The Associated Press that the Toronto Raptors have made two trades, sending DeMarre Carroll to Brooklyn for salary cap relief and landing C.J. Miles in a sign-and-trade with Indiana for Cory Joseph.\n\nThe Raptors agreed to the Carroll deal late Saturday night, then quickly moved to fill his spot as a shooter and wing defender with Miles.\n\nCarroll has two years and $30 million left on his deal, and the cap-strapped Raptors will save millions in tax penalties by making the move. They sent future first- and second-round picks to Brooklyn and also received Justin Hamilton.\n\nMiles agreed to terms on a three-year, $25 million deal with Toronto.\n\nESPN first reported the trades.\n\nEx-Wolverine Tim Hardaway Jr. returning to Knicks\n\nThe New York Knicks have signed free-agent guard Tim Hardaway Jr. to a four-year, $71 million contract.\n\nThe team announced the deal Saturday.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 Hardaway returned to the Knicks after two seasons with the Atlanta Hawks. Last season, he had career highs in scoring (14.5), assists (2.3), rebounds (2.8), minutes (27.3) and field-goal percentage (.455). He has career averages of 11.0 points and 23.4 minutes.\n\nHis father, five-time All-Star Tim Hardaway, is an assistant coach for Detroit.\n\nHarden earns richest contract in NBA history\n\nThe Houston Rockets have signed star guard James Harden to a four-year, $228 million contract extension, the richest contract in NBA history.\n\nThe Rockets said Saturday the extension will run through 2022-23 season but will not kick in until 2019. That means it will not affect their salary cap this season, so the Rockets are free to continue their roster upgrade. They added Chris Paul earlier this summer.\n\nRockets owner Leslie Alexander says Harden’s “incredible work ethic, desire to win, and passion to be the best” make him “the perfect leader in our pursuit of another championship.” Harden says “Houston is home for me.”\n\nHe averaged 29.1 points and led the NBA with 11.2 assists last season.\n\nEx-Wolverine Jamal Crawford goes to Minnesota\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Jamal Crawford has agreed to terms on a two-year deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe cap-strapped Wolves only had the room exception left to use for the deal, worth about $4.2 million for the upcoming season.\n\nThe 37-year-old Crawford, who played just one year at Michigan, averaged 12.3 points in 82 games for the Clippers last season. He was traded to Atlanta to help make room for Danilo Gallinari and reached a buyout agreement with the Hawks.\n\nCrawford gives the Timberwolves a much-needed scorer off of the bench. It continues an aggressive summer that has also seen the additions of Jimmy Butler, Jeff Teague and Taj Gibson.\n\nWarriors retain Zaza\n\nCenter Zaza Pachulia has agreed to a $3.5 million, one-year contract to stay with the NBA champion Golden State Warriors, his agent, Mark Bartelstein, said Friday.\n\nGolden State’s starter in a three-center rotation last season, the 33-year-old Pachulia averaged 5.1 points and 3.8 rebounds in 14.1 minutes during the postseason, and scored in double digits four times.\n\nPachulia played for $2.9 million last season, willing to take a lower salary to be part of a team that would chase a championship — and he wound up with his first ring after 14 NBA seasons.\n\nCavs add Jeff Green\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations says the Cleveland Cavaliers have agreed to terms on a one-year, $2.3 million contract with free agent forward Jeff Green.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 Green averaged 9.2 points and 3.1 rebounds for the Orlando Magic last season. He previously played for Oklahoma City, Boston, Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nGreen will turn 31 in August.\n\nHe has averaged 13.5 points and 4.7 rebounds during his career. Green has appeared in 38 postseason games, most recently with the Clippers in 2015-16.\n\nEvans goes to Memphis\n\nGuard Tyreke Evans agreed to a one-year deal with Memphis.\n\nEvans played 40 games between the Pelicans and Kings in 2016-17, averaging 10.3 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists.\n\nThe fourth overall pick by the Kings in the 2009 draft, Evans has played in 473 games and averaged 16.1 points, 4.8 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 1.3 steals in 32.2 minutes over his eight-year career with the Kings and Pelicans.\n\nPacers add Collison to backcourt\n\nThe Indiana Pacers have signed free agent Darren Collison.\n\nTerms of the deal were not released Friday amid reports it is a two-year contract worth $20 million.\n\nThe point guard returns to a team he played for from 2010-12. Collison averaged 11.9 points and 5.0 in 139 games during his first stint with the Pacers.\n\nSince being taken with 21st overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, Collison has career averages of 12.7 points and 4.8 assists.\n\nHe joins a backcourt that will be led by Victor Oladipo and Lance Stephenson The Pacers are rebuilding after trading four-time All-Star Paul George to Oklahoma City and losing point guard Jeff Teague in free agency.\n\nIndiana also waived forward Rakeem Christmas.\n\nBogdanovic leaves Wizards for Pacers\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says the Washington Wizards have renounced the rights to free agent Bojan Bogdanovic so he could agree to a two-year, $21 million deal with the Pacers.\n\nHe could contribute immediately now after four-time All-Star Paul George was traded from Indiana to Oklahoma City.\n\nBogdanovic averaged 13.7 points in 81 games between Brooklyn and Washington last season.\n\nClippers acquire Gallinari in three-team trade\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers acquired sharp-shooting forward Danilo Gallinari from Denver as part of a three-team trade that also involved Atlanta.\n\nIn the swap, Los Angeles sent Jamal Crawford, Diamond Stone, cash considerations and a protected 2018 first-round pick to the Hawks. The Nuggets receive a 2019 second-round pick from Atlanta.\n\nThe 28-year-old Gallinari was selected by New York with the sixth overall pick in 2008. He wound up in Denver as part of the blockbuster deal in February 2011 that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Knicks.\n\nA fan favorite, Gallinari averaged 16.2 points and made 535 3-pointers for the Nuggets. He missed the 2013-14 season because of a torn left ACL.\n\nCrawford played for the Hawks from 2009-11. He’s captured the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award three times.\n\nThe 20-year-old Stone was acquired by the Clippers during a 2016 draft-night trade with New Orleans. He played in seven games for Los Angeles last season.\n\nGay joining Spurs\n\nVeteran free agent Rudy Gay agreed to a 2-year, $17 million deal with the San Antonio Spurs, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal wasn't announced publicly yet.\n\nThere's a player option on the second year of the deal.\n\nGay suffered a torn Achilles in January with the Sacramento Kings after averaging 18.7 points and 6.3 rebounds in 30 games. He opted out of a $14.3 million deal to stay with the Kings and test his value on the market.\n\nThough he leaves money on the table, the veteran swing man is now on a viable contender.\n\nUpon agreeing to the deal, he posted a picture of a Spurs jersey on social media.\n\nMiami deals McRoberts to Dallas\n\nThe Miami Heat have traded oft-injured forward Josh McRoberts to the Dallas Mavericks for center A.J. Hammons and a 2023 second-round draft pick.\n\nThe move frees much-needed salary cap space for Miami, which owed McRoberts just over $6 million for next season. McRoberts was limited to 81 games with the Heat in the last three seasons.\n\nHammons is set to make $1.3 million.\n\nBoth players got to the NBA out of Carmel High in Carmel, Indiana. McRoberts graduated from Carmel; Hammons left there and transferred to Oak Hill in Virginia for his junior and senior seasons.\n\nDirk and Dallas remain a match\n\nDirk Nowitzki has a deal with the Dallas Mavericks that sets him up to join Kobe Bryant as the only players to spend 20 seasons with one NBA franchise.\n\nNowitzki signed a two-year, $10 million contract that carries a team option in the second season. A person with knowledge of the deal contract provided specifics on condition of anonymity because the team didn't release the terms.\n\nThe agreement is similar to the one the Mavs and Nowitzki reached last year, although for significantly less money. Last year's contract was for two years and $50 million, and the club declined its option before free agency opened this year.\n\nThe 39-year-old Nowitzki is no longer the primary option for the Mavericks, so a $5 million deal is more in line with his role on a roster that has become significantly younger since the start of last season. The $25 million salary from a year ago was as much about Dallas paying Nowitzki for his loyalty, which included taking less money to help acquire free agents through the years.\n\nNowitzki was second to Harrison Barnes in scoring last season at 14.2 points per game.\n\nJohnson sticking with Heat\n\nJames Johnson is back with the Miami Heat, and has cashed in after a breakout season.\n\nJohnson agreed to terms on a four-year deal that could be worth more than $60 million, a person with knowledge of the talks told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it hasn't been formally announced.\n\nJohnson had said for months that he wanted to remain in Miami — and based on that salary, the Heat clearly had no desire to let him go elsewhere.\n\nJohnson revived his career in Miami last season, averaging 12.8 points — his best, by far, in his eight NBA years. He shed 40 pounds and finished sixth in the league's Most Improved Player voting. He made $4 million last season, which was the best salary of his career.\n\nVince Carter off to Sacramento\n\nForty-year-old Vince Carter has agreed to a one-year deal with the Sacramento Kings that will pay him $8 million, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick.\n\nThe Kings will be the seventh team for Carter in 19 seasons. He has spent the past three seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nWith the Grizzlies last season, Carter averaged eight points and three rebounds and shot 40% from the floor. Against the San Antonio Spurs in Game 4 of the first round of the playoffs, Carter became the first 40-year old to hit at least three 3-pointers in a playoff game. He finished the game with 13 points\n\nFor his career, Carter is averaging 18.2 points per game and shooting 44% from the floor.\n\nKelly Olynyk is going to Miami\n\nKelly Olynyk has agreed to sign with the Miami Heat.\n\nAgent Greg Lawrence confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press, after ESPN first reported it would be a four-year deal worth in excess of $50 million.\n\nA 7-foot center with three-point range, Olynyk spent his first four NBA seasons with the Boston Celtics and played mostly as a reserve. He averaged 9.5 points in 278 regular-season games shot a career-best 51 percent last season.\n\nAndre Roberson gets $30M to stay in OKC\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that the Oklahoma City Thunder have agreed to terms with Andre Roberson on a three-year, $30 million contract.\n\nThe deal keeps Roberson in Oklahoma City, where he has emerged as a top-flight perimeter defender in four seasons with the Thunder.\n\nRoberson averaged 6.6 points and 5.1 rebounds last season. But his real value is on the defensive end, where he often guards the opposing team’s best scorer.\n\nDion Waiters staying in South Beach\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says Dion Waiters is staying in Miami and has agreed on a new four-year, $52 million contract with the Heat.\n\nWaiters averaged 15.8 points in 46 games last season for the Heat. He was a significant part of how Miami turned its season around after an 11-30 start, going 30-11 in the second half.\n\nThe Heat were 27-19 when Waiters played, 14-22 when he did not.\n\nWaiters missed Miami’s final 13 games with a badly sprained ankle, and the Heat wound up losing a tiebreaker for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. He played for $2.9 million last season.\n\nWarriors add Nick Young, Omri Casspi\n\nVeteran guard Nick Young is getting a new start with Golden State, agreeing to a $5.2 million, one-year contract with the champion Warriors.\n\nIn addition, forward Omri Casspi is joining the Warriors on a $2,106,470, one-year contract. This will be the 29-year-old Casspi’s sixth team as he enters his ninth NBA season, including two separate stints with the Sacramento Kings. He played for Sacramento, New Orleans and Minnesota last season, averaging 5.2 points and 3.1 rebounds in 17.9 minutes.\n\nThe 32-year-old Young last month declined the player option in his contract for next season with the Los Angeles Lakers, which would have paid him more than $5.6 million, and became a free agent.\n\nNow, he’s on a super team.\n\nYoung averaged 13.2 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 60 games for the Lakers. He will provide the Warriors with the kind of depth they like on a long bench as coach Steve Kerr regularly rotates in his reserves to spell the stars.\n\nJefferson returning to Cavs\n\nRichard Jefferson isn’t messing with any retirement talk this summer.\n\nAfter saying he would stop playing after the Cavaliers won the NBA title in 2016 and changing his mind, Jefferson said Wednesday that he will be back with Cleveland next season — his 17th as a pro.\n\nThe 37-year-old announced his plans on an episode of his “Road Trippin’” podcast.\n\nJefferson, who had contemplated quitting, has one guaranteed season left on his contract worth $2.5 million. He averaged 5.7 points and 2.6 rebounds in 79 games for the Cavs, serving mostly as a backup for LeBron James. He provided Cleveland with a big lift off the bench during the NBA Finals, when he was asked to guard Golden State’s Kevin Durant and was perhaps the Cavs’ most productive reserve.\n\nGordon Hayward goes to Boston\n\nGordon Hayward has chosen to sign with the Boston Celtics and reunite with coach Brad Stevens.\n\nHayward told Utah officials that he is moving on after seven seasons with the Jazz and that he picked Boston, making the announcement on The Players’ Tribune site.\n\nThe deal is reportedly for four years and $128 million, with a player option in Year 4.\n\nHayward played college ball under Stevens at Butler. He leaves a loaded Western Conference to join a Boston team that was the No. 1 seed in last season’s Eastern Conference playoffs. The Miami Heat also were in the chase to land Hayward.\n\nHe was finally an All-Star for the first time last season, averaging career bests of 21.9 points and 5.4 rebounds. Hayward also shot 47 percent, a significant jump over what he managed in the previous four seasons.\n\nPatterson now rolls with Thunder\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says forward Patrick Patterson has agreed to a three-year, $16.4 million deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nPatterson is leaving Toronto to join All-Star Paul George in a new-look Thunder frontcourt, the person told The Associated Press.\n\nThe deal was first reported by ESPN.\n\nPatterson was a valuable reserve for the Raptors, averaging 7.6 points in nearly four seasons. But he struggled badly in last season’s playoffs, shooting 28 percent from the field.\n\nThe Raptors kept Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka but Patterson has a chance to fill a need in Oklahoma City, where Taj Gibson left for Minnesota and Domantas Sabonis was dealt to Indiana in the trade for George.\n\nKings add ex-Spartan Randolph, Hill\n\nThe Sacramento Kings added veteran help to their young roster on Tuesday by agreeing to free-agent contracts with forward Zach Randolph and point guard George Hill.\n\nRandolph left Memphis for a $24 million, two-year deal to reunite with former Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger in Sacramento, a person with knowledge of the agreement told The Associated Press.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nHill announced on Twitter that he was coming to Sacramento. Yahoo Sports first reported the deal, saying Hill would get $57 million over three years.\n\nAfter a rocky start to his career in Portland and New York, Randolph, who left Michigan State after his freshman year, found himself in Memphis. He spent eight years with the Grizzlies, emerging as one of the central figures of the team’s “grit and grind” mantra.\n\nHe helped Memphis make the playoffs the past seven years, including a trip to the conference final in 2013 when Joerger was an assistant. Joerger took over as head coach the following year and had three years with Randolph, including a trip to the second round in 2015.\n\nRandolph, who turns 36 later this month, averaged 14.1 points and 8.2 rebounds per game last season and is still considered one of the better post players in the game.\n\nHe is expected to be a mentor for young big men like Willie Cauley-Stein, Skal Labissiere and Harry Giles, one of the team’s three first-round picks last month.\n\nHill will be expected to provide similar traits in Sacramento, while grooming rookie point guards De’Aaron Fox and Frank Mason III. The 31-year-old has spent nine years in the NBA with San Antonio, Indiana and Utah.\n\nHe averaged a career-high 16.9 points per game last season for the Jazz, helping them make the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2010. He also averaged 4.2 assists and 3.4 rebounds. He played only 49 games in the regular season because of various injuries.\n\nScott agrees to join Wizards\n\nA person familiar with the deal tells The Associated Press that free-agent forward Mike Scott has agreed to a $1.7 million, one-year contract with the Washington Wizards.\n\nThe deal between Scott and the Wizards was first reported by ESPN.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Scott, a second-round pick out of Virginia in 2012, played 281 games over five seasons with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHis best season was 2013-14, when he averaged 9.6 points per game. He played only 18 games with the Hawks last season because of a knee injury before being traded to the Phoenix Suns, who waived him. He last appeared in a game on Feb. 15.\n\nDurant taking less money to stay in Golden State\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Kevin Durant has agreed to terms on a two-year deal worth about $53 million to remain with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe deal calls for about $25 million in the first year with a player option for the second season. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract cannot be signed until Thursday.\n\nIt represents a significant giveback for the NBA Finals MVP, who could have signed a max deal that would have paid him millions more next season. The concession from Durant gave the Warriors enough room to lock up Stephen Curry to a max contract and bring back Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston.\n\nDurant joined Golden State last season after 10 years in Oklahoma City and helped lead the Warriors to their second championship in three seasons.\n\nHoliday joins Chicago\n\nA person familiar with the situation says the Chicago Bulls have agreed to a $9 million, two-year contract with guard Justin Holiday.\n\nYahoo! Sports first reported the agreement.\n\nHoliday averaged 6.5 points in 27 games for the Bulls two years ago.

The former Kansas player averaged 8.1 points last season for the Kings, but did shoot 38% from three-point range.\n\nThe Grizzlies made a low-risk decision to see how much Sacramento’s toxic atmosphere over the previous several seasons may have played into McLemore’s struggles.\n\nMemphis ranked 17th in the league in three-point percentage last season.\n\nMillsap leaves Atlanta for Denver\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Paul Millsap has agreed to terms with the Denver Nuggets on a three-year deal worth $90 million.\n\nThe 32-year-old Millsap gives the young Nuggets a proven, defensive-minded veteran who should fit perfectly with coach Michael Malone and budding star Nikola Jokic. Millsap is a four-time All-Star who averaged a career-high 18.1 points last season with the Atlanta Hawks to go with 7.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists.\n\nYahoo!

It comes one day after an initial agreement fell apart because it violated rules of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nNene initially agreed to a four-year, $15 million deal. But the deal violated a rule for players who will be 38 during the contract and so Nene became a free agent again.\n\nBut Nene’s interior presence was critical for the Rockets, who have also agreed to terms with P.J. Tucker to add some toughness to a high-scoring roster.\n\nESPN first reported the new deal.\n\nT'wolves add to frontcourt with Gibson\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations says Taj Gibson is reuniting with coach Tom Thibodeau, agreeing on a two-year, $28 million deal to join the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nGibson has spent the bulk of his career in Chicago, including five seasons under Thibodeau.

Toronto ended up losing to Cleveland in the second round.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Tucker has averaged 7.7 points for his career and shot 40 percent from 3-point range after joining the Raptors. Along with fellow newcomer Chris Paul, he joins forward Trevor Ariza in giving Mike D’Antoni some strong individual defenders.\n\nIguodala staying with NBA champs\n\nAndre Iguodala and the Golden State Warriors have agreed on a three-year, $48 million contract, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick.

Redick has agreed to a $23 million, one-year deal with the Philadelphia 76ers,\n\nRedick tipped his hand with a tweet: “Trust the process,” a clear nod to Philadelphia’s mantra during its rebuilding cycle over the last several years.\n\nThe 76ers added a second veteran during the opening day of free agency, agreeing to a one-year, $11 million contract with ex-Pistons forward Amir Johnson.\n\nRedick heads to Philadelphia from the Los Angeles Clippers, and gives the 76ers’ young core some experience the team desperately wanted.\n\nJohnson’s agent, Kevin Bradbury, confirmed the deal first reported by ESPN.\n\nJohnson spent the past two seasons with Boston, starting 77 games last season for the team that finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference. The 12-year pro has started at least 72 games in four straight seasons and for his career has averaged 7.5 points and 5.7 rebounds while also playing for Detroit and Toronto.\n\nJazz retains Ingles\n\nForward Joe Ingles has agreed to a four-year contract to remain with the Utah Jazz.\n\nPriority Sports announced the deal, which ESPN first reported was worth $52 million.\n\nIngles was a restricted free agent who would have drawn interest from other teams. But the Jazz locked up the Australian on the first full day of free agency and can now turn their attention to Hayward, their All-Star forward who met with the Miami Heat on Saturday.\n\nIngles averaged a career-best 7.1 points in his third NBA season, then helped the Jazz knock off the Clippers in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nEx-Piston Calderon goes to Cleveland\n\nThe Cavaliers have agreed to a contract with veteran Jose Calderon to back up All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving.\n\nCalderon’s agency, Priority Sports, confirmed the deal on Twitter, and a person with knowledge of the details says it’s for the veteran’s minimum, about $2.3 million in Calderon’s case.\n\nThe Cavs struggled to find a replacement for Matthew Dellavedova after he left for Milwaukee last summer.

He’s staying with a Clippers team that lost Chris Paul to Houston this week.\n\nPatty Mills stays in San Antonio\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says point guard Patty Mills is returning to the San Antonio Spurs on a four-year deal worth $50 million.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the league moratorium preventing deals from being finalized until July 6.\n\nMills has spent the past six seasons with the Spurs, helping them win the 2014 NBA title. Keeping Mills was a priority for the Spurs for many reasons, including how point guard Tony Parker is still dealing with a left leg injury that knocked him out of last season’s playoffs.\n\nMills averaged 9.5 points in a career-best 22 minutes per game last season. He also finished tied with Kawhi Leonard for the Spurs’ lead in three-pointers, with 147.\n\nChampion Warriors keep Shaun Livingston\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that the Golden State Warriors have agreed to a three-year, $24 million deal with backup guard Shaun Livingston.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because a contract cannot be signed until July 6.\n\nLivingston has been an integral part of the Warriors’ two championship teams and three trips to the NBA Finals in the last three years. The versatile guard can play both at the point and off the ball and gives them a defensive dimension on the second unit as well.\n\nIt was the first move the champions made in what figures to be a busy summer. They also expect to sign Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant to big deals and are trying to keep Andre Iguodala as well.\n\nJeff Teague goes to Minnesota\n\nIt didn’t take the Minnesota Timberwolves long to find a replacement for Ricky Rubio.\n\nJust a few hours after trading Rubio to the Utah Jazz, the Wolves agreed to terms with free agent point guard Jeff Teague on a three-year deal worth $57 million. A person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press the deal includes a player option for the third year.\n\nTeague averaged 15.3 points and a career-high 7.8 assists for the Indiana Pacers last season. He shot 35.7% from three-point range and is a better jump shooter than Rubio. The Wolves were looking to upgrade their shooting after trading for Jimmy Butler last week.\n\nMilwaukee holds on to Tony Snell\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says Tony Snell has agreed on a four-year deal that could be worth up to $46 million to stay with the Milwaukee Bucks, one of the first moves that came when the NBA’s free-agency window officially opened.\n\nThe fourth year of the deal is a player option and comes with $44 million guaranteed, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the league’s moratorium preventing signings until July 6.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nSnell started 80 games for the Bucks last season, averaging 8.5 points and shooting 45% from the field — both career bests. He spent his first three seasons with Chicago, playing mostly in a reserve role.\n\nRon Baker: I'm staying with Knicks\n\nShooting guard Ron Baker says he is returning to the New York Knicks.\n\nBaker wrote on Twitter he is “excited to be returning to the Knicks next season.” Baker was an undrafted free agent out of Wichita State who appeared in 52 games for the Knicks as a rookie last season.\n\nBaker averaged 4.1 points and 2.1 assists in about 17 minutes per game. He made 13 starts for the Knicks, reaching double figures in scoring five times.\n\nThe Knicks have not announced the deal. No new contracts can be executed before July 6, the end of the league’s moratorium that went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.\n\nMajor trades\n\nPacers send Paul George to Thunder\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the details say the Indiana Pacers have agreed to trade Paul George to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis in a stunning deal that gives MVP Russell Westbrook a new running mate.\n\nThe people said teams came together on the trade just hours before the free agent market was set to open. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade was not official.\n\nGeorge told the Pacers recently that he planned to leave as a free agent next summer, forcing the team to find a trade before losing him for nothing. The All-Star forward averaged a career-best 23.7 points last season in leading Indiana to the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe trade was first reported by ESPN.\n\nT'wolves send Ricky Rubio to Jazz\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have reached an agreement to send point guard Ricky Rubio to the Utah Jazz to clear salary cap space for a big run in free agency.\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the deal says the two sides agreed to the move just hours before free agency opened. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because neither team had announced the move. The Jazz needed to make the deal before July 1 or would have lost the salary cap room necessary to pull it off.\n\nRubio’s arrival likely means the end of George’s Hills run in Utah.\n\nRubio spent six seasons in Minnesota, delighting Wolves fans with flashy passing and an approachable nature while also suffering through losing season after losing season.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2020/12/15/giannis-antetokounmpo-agrees-supermax-milwaukee-bucks/3907673001/", "title": "Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks agree to 5-year, $228 supermax ...", "text": "Loyalty is a deeply rooted principle for Giannis Antetokounmpo, and for the second time he has applied it with the Milwaukee Bucks, as Antetokounmpo says he has agreed to a five-year contract extension worth about $228 million.\n\nAntetokounmpo had until Dec. 21 to decide to sign the designated veteran player exemption, commonly known as the supermax. By signing, the two-time reigning league Most Valuable Player has elected to continue to build upon his legacy in the city of Milwaukee and continue his pursuit of winning the organization's second NBA championship.\n\nAntetokounmpo, who turned 26 years old on Dec. 6, becomes the sixth NBA player to sign the extension since 2017.\n\n\"This is one of the great days in Bucks history,\" Bucks president Peter Feigin said at a Milwaukee Press Club event, shortly after Antetokounmpo's tweet.\n\nThe five-year extension begins at 35% of the salary cap, with an 8% escalation each year after. He is untradeable for the first year after signing. ESPN reported there is an opt-out clause in 2025.\n\nAntetokounmpo qualified for the supermax by hitting every possible requirement. He completed seven years and has one year left on his current deal (therefore will have completed eight years of service by the end of his current contract); he has been named all-NBA each of the past four seasons; he has won back-to-back Most Valuable Player awards and also was the defensive player of the year last season.\n\nTo win that and an MVP was a historic feat accomplished only by Michael Jordan (1987-88) and Hakeem Olajuwon (1993-94).\n\nThough speculation was rampant about Antetokounmpo’s future and feelings on the Bucks organization, he has long maintained a public desire to stay with the team that drafted him in 2013.\n\nAfter winning the MVP for the 2019-20 season, Antetokounmpo said, \"As long as everybody's on the same page and as long as everybody's fighting for the same thing, fighting for the same thing every single day, which is to be a champion, I don't see why not to be in Milwaukee for the next 15 years.\"\n\nWhen he signed a four-year, $100 million extension in 2016, he spoke of staying in Milwaukee to create a legacy much like his mentor and hero Kobe Bryant had in Los Angeles.\n\n“I can't imagine me being somewhere else,\" he said then. \"I don't say this just for the media but from the bottom of my heart. I know after this five years, hopefully, we'll be doing great, and I'll be here five more years. \"As I said last summer, I want to be here for 20 years. I don't like change, anyway.\"\n\nAntetokounmpo has been remarkably consistent in this regard, in many facets of his professional life.\n\nFor instance, when he re-signed with Nike in 2017 for a deal roundly believed to be worth $10 million annually and included a signature shoe line – the ZOOM FREAK – the first for an international player and 22nd overall for the company, he told The Undefeated, “At the end of the day, I gotta stay loyal to the people who helped me.\n\n“I wanted to build a brand from what I started. … That’s who I am as a person. Deep down in my heart, I know I made the right decision.”\n\nIf he had turned down the supermax, Antetokounmpo would have seen $140 million to $160 million in free agency if he left the Bucks.\n\nAnthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard were eligible for supermax extensions in New Orleans and San Antonio, respectively, but did not choose to sign them and wanted to be traded.\n\nThe short history of players signing the extension, which was created to help teams keep their star players, has been mixed at best:\n\nThe Golden State Warriors won an NBA title in the first year of Steph Curry’s $201 million extension in 2017-18 and lost in the NBA Finals the next year. Last season, Curry played in just five games before being lost for the season due to injury.\n\n\n\nJames Harden has led the league in scoring the past three seasons while Houston has advanced to one Western Conference final and two semifinals after he signed for $227.9 million in 2017. He has reportedly asked to be traded to Brooklyn.\n\n\n\nRussell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder were bounced in the first round of the playoffs the first two years into his $206 million deal and he was traded to Houston last year. Then, Westbrook was traded this offseason to Washington for John Wall.\n\n\n\nWall has played only 73 games over two years due to injury since signing his $170 million deal and last played on Dec. 26, 2018. The Wizards made the playoffs in the first year of his deal but lost in the first round.\n\n\n\nPortland’s Damian Lillard led the league in minutes played last season, his first under his $196 million deal, but the Trail Blazers finished the season with a losing record and lost in the first round of the playoffs in the bubble.\n\nThe Bucks have fallen short of reaching their first NBA Finals since 1974 each of the past two seasons, but the team acquired guard Jrue Holiday from New Orleans via trade and reshaped its bench to better adjust to the offensive and defensive issues the club has run into the past two postseasons.\n\nThough Antetokounmpo’s coming salaries can be restrictive, to have him secured going forward will help keep the Bucks in the championship conversation into his 30s.\n\n\"I’m happy with this award, but I always look forward,” he said after winning his latest MVP. “I always try to figure out how can I get better? How can I do it again? How can I do it for years to come? How can I be a champion? I’m happy, I’m grateful, but how can I do it again?”\n\nNow he and the Bucks know they can map out a plan to do just that.\n\nContact Jim Owczarski at jowczarski@jrn.com.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported the contract is for three years and $18 million.\n\nAnd it appears the Pistons possibly ditched a competitor for the services of free agent big man Al Horford when his team — the Atlanta Hawks — reached an agreement with Dwight Howard.\n\nIt’s not known if the Hawks still want Horford, but it would appear unlikely.\n\nBut the focus remained on Drummond.\n\nNews of the extension was well-received by forward Marcus Morris, who is in Orlando to check out the Pistons during summer-league action. (League rules dictate front office personnel can’t comment on agreements, but that doesn’t apply to players.)\n\n“I’m happy for (Andre),” Morris said. “I think he deserves it. He’s a cornerstone of the Pistons, we’re building around him. I think it was a great move and I’m happy that they got it done.”\n\nThe Pistons would have preferred a deal without an opt-out clause, but remember: Drummond showed good faith by agreeing to wait on the extension that he could have signed last off-season, in order to give the Pistons extra salary cap space. Drummond gave up instant security to help the franchise, so the Pistons apparently decided to reward him.\n\nThe contract can't be signed until the NBA's free agency moratorium ends Thursday, and the Pistons will delay the signing until they've completed their free agency business. That allows the Pistons to use up their cap space while they hold Drummond’s Bird Rights, which allow teams to go over the cap to retain their own free agents.\n\nDrummond is coming off of a season in which he earned his first All-Star berth and rebounding title, but he made national headlines with one of the worst NBA seasons ever at the free throw line. He frequently was benched in the fourth quarter, when teams would intentionally foul him.\n\nBut Pistons owner Tom Gores already had said where these contract negotiations were heading. “No hesitation,” Gores told reporters moments after the Cavaliers swept the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs in April. “Come on, look at all the big guys in the league. Come on.”\n\nDespite the free throw weakness and inconsistent effort, Drummond remains one of the league's most talented players. The Pistons' No. 1 off-season priority was getting a long-term commitment from the 6-11 center.\n\nContact Vince Ellis at vellis@freepress.com.

Phoenix has two days to match the largest offer sheet in league history or let Ayton go. He can no longer be included in a trade for Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant.\n\nThe 23-year-old center was drafted No. 1 overall by the Suns in 2018, but it's been widely speculated that they will part ways since Phoenix had refused to offer Ayton a max contract. This is its final chance.\n\nAyton averaged 17.2 points and 10.2 rebounds last season alongside future Hall-of-Famer Chris Paul and star shooting guard Devin Booker. The 6-11 big man has averaged 16.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in his four-year career.\n\nAyton would join a promising young core in Indiana, headlined by Tyrese Haliburton. The 22-year-old point guard averaged 17.5 points and 9.6 assists in 26 games for the Pacers after being traded from the Kings last season in exchange for two-time All-Star Domantas Sabonis. Haliburton could help Ayton blossom into a superstar.\n\nAyton would be paired with another former Arizona star, Bennedict Mathurin. The Pacers drafted Mathurin sixth overall last month, marking their highest draft pick since 1988 and first single-digit pick since 1989. Mathurin was the 2022 Pac-12 Player of the Year and the first Arizona player to win the award since Ayton in 2018.\n\nIndiana also has second-year players and 2021 first-round picks Chris Duarte and Isaiah Jackson. Duarte, 25, was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team last season, while Jackson, 20, has arguably the most upside of any player on the roster because of his age, athleticism and versatility.\n\nIs Deandre Ayton worth the price?5 players Indiana Pacers should consider in free agency\n\nIndiana has already retained Ayton's former Suns teammate Jalen Smith in free agency. The 22-year-old was traded from the Suns to the Pacers last season and signed a three-year deal with Indiana on Wednesday. Smith was drafted 10th overall by Phoenix in 2020 but averaged just 4.1 points and 3.1 rebounds in 56 games compared to 13.4 points and 7.6 rebounds in 22 games for Indiana.\n\nCarlisle dubbed Smith the team's new starting power forward, and Ayton would certainly be its new starting center, leaving Myles Turner as the odd man out. The 26-year-old shot-blocking center is entering a contract year and has yet to sign an extension, so Indiana may consider trading him to avoid the crowded frontcourt it experienced when Turner and Sabonis shared the court for three-plus seasons.\n\nFollow IndyStar Pacers beat writer James Boyd on Twitter: @RomeovilleKid.

Murray’s guaranteed salary of $160 million ranks second only to Cleveland’s Deshaun Watson ($230 million).\n\nAlbert Breer of Sports Illustrated’s MMQB reports the breakdown in Murray’s new deal includes the following: $105 million fully guaranteed, $161.7 million injury guarantee, $29.035 million signing bonus, $30 million in 2022, $39 million in 2023, $38.85 million in 2024, and is worth a total of $265.69 million over the next seven years.\n\nIt’s the largest contract any player has ever signed with the Cardinals, besting the seven-year, $113 million deal given to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald in 2011. The previous largest contract signed by a quarterback in Cardinals’ history was a five-year, $62.1 million deal for Kevin Kolb following his acquisition from the Eagles in a 2011 trade.\n\nThe biggest contract in NFL history belongs to Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who signed a 10-year deal worth $450 million in 2020.\n\nNFL's highest-paid players in 2022: Kyler Murray climbs list ranking players by salary\n\nMurray’s new deal puts an end to all the speculation and worries that the quarterback would stage a holdout and refuse to report to training camp. Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury told reporters last month that he was convinced a contract was in the works for Murray but added, “I’m just praying (it gets down) before training camp.”\n\nIt did. The Cardinals report to State Farm Stadium for their 35th training camp in Arizona on July 26. Rookies, including quarterbacks, reported on Thursday.\n\nMurray, who turns 25 on Aug. 7, reported to one of three voluntary offseason mini-camps and also participated in the Cardinals’ mandatory mini-camp last month as he awaited a new deal.\n\n“We were always under the impression he was going to be here,” offensive lineman Justin Pugh said at the time on the Dave Pasch Podcast. “Obviously, he may not be as happy as he would be if he had a new contract, but he’s been here, which lets you know the two sides are getting closer. If it was further apart and they weren’t seeing eye to eye and things weren’t close, I don’t think he would be here.”\n\nNFL's highest-paid quarterbacks: Kyler Murray skyrockets to No. 2 in average annual salary\n\nMurray completed a career-high 69.2 percent of his passes last season for 3,787 yards and 24 touchdowns against 10 interceptions, helping the Cardinals finish 11-6 and return to the playoffs for the first time in six years. He also rushed for 423 yards and five touchdowns on 88 carries in being named to his second consecutive Pro Bowl.\n\nIn three seasons, he has completed 66.9 percent of his passes for 11,480 yards and 70 touchdowns with 34 interceptions and has rushed for 1,786 yards and 20 TDs on 314 carries.\n\nMore from McManaman: 4 things I want to see at Cardinals training camp\n\nSelected No.1 overall in the 2019 draft out of Oklahoma, where he won the Heisman Trophy, Murray earned Rookie of the Year honors his first season and has been named to the Pro Bowl each of the past two seasons.\n\nMurray became the first player in NFL history with 70 or more passing touchdowns and 20 or more rushing touchdowns in his first three seasons. His 66.86 completion percentage is the best in league history in a player’s first three years and his 1,057 completions are the second-most in league history in a player’s first three seasons.\n\nFor subscribers: Somers: By extending Kyler Murray, Michael Bidwill placed another big bet this off-season\n\n(This is a developing story.

We rank the top 10 new faces who will have the most impact on their teams:\n\n1. LaMarcus Aldridge (San Antonio Spurs): Aldridge spurned a higher offer to remain in Portland and signed a four-year, $80 million contract with the Spurs, ensuring San Antonio remains a Western Conference title contender. The Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks, Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat were among the teams hoping to sign Aldridge, a four-time All-Star and the prize of the free agent class. However, the 6-11 power forward chose to sign with a franchise known for its consistency and five championships since 1999.\n\nAldridge, who grew up in Texas and played at the University of Texas, averaged a career-high 23.4 points and finished eighth in the league with 10.2 rebounds per game last season. He joins a frontline that includes future Hall of Famer Tim Duncan and small forward Kawhi Leonard, last season’s NBA defensive player of the year. In July, Duncan signed a two-year, $10.4 million deal, and Leonard signed a maximum five-year, $90 million contract.\n\nNBA A to Z podcast: Western Conference preview\n\n2. Greg Monroe (Milwaukee Bucks): The Bucks were one of the most surprising teams in the NBA last season, finishing 41-41 and advancing to the playoffs. Adding Monroe should help Milwaukee move up. Last September, Monroe signed a one-year qualifying offer instead of agreeing to a long-term extension with the Detroit Pistons, the team that drafted him in 2010. His gamble paid off, as the 6-11 center averaged 15.9 points and 10.2 rebounds last season and became one of the most sought-after unrestricted free agents. He agreed to a three-year, $50 million deal with the Bucks.\n\nThe Bucks also will receive a boost with the return of Jabari Parker, the second overall pick in the 2014 draft who tore his anterior cruciate ligament in mid-December and missed the rest of the season. Monroe and Parker join Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton on a young, talented team.\n\n3. Robin Lopez (New York Knicks): After spending the last two seasons playing alongside Aldridge in Portland, Lopez will be on the same team as another perennial All-Star in Carmelo Anthony. Lopez, a 7-foot center, signed a four-year, $54 million contract to give the Knicks an aggressive big man who won’t need too many touches on the offensive end. Lopez missed 23 games early last season with a broken hand, but he returned in early February and didn’t show lingering effects of the injury.\n\nArron Afflalo, Lopez’s teammate in Portland for the final 25 games of last season, also signed a free agent deal with the Knicks. The Knicks also add two first-round draft picks (Kristaps Porzingis and Jerian Grant) to a team that finished with the worst record (17-65) in franchise history.\n\nNBA A to Z podcast: Is Eastern Conference the Cavaliers' to lose?\n\n4. DeMarre Carroll (Toronto Raptors): Carroll is coming off the best season of his career when he started and averaged a career-high 12.6 points for a 60-win Atlanta Hawks team that lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference finals. Carroll is mostly known for his perimeter defense, but he recently has shown a more complete offensive game. He made 120 three-pointers in 70 games and connected on 39.5% of his three-point attempts last season. The Raptors rewarded him with a four-year, $60 million contract.\n\nThe Washington Wizards swept the Raptors in a first-round playoff series, but adding Carroll should give Toronto a good chance to win a postseason series for the first time since 2001 and only the second time in the franchise’s 21-year history.\n\n5. Wes Matthews (Dallas Mavericks): In March, Matthews tore his left Achilles tendon, which ended his season, required surgery and raised doubts about his recovery. Still, the Mavericks showed confidence in Matthews, signing him to a four-year, $70 million contract. Matthews, who started for Portland the last five seasons, has vowed to be ready for Dallas’ season opener. Questions remain about his long-term prognosis, but he could make an immediate impact if he’s healthy.\n\nNBA A to Z podcast: Surprise teams and David West interview\n\n6. Monta Ellis (Indiana Pacers): Seeking a more up-tempo offense, the Pacers agreed to a four-year, $44 million deal with Ellis, who led the Mavericks in scoring last season with 18.9 points per game. At 6-3, Ellis is an undersized shooting guard and a defensive liability at times. He made only 28.5% of his three-pointers last season, but he is capable of going on scoring streaks. Indiana’s offense also should improve with a full season from Paul George, who played 91 minutes in six games last season after breaking his leg in a Team USA scrimmage last August.\n\n7. Tyson Chandler (Phoenix Suns): Entering his 15th NBA season, Chandler is among the league’s best rebounders and defenders. He signed a four-year, $52 million deal with the Suns, a team looking for a stable presence at center. The Suns had hoped to sign Aldridge as well, but Chandler is a good consolation prize. He was fifth in the NBA last season with 11.5 rebounds per game and shot 66.6% from the floor, mostly from close range. The Suns were among the busiest teams during the offseason, signing Chandler and free agents Cory Jefferson, Henry Sims, Ronnie Price, Mirza Teletovic and Sonny Weems. They also re-signed point guard Brandon Knight to a five-year, $70 million deal.\n\nNBA Western Conference Preview\n\n8. Lou Williams (Los Angeles Lakers): Williams averaged a career-high 15.5 points in 25.2 minutes per game for the Raptors last season and won the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award. In Toronto, Williams rejuvenated his career after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in January 2013. The 6-2 guard agreed to a three-year, $21 million contract with the Lakers in July, joining a team that missed out on bigger name free agents after a 21-61 season. He will provide the Lakers with a high-scoring shooter off the bench.\n\n9. Paul Pierce (Los Angeles Clippers): Pierce, who turns 38 on Oct. 13, reunites with Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who coached him with the Boston Celtics for nine seasons. He signed a three-year, $10 million contract in what could be the final contract of his career. With the Wizards last season, Pierce averaged career lows in points (11.9) and minutes (26.2) in his 17th NBA season. Still, he is expected to add depth and contribute to a Clippers team that should contend for the Western Conference title. The Clippers were active in the offseason, resigning free agent DeAndre Jordan after he had committed to the Mavericks, signing veteran forward Josh Smith to a one-year deal and acquiring Lance Stephenson from the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nNBA Eastern Conference preview: If healthy, Cavs favored\n\n10. Ed Davis (Portland Trail Blazers): With Aldridge in San Antonio, Lopez in New York and Matthews in Dallas, the Trail Blazers will look much different. Davis, a 6-10 power forward, isn’t nearly as skilled as Aldridge, but he’s 26 and a capable starting frontcourt player. He shot 60.1% from the floor last season. His three-year, $20 million deal wasn’t the only move the Trail Blazers made recently. They signed free agent forward Al-Farouq Aminu and traded for center Mason Plumlee and forward Noah Vonleh.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/26"}]}

As its supply dwindles, a crisis looms\n\nExperts say the term 'drought' may be insufficient to capture what is happening in the West\n\nThe federal government announced Tuesday the Colorado River will operate in a Tier 2 shortage condition for the first time starting in January as the West's historic drought has taken a severe toll on Lake Mead.\n\nAccording to a new projection from the Department of the Interior, Lake Mead's water level will be below 1,050 feet above sea level come January -- the threshold required to declare a Tier 2 shortage starting in 2023.\n\nThe Tier 2 shortage means Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will have to further reduce their Colorado River use beginning in January. California will not yet have cuts made to the water they receive from the Colorado River.\n\nOf the impacted states, Arizona will face the largest cuts -- 592,000 acre-feet -- or approximately 21% of the state's yearly allotment of river water.\n\n\"Every sector in every state has a responsibility to ensure that water is used with maximum efficiency. In order to avoid a catastrophic collapse of the Colorado River System and a future of uncertainty and conflict, water use in the Basin must be reduced,\" Interior's assistant secretary for water and science Tanya Trujillo said in a statement.\n\nIt was just a year ago that the Department of the Interior declared the first shortage on the Colorado River -- a Tier 1. But the past 12 months did not bring enough rain and snow . Lake Mead's level has been around 1,040 feet this summer, just 27% of its full capacity.\n\nThe growing concern is that the mandatory cuts announced today -- part of a system that was updated as recently as 2019 -- aren't enough to save the river in the face of a historic, climate change-driven drought. States, water managers and tribes are now back at the negotiating table to figure out how to solve the West's water crisis.\n\n\"We thought we were good, but the last few years have been so dry that we realized those tier reductions weren't enough and aren't enough,\" Bill Hasencamp, the Colorado River resources manager with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, told CNN. \"So the two things we're focused on is how do we get through the next three years without the system crashing, and then how do we develop a long term plan to sustain the Colorado River.\"\n\n'There's only so much water'\n\nThe Colorado River's water was divvied up among seven states in the West a century ago. The pact gave half of the river's water to the Upper Basin states (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico) and half to the Lower Basin (California, Arizona and Nevada). Mexico -- through which the river flows before it reaches the Gulf of California -- was also guaranteed an allotment.\n\nThere was one major problem: Having been written in the 1920s, at a time when precipitation was higher than normal, the pact overestimated how much water the Colorado River carries. It also did not account for the West's booming population growth and its hotter and drier future in the face of the climate crisis.\n\nAt a June Senate hearing, Bureau of Reclamation chief Camille Touton laid out a stark warning. In order to stabilize the Colorado River Basin, states and water districts must come up with a plan by August 15 to cut 2 to 4 million acre-feet of water usage by next year. (An acre-foot is the amount of water that would fill one acre a foot deep -- roughly 326,000 gallons.)\n\nTouton's proposed cut is a massive amount -- the high end of the target is about 25% less water than states currently receive. And the low end of the target represents the vast majority of Arizona's yearly allotment of Colorado River water.\n\nJUST WATCHED Colorado residents fear their lifeline caught in tug of war Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Colorado residents fear their lifeline caught in tug of war 03:25\n\nTouton also made clear in June that if the states cannot come up with a plan, the federal government will act.\n\n\"It is in our authorities to act unilaterally to protect the system, and we will protect the system,\" she said at the time. \"We need to see the work. We need to see the action. Let's get to the table and let's figure this out by August.\"\n\nBut Touton on Tuesday did not specify any new deadlines that might be set for states to come up with a plan for the drastic cuts.\n\n\"Today we're starting the process and more information will follow as far as the actions we'll take in that process,\" Touton said on Tuesday. \"I want to continue to push on the need for partnership in this space and the need for collaboration and finding a consensus solution. Not just for next year but for the future.\"\n\nAdministration officials indicated they did not want to impede state negotiations and wanted to focus on using federal money from climate and infrastructure bills to make improvements to Western water infrastructure.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of the Interior Tommy Beaudreau called the current situation with state negotiations \"a complex environment.\"\n\n\"There are reasons for encouragement,\" Beaudreau told reporters Tuesday. \"The states have come together to try to hammer out voluntary solutions, this is a complex environment.\"\n\nBut inter-state negotiations are not going well.\n\nJohn Entsminger, the general manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, told CNN that so far not enough of the stakeholders have put forth proposals that would get the basin to Touton's target. He said he hopes the federal government proposes \"some pretty strong measures\" that could be acted on immediately.\n\n\"Frankly, I'm frustrated because the overwhelming sense I've gotten from the negotiations is there aren't enough people taking this seriously enough and understanding this is about adapting to less water in this river,\" Entsminger said.\n\nNevada has already moved to cut its metropolitan water usage, banning non-functional turf and paying people for years to remove water-intensive lawns, Entsminger said. But agriculture, which takes up a lot of the water from the river, must be part of the equation as well.\n\n\"You have to have a contribution from the sector that uses 80% of the water,\" he said. \"That's not law, politics, it's just math.\"\n\nEntsminger said other stakeholders that are hesitant to give up their water allotments need to accept a new reality: The river is running dry, and sacrifices must be made.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what can be agreed to because there's only so much water, and mother nature will figure this out at some point,\" he said. \"At some point, there's just not water in the river channel.\"\n\nThe federal government has not often stepped in and taken control of water management plans from the states, but it has the authority to do so in the Lower Colorado River Basin -- which includes Arizona, southern Nevada and southern California. And experts told CNN the threat of federal action is something states will respond to.\n\n\"We kind of need the federal government to make some threats to spur action,\" John Fleck, a Western water expert and professor at the University of New Mexico, told CNN earlier this year. \"Progress seems to happen when the federal government comes in and says to states, you need to do this or we're going to do something you don't like.\"", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/us/five-things-july-29-trnd", "title": "5 things to know for July 29: January 6, Kentucky, Uvalde ...", "text": "If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

According to sources familiar with the matter, prosecutors are preparing for a court battle to force former White House officials to testify about former President Donald Trump's conversations and actions around the insurrection. This appears to be the clearest sign yet that federal investigators are homing in on Trump's conduct as he tried to prevent the transfer of power to Joe Biden. This court fight would put the Justice Department's investigation into a more aggressive stance than even the Mueller investigation -- a major yearslong criminal probe into Trump while he was President. He was not ultimately charged. This comes as the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot confirmed it intends to share 20 transcripts with the DOJ as the department ramps up its investigation.\n\n2. Kentucky\n\nAt least eight people are dead and hundreds of homes have been damaged following catastrophic flooding in eastern Kentucky on Thursday. Rescuers are working around the clock to reach difficult-to-access areas amid continuing storms, officials said. Floodwaters have washed out bridges, wiped out power lines and sent some residents scrambling to their rooftops as water gushed into their homes. Some families' houses and cars were submerged or swept away completely by the flooding , which has been exacerbated by overflowing creeks. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called it one of the most \"devastating flooding events in Kentucky's history,\" adding destruction is far from over as more rainfall is expected today. Officials said the death toll is expected to rise.\n\nJUST WATCHED Drone footage captures devastating flash flooding in Kentucky Replay More Videos ...

Economy\n\nThe US economy shrank again in the second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday, fueling some recession fears . Gross domestic product, or GDP, fell by 0.9% on an annualized basis from April through June. The decline marks a key symbolic threshold for the most commonly used -- though unofficial -- definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Although Thursday's estimate marked a sharp drop from the 6.7% expansion the economy underwent in the second quarter of 2021, the Biden administration has been adamant that the world's largest economy, despite being buffeted by decades-high inflation, remains fundamentally sound.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN reporter breaks down unique nature of GDP decline Replay More Videos ...

Coronavirus\n\nCovid-19 cases are on the rise in the US due to the Omicron variant, but experts say it is still too early to determine if we're approaching the endemic phase of the virus . According to data from Johns Hopkins University, 1 in 5 Americans have been infected with Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, with just over 680,000 daily cases reported yesterday. Soaring infection rates are leading some people to seek a fourth dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine to increase their antibodies, but early studies show it still might not be enough to protect against breakthrough infections caused by the Omicron variant.

It now stands at just 35% of full capacity.\n\nWith the reservoir projected to continue dropping, state officials from Arizona, California and Nevada said they've begun meeting to talk about additional steps to reduce the risks of Lake Mead falling to critically low levels.\n\nFederal water managers said the first shortage declaration shows how severe the drought has become and how climate change is having serious effects on the river, which provides water for about 40 million people.\n\n“Reclamation does not take these actions lightly or do so easily. We do so because it is necessary, protecting the system and implementing the agreements we have in place,” Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Touton said in a news conference.\n\nThe cuts will be the largest to date on the river, shrinking the flow of water through the 336-mile Central Arizona Project Canal, which for more than three decades has supplied Arizona’s growing desert cites and vast stretches of farmlands.\n\nFarmers in part of central Arizona will face major cutbacks in water deliveries next year as a result of the shortage declaration, and they’re preparing for the supplies to be shut off in 2023. The reductions will force growers in Pinal County to leave some fields dry and unplanted, and the state is providing money to help local irrigation districts drill wells to pump more groundwater.\n\n“The cutbacks are happening. The water's not there,” said Will Thelander, whose family has been farming in Arizona for three generations. “We’ll shrink as much as we can until we go away. That’s all the future basically is.”\n\nThe announcement is based on projected reservoir levels over the next two years. Even bigger cuts are possible in 2023, meaning some Arizona cities could begin to see their water deliveries slashed as well.\n\nHoover Dam, a symbol of the modern West, faces an epic water shortage\n\nWest's drought has no end in sight:'If we do nothing, it’s going to be really bad'\n\nThe level of Lake Mead is projected to end the year at an elevation of 1,065 feet, which puts the river’s Lower Basin in what’s called a tier-one shortage. The government’s estimates also show the reservoir probably will continue falling, possibly triggering a lower-level shortage in 2023 that would bring larger cuts.\n\nThe reductions are taking effect under a 2019 agreement called the Drought Contingency Plan, which was aimed at reducing the risks of Lake Mead falling to critical lows. But as extreme heat and drought have persisted across much of the watershed, the levels of the Colorado’s largest reservoirs have fallen faster than had been expected.\n\nWith Lake Mead projected to continue dropping, some water researchers have warned that the cuts agreed to under the 2019 agreement now are not enough and that the region will soon need bigger efforts to adapt.\n\n“I think it means that we're in an all-hands-on-deck situation. And we have to figure out how we get along with less Colorado River water coming into the state,” said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. “I would say that everything's on the table. How do we continue to have our cities and our economy and quality of life and prosperity on significantly less Colorado River water?”\n\nThe shortage next year will reduce the Central Arizona Project’s water supply by nearly a third, shrinking the amount flowing through the CAP Canal to farmlands in Pinal County that produce cotton, hay and other crops.\n\n'I'm really concerned about drought'\n\nFarmers in Pinal County will see their Colorado River allotment reduced by more than 60 percent next year. Growers have said they may have to stop irrigating about a third of the area's farmlands, leaving them dry and fallow.\n\nJack Dixon said his great-grandparents farmed in Oklahoma and Texas, but when the Dust Bowl set in during the 1930s, they moved to Arizona for its water. In the history of land mismanagement that contributed to the Dust Bowl, Dixon said he sees similar risks in Arizona, where dry farmland already has become one of multiple contributors to dust storms.\n\n“That's another reason why I'm really concerned about drought, because my family lived it,” Dixon said. “And we’ve seen what happens when you run out of water.”\n\nGrowers in Pinal County have known for years that their supply of CAP water would eventually be cut off, with a 2004 settlement dictating a schedule of decreasing water deliveries between 2017 and 2030. But the 2019 shortage agreement and the deteriorating conditions at Lake Mead have meant that Pinal farmers will lose their supply of Colorado River water much sooner.\n\nWater's retreat has accelerated\n\nThe Colorado River provides water for cities, tribal nations and about 4.5 million acres of farmland from Wyoming to the U.S.-Mexico border. About 70% of the water diverted from the river in the U.S. is used for agriculture, flowing to fields of hay and cotton, fruit orchards and farms that produce much of the country’s winter vegetables.\n\nThe watershed has been hit by one of the driest 22-year periods in centuries. Scientists describe the past two decades as a megadrought worsened by climate change, and say long-term “aridification” of the Colorado River Basin will require the region to adopt substantial changes to adapt to getting less water from the river.\n\nIn 2000, Lake Mead was nearly full. Since then, the water level in the reservoir has fallen about 147 feet, leaving a growing “bathtub ring” of minerals coating the rocky shores. The water’s retreat has accelerated over the past year during months of severe drought and extreme heat.\n\n'Red alert': Lake Mead falls to lowest water level since Hoover Dam's construction in 1930s\n\nClimate change 'is making us face this reality quicker'\n\nScientific research has shown that the Colorado River watershed is sensitive to the higher temperatures caused by climate change, which intensify dry conditions and evaporate more moisture from the landscape. In a 2018 study, researchers found the river’s flow since 2000 had dropped 19 percent below the average of the past century, and that about half of the trend of decreasing runoff was due to unprecedented warming in the river basin.\n\nIn future years, the average annual water deficit in the river’s Lower Basin has been estimated at 1.2 million acre-feet — the equivalent of 43% of Arizona’s water allotment of 2.8 million acre-feet.\n\n“It's going to be really hard and we're going to have to do things differently,” Paul said.\n\nPaul said there are many unanswered questions about how agriculture will look in several years in Pinal County, and how growers will respond.\n\n“We know they can go back to groundwater, but in the end, we also know that's finite,” she said.\n\nDixon said he thinks there’s still a future for agriculture in Arizona if farmers make water-saving changes, like switching to drip irrigation, planting less water-intensive crops and improving management of watersheds. Dixon said he already has drip irrigation installed on some of his cotton fields, which he leases to another farmer, and plans to convert the remaining 120 acres to a drip system to save more water.\n\nFollow Zayna Syed and Ian Jameson on Twitter @zaynasyed_ and @byianjames.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2022/05/04/colorado-river-drought-tests-azs-desert-dweller-ethic/9624195002/", "title": "Will Colorado River shortages limit water use? Arizona cities seek ...", "text": "Arizona’s cities should consider imposing unprecedented restrictions on outdoor water use if the Colorado River’s flow continues to decline as expected this year, the state’s water resources director says.\n\nScottsdale and Tucson already have declared themselves to be in the first stage of their respective drought plans, and are reducing government water uses. Phoenix plans to take payments from the state in lieu of some of its Colorado River deliveries next year, part of the state’s latest drought mitigation effort.\n\nBut these and other Arizona cities are not hiring water cops like those who patrol Las Vegas streets watching for waste.\n\nShould they? Arizona’s top water official can’t order it, but he suggests the time for cities to enforce their own urban water savings outside the home is fast approaching.\n\nIf the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation this summer forecasts that Lake Mead's sinking elevation will tip the region into deeper mandated cutbacks next year, as the current trajectory suggests, “there should be serious consideration by water providers to start going down that path,” Arizona Water Resources Director Tom Buschatzke said.\n\nArizona's neighbors to the west already have taken the plunge in an effort to prop up the Southwest’s supply stored in Lake Mead and elsewhere.\n\nThe Metropolitan Water District in Los Angeles announced last week that starting in June it would limit outdoor watering to one day a week for some 6 million Californians, and would consider banning it altogether in September. That emergency comes in response to an in-state drought afflicting the State Water Project, though Metropolitan also imports Colorado River water.\n\nEnvironment: In drought-stricken West, officials weigh emergency actions\n\nThe Southern Nevada Water Authority, the river-dependent provider to the Las Vegas area, has long targeted outdoor water use by ticketing people who water on prohibited days or in a wasteful manner, and now prohibits grass turf in front of new homes. Last fall it adopted a plan that will restrict river water going to new golf courses and reduce watering on existing courses.\n\nThe Las Vegas region cut per-person use by 47% between 2002 and 2020, to about 112 gallons, while its population grew by 52%.\n\nNow officials seek to slash that use to 86 gallons by 2035, a task the agency says the warming climate and aging infrastructure will complicate by adding about 10 gallons of demand per person. Heat stresses plants, requiring more water to maintain healthy landscaping and shade trees.\n\nFeds will hold back water from Lake Mead\n\nMost of Arizona’s water supply is used outdoors, and the Colorado supplies about a third of it. Farms use about 70%, but even in cities the bulk is applied outside on landscaping and golf courses or in swimming pools.\n\nExtended drought that scientists say is worsened by the region’s warming climate has exacerbated the Southwest’s overuse of the river, causing the U.S. Interior secretary to declare a shortage that is likely to worsen.\n\nArizona is normally entitled to 2.8 million acre-feet of Colorado River water. This year, through a combination of the federally-mandated cuts and in-state efforts to soften further cuts in future years, the state is leaving more than 500,000 are-feet — a third of what it normally pumps across the desert through the Central Arizona Project — behind Hoover Dam.\n\nThose cuts have fallen hardest on central Arizona farms, but the next-level federal declarations will reduce deliveries to cities that have until now stored some of their river water in the ground. A third-tier of shortage, which Buschatzke fears is possible in 2024, would push the state’s losses above 700,000 acre-feet, enough to support a couple of million households, though farms would still absorb much of that loss.\n\nMore: How nature itself can squash quagga mussel invasion on Colorado River\n\nFederal shortage mandates on the states are linked to water levels in Lake Mead, which in turn rely on upstream releases from Lake Powell. There, with the reservoir’s surface nearing the minimum pool needed to generate hydropower for several million Americans, the Interior Department plans to hold back 480,000 of the 7.48 million acre-feet scheduled to flow from Powell to Mead this year, and Rocky Mountain states have agreed to send another 500,000 down the Green River from storage near the Wyoming-Utah state line.\n\nThe resulting loss in Lake Mead won't trigger deeper cutbacks downstream unless another dry winter makes it necessary for the government to keep holding the water back.\n\nThese moves buy time but won’t prevent further losses without help from nature, Buschatzke warned.\n\n“I don’t want to freak people out,” he said, “but we can’t guarantee that this is going to be the solution that fixes our problem.”\n\nPhoenix wants 'partners in conservation'\n\nMandatory watering restrictions remain a foreign concept in Arizona cities, where officials say they’re instead making progress by encouraging residents to embrace their Sonoran Desert surroundings.\n\n“People need to understand that we live in a desert,” and landscape accordingly, said Cynthia Campbell, water resource management adviser for the city of Phoenix. Most in America’s biggest metropolitan growth magnet seem to agree, choosing succulents over sod, and the city of 1.7 million people uses no more water than it did 30 years and 600,000 people ago.\n\nA wave of high-rise apartment and condo construction also goosed the city's efficiency by cutting down on per-person outdoor watering, she said.\n\nBut mandatory watering restrictions? Those would instill a sense of temporary emergency, Campbell said, instead of a longer-term desert ethic. Phoenix prefers “partners in conservation” to water cops enforcing restrictions, she said.\n\nArizona water providers have never mandated residential water cutbacks, though city governments did limit their own uses during an unusually severe dry spell in 2004, Buschatzke said. The long-term outlook has since worsened.\n\nRelated: Advocacy group asks Southwest to 'amp up' protecting Colorado River\n\nWarmth and dry soils kept most of a near-normal Rocky Mountain snowpack from reaching the reservoirs last year, and the current forecast is for less than two-thirds of normal runoff this year. Unless that changes, a deeper shortage affecting city supplies is likely next year.\n\n“Look at all of those factors and it’s probably time to start doing something at the homeowner level or the business level,” Buschatzke said. “I can’t dictate that, but I might urge those folks to consider doing that.”\n\nTribes with water rights are both helping prop up Lake Mead and encouraging others to conserve. In response to the federal plan to hold back water in Lake Powell this year, Colorado River Indian Tribes Chairwoman Amelia Flores released a statement saying her government is in discussions about leaving more of its water in Lake Mead. If Congress approves a proposal to let it transfer water through the CAP, she said, providers in central Arizona could lease it.\n\n“We are doing what we can to help and encourage everyone in the basin to conserve water,” she said in the written statement. “Reduced water in the River may be the future for our lifetimes.”\n\nCities may tap underground storage\n\nThanks to diversified water sources and a concerted effort to store previously unused river water underground in central and southern Arizona aquifers, residents connected to city water mains won’t soon face dry taps. The question is rather whether the extent of outdoor watering in the face of cutbacks to the Central Arizona Project canal will cause the cities to start depleting or “mining” that groundwater with no sure way of replacing it.\n\nPhoenix relies on the Colorado for about 40% of its water, and takes the rest from in-state sources including groundwater and dams managed by Salt River Project. The Colorado River water that Phoenix has stored in the ground as a “savings account” could offset about five years of the city’s entire share of the river if Lake Mead could no longer supply it, Campbell said.\n\nThat’s a worst-case prospect that the states, tribes and federal agencies are working to prevent, and the city expects it will instead use wells to replace a smaller portion of its Colorado water in bad years when that flow is curtailed.\n\nA change in state law last year permits cities with banked water to retrieve the equivalent in local groundwater regardless of whether the banked water actually flows past those wells. Wherever the banked water actually is in the aquifer, it then becomes regular groundwater subject to the state’s urban groundwater conservation law.\n\nThe state will pay Phoenix more than $4 million to leave about 16,000 acre-feet of water in Lake Mead this year, a hedge against triggering new cutbacks. That’s not water that city residents need today, so the city would have banked it in the ground had it received it. Instead, the money will fund conservation programs, Campbell said, possibly including rebates on low-flow toilets.\n\nEarth Day: Activists call for climate action at rally at Arizona Capitol\n\nPhoenix currently uses 169 gallons per person every day, and has set a goal of 155 by the end of the decade. Residential use already is around 99, Campbell said.\n\nPhoenix is focused on reducing its own municipal use, such as by retrofitting a cooling tower at Sky Harbor Airport to recycle water and xeriscaping public areas that don’t need turf for outdoor activities. It also has replaced fixtures such as toilets with more efficient models.\n\nPhoenix has not, as yet, paid anyone to remove turf, a concept pioneered regionally by the Southern Nevada Water Authority with rebates that reached $3 per square foot.\n\n“We don’t have to,” Campbell said. “We see our folks doing the right things without getting incentives.”\n\nTechnically, according to the Phoenix Water Resource Plan, it’s illegal to irrigate in a way that causes water to flow into a street or public place. The city responds to complaints, Campbell said, and “in most cases people either weren’t aware they were doing it or didn’t realize how bad that is.”\n\nThe city’s water department could fine violators up to $2,500 or even shut off the water when someone is uncooperative, though Campbell said she’s not aware that it has happened.\n\nConservation is 'the low-hanging fruit'\n\nWater in the street, whether from malfunctioning sprinklers or uncontained flood irrigation, is an enduring image of waste in the city.\n\n“I’m amazed how almost always when I visit Phoenix I see water flowing down the street,” said Robert Glennon, a University of Arizona law professor and author who focuses on water policy and law. “There’s something horribly wrong about seeing that.”\n\nPhoenix and other cities should push conservation, whether by mandate or by rebate, Glennon said, and should consider paying people to trade in water-guzzling fixtures. Such programs would cost far less than others that Arizona is considering, such as investing in seawater desalination in Mexico or California.\n\n“Water conservation remains the low-hanging fruit,” Glennon said. “There are a lot of things we can do. Las Vegas has led the way.”\n\nGlennon’s home city, Tucson, has less grass than Phoenix and uses less water per person: 135 gallons a day, including reclaimed water applied to golf courses and other purposes, and just 82 gallons by residential customers, according to Tucson Water.\n\nThe city has imposed the first stage of its drought plan, which triggered an accounting that shows residents how their use compares to the average in their customer class, along with a program offering free water audits, spokesperson James MacAdam said.\n\nIf the federal government imposes deeper cutbacks on releases from Lake Mead next year, he said, Tucson will go to its next stage and require water audits for those whose use exceeds guidelines that are now under development. The mayor and council could stop offering new water service to areas outside of its city limits or targeted annexation areas. They would consider adding a water surcharge. But they would not ticket or restrict water use.\n\nLike Phoenix, Tucson believes it has the resources to protect residents even as the Colorado shrinks. Tucson uses about 100,000 acre-feet — each acre-foot equaling about 326,000 gallons — every year, all of it from the Colorado. Thanks to an allocation of 144,000 acre-feet from the river in years past, Tucson has stored five years’ worth in its aquifer, and forgoing groundwater use has also let the aquifer rebound naturally. But even if the Bureau of Reclamation imposes a Tier 3 shortage, cutting Tucson’s share to 130,000 acre-feet, MacAdam said Tucson could still store more in the ground.\n\nThat’s not to say cutbacks aren’t coming.\n\n“Given the drama on the river and the way it’s going,” he said, “it’s not unlikely that there will be negotiations where everyone’s looking at voluntary cuts.”\n\nUnder current development patterns, he said, Tucson could tap groundwater to supply customers for several decades even if the CAP stopped delivering the city any Colorado River water.\n\n“We feel really good about it,” MacAdam said of the city’s supply.\n\n'We are not running out of water'\n\nIn Scottsdale, residents rely on the Colorado for about two-thirds of their water, and the city has taken action this year to preserve it. Scottsdale declared a Stage 1 drought and committed itself to reducing 5% of municipal water uses while asking residents to voluntarily do the same, Scottsdale Water spokesperson Valerie Schneider said.\n\nThe city also announced it will stop allowing water haulers to take its water beyond city limits next year, forcing one unincorporated area to look for another source. City residents do not face restrictions.\n\nAs of May 1, Schneider said, the city had shaved nearly 8% of its water use on public properties, and Scottsdale overall had cut use by 2.5%.\n\n“We are the only city actively looking to reduce water use by a designated number and asking residents to do the same,” Schneider said.\n\nScottsdale is not imposing restrictions on watering. If cuts from Lake Mead require more severe drought declarations, the mayor and council will decide whether to restrict watering or impose a water surcharge.\n\n“We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves,” Schneider said. “We are not running out of water.”\n\nIn Phoenix's far-northwest suburbs, Surprise also has activated the first stage of its drought plan. Like its larger neighbors, it says it has a resilient water supply and can rely on public information for now. It has banked groundwater since the 1990s, and last year stored twice what it served to customers. Like Phoenix, it has agreed to leave a portion of its Colorado River water in Lake Mead this year.\n\nThe city is completing a xeriscaping demonstration garden and offering courses on efficient landscaping and irrigation. It is not restricting use.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the Colorado River basin,\" Surprise water conservation specialist Amanda Rothermal said in an email, \"and we are ready to respond and meet the needs of our community as conditions change.\"\n\nLarge cities in metro Phoenix have not imposed watering restrictions because they don’t yet need to, said Warren Tenney, who directs the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association. His organization represents and advocates for 10 Maricopa County cities, including Phoenix and Scottsdale.\n\n“If things get so serious that we need to ask for everyone to conserve even more,” Tenney said, “then we will do that. But it’s much more effective to work at instilling an understanding that we are desert dwellers, and therefore water is our most precious resource.”\n\nNevada, with only a 300,000-acre-foot allocation of the river for 2.3 million residents in and around Las Vegas (roughly equal to what Phoenix alone uses from all sources each year), has acted out of a necessity that hasn’t yet hit central Arizona’s big cities.\n\n“We’re not in a situation like Las Vegas, where we are solely relying on the Colorado River,” Tenney said. “We’re fortunate to have more than one supply here, but we constantly remind ourselves that we have to be good stewards.”\n\nThe goal is to avoid mandates\n\nPhoenix has achieved per-capita reductions in water use similar to those in Las Vegas and Los Angeles without spending millions on rebates or enforcement, said Kathryn Sorensen, director of research at Arizona State University’s Kyl Center for Water Policy and a former director of the city’s water department.\n\nAbout 80% of family homes in the city had lush green lawns in the 1970s, a percentage that has plummeted since then. Central Arizona cities have invested in conservation education, she said, and it is paying off.\n\n“The cities have focused on culture change — getting people to understand that wise water use in the desert is always necessary,” Sorensen said, “not just when reservoir levels are low.”\n\nThe goal in Phoenix, according Campbell, is to avoid mandates. “We never want to have to do that,” she said.\n\nState DWR Director Buschatzke, himself a former Phoenix water director, remembers homeowners and developers advocating against bans on grass or large pools, the sorts of tools Las Vegas has employed.\n\n“I still think there’s a kind of strong individualist ethic in this state, and that would not be looked upon favorably,” he said.\n\nNonetheless, he said, it’s time for water departments to start thinking about options if the river keeps shrinking, and about what conditions might lead to outdoor water limits.\n\nHe expects any such moves would be incremental, tied to current drought conditions, so people can understand what’s coming.\n\n“We’re not going to leap from A to Z, but we’re going to have that progress,” he said before amending his thought to reflect the river's unpredictable nature: “Maybe we’ll have to leap.”\n\nBrandon Loomis covers environmental and climate issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

I've reduced it $350 billion in my first year in office. And we're on track to reduce it, by the end of September, by another 1 trillion, 500 billion dollars -- the largest drop ever.\"\n\nBiden's figures for both the 2021 fiscal year (which ran through last September) and the ongoing 2022 fiscal year (which runs through the coming September) are accurate, though the $1.5 trillion figure for 2022 is a projection. But some experts on fiscal policy say Biden is distorting reality when he claims that he is personally responsible for the deficit going down.\n\nThe deficit has been smaller under the Biden administration than it was at the end of President Donald Trump's tenure. But the deficit has been bigger under the Biden administration than the nonpartisan federal Congressional Budget Office had projected it would be if the Biden-era federal government stuck with the laws that were in effect when Trump left office in early 2021.\n\n\"The actions of the administration and Congress have undoubtedly resulted in higher deficits, not smaller ones,\" Dan White, senior director at Moody's Analytics -- an economic research firm whose analysis Biden has repeatedly touted in his speeches -- said in an email. \"It is encouraging that the administration has proposed some initiatives to bring down the deficit, but so far none of those initiatives has been seriously considered.\"\n\nA smaller deficit than before -- but a bigger deficit than expected\n\nThe roughly $2.8 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021, during which Biden was in office for more than eight months, was about $360 billion lower than the roughly $3.1 trillion deficit in fiscal 2020, Trump's last full fiscal year in office.\n\nA $360 billion decline is certainly substantial. The Congressional Budget Office, however, had estimated at the beginning of Biden's tenure that the fiscal 2021 deficit would be a decline of more than $870 billion if the Biden administration did not implement new policy.\n\nThe Biden administration did implement new policy -- notably including a massive pandemic relief package\n\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization that advocates deficit reduction, said in an interview that Biden's claims about having personally reduced the deficit are \"almost bizarro world ,\" a reversal of reality. The deficit would have fallen by much more \"had President Biden come to office and not done anything,\" he said.\n\nIt's important to note that Congress has the power of the purse in the federal government. Presidents propose budgets, but Congress habitually ignores them in favor of its own spending preferences. So both blame and credit should be shared.\n\nExpiring pandemic spending has been the main factor\n\nSo why, then, has the federal deficit gotten smaller at all under Biden, even if it has been higher than was originally projected at the time Biden took office?\n\nbeen There are a number of factors at play -- including the economic rebound for which White, Goldwein and others say Biden can fairly take some credit. But the main factor is that temporary pandemic relief spending has ending , bringing federal spending down from extraordinarily high levels.\n\ncaused by the pandemic-related economic crash, that temporary spending caused the deficit to skyrocket to an There was an explosion of short-term spending under Trump after the pandemic hit in 2020. Combined with the reduction in tax revenue largelycaused by the pandemic-related economic crash, that temporary spending caused the deficit to skyrocket to an all-time record in fiscal 2020 -- the roughly $3.1 trillion that was more than triple the deficit of the year prior.\n\nSo a decline from unprecedented 2020 deficit levels was always very likely. And even a big decline from those 2020 levels doesn't mean the deficit is low by historical standards.\n\nThe roughly $2.8 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021 is the second-largest deficit in US history in nominal terms and, according to Goldwein's organization , the sixth-largest as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. If the fiscal 2022 deficit does end up $1.5 trillion lower than the fiscal 2021 deficit, as Biden correctly noted the Treasury Department now expects, it would still be among the largest ever.\n\nAnd even with a $1.5 trillion decline from fiscal 2021, the fiscal 2022 deficit is still expected to be significantly higher than the deficit the Congressional Budget Office had projected for fiscal 2022 at the time Biden took office. Running a higher-than-expected deficit in fiscal 2021 provided more room for dramatic-sounding deficit reduction in fiscal 2022.\n\nThe quick rebound has helped, too\n\nThe deficit has a spending component and a revenue component. And it would be fair for Biden to boast about putting more revenue in government coffers through economic growth.\n\nBiden's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill not only increased government spending but helped fuel an unusually rapid recovery from the 2020 crash -- a recovery that generated additional tax payments as well as reducing spending on unemployment benefits in particular.\n\nJoel Friedman, senior vice president for federal fiscal policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank, said in an email that the deficit has fallen under Biden in part because pandemic measures have expired but also \"because of strong economic growth\" Friedman said is \"related\" to the pandemic measures.\n\nThe \"robust\" federal pandemic response not only reduced hardship, Friedman said, but \"helped make the Covid-19 recession the shortest on record and helped fuel an economic recovery that has brought the unemployment rate down to 3.6 percent and boosted revenue.\"\n\nThe deficit did increase under Trump\n\nWhile claiming credit for the deficit falling during his own presidency, Biden has also taken aim at Republicans' fiscal stewardship -- saying in his Wednesday speech that the deficit \"went up every year under my predecessor, before the pandemic and during the pandemic.\"", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/22/politics/baby-formula-us-military-aircraft/index.html", "title": "Baby formula arrives in Indianapolis from Germany on US military ...", "text": "Indianapolis (CNN) A shipment of 35 tons of baby formula has arrived Sunday in Indianapolis on a US military aircraft from Germany to address a nationwide shortage .\n\nThe prescription formula will be distributed to areas around the country where there is the most acute need, a Biden administration official earlier told CNN. But the official said none of the first shipment would land on store shelves in the US, adding that Sunday's shipment is hypoallergenic and will be fed to babies intolerant of protein in cow milk.\n\nThe shipment included 132 pallets of formula, which arrived on one C-17 cargo plane. The formula originated from Zurich, Switzerland, and was trucked to Germany, where it was loaded on the C-17 and flown to the US.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who greeted the arrival of the delivery in Indianapolis, said Sunday's shipment -- the first of Operation Fly Formula -- would provide enough formula for 9,000 babies and 18,000 toddlers for one week.\n\n\"It is a large shipment of very specific and specialized formula. Formula for moms and dads who have children who have allergies where the regular formula just simply will not work,\" the secretary said at a news conference in Indianapolis shortly after the shipment landed.\n\nThe Biden administration official told CNN earlier that the product contained in the first shipment will be distributed to hospitals, doctors, home health care facilities and pharmacies in regions \"where the needs are most acute.\"\n\nThe aircraft on Sunday transported pallets of Nestlé Health Science formula -- including Alfamino Infant and Alfamino Junior. At the site of the arrival in Indianapolis, a Nestlé spokesperson said, \"Some cases are ready for distribution in the next couple of days. Others will be released into the supply chain after standard quality testing is completed.\"\n\nThe White House announced later Sunday that the second flight of Operation Fly Formula, which includes \"114 pallets of Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA infant formula,\" was expected to \"take place in the coming days.\"\n\nThe White House said the \"total amount of formula arriving in the first round of Operation Fly Formula\" is the equivalent of 1.5 million doses of eight-ounce bottles.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday announced Operation Fly Formula, which directs the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture to utilize the Defense Department's commercial planes to import formula from abroad.\n\nSeparately, the Biden administration on Sunday evening announced the first two Defense Production Act authorizations for infant formula amid the ongoing nationwide formula shortage. The two \"priority orders,\" the administration said, are Reckitt and Abbott Nutrition, the baby formula manufacturer at the heart of a nationwide formula recall. The authorizations would allow those companies to urgently receive materials such as sugar, corn syrup, filters, which help make formula.\n\nFrustration for American families\n\nThe shipment comes as the shortage of baby formula has caused major disruptions and frustration for some desperate American families. Already, some families have begun rationing their supply of formula , while others have turned to hospitals when they can't find the kind they need.\n\nAnd in a clear sign of the deep effects of the crisis, a doctor at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee , said last week that he admitted two young patients -- a toddler and a preschooler -- because the specialty formula they need is out of stock and they haven't been able to tolerate any replacements.\n\nClinical dietitians at Medical University of South Carolina Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital in Charleston have reported that at least four babies were recently hospitalized for complications related to the ongoing formula shortage, according to a spokesperson for MUSC.\n\nThe spokesperson said three of the four babies were hospitalized due to intolerance of formula that parents had to try because of shortages, while one was sickened by mineral imbalances from caregivers mixing their own formula.\n\nOn Sunday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency over the nationwide shortage of the supply of infant formula.\n\nA statement from his office said the move would \"empower the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to prevent price gouging for formula.\"\n\nRetailers nationwide have been struggling to keep shelves fully stocked as supply chain problems persist, slowing down both production and distribution of goods.\n\nAccording to market research firm IRI, stores' infant formula inventories in mid-January were down 17% from where they were in mid-February 2020, just before the pandemic hit US shores.\n\nThe shutting down of the country's largest formula plant in February exacerbated pandemic-related supply chain issues and supercharged the nationwide shortage.\n\nThe out-of-stock rate for baby formula hovered between 2% and 8% in the first half of 2021, but began rising sharply last July. Between November 2021 and early April 2022, the out-of-stock rate jumped to 31%, data from Datasembly showed. That rate increased another 9 percentage points in just three weeks in April, and now stands at 40%, the statistics show.\n\nThe baby formula shortage has thrown the White House into crisis mode and opened yet another political wound going into an already challenging midterm election season, frustrating the West Wing and the rest of the administration as they struggle with how little control they have over a situation that is centered at the US Food and Drug Administration, an independent agency that the White House neither controls nor gets direct reports from.\n\nOfficials have faced criticism that the FDA moved too slowly to address warning signs. At the same time, they have been attempting to learn whether formula companies are actually short on ingredients, while also trying to tackle potential price gouging.\n\nVilsack said in Indianapolis on Sunday that the federal government is working with suppliers of baby formula in the US to increase production and address the nationwide shortage.\n\nHe had said the government is working to help get the Abbott facility in Michigan up and running, through the aid of the Defense Production Act.\n\nThe agriculture secretary also said an agreement with the FDA would allow the Abbott facility and others to \"jump ahead of line for the necessary supplies that are necessary and required in order to produce the formula.\"\n\nMore flights expected\n\n\"Folks, I'm excited to tell you that the first flight from Operation Fly Formula is loaded up with more than 70,000 pounds of infant formula and about to land in Indiana. Our team is working around the clock to get safe formula to everyone who needs it,\" Biden said on Twitter\n\nNational Economic Council director Brian Deese told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that as part of the airlift operation, more flights with baby formula \"will be coming in early this week.\"\n\n\"We're going to keep ramping that up until we get there,\" Deese said.\n\nPressed by Bash on how the US ended up in a position in which baby formula has to be airlifted into the country, Deese in part blamed market consolidation.\n\n\"It goes back to this question of how we can bring more competition in our economy, have more providers have this formula so that no individual company has this much control over supply chains,\" he said.\n\nThe Biden administration official told CNN earlier that the product was coming from a factory that has already gone through US FDA approval -- meaning US inspectors would only need to conduct \"spot checks\" Sunday after the product lands. Those checks include ensuring that the product was not damaged in transit and has appropriate labeling. An FDA inspector was onsite to conduct the spot check. Separately, Nestlé is also going to conduct its own quality check at its local distribution site.\n\n\"This shipment is essentially going to get off this cargo plane, then the Federal Express folks are going to take it from there, they are going to deliver it to a distribution center that the Nestlé Gerber folks have here in Indiana, and then it's going to go on trucks and it's going to be delivered in hospitals and home health care clinics across the country, providing support and help,\" Vilsack said Sunday.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden administration is engaged in conversations with makers of other European baby formula to approve and obtain excess supplies for US distribution, the administration official told CNN.\n\nIndianapolis was chosen as the arrival site for the formula because the Nestlé distribution site is located there. The official added that the administration is plugging into the existing distribution chain.\n\n\"We're turning a two-week process into 72 hours,\" the official said.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated for additional developments.\n\nCLARIFICATION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the timeline of the first round of Operation Fly Formula's arrival in the United States.", "authors": ["Polo Sandoval", "Samantha Beech"], "publish_date": "2022/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/us/five-things-april-21-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for April 21: Ukraine, Covid-19, Wildfires, Tesla ...", "text": "If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has scrapped plans to storm the Azovstal steel plant in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, saying those who choose to surrender should be treated in accordance with international conventions. The plant is among the last significant holdouts of Ukrainian forces in the city and is sheltering hundreds of soldiers and civilians. Putin also congratulated the Russian military on taking control of Mariupol, a claim Ukrainian officials have denied. Ukrainian commanders on the ground also said Russian forces have not honored agreements to open humanitarian corridors or enforce ceasefires and have continued to bombard the city. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Air Force has added about 20 more operational aircraft to its fleet because of an influx of spare parts, according to a senior US defense official, which will help strengthen the country's aerial defense network.\n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nThe Justice Department yesterday appealed the federal ruling that struck down the mask mandate on airlines and other mass transportation, following a recommendation by the CDC. \"An order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health,\" the CDC said in a statement yesterday -- despite airlines and public transit systems already deciding to make masks optional following the ruling earlier this week . If the conservative-leaning appeals court upholds the order, the case could then be appealed to the Supreme Court, where conservative justices have been ruling against Covid-19 measures since the start of the pandemic.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Huge shift in travel policy': Travel mask mandate no longer in effect Replay More Videos ...

Wildfires\n\nMore than 8 million people are currently under fire alerts with areas across New Mexico, western Texas, and portions of Nebraska and Wyoming under critical fire risk. This comes as a result of extremely dry conditions, low humidity, gusty winds and near record-setting high temperatures across the Southwest US. There are 11 large wildfires burning across the region, including the Tunnel Fire in Arizona , which had ballooned to more than 19,000 acres as of yesterday. It has been an extraordinarily busy start to the fire year in the South and Southwest, with more than 19,000 wildfires reported through Tuesday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center . This is the highest number of fires at this time of the year in any year of the past decade.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Fire season is now year-round': Here's how climate crisis fuels wildfires Replay More Videos ...

Tesla\n\nTesla posted record profits once again yesterday, earning an adjusted income of $3.7 billion for the first quarter of 2022, much higher than the $2.6 billion forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. But the electric car maker warned that it is not immune from supply chain problems, which it said limited \"our ability to run our factories at full capacity,\" a situation that will likely persist through the rest of 2022, it added. CEO Elon Musk said that despite some of the company's supply chain issues, particularly due to a temporary closure of Tesla Shanghai , he anticipates there will still be a record output from the plant this quarter. Musk also defended recent price increases for Tesla's vehicles. The company's cheapest car, a Model 3, now costs about $47,000 , up 34% from three years ago.\n\n5. Disney\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis escalated his feud with Disney this week, challenging state lawmakers to unravel the 55-year-old Reedy Creek Improvement Act, a unique Florida law that allows the entertainment giant to operate as an independent government around its Orlando-area theme parks. This comes after DeSantis ripped Disney as a \"woke corporation\" and encouraged Republican lawmakers to advance a pair of bills targeting Disney over its objections to a new law limiting classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity. Republicans in Florida and Disney have been at odds over the legislation that opponents called the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill . After initially declining to weigh in, Disney CEO Bob Chapek publicly criticized lawmakers for passing the legislation and apologized to the company's LGBTQ employees for not being a stronger advocate.\n\nJUST WATCHED Florida state lawmaker hits back at Disney: 'You better be on your best behavior' Replay More Videos ...

Doug Ducey as their featured speaker at a kick-off event in April.\n\nThe resistance from the golf industry has surfaced as Arizona’s water outlook has grown increasingly complicated, with a shortage looming on the Colorado River and groundwater declining in many areas beneath growing cities and suburbs.\n\nThe disagreement shows that even a modest plan for using less water can generate considerable opposition from some in the golf business, and it also indicates state water regulators may continue to grapple with resistance — even in the face of severe drought and the effects of climate change — as they seek to implement requirements of the 1980 law that regulates groundwater in parts of Arizona.\n\n“I'm astounded that we are 40 years into the Groundwater Management Act and we are still arguing about whether the department can, in fact, impose minor conservation requirements on golf courses,” said Kathleen Ferris, a water researcher and lawyer who previously headed the state Department of Water Resources.\n\nFerris said she understands that a number of golf courses aren't fighting the water-saving proposal and are \"really trying to figure out what it is DWR needs them to do and how they can comply with reductions in their water use.\"\n\nState records show there are 165 golf courses in the Phoenix area. They use various sources of water, including treated wastewater and Colorado River water. But more than half of the area's courses rely at least partially on groundwater, together pumping roughly as much from wells as the average consumption of 130,000 single-family homes.\n\nAs state officials finish drafting their plan for reductions in water use on golf courses in the coming months, the allotments that are established will affect how much water is sprayed on courses in the desert for years to come.\n\n“We need to increase our conservation and decrease our groundwater withdrawals,” said Tom Buschatzke, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources, speaking at an April 28 online meeting attended by more than 400 people.\n\nIt was the latest public meeting between state water officials and golf course managers, and one in a series of state-convened work groups focused on developing updated groundwater plans — technically called the fifth management plans — for the five “active-management areas” where pumping is regulated around Phoenix, Tucson and Prescott as well as Santa Cruz and Pinal counties.\n\nShrinking supplies drive water-saving needs\n\nBuschatzke began with an overview of Arizona’s worsening water challenges, including the declining reservoirs of the Colorado River, which store water that flows through the Central Arizona Project Canal to desert cities from Scottsdale to Tucson.\n\n“I wanted to give you the context of what’s happening, challenges that are facing our state with the management of the Colorado River,” Buschatzke said.\n\nHe showed a chart tracing the declining water levels in Lake Mead since 2000, a blue line descending like a mountain slope toward a threshold that will soon trigger an official shortage declaration by the federal government.\n\n“Unfortunately, Lake Mead and the Colorado River keep declining. We’re on the verge of taking very large reductions in our Colorado River water use starting in 2022,” Buschatzke said.\n\nThe watershed is trending, he said, and Lake Mead’s levels could continue to drop toward lower thresholds that would bring bigger cuts for Arizona, Nevada and Mexico — and potentially for California if the reservoir keeps declining.\n\nOther slides detailed the cutbacks that would be required if the reservoir falls toward critically low levels, something a 2019 deal among the states aimed to avert. Buschatzke also described a worst-case scenario.\n\n“At dead pool, 890 feet elevation, no water moves past Hoover Dam. No water. The river will be dry and Arizona will not have any Colorado River water,” Buschatzke said. These larger challenges with the river, he said, relate to the conservation that’s needed under the new management plans in all sectors, including golf.\n\nOther details about the water plans were explained by Natalie Mast, the department’s director of active-management areas, who said the guiding purpose in each successive plan is to achieve reductions in groundwater pumping. She gave a recap of previous meetings since 2019 and said time is tight to finish developing the plans.\n\n“We’re kind of in a red zone here. We’re pushing the limits of our timeline in order to complete the drafting of those fifth management plans,” Mast said. “We do need to work through the finalization of these programs in a relatively quick manner.”\n\nThe presenters from the state water agency went over their proposal, an earlier iteration of which they floated in February. The compared their proposal with the different plan presented by the Arizona Alliance for Golf.\n\nThey also delved into complex details about how the plan would work. For one thing, the changes in water allocations wouldn’t be the same for all golf courses. Under the state’s proposal, the changes in allocations would vary widely depending on the course. Examples listed in the proposal show that some large courses might face a reduction of as much as 24% in their allotment, while other courses would have smaller reductions, such as 8% or 11%, and some courses would actually see their allotments increased.\n\nState officials said their goals, in addition to reducing the amount of groundwater pumped, include improving the “simplicity” of the system of water allotments and achieving “equity” among golf courses, recognizing that some have made more progress than others in becoming more efficient.\n\nThe reductions in allotments apply to all courses that use groundwater, some of which also use water from other sources. The analysis by the Department of Water Resources showed its proposal would mean an overall decrease of 1.3% in the aggregate water allotments of all golf courses in the Phoenix area. In contrast, state officials found that the alliance’s proposal would slightly increase the combined water allotments of all courses by 0.1% compared to the last management plan.\n\nBuschatzke said representatives of the Arizona Alliance for Golf asked to meet with his department in November, and they’ve had 11 meetings, five of which he attended.\n\nHowever, Buschatzke said, the golf alliance’s latest proposal wouldn’t satisfy the goal of reducing water use and “is not something that meets our requirements.”\n\nHe said the state is proposing “small reductions,” and added that he thinks “it should be as much as we can achieve under the golf program given all that is happening with our water supplies.”\n\n'Fundamental disagreements'\n\nThen representatives of the Arizona Alliance for Golf spoke.\n\nThe group was formed “to bring unity and cohesion to these really important conversations,” said Katie Prendergast of the public relations firm Horizon Strategies. The meetings between the group and the department in recent months have aimed at finding a “workable proposal,” she said, “one that provides the water necessary for courses to remain economically viable while enabling the department to meet its statutory requirement.”\n\n“Based on today’s presentation, we don’t have the same perspective as the department and there are clearly gaps we need to work through,” Prendergast said.\n\nAlso speaking for the alliance, Rob Collins of Paradise Valley Country Club touted the golf industry’s efforts to conserve.\n\n“Water is expensive, so it’s critical to our businesses and it’s a major expense,” Collins said. “We are naturally water-savers.”\n\nCollins said he thinks it would be better to “look at real-use numbers rather than being focused on plan-to-plan reductions,” as the state agency is doing.\n\nBri Kenny of the Scottsdale-based golf management company Troon said she thinks “it’s super necessary that we have another meeting.”\n\n“We do have fundamental disagreements on these plans,” Kenny said. “And it actually stems back to the approach in calculating reductions and the quality of the data that exist, that you’re calculating the reductions from.”\n\nBuschatzke said he and his staff are open to having another meeting.\n\n“Remember, when you talk about the data that we’re using, this is data that is reported by the golf courses, by the golf industry to us, as is required under the law,” Buschatzke said. “We’re relying on the accuracy of the data you’re providing to us in your annual reports. So if there are ways you can make that data more accurate, we would encourage you to do so.”\n\nBuschatzke reiterated that his agency is required to calculate these allotments to achieve reductions in groundwater use.\n\nThe Arizona Alliance for Golf says on its website that golf “is a driving force behind the state’s real estate and tourism industries, accounting for thousands of jobs and at least $4.6 billion in direct economic impact each year.” The group also says Arizona’s golf industry is a national leader in water conservation and “must be part of both the conversation and the solution” as state officials debate the future of water use.\n\nMark Woodward raised those points during the meeting. Woodward, president of Arizona’s Cactus and Pine Golf Course Superintendents Association, said he’s been in the business 52 years and the groundwater management plan that’s being discussed is “the biggest issue we’ve ever faced.”\n\n“Rushing any decisions related to the plan would not be good for the industry. It would not be good for the department or anything. It’s critical that we get these decisions right,” Woodward said. “Because potentially any decisions you guys make are going to be impactful to the golf industry for the next 10 years or more.”\n\nWoodward said more time is needed to “clean up the data” and the department should consider “the big picture, to look at the return on investment that golf brings for the small amount of water that we use — less than 2% of the state’s water supply.”\n\nHe also urged state officials to consider the progress golf courses have already made over the past 30 to 40 years in reducing water use.\n\n“In many cases, there’s not a lot of room for improvement. We’ve already done more than most industries have already done. So we’re way ahead of the curve,” Woodward said.\n\n“Let’s work together to ensure that decisions are well thought out and they accomplish all the goals of the department,” Woodward said. “You have goals. We understand that. But we also have an industry to run and we don’t want to do anything that’s going to jeopardize that industry, and I don’t think the governor or anybody wants to do that, frankly.”\n\nWoodward said he and others in the golf industry also have questions about how the department is developing its proposals.\n\n“It is the most critical thing that has happened in the last 50 years in this industry,” Woodward said. “We fully understand the need to operate efficiently and effectively, and use water wisely. We’ve been doing that for years. This is nothing new to us. We have a shared goal with you all: savings of groundwater. We understand that you have a goal to reach. We get that. But not at the expense of damaging an industry.”\n\nMany golf courses use groundwater\n\nBuschatzke replied that he and his staff “recognize the need to have a program that allows the golf industry to continue to move forward.” He said they’ll continue to accept comments about any of the proposals.\n\n“But everyone needs to understand as well that we are under a deadline,” Buschatzke said. “We need to move forward and come to some closure very soon.”\n\nMore than two years ago, he noted, the state’s Auditor General pointed out the department was behind schedule on the groundwater management plans and said it needed to catch up. The agency’s regulators are now trying to wrap up a draft proposal for golf water allotments this year.\n\nTo examine water consumption on golf courses, The Arizona Republic requested data from the Department of Water Resources under the state’s public records law. The records show 219 golf courses across Arizona used a total of 119,478 acre-feet of water in 2019. The average amount of water used per course was 504 acre-feet during the year, or about 450,000 gallons a day.\n\nMore than half of the golf courses pump groundwater, which accounted for about 46% of all golf water use in 2019. Treated effluent from wastewater plants accounted for 27% of water use, while about 15% was Colorado River water from the CAP Canal. The remainder came from other sources.\n\nA majority of the courses, 165 in all, are located in the Phoenix active-management area. The state data shows 89 of these courses rely at least partially on groundwater. During 2019, the records show, they pumped 44,354 acre-feet of groundwater, or 14.4 billion gallons, about as much water as 130,000 typical single-family households.\n\nDuring the meeting, Buschatzke said his department is proposing a small overall reduction in groundwater use “because we do recognize much of what’s already been done in the golf industry with efficiencies, with how well the water is managed, and that some turf has already been reduced.”\n\nCourses that are entirely reliant on surface water or recycled water don’t fall under the requirements of the groundwater law. “But if you have one molecule of groundwater in what you put on the golf course, you then are subject to penalty if you exceed your allotment,” Buschatzke said.\n\nAnd while some courses face larger reductions than others, Buschatzke said, the overarching goal is to reduce water use industry-wide.\n\nSome golf managers asked whether there will be a grace period to take out grass on portions of their courses. Others voiced specific concerns about how their courses and country clubs will fare.\n\nJan Ek, general manager of the Recreation Centers of Sun City, said she oversees seven large 18-hole courses that were built in the 1960s and '70s, plus one 9-hole course.\n\n“In most cases, we are over allocations on every golf course. It was built with wall-to-wall green,” Ek said.\n\nShe said they’ve been switching to more efficient irrigation systems and converting some areas to desert landscaping, and have also asked their board to approve spending more on grass removal. Ek said they have removed turf on about 60 acres so far, but “we’ve got a long ways to go.”\n\nThe new management plan is “beyond scary, because I don’t even know how we could possibly get there,” Ek said. She said she’s also looking at the expense of fixing a leaking lake, making for a list of projects that need to be addressed. And reducing water use on the scale proposed, she said, will be a “huge undertaking.”\n\nAnd then there’s the size of the golf courses, she said, “because I have courses that are so large they could be two golf courses.”\n\nEk said she wants to get her courses into compliance with the water allotments. She asked Buschatzke if they could meet with him or his staff to go over a plan that would move toward the goal and still be affordable.\n\n“Absolutely, we would be willing to sit down and work with you on a plan. I can’t guarantee what the result would be,” Buschatzke said. “And if there’s a mechanism to come to a legally binding agreement in that regard, we’re willing to talk about that with you as well.”\n\n“That would be excellent,” Ek said. “We would very much appreciate that opportunity and, you know, ability to negotiate if we need to, to get ourselves to that point.”\n\nGrappling with a 'drier future'\n\nOne subject that came up only once during the meeting was climate change, when Buschatzke briefly uttered the words and referred to the “long-term effects finally hitting us from the drier future.”\n\nBut no one mentioned the fact that when it’s hotter and drier, as it has been recently, plants consume more water through evapotranspiration — something golf specialists track on their computer screens with sophisticated systems that pinpoint the irrigation demands on their greens and fairways.\n\nExcessive heat warning:Afternoon temperatures expected to reach up to 117 degrees\n\nAnd climate data from the federal government shows the Southwest has grown significantly hotter over the past decade, experiencing more pronounced warming than other regions of the country, which affects the amount of water needed per acre of green grass in the desert. In other words, at a time when golf courses are being asked to conserve more, hotter average temperatures are gradually pushing per-acre water demands higher.\n\nAt the same time, scientists have found that the Colorado River watershed is sensitive to warming and that higher temperatures have contributed significantly to the severe drought over the past 22 years.\n\nScientists describe it as a “megadrought” in the West and one that, unlike the long droughts of the past, is being amplified by carbon pollution and the heating of the planet.\n\nLake Mead, the largest reservoir on the Colorado River, declined last week to the lowest level since it was filled in the 1930s following the construction of Hoover Dam. Some researchers have estimated the Colorado River could lose roughly one-fourth of its flow by 2050 as temperatures continue to rise, and that for each additional 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the average flow is likely to drop by about 9%.\n\nArizona gets an estimated 36% of its water from the Colorado River, and a large portion of it flows through the CAP Canal to cities, farms and tribal lands.\n\nBut with a first-ever shortage expected next year, mandatory cutbacks will reduce the Central Arizona Project’s water supply by nearly a third. That will shrink the amount flowing through the CAP Canal to farmlands in Pinal County that produce cotton, hay and other crops.\n\nIn a first-level shortage, the water supplies of Arizona’s cities are protected from cuts under the state’s plan. That could change, though, if Lake Mead continues to drop and reaches lower thresholds that would trigger larger cuts.\n\nWhile the water outlook in the Southwest has worsened over the past year, the organizers of the Arizona Alliance for Golf have sought to mobilize support.\n\nAt an event on April 27, members of the alliance welcomed Ducey, who gave opening remarks.\n\nIn a tweet, the governor shared a photo of the audience listening to his speech. Ducey tweeted: “The golf industry is critical to growing Arizona’s economy, job opportunities and tourism. Today, I’m proud to help kick off the Arizona Alliance of Golf and ensure our state remains the premier golf destination.” He also mentioned Grayhawk Golf Club.\n\nC.J. Karamargin, Ducey’s spokesperson, said the governor “has been very focused on water issues and he has spoken about the need to prepare for a drier future in Arizona.”\n\nThe Department of Water Resources is working on the groundwater management plan through a transparent public process, Karamargin said, and “we’re going to wait and see what happens there, how that plays out.”\n\nRepeated studies have examined golf's contributions to Arizona's economy. Four years ago, researchers at the University of Arizona found that the golf industry contributed $3.9 billion in sales to the state's economy in 2014.\n\nAn economic study released in December by the Arizona Alliance for Golf said the industry supports about 50,000 jobs in the state and in 2019 generated an estimated $4.6 billion in economic activity and about $388 million in tax collections.\n\nOn National Golf Day several years ago, Ducey's office said in a statement that \"Arizona is a hole-in-one for golfers\" and that it's \"a real boon for our economy.\"\n\nThe membership of the Arizona Alliance for Golf also includes a public entity that manages Phoenix's public courses. Gregg Bach, a spokesperson for the city of Phoenix's Parks and Recreation Department, said the city's Phoenix Golf section is a member of the alliance.\n\nNot everyone in the golf industry opposes the state’s water conservation plan. Chip Howard, an agronomist and golf industry consultant, said that with a few exceptions, “I find this plan to be fair and equitable among golf courses.”\n\n“That said, there will be a few already-small golf courses that will find the proposed plan to be challenging,” Howard said. “I hope that those golf courses can be accommodated in a way that will preserve their viability to contribute to the economy.”\n\nWhile the debate continues over how much water golf courses should be allowed to use, Arizona is facing more and more warnings that the available water supplies appear insufficient to support all the new subdivisions that are springing up and planned in the state's rapidly growing cities and suburbs.\n\nColorado River in crisis:Hoover Dam faces an epic water shortage\n\nFerris, the former director of the Department of Water Resources, coauthored a report on the subject this year with Sarah Porter, director of Arizona State University's Kyl Center for Water Policy. They warned that groundwater has been seriously overallocated in areas where aquifers are regulated, allowing for unsustainable pumping that they said threatens the state’s water future.\n\nFerris and Porter said the state's leaders need to reform groundwater rules to safeguard desert aquifers and prevent water levels from continuing to decline in many areas.\n\nFerris helped draft the state’s 1980 Groundwater Management Act and later became director of the Department of Water Resources. Now a senior research fellow at ASU, Ferris said she thinks the department’s proposal makes sense, and she has followed the golf group’s opposition to it.\n\n“I’m dismayed that we’re seeing this kind of pushback from a number of folks,\" Ferris said. “It’s sort of indicative of a lack of understanding of how critical the water issues we face are, and that it’s going to take everybody doing their part to ensure that we have sustainable water supplies moving forward.”\n\nFerris pointed out that representatives of the agriculture industry, which accounts for a large portion of groundwater pumping in regulated areas, have also banded together to press their case as officials consider what allocations to adopt in the groundwater plans.\n\n“There just seems to be a lack of understanding among a number of different groups that we are facing a very difficult time in Arizona’s history, and we can’t go on with business as usual,” she said. “You know, everybody thinks they’re special. But nobody is going to be very special when we run out of water.”\n\nIan James covers water, climate change and the environment for The Arizona Republic.

Store staffers at the candy store chain It’Sugar urged it to stock up, and the gummies did so well that TikTok became part of the company’s sales strategy. The chain now has signs with the app’s logo in stores, and goods from TikTok make up 5% to 10% of weekly sales.\n\n“That’s an insane number,” said Chris Lindstedt, the assistant vice president of merchandising at It’Sugar, which has about 100 locations.\n\nTikTok, an app best known for dancing videos with 1 billion users worldwide, has also become a shopping phenomenon. National chains, hoping to get TikTok’s mostly young users into its stores, are setting up TikTok sections, reminiscent of “As Seen On TV” stores that sold products hawked on infomercials.\n\n► What's the deal with WitchTok?:We spoke to creators bringing magic to TikTok.\n\nAt Barnes & Noble, tables display signs with #BookTok, a book recommendation hashtag on TikTok that has pushed paperbacks up the bestseller list. Amazon has a section of its site it calls “Internet Famous,” with lists of products that anyone who has spent time on TikTok would recognize.\n\nThe hashtag #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt has gotten more than 5 billion views on TikTok, and the app has made a grab-bag of products a surprise hit: leggings, purses, cleaners, even feta cheese. Videos of a baked feta pasta recipe sent the salty white cheese flying out of supermarket refrigerators earlier this year.\n\n► TikTok:Coach to stop destroying damaged returns after TikTok video of slashed purses goes viral\n\nIt’s hard to crack the code of what becomes the next TikTok sensation. How TikTok decides who gets to see what remains largely a mystery. Companies are often caught off guard and tend to swoop in after their product has taken off, showering creators with free stuff, hiring them to appear in commercials or buying up ads on TikTok.\n\n“It was a little bit of a head scratcher at first,” said Jenny Campbell, the chief marketing officer of Kate Spade, remembering when searches for “heart” spiked on Kate Spade’s website earlier this year.\n\nThe culprit turned out to be a 60-second clip on TikTok posted by 22-year-old Nathalie Covarrubias. She recorded herself in a parked car gushing about a pink heart-shaped purse she’d just bought. Others copied her video, posting TikToks of themselves buying the bag or trying it on with different outfits. The $300 heart-shaped purse sold out.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it because I wasn’t trying to advertise the bag,” said Covarrubias, a makeup artist from Salinas, California, who wasn’t paid to post the video. “I really was so excited and happy about the purse and how unique it was.”\n\nKate Spade sent Covarrubias free items in exchange for posting another TikTok when the bag was back in stores. (That video was marked as an ad.) It turned what was supposed to be a limited Valentine’s Day purse into one sold year round in different colors and fabrics, such as faux fur.\n\nTikTok is a powerful purchasing push for Gen Z because the creators seem authentic, as opposed to Instagram, where the goal is to post the most perfect looking selfie, said Hana Ben-Shabat, the founder of Gen Z Planet. Her advisory firm focuses on the generation born between the late 1990s and 2016, a cohort that practically lives on TikTok.\n\n► ‘It's fun to play dress-up':Getting that cute fall pic in hot weather\n\nUsers trust the recommendations, she said: “This is a real person, telling me a real story.”\n\nInstagram, YouTube and other platforms connected people with friends or random funny videos before marketers realized their selling potential. For TikTok, losing the veneer of authenticity as more ads and ways to shop flood the app could be a risk. If ads are “blatant or awkward, it’s more of a problem,” said Colin Campbell, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of San Diego.\n\nInfluencers who get paid to shill for brands are getting better at pitching goods to their followers, telling them that even though they get paid, they’re recommending a product they actually like. “They feel like they are our friend, even though they aren’t,” he said.\n\nChannah Myers, a 21-year-old barista from Goodyear, Arizona, bought a pair of $50 Aerie leggings after seeing several TikTok videos of women saying the cross-banding on the waist gave them a more hourglass-like figure. “It’s funny, I shop religiously at Aerie and I had no idea they existed until I saw them on TikTok,” Myers said.\n\n► 'Devious licks':Challenge on TikTok leads to criminal charges against students across US\n\nAfter those Aerie leggings went viral on TikTok in 2020, the teen retailer expanded the same design to biker shorts, tennis skirts and bikini bottoms, all of which can be found by searching “TikTok” on Aerie’s website. It wouldn’t say how many of the leggings sold.\n\nTikTok, along with other tech companies like Snapchat, is gearing up to challenge Facebook as a social-shopping powerhouse. Shopping on social media sites, known as social commerce, is a $37 billion market in the U.S., according to eMarketer, mostly coming from Instagram and its parent company Facebook. By the end of 2025, that number is expected to more than double, to $80 billion.\n\nLast month, TikTok began testing a way for brands to set up shop within the app and send users to checkout on their sites. But TikTok has hinted that more is coming. It may eventually look more like Douyin, TikTok’s sister app in China, where products can be bought and sold without leaving the app — just like you can on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n“Over the past year, we’ve witnessed a new kind of shopping experience come to life that’s been driven by the TikTok community,” said TikTok General Manager Sandie Hawkins, who works with brands to get them to buy ads on the app and help them boost sales. “We’re excited to continue listening to our community and building solutions that help them discover, engage and purchase the products they love.”\n\nThat includes The Pink Stuff, a British cleaning product that wasn’t available in the U.S. last year.\n\n► TikTok:A woman on TikTok wasn't afraid to show her death. In the process, she helped others live.\n\nThat all changed when videos of people using it to scrub rusty pots and greasy countertops went viral on TikTok, pushing the brand to cross the Atlantic. It launched in the U.S. in January on Amazon, with 1.3 million tubs sold monthly, and is getting calls from major stores wanting to stock it, according to Sal Pesce, president and chief operating officer of the The Pink Stuff U.S.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/08/24/fancy-like-walker-hayes-song-brings-back-applebees-oreo-shake/8253507002/", "title": "'Fancy Like' Walker Hayes song brings back Applebee's Oreo shake", "text": "A shoutout on a viral song has led Applebee's to bring back this famous dessert — the Oreo Cookie Shake.\n\nThanks to country singer Walker Hayes' song \"Fancy Like\", the restaurant brought back the menu item on Monday for a limited time.\n\nIn light of the pandemic, Applebee's cut many menu items as sales plummeted, milkshakes included, according to CNN.\n\n\"The Oreo shake was one of my favorites back in the day and the power of the song brought it out of retirement,\" Hayes told USA TODAY.\n\nHayes' mention of the dessert in the song gone viral on TikTok and other social media platforms led to the restaurant capitalizing on the buzz.\n\n\"We fancy like Applebee's on a date night, got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake,\" Hayes sang in the song.\n\nThe restaurant posted a video of workers at a Applebee's dancing to the hit song and bringing out a steak and the $2.99 Oreo shake on TikTok .\n\nRestaurants including Applebee's have had to change with the times after the COVID-19 pandemic altered how customers engage with dine-in establishments.\n\nIn February, Dine Brands, the parent company of Applebee's and IHOP, launched an online-only delivery restaurant Cosmic Wings where the food is prepared at Applebee's locations.\n\nThe meal, which features Cheeto-flavored wings and cheese bites, is delivered through the Uber Eats app that saw enormous growth after more people decided to have food delivered to their homes.\n\nApplebee’s CMO Joel Yashinsky said Hayes' song came on the restaurants radar within a week or two of the release.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nWeight loss can be a full-time job. There are meal kits you can try, intense workout regimens, juice cleanses and questionable diet pills. While it’s easy to take advantage of the overwhelming number of options available to help you, you have to be motivated to actually take the first steps towards a healthier life.\n\nWhen I gained weight after college, I was sitting in front of a computer for a 40-hour work week and didn’t feel like I had any additional time or energy to devote to my health. In hindsight, prioritizing my health would have given me more energy. But the fact of the matter is that I didn’t have any motivation to sort through all the fads. All I knew was that I wanted to be comfortable in my own skin again.\n\nI turned to WeightWatchers in 2019 and I was very skeptical about whether it would work for me or not. Now three years later and 30 pounds lighter, I know I made the right decision. The program helped me not only lose weight but start living a much healthier lifestyle.\n\nGet deals and shopping advice delivered straight to your phone.

While weight loss is the most sought-after benefit of following the program, it offers plenty of other benefits. It promotes hydration, physical fitness, meditation and better sleep. It’s tied at #1 for Best Diet Program and Best Weight-Loss Diet and #3 for Easiest Diets to Follow by the U.S. News and World Report.\n\nWeightWatchers uses a simplified calorie-counting system that is personalized based on your age, weight, height and sex to help you lose weight in a healthy way. Every food and drink has a corresponding point value. Saturated fat and sugar are higher in point value, while proteins are fewer. There are even foods valued at zero points that you can find on a ZeroPoint food list, which can be consumed to your heart’s content. You’re allotted a specific number of points for each day so, in theory, if you consume the equivalent of your daily points or fewer, you should lose weight. The aim is to guide you toward making better choices and, with practice, to make those choices habitual.\n\nHow does WeightWatchers work?\n\nWhen you sign up for WeightWatchers, you complete a personal assessment, which provides a baseline of where you are currently are in your health journey and indicates your goals. These are all taken into account in the “Personal Points Engine” to generate your personalized program, or PersonalPoints. WeightWatchers proudly proclaims that no two programs are the same—your PersonalPoints includes your daily Points Budget, which is a number of points per day that you should ideally consume, in addition to your personalized ZeroPoint food list.\n\nEvery time you have something to eat or drink throughout the day, you track it on the app. Each food and beverage has a corresponding point value, which eats into your Points Budget for that day. While it might seem hard to stick to a daily number, the ZeroPoint food list makes it more manageable because you have flexibility to enjoy more food or drinks when you get hungry, even if you’ve hit your daily limit. In addition, you’re rewarded with more points in your budget if you track healthy habits such as eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming water and exercising. Another great feature: Unused points become “rollovers”, meaning they automatically roll into your Points Budget for the next day. For example, if you’re working with a budget of 23 points and find that you only use 21 of those points on Monday, your Tuesday Points Budget will reflect 25.\n\nIn addition to a daily Points Budget, you’re also assigned an additional number of weekly points, or \"weeklies.\" These give you the freedom to indulge at your discretion. If you go over your daily point budget on any given day, points are taken from your weekly points. You may go over by a point or several, but there’s no harm, no foul. Your amount of weeklies is personalized to you and designed to help you find success in your weight goals whether you use them little by little, many at once or opt to not use them at all.\n\nWhat are ZeroPoint foods on WeightWatchers?\n\nYour ZeroPoint food list is a helpful way to stick to your Points Budget. ZeroPoint foods and drinks are ones that you don’t have to track, that you can consume indefinitely without spending any of your allotted daily points. There are some “staple” ZeroPoint foods and drinks that anyone can find on their ZeroPoint food list. This includes many fruits and vegetables, lean proteins and eggs. Your personalized ZeroPoint food list has additional items tailored to you and selected by you based on what you consume regularly, as well as what you enjoy consuming the most. You select foods for your ZeroPoint food list when you sign up for the program, and as your day-to-day habits change throughout the year, you can go back and adjust your list as needed. Options include but are not limited to potatoes, sweet potatoes, popcorn, avocados, brown rice and whole-wheat pasta.\n\nDepending on what you select to be on your ZeroPoint food list, your Points Budget will change. For example, if you add foods that are high in carbs or sugars to your ZeroPoint food list, your Points Budget will decrease to offset the higher calorie intake. The idea is, and always has been, that no food is off-limits. You can still enjoy all of your favorite foods, just in moderation.\n\nWhat membership plans are available on the WeightWatchers program?\n\nThere are a few types of WeightWatchers plans and it all comes down to your personal preference. One is the Digital plan, which is essentially the basic plan and more of a self-guided experience. You have access to the app and website, as well as tracking, and your own personalized plan. The Digital plan also gives you access to 24/7 Live Coaching via messenger and 5-minute coaching audios.\n\nThe second plan is called Unlimited Workshops + Digital. It includes all aspects of the Digital plan in addition to thousands of workshops you can join. In-person workshops were on hold temporarily because of the pandemic, but now they are back in full swing and you can choose to participate in-person or virtually. If you’re someone that finds strength in numbers and craves a social aspect in your weight loss journey, this plan may work better for you.\n\nThe third plan is called 1-on-1 Coaching + Digital and it is exactly how it sounds. With this plan, you’ll get all of the aspects of the Digital plan, and an opportunity for private coaching with a weight-loss expert. You’ll have 15 minutes with the coach of your choosing each week to talk about your wins, areas where you feel you may have fallen short and to create a game plan to move forward with confidence. They’re there for guidance as well as to keep you on track. If you want more accountability and someone to check in on your progress, this plan may appeal to you.\n\nWhen I first began the program several years ago, I started with the 1-on-1 coaching program. Ultimately, I felt smothered by the check-ins and wanted some more freedom. It wasn’t personal to the coach, it just turned out that WeightWatchers is more effective for me when I am figuring it out my own way. I’m someone who wanted the app and website benefits without having to interact with others, so I opted for the Digital plan, and I’m still using it three years later.\n\nWhat’s included in the WeightWatchers app?\n\nThe WeightWatchers app is included in all membership levels. When you open it, you’ll be prompted to complete an optional weekly check-in. I find this helpful at times. It prompts you to take into consideration how you're feeling during a given week and how that might be impacting your journey, as well as prompts you to weigh in and truly track your progress. It can be tempting to avoid the scale, so this is a helpful way to keep you accountable. This keeps your weight loss “why” top of mind, and allows you to reflect on what’s working and what’s not.\n\nThe app is where you log your food and beverage consumption each day to keep on track with your health goals. It gives you access to thousands of recipes and even a convenient “What’s in your fridge?” feature that will let you input items that you already have at home and match you with healthy recipes you can make. You can build your own recipes and save them for later use, making it much easier to track meals that are “regulars,” so to speak, in your life. There is also a barcode scanner to make food tracking easier and a search feature where you can look up food items from common brands or even restaurants.\n\nSleep is also a focus on the app. There’s a sleep section where you can track your hours of sleep, set up a reminder to alert you when it’s bedtime, and stretches and meditations to help you wind down for an improved night’s sleep.\n\nThen, there’s the fitness tracking. As previously mentioned, logging your daily fitness efforts will expand your Points Budget. You can sync most fitness tracking devices with the app so that activity is automatically logged and extra points seem to magically appear in your Points Budget. If you’re looking for a new fitness routine, you can choose from thousands of on-demand workouts from obé Fitness through the app.\n\nThe app is also where you’ll find a chat feature with 24/7 access to coaching, should you want it. If you want to take the social aspect of WeightWatchers to the next level, there’s even a social media section called “Connect” where you can post to the WeightWatchers community to share wins, ask questions and join groups of like-minded people. If that's not your style but you still want some advice to level up your health journey, the app gives you access to audio recordings from weight-loss experts that are meant to teach and motivate when you need it, or when you’re looking to try something new.\n\nWhat is the WW Shop?\n\nAvailable on both the app and website, there’s a WeightWatchers store called the WW Shop. You can buy healthy food, various WeightWatchers cookbooks, products to make your health journey easier such as grilling tools or a sleep mask and more. I’m going to level with you: Some of the food items are hit or miss. I tried the Chocolate Caramel Mini Bars. They weren’t anything to write home about, but it was very rewarding to only track 2 points for a chocolate bar that satisfied my chocolate craving. I ended up re-ordering these.\n\nI also tried the 2-Ingredient Dough Bagel Kit and I have some beef with it. I thought when I opened up the kit that all of the ingredients would be in it, but that was not the case. You need to buy ingredients on top of it; it just gives you the bagel mold sheet and toppings. It’s clearly stated in the description of the item so that was completely a user error. I will say, however, that I was not thrilled with the non-stick silicone pan. It did the job but the silicone is very floppy to hold so getting it out of the oven while it was hot proved challenging. Ultimately, the bagels came out decently, and I appreciated that they were low-calorie, allowing me to log fewer points than I would with a store-bought bagel.\n\nLastly, I tried the Half Gallon Water Bottle. Drinking water from such a large container felt a little aggressive, but also very efficient. I liked knowing that if I just finished the container, I’d be drinking all the water I needed to each day. It even tells you what time of day you should be done drinking a certain amount. In addition to being a quality water bottle, it’s dishwasher friendly, which is always a plus. The only thing I would change is the neck of the water bottle, which has a fabric handle of sorts. It’s convenient to hold when you’re using it, but seems strange to put in the dishwasher.\n\nAll these products available in the online store aim to keep you on track. What's more, you can earn rewards to use in the shop for your commitment to the program and hard work. Everything you track on the app contributes to “WellnessWins”, an accumulation of points (separate from PersonalPoints) that are redeemable at the online store. You can earn WellnessWins through food tracking, fitness tracking and even getting a good night’s sleep.\n\nWhat is a WeightWatchers workshop?\n\nWith the Unlimited Workshops + Digital plan, you have access to an endless supply of workshops. They occur both virtually and in-person—you can find a location near you with an easy search feature on the website. Similarly, you can find the right coach for you by browsing coach profiles on the WeightWatchers site.\n\nDuring a WeightWatchers workshop, you can expect practical, science-backed tips from the leading coach to help you on your weight loss journey, as well as plenty of motivation. It also gives you the opportunity to meet with other members to bond over your struggles, share ideas and cheer each other on. While I haven’t participated in a workshop myself, I can see the appeal, as I’m often commiserating with friends or family in a similar way that the workshops provide.\n\nHow much does WeightWatchers cost?\n\nThe price of WeightWatchers varies depending on the plan that you select. For the Digital plan, there is a standard monthly fee of $22.95 plus a one-time starter fee of $20. If you want to pay on a monthly basis with no commitment, you’ll pay the standard monthly fees each month and a one-time starter fee in full. If you commit to 3-months of the Digital plan, you can waive the starter fee completely and pay only $10 for the first month instead of the standard $22.95. After the first month, your monthly fee will increase to $22.95 per month but you’ll have saved $32.95 in total with the discounted rate and no starter fee. If you make a 6-month commitment, you also waive the starter fee and pay $10 per month for the first three months of your program. After the first three months, the rate will increase to $22.95 per month until you cancel. This option saves you a total of $58.85. Important note: There is a termination fee of $42.95 if you end either a 3-month or 6-month plan early.\n\nWith the Unlimited Workshops + Digital plan, you’ll find similar options for your level of commitment but at a higher price. Monthly plans costs $44.95 with a $20 starter fee. For a 3-month commitment, you’ll wave the $20 starter fee and pay $10 for your first month. After your first month, your monthly rate will increase to $44.95. You’ll save a total of $54.95 by committing to three months. For a 6-month commitment, you’ll wave the $20 starter fee and pay $10 per month for the first three months, and will then pay $44.95 per month. This ultimately saves you a total of $124.85.\n\nFor the 1-on-1 Coaching + Digital, there is only a monthly option. There is a standard monthly rate of $59.95, plus a starter fee of $20 to begin with. There is currently a 40% off promotion saving you a total of $31.98 in your first month. After that, you’ll be billed the full $59.95 per month until you cancel.\n\nWhat are the downsides of using WeightWatchers?\n\nFood tracking can be time-consuming, and it’s especially annoying when products aren’t in the database, or you have to assemble recipes from scratch on the app. You’ll often find yourself selecting food that’s close enough to what you’re looking for. It works OK that way, it’s just not as precise. This is why ZeroPoint foods are essential to improving your WeightWatchers experience.\n\nThat being said, you don’t want to fall into the habit of consuming the same ZeroPoint foods all the time. While they are a blessing, they can turn bland and boring if you eat them too frequently. I have gotten into ruts where I was sick of some of the ZeroPoint foods: That’s a good time to readjust your ZeroPoint food list. I also recommend adding extra flavor to level up your foods. While you may be focused on keeping your meals as low-point as possible, add some hot sauce. Season it excessively with herbs and spices. And use your weeklies for those indulgent foods you crave so that you don’t feel burnout.\n\nLike me, you may find that the first plan you choose isn’t the right one for you. I didn’t enjoy having a coach, but other people love it. While I enjoy doing my own thing, others may want more comradery and socializing. Take some time to experiment to figure out what plan will work best for you and your goals.\n\nLastly but perhaps most importantly, it can get discouraging when you’re not seeing the progress you want at the pace you want it (though this is an issue with weight loss in general, not just WeightWatchers). I lost weight pretty quickly at the beginning and plateaued. But there are so many resources to inspire you to switch things up food-wise, try new workouts and find your way forward. When you’re feeling discouraged, the key is to not give up. There were times when I wanted to throw discipline to the wind and eat mac and cheese and cookies for dinner. But I didn’t, and eventually, I saw results.\n\nIs WeightWatchers worth it?\n\nI would not be doing WeightWatchers three years later if I didn’t think it was worth it. I am living proof that WeightWatchers can work. But the keyword here is can. You have to put in work and make some sacrifices. If you don’t follow your plan thoroughly or “cheat” a lot, you’re only cheating yourself. I’d be lying if I said I’ve never fallen off the wagon—after three years of tracking, I’ve relaxed my food logging a bit. But I’m still able to maintain my weight and even continue to lose weight. That just proves that the program really motivates you to stick to a healthier lifestyle. So sometimes my weight will fluctuate, but because of the lessons ingrained in me and the resources that WeightWatchers provides when needed, I’ve learned how to not completely sabotage myself.\n\nIn total, I’ve lost 30 pounds and have cultivated a healthier mentality towards food. I’m much more conscious of how healthy certain foods or ingredients are and exercise caution with those that are not. The program helps me to make better decisions when given the choice between an indulgent meal and a healthier option. I now feel empowered when I turn down unhealthy options, and I find ways to make healthier choices more appealing.\n\nYou may find that you don’t want to pay for this program forever, but in my experience, it provides a great starting point for a lifelong journey of taking care of your body. For now, it keeps me in check. And once you internalize how WeightWatchers works and why, you can retain healthy habits for long after you use this program—or, of course, rejoin if you need a refresher.\n\nThere’s a lot more where this came from.

Addressing how much coffee, water or fast food a person consumes can be the first step toward feeling better.\n\n\"Considering that our brain and body function due to the food we ingest, metabolize, and reallocate within ourselves,\" she said, \"it makes perfect sense that what we eat also must influence our biochemistry, which is a substantial part of mental health.\"\n\nSo, if food plays a part in our mood, then what should we eat to feel our best?\n\nQuinoa\n\nEnjoying its time in the limelight is quinoa, the protein-packed whole grain popular among those looking for substitutes for rice and pasta.\n\nDelbridge said studies have found a flavonoid in quinoa has a significant anti-depressant effect.\n\nSalmon\n\nSalmon is packed with omega 3 fatty acids, which are proven to improve our mood. Omega 3s, Delbridge described, play a vital part of our body’s cell manufacturing and makes our hair and skin shiny, even giving the appearance of happiness.\n\nYet, he said, the fish is under-consumed. Most people he talks to eat it fewer than one time per month.\n\nIf you can’t afford the fresh stuff, Delbridge suggests canned salmon. Simply not a fan? Fish oil supplements contribute the same mood-boosting effects.\n\nMushrooms\n\nVitamin D boosts mood and has anti-depressant qualities. Mushrooms have a ton.\n\nWe usually get our Vitamin D from the sun. But it's also found in mushrooms, milk, beef, chicken livers and fatty fish, notes Marjorie Nolan Cohn, a registered dietitian and founder of Philadelphia-based MNC Nutrition.\n\nVitamin D’s main role is converting and regulating the conversion of tryptophan into serotonin. The goal, Cohn said, is to maintain the right amount of serotonin, which can ward off depression and anxiety. Too much or too little serotonin can have adverse effects.\n\nShe recommends a Vitamin D supplement for many of her patients.\n\nDark chocolate\n\nYes, this is true. Dark chocolate has plenty of health benefits, including easing emotional stress, according to a 2009 American Chemical Society trial.\n\nRegistered dietitian nutritionist Sonya Angelone said dark chocolate boosts mood because it raises endorphin levels. Angelone advises choosing the dark chocolate with at least 70% cacao.\n\nFoods with probiotics – i.e. kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut\n\nProbiotics are bacteria living in our intestines and known for aiding in digestion, boosting the immune system and cleaning our gut.\n\nThey’re a key contributor to the health of the gut-brain axis and have a calming effect on the body and specifically helps with aggression, notes Delbridge.\n\nFermented dairy foods contain probiotics, such as kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles and yogurt.\n\nB6 vitamins – poultry, leafy greens, beef\n\nB6 vitamins are vital for converting tryptophan into serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a primary role in mood, learning, appetite and impulse control, Cohn said.\n\nB6 is found in poultry, seafood, beef, leafy greens, spinach, kale.\n\nGrapes\n\nGrapes contain something called resveratrol, Angelone said, an antioxidant proven to boost mood.\n\nFolic acid – bok choy, turnip greens\n\nFolic acid deficiencies lead to a drop in serotonin levels.\n\nCohn said folic acid also is good for fetal brain development. Look for leafy greens like spinach, bok choy and turnip greens.\n\nVitamin C\n\nVitamin C is a great way to boost your immune system with antioxidants.\n\nYour immune system and your brain are connected. People who are not physically well often cite their condition as a source of depression. Plus, Vitamin C binds to free radicals, allowing the body to more easily remove them, said Cohn.\n\nVitamin C is found in broccoli, oranges, kale, strawberries, mangoes and kiwis.\n\nMagnesium\n\nStatistics, notes Cohn, show large parts of our population could be deficient in magnesium, which plays a role in hundreds of different metabolic functions and helps balance serotonin.\n\nIt’s found in dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, pumpkin seeds, avocados, whole grains, yogurt, kefir and Swiss chard.\n\nDespite the benefits of these foods, medical experts claim any one food isn’t the elixir for a steady mind. Sleep, a person's eating patterns and exercise also play a part. Gupta adds eating is not a substitute for therapy or medication.\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter:@SeanRossman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/health/mediterranean-diet-2022-best-diet-wellness/index.html", "title": "Mediterranean diet named best diet for 2022 | CNN", "text": "Sign up for our Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style newsletter , an eight-part series that guides you in a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that's good for your health.\n\n(CNN) It's a winning streak that just won't quit.

And right now -- during these stressful times of the pandemic -- that's especially helpful for people,\" Schueller said. \"We want food we can enjoy. And we want food that will maintain our health, maybe even boost our immunity. The top-ranked diets offer this.\"\n\nMediterranean diet\n\nIn addition to its top spot as best overall diet, the Mediterranean style of eating also captured the blue ribbon in the following categories: easiest diets to follow; best diets for healthy eating; best diets for diabetes and best plant-based diets.\n\nThe diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions.\n\nRed meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy omega 3 oil-packed fish is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet.\n\nSocial interactions during meals and exercise are basic cornerstones of the Mediterranean style of eating. Lifestyle changes that are part of the diet include eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise.\n\nBest diet for heart health\n\nIn the best heart-healthy diet category, the Mediterranean diet shared the winner's circle with the Ornish diet, which was created in 1977 by Dr. Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California. Today the diet is offered via the consumer health website Sharecare.\n\nOnly 10% of calories can come from fat, very little of it saturated, the report said : \"Most foods with any cholesterol or refined carbohydrates, oils, excessive caffeine and nearly all animal products besides egg whites and one cup per day of nonfat milk or yogurt are banned, though the plan includes some seeds and nuts.\"\n\nWhile experts agree that the diet can be overly restrictive and hard to follow, according to Ornish it's the only scientifically proven program to reverse heart disease without drugs or surgery, as shown in a randomized clinical trial.\n\nThe diet is combined with stress-management techniques, exercise, social support and smoking cessation, which \"formed the basis of Ornish's landmark heart disease-reversal trial in the 1990s,\" the report said.\n\nBest diet for diabetes\n\nIn the best diet for diabetes category, the Mediterranean diet took top honors. Tied for second place were the flexitarian and vegan diets.\n\nThe flexitarian diet is a combination of two words: flexible and vegetarian. With this diet, you don't have to swear off meat completely. You can be a plant eater most of the time and have the occasional steak or burger. A mostly plant-based diet is linked to overall better health and longevity, the report said, including a lower rate of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.\n\nThe vegan diet takes vegetarianism a step further by eliminating all animal products -- even dairy and eggs. That means \"no refried beans with lard, margarine made with whey and anything with gelatin, which comes from animal bones and hooves,\" the report said.\n\nBest overall diet for weight loss\n\nFor this category, the popular WW (formely called Weight Watchers) plan tied with the flexitarian and Volumentrics diets for the No. 1 spot.\n\nThe flexitarian diet wants you to add foods to your diet such as non-meat proteins like beans, peas or eggs, as well as fruits and veggies, whole grains, dairy and seasonings. Then you try to follow the following calorie counts, the report said: \"Breakfast choices are around 300 calories, lunches 400 and dinners 500. Snacks are about 150 calories each; add two, and your daily total clocks in at 1,500 calories.\"\n\n\"If you emphasize the plant-based component of this diet -- eating lots of fruits, veggies and whole grains -- you'll likely feel full on fewer calories than you're accustomed to,\" according to the analysis of the flexitarian diet . \"Research shows vegetarians tend to eat fewer calories, weigh less and have a lower body mass index (a measure of body fat) than their meat-eating peers.\"\n\nThe WW plan, which along with the Mayo Clinic diet tied for first in best commercial diets, has an important component needed in any successful diet, the report said: social support. In addition to in-person meetings and optional one-on-one consultants, the plan offers an online community.\n\n\"A backbone of the program is support via the WW app, expert-led workshops and Digital 360 plans to provide practical tools and behavior-change techniques for help along the way,\" the analysis said\n\nThe Volumentrics diet is all about cutting the energy density (calories) of the foods you eat. One of the best ways is to eat a lot of foods that are high in water, as that increases the weight of food in your stomach without packing in additional calories. Top choices include soups, which the report said is 80% to 95% water; fruits and vegetables which are 80% to 95% water and yogurt, which is about 75% water.\n\nBest diet for quick weight loss\n\nThe quick weight loss category is for the person who needs to lose a few pounds for a special occasion. These eating plans are not recommended as a long-term manner of eating, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe Atkins Diet , created in 1972 by cardiologist Dr. Robert Atkins, took first place in this category. The diet involves four phases of meal plans, starting with very few carbs and adding more as the diet progresses.\n\nHowever, \"low-carb dieters may eat too much fat, raising health concerns,\" the analysis found, giving the diet a 34 out of 40 in the overall rankings.\n\nThe Health Management Resources Program, or HMR, tied for second place with the OPTAVIA diet.\n\nThe HMR program is a weight loss and lifestyle-change program designed to reduce calories via meal replacements that include added fruits and vegetables. The two-week starter kit is just shy of $200 and includes 70 servings of HMR shakes and entrées, support materials, weekly group coaching and free shipping, the report said.\n\nThe OPTAVIA diet wants you to buy its \"Fuelings\" and supplement them with a \"Lean & Green\" meal (one meat, veggie and healthy fat entrée) each day.\n\n\"Between 10 to 35 percent of daily calories come from protein,\" the report said, which is more than government nutritional guidelines suggest. \"Prices for OPTAVIA's Optimal Weight 5&1 Plan range from about $400 to $450 for 119 servings, or about three weeks' worth; that's about $13-$15 per day.\"\n\nBoth HMR and OPTAVIA came in at 27 out of 40 diets in the overall ratings, according to the report.\n\nComing in last\n\nThe Dukan Diet landed at the bottom of the rankings of best diets. Other poor performers included Whole30, which tied for 35th place and the popular keto diet, which tied with the modified keto diet for the 37th spot.\n\nThe Dukin, Whole30 and keto diets, which emphasize eating high-protein or high-fat foods with minimal carbohydrates, are typically rated poorly by experts because they are extremely restrictive, hard to follow and eliminate entire food groups, which is not recommended by dietary guidelines.\n\nGetting started on the Mediterranean diet\n\nWant to make the Mediterranean diet one of your goals this year? Get started by cooking one meal each week based on beans, whole grains and vegetables, using herbs and spices to add punch. When one night a week is a breeze, add two, and build your nonmeat meals from there\n\nGrains that have changed little over the centuries, known as \"ancient grains,\" are also a key feature of the Mediterranean diet. Quinoa, amaranth, millet, farro , spelt, Kamut (a wheat grain said to be discovered in an Egyptian tomb) and teff (an Ethiopian grain about the size of a poppy seed) are some examples of ancient grains.\n\nWhen you do eat meat, have small amounts. For a main course, that means no more than 3 ounces of chicken or lean meat. Better yet: Use small pieces of chicken or slices of lean meat to flavor a veggie-based meal, such as a stir fry.\n\nAnd rethink dessert. Mediterranean cultures typically close out meals with fruit that's in season.\n\nIf you tire of eating raw fresh fruit, get creative. Poach pears in pomegranate juice with a bit of honey, then reduce the sauce and serve over Greek yogurt. Grill pineapple or other fruits and drizzle with honey. Make a sorbet out of fruit, including avocado (it's really a fruit). Stuff a fig or date with goat cheese and sprinkle on a few nuts. Create a brown rice apple crisp or even a whole-wheat fruit tart.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/victor-panichkul/2014/12/18/registration-now-open-oregon-wine-symposium/20593485/", "title": "Registration now open for Oregon Wine Symposium", "text": "Victor Panichkul\n\nStatesman Journal\n\nRegistration is now open for the largest annual wine industry educational event in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe Oregon Wine Symposium is scheduled for Feb. 24-25 at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland.\n\nIn addition to speakers and seminars, there will be more than 145 trade show exhibitors showcasing a wide range of products.\n\nKeynote speaker Michael Dorf, founder and CEO of City Winery, a unique urban wine venue that combines live music with winemaker tastings and talks, will share his story of growing his innovative wine business from scratch.

But could French-style yogurt become the new darling of the dairy aisle?\n\nExperts think so, but aren't sold on French's ability to dethrone Greek. However, they say Yoplait, with its new Oui brand of French-style yogurt, could be setting a trend for higher-end yogurts.\n\nFrench-style yogurt differs from regular yogurt because it's made in small batches, in glass jars with a few ingredients. The process mimics how yogurt was made in French farmhouses a century ago, explained David Clark, president of U.S. yogurt for Yoplait owner General Mills.\n\n\"It's essentially the same ingredients that yogurt is made from,\" said registered dietitian nutritionist Wesley Delbridge. \"It's just made in a different way.\"\n\nFrench-style means placing whole milk and yogurt cultures in a small glass pot and letting it culture together in the glass. Yoplait said this takes about eight hours. Typically, yogurt is made in large batches and then put in small containers.\n\nRead more:\n\nThese foods will boost your mood and make you happy\n\nThese foods get a bad rap, but are actually good for you\n\nThese 'health foods' may be bad for you\n\nThe result is a thicker, firmer yogurt that isn't as tart, Delbridge explained. Some have described it as similar to butter or heavy cream with a subtle sweetness.\n\n\"It's not necessarily better for you than Greek yogurt or better for you than just plain yogurt,\" said Delbridge, a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \"It's just about the user experience and kind of what your preferences are on taste and cost.\"\n\nYoplait's Oui, which comes in plain and fruit-on-the-bottom varieties, has more fat and calories and less protein than its Greek counterparts.\n\nA 5-ounce cup of black cherry Oui yogurt has 160 calories, 7 grams of fat and 5 grams of protein. A 5.3-ounce cup of Chobani's black cherry Greek yogurt has 120 calories, no fat and 12 grams of protein. Both have about the same amount of sugar. Oui has 15 grams, Chobani has 16 grams.\n\nWill French replace Greek?\n\nGlobal food trendologist Christine Couvelier said Yoplait's play at authenticity taps into the food market's move toward authenticity.\n\n\"Consumers want to know more about the story and they want to know more the authenticity of products,\" she explained. \"The romance of it and the story behind it is so important.\"\n\nThe chances French-style yogurt can replicate the success of Greek yogurt will come down to advertising, said Phil Lempert, an expert on grocery store trends.\n\nThe run on Greek has impacted General Mills. Late last year, analysts downgraded the company's stock outlook. Now recent earnings show its North American yogurt sales dipped 18% last year as consumers drifted toward Greek and other natural foods.\n\nLempert said French could steal a little bit of the market from Greek, but it would attract a different type of customer, those who want more indulgence and do not care how many containers they can get for $10.\n\n\"It's not about price anymore,\" Lempert said. \"What it's about is this whole formula of value.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nCoconut oil isn't healthy.

But you’re not the only one gearing up for the big event. Small business owners are also priming themselves for an influx of sales that rival the holiday rush.\n\nFor some sellers, Amazon’s annual event – happening this year June 21-22 – is responsible for months’ worth of revenue in just a few days. The sales swell is driven in part by promotional deals, such as the popular “Spend $10, Get $10” offer available during the two weeks prior to Prime Day from June 7 – 20. Prime members who spend $10 on select small business products on Amazon will get a $10 credit to spend on Prime Day. This year, more than 2.5 million customers bought small business products in the first twenty-four hours of the promotion.\n\n“Our first Prime Day was quite an experience,” she said. “Nobody knew quite what to expect. We happened to be traveling to a trade show that day, and I remember looking down at my phone in astonishment while racing through the airport. We sold a year's worth of products in a few hours.”\n\nHere’s how Burner and three other small business owners sell on Amazon, the boost they see during Prime Day, and what they’re doing in preparation for this year’s big event.\n\n1. Buttonsmith\n\nBurner started listing her company’s products – customizable dog collars, lanyards, ID badge reels and more – on Amazon in 2014. The company’s core focus is on high-quality, U.S.-made products, as well as improving the efficiency of the manufacturing process on American soil.\n\n“We’re building U.S. manufacturing for the 21st century,” said Burner. “E-commerce lets us hear directly from customers so that we understand what you want and need, and we can make it and deliver it so quickly you won’t believe it’s been customized.”\n\nBurner isn’t afraid to adapt Buttonsmith’s product offerings to align with the times. Last year, after demand for the hottest fashion accessory of 2020 face masks skyrocketed, the company began producing U.S.-made, fabric masks.\n\n“Last year, we sold more than $5 million in goods on Amazon because we could reach customers. They could tell us what they wanted, and we could adapt incredibly quickly using our software and our U.S. supply chain,” said Burner. “We designed and sold three entire iterations of masks, based on feedback from customers about how to make them better.”\n\nThis year, Buttonsmith is refocusing on its original product offerings – fashionable pup-cessories.\n\n“We’re thinking that people with pandemic puppies might want more of our cute dog collars and leashes as everyone ventures back out into the world,” Burner explained.\n\nIn preparation for Prime Day, Buttonsmith’s Carnation, Washington-based manufacturing team has been working diligently to ensure they have enough parts on hand to meet anticipated demand.\n\n“We’re putting most of our best-selling products on sale and hoping it will be an opportunity for lots of customers to treat themselves,” she said.\n\n2. Volcanica Coffee\n\nVolcanica Coffee is a specialty retailer of exotic coffees sourced from volcanic regions around the world. The mineral-rich soil in these locales produces aromatic and truly remarkable flavors, explained Maurice Contreras, the company’s founder and president.\n\n“We are a family-owned business that started in our garage in 2004,” said Contreras, who set up shop on Amazon back in 2009. “Amazon has resulted in a new avenue of sales and introduced us to many new customers. We started slow, but the momentum kept building each year. As we realized the potential, we added more coffees.”\n\nVolcanica currently carries more than 100 different coffees in their store on Amazon, spanning single-origin, estate, peaberry, decaf and flavored brews.\n\nPrime Day results in “significant” traffic for the small business, Contreras noted – and as much as a 20-30% boost in sales.\n\n“We treat this as a Black Friday sale with an enormous surge in a short amount of time,” he said.\n\nTo prepare for Prime Day, Volcanica is reviewing listings, increasing advertising budgets and ramping up supply to cover the expected surge.\n\n3. Oats Overnight\n\nBrian Tate started selling Oats Overnight, a high-protein, spoon-free breakfast product, on Amazon in early 2018. After launching on the platform, he saw sales steadily grow – to the point where Amazon sales now make up a full quarter of the company’s gross revenue.\n\nOats Overnight comes in 13 premium flavors, like strawberries & cream and blueberry cobbler, and there’s about 20 grams of protein in each serving. The oats used in the product are gluten-free and 100% whole grain.\n\nCustomers can’t get enough, and they’re quick to share their glowing reviews online. “Due to the trusted review system on Amazon, customers feel confident trying our unique product,” added Tate.\n\nTo get ready for Prime Day this year, Tate and his team are doubling down on marketing efforts. In past years, Oats Overnight has seen sales double during Prime Day and its lead-up.\n\nTate hopes for a similar trend during this year’s event.\n\n4. MEandMine\n\nAn award-winning brand focused on science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM), MEandMine makes social-emotional learning play kits for kids ages 4-6.\n\n“Our kits are systematically designed by a group of pediatricians, psychologists, educators and parents, and co-created with kids,” explained Sandy Yu, the company’s head of marketing. “Our mission is to help kids nurture endless creativity, resilience, happiness and a lifelong love of self through play.”\n\nMEandMine began selling their products on Amazon late last year. The first three kits they launched on the platform received such stellar reviews that they hit $18,000 in sales in just three days.\n\n“There was a huge demand for educational toys on Amazon last year, given COVID and shelter in place,” said Yu.\n\nThe company launched on Amazon right before last year’s Prime Day, so they weren’t able to take part in deals or release any new features for the event. Still, Yu said MEandMine’s products got excellent traction via organic search and ad exposure.\n\n“Our products were in high demand given the positive reviews and the fact that parents were all frantically searching for educational toys,” Yu said.\n\nMEandMine now has seven types of kits listed on Amazon, and they plan to launch a couple more in the next few weeks.\n\n“We’re hoping to connect with more new shoppers,” added Yu, “and grow the MEandMine X STEAM Play community through Prime Day.”\n\nBe sure to check out Amazon’s “support small” hub to learn how you can shop at small businesses during this year’s Prime Day, happening June 7-20.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/09/30/40-best-gifts-brothers-gift-ideas-your-sibling-brother-law/3585405001/", "title": "40 best gifts for brothers - Gift ideas for your sibling or brother in law", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Wonder and Franklin, who died in 2018, each have had 20 songs top the chart.\n\nOf Drake’s 21 No. 1 hits on the R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart, 12 include him in the leading role, including “God’s Plan,” “In My Feelings,” “Hotline Bling,” “Hold On, We’re Going Home” and “Best I Ever Had,” his first major hit released in 2009. Nine of his No. 1 successes are songs he co-starred on, including “Work” with Rihanna, “Moment 4 Life” with Nicki Minaj, “Fall for Your Type” with Jamie Foxx and “I Invented Sex” with Trey Songz.\n\nEarlier this year, 34-year-old Drake made Billboard chart history when he set a new record for most songs on the Hot 100 chart — Billboard’s main songs chart that includes all music genres.\n\nAt the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, Drake broke Taylor Swift’s record for most wins.

If he reaches this industry pinnacle, he'd be the first artist to simultaneously debut a song atop the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Song chart, according to a video Combs posted Wednesday asking fans to support his run for Nashville history.\n\nIf it bows in the top slot, \"Forever After All\" would be the 45th song in Billboard history to debut at No.1 on the Hot 100, according to the trade publication, and first from a country artist since Carrie Underwood released her post-\"American Idol\" single \"Inside Your Heaven\" in 2005 (country radio programmers however didn't set sights on Underwood until her next single, \"Jesus, Take The Wheel\").\n\nCombs wants to \"go down swinging\" as he faces off with a new single from pop powerhouse Ariana Grande and lingering hits from 24kGoldn, Cardi B with Megan Thee Stallion, Drake and Nashville's hitmaking newcomer Gabby Barrett.\n\nListen to Ariana Grande's new single, 'Positions,' from anxiously awaited sixth album\n\n\"We're in one of these rare situations that I don't know if we'll ever be in again,\" Combs told The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, this week. \"I'd like to just go down swinging, I think.

I figured let's throw one more haymaker at 'em and see if it lands.\"\n\nThe song — a heartfelt midtempo love story released weeks after Combs tied the knot longtime girlfriend Nicole Hocking — comes off \"What You See Ain't Always What You Get,\" a 23-song deluxe album released last week in follow-up to his 2019 record \"What You See Is What You Get.\"\n\nCombs first teased the song on TikTok in August, belting the grizzled lyrics \"They say nothin' lasts forever/ But they ain't seen us together/ The way the moonlight dances in your eyes ...\" in a teaser clip.\n\nThe song follows \"Beautiful Crazy\" and \"Better Together\" in a line of first-person love stories that aided in Combs earning his spot among Nashville's top entertainers.\n\n\"You could write a generic love song, and not to say it couldn't be done, but my wife's impact on my life has weighed heavily on the outcome of these songs,\" Combs said. \"These songs wouldn't exist without her. I don't think I would've been in that headspace -- or been comfortable saying those kind of things -- without going through that.\"\n\n'I heard a YES':Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are engaged\n\nCombs \"couldn't of imagined this level of response\" to the song, he said. It earned nearly 11 million plays on Spotify since debuting last week, and the new deluxe album set a record on the streaming platform for most first-day plays from a country release.\n\nMoreover, \"Forever After All\" reached No. 1 on Apple Music's Daily Top 100: Global Songs chart and set a record for most first-day streams from a country song on the competing digital platform.\n\nBillboard calculates Hot 100 position via a combination of U.S. streaming, radio and sales data. The chart debuts Top 10 songs each Monday.\n\n\"All I can ever hope out of a song is somebody finds a connection to it that's special to them,\" Combs said. \"'Even Though I'm Leaving' is a song I've put out that people have found a piece of their own persona stories in. This song is similar to that, just in a different emotional range.\"\n\nHe recorded a handful of deluxe tracks in June, including country quarantine anthem \"Six Feet Apart\" and \"Without You,\" a collaboration with ace Nashville songwriter-fiddle player Amanda Shires.\n\n\"Forever After All\" was the oldest song in Combs collection of new cuts — \"I'm always a fan of having one in your back pocket,\" he said. He wrote it around January 2019, after moving into a new Tennessee home.\n\n\"I always wanna put out something I feel is worth people spending their money on,\" Combs said of his new release. \"I've never been a cash grab guy. ... That's never case. I think it's some of the strongest stuff that we've put out.\"\n\nSince 2016, Combs has launched his first nine inescapable radio singles (could a country music fan tune in anywhere last year and not hear his blasting \"Long. Neck. Ice. Cold.\" chorus in \"Beer Never Broke My Heart\" or the ready-for-any-wedding slow dance groove of \"Beautiful Crazy\"?) to top the Billboard Country Airplay chart\n\nHe's the only solo artist to send his first nine singles to No. 1 of the all-important country chart, and it's not even close. Clint Black sent his first four singles to top of the country chart during the height of his influential 1989 \"Killin' Time\" album cycle.\n\nHe'll take this monumental momentum into the CMA Awards next month, where Combs competes for Entertainer of the Year.\n\n\"You think people love it and you hope that they do ... and they do,\" Combs said. \"I'm just thankful for that. When something's really good, you just don't ask questions.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/11/23/grammy-nominations-snubs-and-surprises-2022-awards-drake-bts-jon-batiste/8724506002/", "title": "Grammy 2022 snubs: BTS, Drake shorted; Miley Cyrus shut out", "text": "It wouldn’t be an awards show without an accompanying list of grievances.\n\nBut while the nominations for the 64th annual Grammy Awards certainly validated the Recording Academy’s revived commitment to diversity, some familiar names – and frequent visitors to the Grammy podium – were either shunned or relegated to smaller genre categories.\n\nBillie Eilish, Doja Cat, H.E.R. and Olivia Rodrigo are among the top nominees this year, while jazz-R&B musician Jon Batiste scored a leading 11 nominations.\n\nBut popular chart-toppers including Drake, Miley Cyrus and BTS didn't get much love.\n\n“The thing that keeps me up at night is that we don’t get a chance to honor all of the amazing projects produced every year,” Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason Jr. tells USA TODAY. “I come from the music sphere and know the feeling of putting your heart and soul into a project, hoping to get recognized. But we only have 10 slots and one winner (for each category).”\n\nGrammys 2022: Check out the nominees\n\nMore Grammys: What to know about Jon Batiste\n\nAmong the notable snubs and surprises:\n\nGrammys 2022 snubs\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nDespite a guest list featuring Stevie Nicks, Joan Jett, Dua Lipa and Billy Idol, Cyrus’ seventh studio album, “Plastic Hearts” was blanked. Maybe voters didn’t cotton to her valentine to the ’80s, which is a shame. The release not only brims with Cyrus’ passion for the era but singles “Prisoner” (with Dua Lipa) and “Angels Like You” (featuring a co-write with Ryan Tedder) exemplify her ability to marry authenticity with rock charm.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly\n\nHis fifth studio album, \"Tickets to My Downfall,\" established Kelly as a pop-punkster who formally ditched his hip-hop roots. Still, his slick, guitar-fronted anthems didn't warrant a single nod. But between his ongoing musical partnership with Blink-182's Travis Barker and a hit rock single with \"Papercuts,\" from his upcoming \"Born with Horns\" album, MGK should have a reason for future Grammy consideration.\n\nDrake\n\nPrepare for another round of Drake vs. Kanye. The latter scored an album of the year nod for his much-tinkered with “Donda.” But Drake, despite breaking Spotify records, becoming the eighth artist in Billboard history to earn 10 No. 1 albums with “Certified Lover Boy” and outselling Ye with first-week sales, was only recognized for best rap album and best rap performance (“Way 2 Sexy” with Future and Young Thug). The Weeknd would like a word.\n\nBTS\n\nWe’ll acknowledge that “Butter” isn’t as hearty a slice of pop perfection as its predecessor, “Dynamite.” But it’s still a blissfully fun contribution from the K-pop superstars – not to mention the song of summer that broke a record on Spotify’s global chart for biggest song debut in the platform’s history. So only one nod for best pop duo/group performance? The BTS Army would like a word.\n\nMore awards: Brutally honest reviews of AMAs performances\n\nMegan Thee Stallion\n\nA nomination for best rap performance (“Thot S---”) is acceptable, but the most recent best new artist winner had every reason to expect that her debut album, “Good News,” would earn a few back slaps. The critically acclaimed release bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart, spawned the platinum singles “Body” and “Cry Baby” (with DaBaby) and pushed Megan further into the conversation of notable current female rappers.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nThe double Grammy-winner released “Positions” to reasonable acclaim as she continued to push a sound that mingled pop with R&B and trap. Though the album leaned more heavily on breathy ballads of seduction rather than club thumpers, it still earned her a No. 1 single with the title track, which landed a Grammy nod for best pop solo performance. The album will also compete for best pop vocal album, but there was an assumption it would warrant a bigger Grammy spotlight.\n\nLorde\n\n“Solar Power” is among the works that earned Jack Antonoff his producer of the year nomination, but as for the artist herself? MIA this year. While “Solar Power” wasn’t as adored as her 2013 debut “Pure Heroine” or 2017’s “Melodrama,” it signified a stylistic shift that usually appeals to the Grammy crew. Lorde has called “Solar Power” her “weed album” due to the songs being steeped in hazy psychedelic pop and sparser instrumentation than her past work. Apparently, voters preferred her in the clubs.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nAs we know from her “Miss Americana” documentary, the album of the year category is the one that Swift covets the most, so no doubt she’s pleased with “Evermore” landing among the year’s heavyweights. But whither “Willow,” which she performed as part of a medley at this year’s Grammy ceremony? Or “No Body, No Crime,” which returned Swift to her country radio roots? The omissions make Swift's album nod seem obligatory, which it certainly is not.\n\nMorgan Wallen\n\nRecording Academy honcho Mason confirmed the embattled country singer was eligible to be nominated (“As long as the requirements meet our standards as far as date and genre, we don’t decide who is eligible,” Mason told USA TODAY). But despite the massive commercial success of “Dangerous: The Double Album,” and hit singles “Sand in My Boots,” “7 Summers” and “More Than My Hometown,” Grammy voters didn’t acknowledge Wallen, who was caught on camera uttering a racial slur in February.\n\nAlicia Keys, Kacey Musgraves, Lizzo\n\nOne year you’re a Grammy darling and the next cycle, a distant memory. Well, not completely. Keys, who has earned an impressive 15 Grammys (amid 29 nominations), popped up only in the best immersive audio album category (recordings released on formats such as DVD-Audio, Atmos and Blu-Ray) for “Alicia” and shares a record of the year nod not for her solo work, but “A Beautiful Noise,” which she performed with Brandi Carlile on “Every Vote Counts: A Celebration of Democracy” (it’s also on the digital version of “Alicia”).\n\nMeanwhile, former album of the year winner Musgraves, whose “Golden Hour” garnered an armload of trophies at the 2019 ceremony between the general and country categories, only nabbed a bit of recognition for “Camera Roll” (best country song and best country solo performance), from her current album (aka \"the divorce one\"), “Star-Crossed.”\n\nAs for Lizzo, she’s just a year removed from scoring her first three career Grammys, but her 2021 single with Cardi B, “Rumors,” didn’t merit any attention.\n\nGrammys 2022 surprises\n\nJon Batiste\n\nFaithful viewers of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” are well-aware of Batiste’s nimble musicianship with his band, Stay Human. But even with the jazz/R&B trailblazer’s sterling resume, his 11 nominations – the most among any artist this year – his isn’t a name expected among the album of the year (“We Are”) and record of the year (“Freedom”) lineups. It’s been a celebratory period for Batiste, who snagged an Academy Award in 2021 for best original score for “Soul.” Despite three previous Grammy nominations, he has yet to win. But with his current multiple nominations spread across jazz, R&B, American roots and classical categories, that will likely change in January.\n\nABBA\n\nWe’re the first to agree that ABBA’s absence among Grammy winners is blasphemous. But we’re also rational enough to realize that while their ’70s and ’80s output – “Mamma Mia,” “Waterloo,” “Dancing Queen” “The Winner Takes It All” – was undoubtedly deserving of awards praise, the single “I Still Have Faith In You,” from the group’s first album (“Voyage”) in 40-plus years, is an odd inclusion for record of the year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/10/14/pooh-shiesty-arrest-trial-life-in-prison-memphis-rapper/6096564001/", "title": "Pooh Shiesty: Memphis rapper faces life in prison in Florida case", "text": "Memphis rapper Pooh Shiesty started the year as one of hip-hop’s hottest new artists, but after a series of arrests he’s now facing the possibility of life in prison.\n\nShiesty — real name Lontrell Williams — has been jailed in Florida since July on charges related to an October 2020 incident where he was allegedly involved in the robbery and shooting of two men outside a hotel in Miami-Dade County.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the charges in a federal indictment, which carry a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His trial is set to begin Oct. 25.\n\nThe Commercial Appeal reached out to Shiesty's attorneys and record label for comment, but did not receive a response.\n\nHere are five things to know about Shiesty’s career and his legal troubles.\n\nRising rapper: 'Shiesty Season' is here\n\nChosen by Spotify's \"Rap Caviar\" as one of the \"10 Artists to Watch in 2021,\" the 21-year-old Pooh Shiesty became the latest young Memphis rap sensation, hitting the Billboard Hot 100 and Emerging Artist charts and making Rolling Stone's \"Breakthrough 25\" rankings. He was handpicked by rapper-mogul Gucci Mane to sign to his The New 1017 label and released his \"Shiesty Season\" mixtape earlier this year.\n\nRaised around South Memphis' Cane Creek Apartments, Shiesty is a second-generation Memphis rapper. His father founded the Bluff City label Mob Ties Records and rapped under the name Mob Boss, steeping him in the family business from a young age.\n\nShiesty got his start with a group of friends known as Choppa Gang. After a couple years away from Memphis, living with his mother in Texas, Shiesty returned to the Mid-South and started focusing on his music. As part of the Choppa Gang collective — which also included Big30, Choppa T and K Shiesty — he first gained notice with the track \"Breaking News,\" released in 2018.\n\n'A GANGSTA'S PAIN':Moneybagg Yo thrills Memphis crowd at homecoming concert\n\nMEMPHIS RAP:Yo Gotti becomes co-owner of Major League Soccer's D.C. United\n\nOn the heels of \"Breaking News,\" Shiesty began to develop a major underground buzz with performances on tracks like \"Hell Night\" (featuring Big30), \"Day One\" and \"Choppa Talk.\" Further fame followed in 2019 with \"Shiesty Summer\" released that August. The track would go viral, with the YouTube video for the song eventually getting close to 10 million views. His numbers would grow exponentially with the anthemic follow-up \"7.62 God,\" which would further put Shiesty on the music biz map.\n\nIn spring 2020, fate would intervene in the form of Grammy-nominated, platinum-certified rapper Gucci Mane. Gucci messaged Shiesty on Instagram, and in short order offered him a record deal, specifically a chance to be part of his The New 1017 label venture with Atlantic Records.\n\nThe association with Gucci quickly helped up Shiesty's profile, as did a series of further hits and notable collaborations including \"Monday to Sunday\" (featuring Lil Baby and Big30), a remix of \"Main Slime\" (with fellow Memphians Moneybagg Yo and Tay Keith), and his \"Back In Blood\" (a team-up with Lil Durk that would eventually go platinum).\n\nShiesty hit the upper reaches of Billboard this spring, placing at No. 4 on the albums chart with \"Shiesty Season,\" while his video for the single \"Back in Blood,\" hit the No. 1 spot on YouTube's U.S. video charts, and he made his national TV debut on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”\n\nPersonal loss: Pooh Shiesty's brother dies\n\nThis past February, just as he was celebrating his growing success, Shiesty lost his brother, fellow hip-hop artist TeeDa P. Born Tarrance Henderson, TeeDa P died on Feb. 28.\n\nWhile the family did not confirm the cause of death, various outlets reported he had been battling brain cancer and Pooh Shiesty had canceled a series of concerts just before his passing. TeeDa P had been gaining notice himself as a rapper since releasing a series of singles in 2019. His new album, \"Halftime,\" came out earlier this year.\n\nShiesty publicly mourned his brother and received messages of support from a number of fellow rappers, including Memphis-rooted superstar Drake.\n\nLegal troubles: Pooh Shiesty arrested in Florida\n\nShiesty's legal issues began in October 2020, when federal authorities allege he was involved in the robbery and shooting of two men outside a hotel in Miami-Dade County, Florida.\n\nThe FBI would eventually indict him and two others on charges of discharging a firearm during a violent crime, conspiracy and robbery under a law regulating commerce. Shiesty, along with Jayden Darosa and Bobby Brown, went to the Landon Hotel in Bay Harbor Islands, Florida, in October to purchase \"high-end athletic sneakers\" and marijuana, according to the criminal complaint by Miami-Dade FBI Detective Elio Garcia.\n\nShiesty arrived in a McLaren he rented from one of the victims and wanted to negotiate the car's rental as well, but during the transaction, he and Brown shot the men — one in the hip and the other in the butt, according to the court documents. The FBI said surveillance footage captured the shooting and after law enforcement spoke with the victims they identified one of the suspects as Shiesty.\n\nWhile leaving the scene, a Louis Vuitton bag — which had $40,912 in cash — fell out of the McLaren and, according to the complaint, Shiesty had posted guns and $100 bills on Instagram days before the robbery.\n\nLaw enforcement utilized the rapper's social media account and found the same bills in the Louis Vuitton bag were also in his posts, the court document said.\n\nShiesty was arrested but released from custody shortly after the incident.\n\nStrip club shooting: Pooh Shiesty arrested in Florida again\n\nShiesty was again arrested in June 2021 in connection with a Memorial Day weekend shooting of a security guard at strip club in Northwest Miami called King of Diamonds.\n\nAccording to a review of the affidavits in the case by Rolling Stone, the incident began when Shiesty “allegedly pulled a black semi-automatic pistol from his waistband and waved it around the King of Diamonds club in Miami… after he dropped some cash on the ground and purportedly worried patrons might grab it. As security tried to remove him from the building, he allegedly fired a shot, striking a security guard in the ankle.”\n\nAccording to his attorneys, Shiesty is facing a “mandatory minimum of 20 years” if convicted of the shooting.\n\nOn June 9, Shiesty was granted a $10,000 bond by a Florida judge on aggravated battery charges related to the King of Diamonds incident. But he was ordered to remain in jail until another judge ruled on his status in the Landon Hotel shooting.\n\nA few weeks later, on June 29, Shiesty was formally indicted in the Landon Hotel shooting. In early July, a federal judge ordered that he be held without bond. Shiesty has been held at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami since then.\n\nMEMPHIS RAPPERS TO KNOW:These 5 pioneers of Memphis rap helped pave the way for city's current hip-hop renaissance\n\nMEMPHIS CONCERTS:'Legendz of the Streetz' tour date in Memphis pushed to 2022\n\nCourt case: Pooh Shiesty trial set for Oct. 25\n\nAccording to a recent report in Rolling Stone, Shiesty and his attorneys had petitioned the court to delay his trial to Dec. 6, in order to “properly build his defense against claims he was part of an armed drug-trafficking conspiracy dating back to 2019.”\n\nThe outlet notes that, “Prosecutors said they were fine with a delay but that conflicts would push the trial out to February. The feds also told the court they were reviewing ‘new allegations’ and a ‘potential superseding indictment.’”\n\nBut earlier this month, Shiesty and his lawyers did an about face in the strategy, and instead decided it was “in their best interest to proceed to trial” at the end of October. The first day of trial is set for Oct. 25 in the Southern District of Florida Court in Miami.\n\nIn the meantime, Shiesty’s friends and fellow rappers, including his longtime Memphis partner Big30, have rallied around him. Big30 recently released a track called “Free Shiest Life” and has posted support for his friend on social media with the hashtag, #FreeShiesty.\n\nCommercial Appeal reporter Dima Amro contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/12/11/top-moments-2020-music-garth-brooks-taylor-swift-billie-eilish/3884569001/", "title": "Top moments in 2020 music: Garth Brooks breaks Facebook Live ...", "text": "It's been one heckuva year, with the coronavirus pandemic upending seemingly every aspect of our lives.\n\nIn the music industry, album releases were pushed back and surprise quarantine tunes dropped.

It dropped less than 24 hours later.\n\nReviews were extremely positive. USA TODAY's Patrick Ryan called it her \"most introspective and emotionally raw album yet.\"\n\nReview:'Folklore' is the album Taylor Swift was born to make\n\nThe red-hot pop star's eighth album debuted atop the Billboard charts. It was her seventh to debut at No. 1, following in the footsteps of \"Lover,\" \"Reputation,\" \"1989,\" \"Red,\" \"Speak Now\" and \"Fearless.\" Lead single \"Cardigan\" claimed the No. 1 position on Billboard's Hot 100 songs chart, dethroning DaBaby's \"Rockstar.\"\n\nSwift's ninth album, \"Evermore,\" was released Friday.\n\nBTS drops first song in English\n\nK-pop super group BTS blew up the music world in late August with the release of \"Dynamite,\" its first song recorded completely in English.\n\nMembers RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V, Jimin and Jungkook had dropped some English lyrics in songs before, but \"Dynamite\" was a first — and fans were quick to respond. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, unseating Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's \"WAP\" after a two-week run.\n\nBest-selling albums to YouTube records:A look at K-pop group BTS' milestones so far\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, RM explained the song's intention.\n\n\"The goal of 'Dynamite' is really simple ... to explore the world with positive vibes and energy,\" he said. \"We’ve been through all the sadness and desperation, but with this song and performance we just hope the world gets more positive.\"\n\nBattle of the bands: Lady A vs. Lady A\n\nLady Antebellum changed its name to Lady A in June – and things quickly got very messy.\n\nMembers of the country band (Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood) renounced the group's original name, explaining that when they formed 14 years ago, they didn't consider the pre-Civil War \"associations that weigh down this word,\" including its ties to slavery.\n\nBattle of the bands:Blues singer lambasts Lady Antebellum's name change, says she's been Lady A for 20 years\n\nThere was just one problem. Seattle-based singer Anita White said she'd been going by Lady A for nearly three decades.\n\nWhite, who is Black, blasted the country group in an Instagram post, saying: \"How can you say Black Lives Matter and put your knee on the neck of another Black artist? I'm not mad ... I am however not giving up my name, my brand I worked hard for. #GodWillFightMyBattle #TheRealLadyA #LadyABluesSoulFunkGospelArtist #TheTruthIsLoud\"\n\nThe two sides initially said they'd work together to reach a compromise. But those discussions deteriorated and White and her attorneys reportedly asked for a $10 million payment, according to the band's publicist, Tyne Parrish.\n\nIn July, Lady A (the band) filed a trademark lawsuit against White in U.S. District Court in Nashville. \"Reluctantly we have come to the conclusion that we need to ask a court to affirm our right to continue to use the name Lady A, a trademark we have held for many years. It was a stirring in our hearts and reflection on our own blindspots that led us to announce a few weeks ago that we were dropping the word ‘Antebellum' from our name and moving forward using only the name so many of our fans already knew us by,\" the statement said.\n\n'Rockstar' named song of the summer\n\nTo the surprise of pretty much no one, DaBaby's \"Rockstar\" was crowned the 2020 song of the summer by Billboard.\n\nFrom Memorial Day to Labor Day, \"Rockstar\" (featuring Roddy Ricch) held the top spot for 13 of 15 weeks on Billboard's song of the summer tracking list. For seven of those weeks, it was also No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart.\n\nWho is DaBaby?:Meet the chart-topping rapper behind 'Rockstar'\n\nLil Nas X's \"Old Town Road\" was 2019's winner.\n\n\"You can't overlook the star power of DaBaby and Roddy Ricch,\" Billboard senior director of music Jason Lipshutz told USA TODAY. The song has \"a really catchy hook and a video that was eye-popping and spoke to the moment. This is a case of the right artist with the right song at the right time,\" he added.\n\n\"Blinding Lights\" took the second spot, followed by Jack Harlow's \"Whats Poppin\" featuring DaBaby, Tory Lanez and Lil Wayne. Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\" featuring Beyoncé clocked in at No. 4 and SAINt JHN's \"Roses\" rounded out the Top 5.\n\n\"Rockstar\" was streamed 514.6 million times this summer, according to Nielsen Music/MRC Data. \"Blinding Lights\" was the most-heard song on radio with 1.2 billion audience impressions.\n\nKaty Perry announces pregnancy in music video\n\nPop superstar and \"American Idol\" judge Katy Perry revealed a baby bump in the final moments of the music video for single \"Never Worn White,\" her first song of 2020.\n\nDuring the dreamy video, Perry donned an elegant white gown fit for a bride and wore a literal bouquet of flowers while singing a love song to fiancé Orlando Bloom. The singer opened up about overcoming her apprehension to love and marriage in the ballad:\n\nI've never worn white, no\n\nBut I really wanna try with you\n\nYeah, I've never worn white\n\nBut I wanna get it right\n\n'Cause you really wanna say \"I do\"\n\n'Cause I do\n\nHer angelic glow was amplified when she cradled her stomach with both hands and sang, \"See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do).\"\n\n'Floating with love':Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom welcome baby girl Daisy Dove Bloom\n\nPerry gave birth in late August to a baby girl named Daisy Dove Bloom.\n\n\"We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,\" the proud parents said in a statement to the United Nations Children's Fund.\n\nEminem performs 'Lose Yourself' at the Oscars\n\nEminem? At the Oscars? In 2020? Yep, that happened.\n\nThe rapper surprised fans by turning up at the awards show at Los Angeles' Dolby Theatre to perform his track \"Lose Yourself\" – earning a slew of reactions from celebs in the audience and people watching at home.\n\nThe 2002 track was featured in the film \"8 Mile\" and won an Oscar for best original song the following year. Eminem skipped that awards show and missed out on performing it at the time.\n\n'Clean dozen in the books!':Eminem is 'not afraid' as he celebrates 12 years of sobriety\n\nOn Twitter, he quoted from the song's lyrics following the head-turning performance that left some fans wondering why he was on the Oscars stage.\n\n\"Look, if you had another shot, another opportunity... Thanks for having me @TheAcademy. Sorry it took me 18 years to get here,\" he tweeted with a video clip of Barbra Streisand presenting the award years ago.\n\nBillie Eilish wows at the Grammys\n\nAt 18, Billie Eilish won the four biggest Grammy Awards in one night, becoming only the second artist to do so — and the youngest.\n\nShe won the album, record and song of the year categories as well as best new artist — the first singer to do so since Christopher Cross in 1981.

It came from ...", "text": "Long before J. Cole, the popular rapper from Fayetteville whose verse is characterized by his flow of words, there was Bill Curtis and the Fatback Band.\n\nCurtis, another Fayetteville native, gets credit from many authorities and source books for recording the first rap record of the hip-hop era.\n\nThe release of that song, “King Tim III (Personality Jock),” actually predated the Sugarhill Gang’s multi-platinum seller “Rapper’s Delight,” though the latter is often cited as the first commercially released rap song.\n\nBoth “King Tim III” and “Rapper’s Delight” emerged during 1979, within months of each other, at the dawn of hip-hop.\n\n“It was a milestone,” Curtis said of his band’s historical hip-hop recording.\n\nCurtis, a drummer and percussionist, founded the Fatback Band in the early 1970s and continues to lead the current incarnation of his funk/dance franchise.\n\nWhereas “King Tim III” failed to cross over from any R&B activity into the mainstream, never cracking the Billboard Top 40, “Rapper’s Delight” became a worldwide smash.\n\n“I was out then, but on the B-side (of a single). It was the first recorded rap,” Curtis said of “King Tim III.”\n\n• • •\n\nShort in stature, Curtis speaks in a stately, melodious voice that has a mellow groove of its own. During an interview from his longtime home off Country Club Drive, he sat comfortably on a brown leather couch in his stocking feet. He sipped a root-based beverage that he despises, yet drinks on a daily basis for his kidneys.\n\nIn the kitchen, Terri Everett, his partner for a quarter-century, was baking an experimental pound cake without milk.\n\nMore than once, Curtis called out, asking when the cake would be ready. In the meantime, she offered him a sample of what was to come with a crusty cupcake made from the same mix.\n\n“I’m close to vegan,” he said. “I don’t eat that much meat. As you grow older, you learn to fall out of love for food.”\n\nHis love for music — especially, making music — has never waned.\n\nBased out of New York City, the Fatback Band started as a jazz-funk outfit before finding most of its success in the ’70s and ’80s with a string of rhythm-and-blues hits like “(Do The) Spanish Hustle”, “I Like Girls,” “Gotta Get My Hands on Some (Money),” “Backstrokin' ” and “I Found Lovin.”\n\nCurtis estimates that his band’s music has been sampled 35 to 45 times over the years. In music, sampling is the reuse of a portion, or sample, of a sound recording in another recording. Samples may be rhythm, melody, speech, sounds or entire bars of music.\n\nTwo years ago, Curtis and his band’s stock rose again when soul diva Chaka Khan’s single “Like Sugar” gained widespread attention. The song heavily sampled the Fatback Band’s 1975 funk-jam, “(Are You Ready) Do the Bus Stop.”\n\n“Chaka Khan did a remake of ‘Bus Stop,’ and that really opened up the doors again for me,” he said. “She took all the Fatback music from ‘Bus Stop,’ and she wrote some new lyrics to it. She called it sugar — ‘Like Sugar.’ And that really opened the doors. That opened up little avenues for me to tour, plus opened up some commercial and movie things.”\n\nCurtis, an only child who moved back to Fayetteville around 1997 to live with his elderly mother, continues to make his own music. These days, he releases singles only on his Fatback Records label.\n\nBorn and raised on Ann Street near the First Presbyterian Church in Fayetteville, Curtis is the son of a model/beautician and shoemaker.\n\nAfter starting with the piano, he switched to drums in 1943. Curtis joined the band at E.E. Smith High School, a program that produced a string of top-notch drummers during the middle of the century, with Curtis, Belton Evans, Herbert Drake and Ernest Moore at the top of the class.\n\nAll those stickmen would experience successful professional careers. Curtis credits the late Evans, who played behind some of the best in the early days of rock ’n’ roll, with teaching him to play the drums.\n\nAfter serving a stint in the Army, Curtis studied percussion at the Mannes School of Music in New York and at the New York College of Music.\n\nThe party music may pay the bills, but he’s a classically trained musician.\n\nEarly on, Curtis played as a sideman and recorded with a number of accomplished R&B and jazz artists, including Paul Williams, Big Maybelle, Bill Doggett, Sil Austin, King Curtis, Dinah Washington and Clyde McPhatter of Drifters fame. That’s him on drums on McPhatter’s 1965 recording “Live at the Apollo Theater.”\n\nMore recently, the Fatback Band has been playing the African World Peace Festival every other year in his hometown, and the group remains a strong draw in Europe. On Feb. 29, the band — under the name Fatback Band New Generation — was flying to England for a tour that includes dates in Amsterdam, Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nFatback has been booked for three music festivals in the United Kingdom, according to Curtis. “We’re like a local band in England,” he said, adding that his group’s music is popular in Japan, too.\n\n• • •\n\nThis first-class party band, always known to lock into a killer groove and work it to death, beat the Sugarhill Gang to the punch. Fatback was the first R&B act to acknowledge the populist form of rap art that first emerged from the streets of New York City more than four decades ago.\n\n“I heard people rapping up in the Bronx,” the 88-year-old Curtis said late last month. “In New York, they had street parties in the boroughs. We played all around New York. I was playing up in the Bronx and I heard the DJs up there — I think it was Grandmaster (Flash, another early rap artist) — they rapping and scratching on records and all that. You see, the Bronx was the birthplace of rap.”\n\nAround that same time, Curtis was in the studio recording the “Fatback XII” album. He said he had no intentions of recording a rap song, but once the album was finished, he failed to hear hit potential from any of the recorded tracks.\n\n“That’s the way I go — on instinct, on feeling,” he said.\n\nCurtis told his partner, Jerry Thomas, who has co-produced most of the Fatback Band catalog with him, that he didn’t think he had a possible hit on the disc.\n\n“‘We’ve got to do something different in there.’ And I had this one tune in there,” Curtis said, “which was kind of like an instrumental called ‘Catch the Beat.’ I said, ‘Jerry, let’s do a rap.’\n\n“First thing Jerry said, ‘Can’t nobody in the band rap. What do you mean, let’s do a rap?’ In the meantime,” Curtis added, “one of the roadies was in the studio with me and heard me say that. He said, ‘I have a friend that lives in the projects that can rap.’ I said, ‘Yeah, bring him in tomorrow night.’ And he brought in Timothy Washington. That’s his name. He brought Timothy in and I said, ‘Go in the studio and start rapping.’ And he went in there and laid it down in two shots. Bang! Then we changed his name to King Tim III.”\n\n• • •\n\nHip-hop’s roots as a musical phenomenon are subject to debate, although its roots as a commercial phenomenon are considered much clearer.\n\nThere is some debate in the music industry as to which record came first, but the general consensus is that the first rap record was by the Fatback Band followed by what has been called the “granddaddy” of rap records, \"Rapper's Delight.\"\n\nIt can be argued that rap on record had been around for years, with James Brown, Gil Scott-Heron and the Last Poets among those who recorded rhyme-like spoken word passages that have been likened to rap music at an earlier stage. Some music archivists even argue that such jazz scat artists as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Al Jarreau were rapping on record years before the arrival of the hip-hop era.\n\nStill, “King Tim III (Personality Jock)” — which first came out on the Spring Records label — marks the beginning of recorded hip-hop.\n\n“‘King Tim’ remains a killer blast of hip-hop, seamlessly mixing a slick old-school rap into the band's intensely funky blend of organ, energetic horn blasts and a relentless walking bassline,” the online All Music Guide says in its review of “Fatback XII.”\n\nCurtis always has claimed that his rap record came out roughly three weeks before “Rapper’s Delight.”\n\nYet, according to online sources, “King Tim III” was released March 25, 1979, months before “Rapper’s Delight” hit the streets on Sept. 16, 1979. Eventually, the Sugarhill Gang’s dance-groove track filled the airwaves and made the DJs’ rotation in the nation’s disco clubs.\n\n\"Rapper’s Delight,“ released on Sugar Hill Records, may not have been first, but it is credited for introducing hip-hop music to a wide audience. Likewise, it proved there was money to be made in hip-hop records.\n\nWhereas the Sugarhill Gang’s song was far more successful — with the New Jersey-based hip-hop trio producing the first rap single to become a Top 40 hit (it reached No. 36 on Jan. 5, 1980) on the American Billboard Hot 100 — the Fatback Band’s first rap release was issued as a B-side, or the flip side, of the 7-inch single, “You’re My Candy Sweet.”\n\nCurtis said he pushed for “King Tim III” to be the A-side of the single. But he was told that Spring Records refused to put up any money to market the song that label executives largely saw as a novelty, at most.\n\nThey didn’t think it would catch on with listeners.\n\n“‘You’re My Candy Sweet’ was me on the vocal,” Curtis said, before adding with his infectious laugh, “and I can’t carry a tune.”\n\n• • •\n\nClosing in on his 90th birthday, Curtis said he’s considering backing off as a percussionist with Fatback and taking on more of a management role.\n\n“I’m going to go until I drop,” he said with that high-pitched snicker of a laugh. “Our music — they’re just catching up to us. They’re just catching up to what we were doing. The DJs was raised on Fatback; the Djs was weened on Fatback.”\n\nHe figures approximately 50 albums have been issued under the Fatback or Fatback Band name. Those records were released on the labels Perception, Polygram, Spring and his own Fatback Records.\n\n“It’s my life’s work and it tells me where I came from,” he said. “I didn’t do it by myself. I was surrounded by good people and people on the same page I was on.”\n\nFollowing “King Tim III,” he said, Fatback recorded at least a couple more rap records. “After that,” Curtis said, “I got away from it. I had done rap. I try to tell people — don’t try to pigeonhole it. It’s just rap.”\n\n“It’s not a big deal to me,” he replied, when asked if it bothers him that he doesn’t always receive proper credit for making the first-recorded hip-hop era rap song. “I’m a record man. I love to make music. I know what I did. I know what I did.”\n\nStaff writer Michael Futch can be reached at mfutch@fayobserver.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/28/missy-elliott-talks-hits-she-wrote-aaliyah-beyonce-and-herself/2140241002/", "title": "Missy Elliott breaks down hits she wrote for Aaliyah, Beyonce, Ciara ...", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Missy Elliott, who has a history of writing and producing some of pop music's most creative and catchy songs, breaks down some of the hits she's written for herself and other stars. Elliott is one of the nominees for the 2019 Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nAaliyah, \"One In a Million\"\n\nAaliyah had been coming off the major success of her 1994 debut album, the R. Kelly-produced \"Age Ain't Nothing But a Number,\" when newcomers Missy Elliott and Timbaland were called in to work on ONE song with the R&B goddess.\n\nBut one song turned into eight, and \"One In a Million\" — the song and the album — was born.\n\n\"I was scared. I don't know if Tim was scared when we first played it because it was a different sound. It was a different way to attack records because people were really singing then; that world of rap-singing didn't really exist,\" Elliott explained. \"Because I wasn't really a singer like that, that's why I wrote like that, because I was a rapper, but I didn't know how to do a bunch of runs, so every record that I would attack, I would attack it like I'm rap-singing it.\"\n\nBut Aaliyah loved the song and appreciated Elliott and Timbaland's unique style.\n\n\"She had an ear and she knew what that music made her feel like. She was next level to understand that this is some next level (music). This is not just the sound that's going on right now — this is a new sound that is being created. This whole movement is new,\" Elliott said.\n\nMore:Missy Elliott becomes the first female rapper nominated for the Songwriters Hall of Fame\n\nMore:Watch Missy Elliott surprise her 'Funky White Sister' during a performance on 'Ellen'\n\nElliott and Timbaland would go to form a special bond with Aaliyah that was unmatched — as heard on \"One In a Million\" and its follow-up \"Aaliyah,\" released a month before Aaliyah died in 2001.\n\nElliott says although \"One In a Million\" topped the R&B charts, radio didn't want to play the song at first.\n\n\"(Radio) said they couldn't blend it in, they couldn't mix it in with records before it or after it because the cadence hadn't been done before,\" she said. \"And so somehow, I think her uncle spoke to some people and they end up playing it. I know (Funkmaster) Flex was one of the first people to break that record in New York. ...It was a headache at first.\"\n\nMissy Elliott featuring Nas, Eve and Q-Tip, \"Hot Boyz\"\n\nAnother song Elliott said radio didn't want to play was \"Hot Boyz.\"\n\nThat may sound like a surprise since \"Hot Boyz\" set a record when it spent 18 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's rap songs chart. And since 1999, Drake and Iggy Azalea have been able to match the feat, but no one has outlasted Elliott's hit.\n\n\"I remember one of the stations in L.A. was the first to pull it,\" she said. \"And something happened, I can't tell you what happened, but whatever happened, it ended up back at the stations ... and it ended up in the Guinness Book of World Records.\"\n\nThe upbeat, hard-hitting song, which featured rappers Nas, Eve and Q-Tip, was one Elliott wanted to create not only for her die-hard female fans, but her male fans, too.\n\n\"I want guys to feel like they could ride around and listen to this because the beat was so hard. This beat feel like all the male rappers would want to get on this joint right here,\" she said.\n\n702, \"Where My Girls At?\"\n\n702's \"Where My Girls At?\" reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 chart in 1999, but Elliott said she initially wrote the anthem for TLC.\n\n\"Lisa (\"Left Eye\" Lopes) really wanted it, she really wanted that record, but I guess, if it's two against one (what can you do?)\" So I ended up giving that record to 702, which was cool because they were a group. I knew whoever had it, I wanted it to be going to a group.\"\n\nOf the biggest songs of 1999, \"Where My Girls At?\" was ranked No. 11 by Billboard. Elliott said she wanted women to feel empowered when they heard the fun track.\n\n\"It's almost like church — when you go to church, pastor is saying something (and you're) like, 'I swear up and down that message is for me.' I wanted to create something women could feel like, 'I could relate to this record.'\"\n\nMissy Elliott, \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\"\n\nElliott's debut single, \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly),\" goes down in history as one of the most creative, unique and impressive songs of all-time.\n\nBut Elliott said she created the song — and her first album — in an agreement to get her own label so she could sign artists and produce for them.\n\n\"Of course, those were my smoke days, you can tell by the first line. I just went in and I just said whatever I felt. Back then, there was no expectation, so it wasn't like I had to really think and say, 'OK, I have to make something better than what I did the last time. This was my first time going in, so it was like, whatever the music made me feel, I said it,\" she said.\n\nElliott and Timbaland finished her platinum-selling album, released in 1997, in just two weeks.\n\n\"That's how quick I wanted to hurry up and get my label deal. I would do songs five songs a day, so it was nothing. This was before people even knew who I was,\" she said.\n\nDestiny's Child, \"Confessions\"\n\nElliott knew Destiny's Child would be big before they blew up.\n\nShe worked on the song \"Confessions,\" from the group's sophomore album \"The Writing's on the Wall,\" which gave them their pop star breakthrough.\n\n\"They all had something special. And Beyonce, she knew exactly how to attack a record,\" Elliott said. \"When I heard Bey singing the verses, I was like, 'Oh they finna go far.'\"\n\nThe groovy song, about a woman cheating on her partner and confessing the truth, was one Elliott wrote specifically for the group after they reached out to work together.\n\n\"And it's funny when I think back on it because you rarely get women having to confess. It's always the guy who ends up having to confess,\" Elliott said. \"That was a different kind of twist for a female to be like, 'Look, I basically kicked it with Mike when you was gone, this went down and that went down.'\"\n\nMissy Elliott, \"Get Ur Freak On\"\n\nAfter Elliott created most of the music for her third album, \"Miss E... So Addictive,\" she felt like she was missing something. But Timbaland felt she was overanalyzing the situation.\n\n\"By this time, he's annoyed. He just happened to be in front of the keyboard and he starts just pressing the buttons on the keyboard but he when was doing it, he was mad,\" she recalled. \"He begins to create around this sound.\"\n\nMore:5 things to know about the viral 'funky white sister' who covers Missy Elliott's 'Work It'\n\nMore:AMAs: Twitter loses control after spotting Missy Elliott's 'funky white sister'\n\nIt kicked off the sound for what later became \"Get Ur Freak On,\" the album's first single and a monster hit for Elliott. It won the best rap solo performance Grammy, beating out Jay-Z, DMX and Nelly.\n\n\"I'm always a headache to Timbaland. He has to take vacations after we're done with my album because I stress him out,\" she said.\n\nThe eye-popping music video matched the song's wild energy and even featured cameos by Ludacris, LL Cool J, Eve, Busta Rhymes, Master P, Ja Rule and the late Nate Dogg.\n\n\"I miss those days. ...there was a time where you didn't have to be a feature on the record, you just support,\" she said. \"I tried to gather if people were in town like, 'Hey, come through' and they always showed up. I'm humbled by that.\"\n\nCiara featuring Missy Elliott, \"1, 2 Step\"\n\nMissy Elliott hadn't even met Ciara when she created \"1, 2 Step\" for the star.\n\nElliott was busy working her own music and hadn't heard Ciara's debut hit, \"Goodies,\" when she was asked to write a song for the budding singer.\n\n\"Back then people weren't really sing-rapping. Now that's the thing. But I wanted it to be where she still kind of rap-sings it. It allowed her to be able to dance, so she's not sitting there trying to do all these runs and sing and all that stuff, because you can't really get off when you trying to sing and then you trying to do the whole matrix thing going backward,\" she said, referring to Ciara's skilled dancing.\n\nThey finally met on the set of \"1, 2 Step,\" Ciara's second single which reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart. It became the fifth most successful song of 2005.\n\nThe two went to collaborate on more songs, even winning a Grammy together for \"Lose Control.\"\n\n\"When you have that kind of chemistry, you're going to always work together,\" Elliott said.\n\nMissy Elliott, \"Work It\"\n\nThe hook of Elliott's \"Work It\" features a famous line where the lyrics are played in reverse.\n\nShe said it was a happy accident.\n\n\"The reverse thing, that was a mistake. The engineer happened to hit something, and it just went backward, and I was like, 'Oh that's kind of crazy because it went backward on the beat. So, after that happened, I said, 'Yo, keep that in there and I'm going to write around it.'\"\n\nThe internet in 2002 went crazy — in today's world it would have been a viral moment — as fans tried to figure out what Elliott was saying in the song. Some thought it was a secret code or message.\n\n\"They thought I was saying all kinds of nasty stuff,\" she said. \"No, actually, I'm not, this time.\"\n\n\"Work It\" was the first single from Elliott's fourth album, \"Under Construction,\" which earned a Grammy nomination for album of the year.\n\nShe said Timbaland really challenged her to write something great on \"Work It.\"\n\n\"I don't record in front of anyone, so I went in another room and recorded, and I felt like a little kid going to their daddy with their report card. About the fifth time, he's like, 'That's it. That's what I'm talking about.'\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/12/14/t-pain-10-biggest-hits-lil-wayne-jamie-foxx-chris-brown-kanye-west/77215914/", "title": "T-Pain shares stories behind 10 of his biggest hits", "text": "Patrick Ryan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe King of Auto-Tune has retired his crown.\n\nSince releasing debut album Rappa Ternt Sanga in December 2005, T-Pain has lent his digitally altered vocals to some of the biggest hits of the past decade, including solo singles and all-star collaborations with Kanye West, Lil Wayne and Chris Brown.

(Warning: Some contain NSFW language.)\n\nYes, T-Pain! Watch his flawless covers of 'Crazy,' Sam Cooke\n\n1. I'm Sprung\n\nPeaked at No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in November 2005\n\nT-Pain's debut single, Sprung, was written for his wife, Amber, whom he married in 2003 and has three children with. \"It was brand new love. It was the kind of love that makes you write a song about it.\" The song itself came together quickly. \"I was experimenting with Auto-Tune at the time and I really got into it. It was fairly easy to get that done, because it was about something I am well-versed in: love.\" Before T-Pain had even signed to Jive Records, \"the song was already circulating. It was kind of surprising once I found out what label money does to a song — just seeing it spread once the label got involved was amazing. It surprised me how fast it happened, but I already knew it was a good song.\"\n\n2. I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper) (feat. Mike Jones)\n\nPeaked at No. 5 in February 2006\n\nLuv was inspired by a night when T-Pain took his friend to a strip club for the first time. \"We got one girl to dance on him and he was just automatically trying to take her out of the club, pay for her tuition and do everything. The next couple days in the studio, everybody was still laughing about it. I started playing with GarageBand on my Mac and singing, 'I'm in love with a stripper,' and everybody was like, 'Yo, lay that down and we'll give it to (him) as a joke.' Then the label came in and we were going through some songs I had recorded. They heard the 'joke' and were like, 'This is the furthest thing from a joke. We're putting this out next week.' \" The fact that it became a hit \"threw me off. I was literally trying to make a bad song but it didn't work.\"\n\n3. Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin') (feat. Yung Joc)\n\nPeaked at No. 1 in May 2007\n\n\"This is the first record where I was trying to make a hit song. I was going into the studio consciously like, 'What do people like talking about? They like drinking and they like drinking with girls. What do you say to a girl to get her a drink?' I really went down the list. That was the first time I had ever done that. I didn't like doing that, because that's not really making music to me — that's making hit songs to get some money real quick.\" The track started simple and sparse, before he started adding harmonies and ad-libs to the verses. \"It got to where I actually liked the song. I was like, 'This is a pretty cool, dope song.' That's what really made me like it and then it became my first No. 1.\"\n\n4. Kiss Kiss, Chris Brown\n\nPeaked at No. 1 in November 2007\n\nKiss' music video shot on Florida International University's University Park campus in Miami. \"It was a two-day shoot, but I was super lazy at the time, so I only showed up for one day. Just watching how they were trying to split everything into two days was pretty funny because it was quite hectic and Chris would not let up on getting what he asked for. I gained tons of respect for Chris, he was really taking charge of that whole thing.\" Although Brown had already scored hits such as Yo (Excuse Me Miss) and Say Goodbye prior, \"it made me feel like Chris had grown up and was doing his thing.\"\n\n5. Good Life, Kanye West\n\nPeaked at No. 7 in November 2007\n\nT-Pain recorded a number of different hooks for Life, but \"it just wasn't sounding right to Kanye. He needed something different that was real anthemic and blew his mind right away. What ended up happening was, he made a composite of all the hooks that I did and made the hook out of it. Even the last part that I sing — 'Is the good life better than the life I live?' — that was one of the hooks, and he just put it at the end of the song and made it a bridge.\" When it came time to shoot the music video, \"it was a completely different song. I got to the shoot and (Kanye) was like, 'Do you want to listen?' And I was like, 'No, I've heard it.' He was like, 'No, you're going to want to listen to the song again before we start.' \"\n\n6. Low, Flo Rida\n\nPeaked at No. 1 in January 2008\n\nLow's hook was one of many that T-Pain wrote during a one-night writing session with Atlantic Records' A&R head Mike Caren. \"He gave me a bunch of beats and I just ran down the list and did a bunch of hooks. A lot of them turned into singles for Atlantic artists,\" including Flo Rida, then an up-and-coming rapper. The song's now-iconic refrain of \"Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans / boots with the fur\" was inspired, in part, by \"what all the girls were wearing. It was a rich white girl's uniform, it was so weird. Now it's like Uggs and yoga pants and Starbucks cups. It was just what I was seeing girls wear in the club and it kind of wrote itself.\"\n\n7. Got Money, Lil Wayne\n\nPeaked at No. 10 in September 2008\n\nMoney's music video depicts a bank heist, but \"what a lot of people don't know is that Wayne was shooting two videos at once. He was shooting (the A Milli video) out on the street and then it turned into the bank video. Everything about that day was super fun, it was just a bright and sunny day.\" Wayne and T-Pain are shown throwing cash throughout the video, a lot of which was real. \"I didn't feel comfortable because it wasn't mine — or maybe it was. Maybe that was my payment for the video. I asked for fake money, but they kept passing me real money, like, 'Yo, just throw this.' I was like, 'No, I'm not throwing real (expletive) money.' \"\n\n8. Blame It, Jamie Foxx\n\nPeaked at No. 2 in May 2009\n\n\"Jamie's a crazy dope writer. A lot of people don't know that, but it's insane how good he is. He came up with the hook and wrote the verses, and sent me the song. For some reason, it took me like 20 minutes to catch the chord progression. It was weird, I didn't know how to set my Auto-Tune and I was like, 'I don't want to call and ask how he set his Auto-Tune, that would be embarrassing.' So I just went through like 20 minutes of trying to figure out how I was going to sing this thing, because I didn't want to do the same rhythm as him. I just kept the faith and hopefully I was going to stumble on one of the keys of Auto-Tune I wanted to do this in. Once I found it, I recorded my verse, sent it to him,\" and Blame won a Grammy Award in 2010 for best R&B performance by a duo/group with vocals.\n\n9. I'm on a Boat, The Lonely Island\n\nPeaked at No. 56 in June 2009\n\nAfter T-Pain appeared on Saturday Night Live in 2008, Andy Samberg's comedy trio reached out to his team about collaborating. \"They sent us the song and I didn't know what the (expletive) they were talking about. I couldn't tell if the song was serious or not, so it kind of confused me. But once they said it was a Digital Short, then of course I complied. They wrote the whole thing, I went and put my voice on it, and sent it back.\" They later shot the video in Miami on a \"$30 million yacht, which was pretty cool. I'll tell you what, though — it was cold as (expletive) out there. We had to do these (aerial) shots and I wish drones had been popular back then, because they used an actual helicopter and that thing was spraying so much water on us. That was probably the worst video day I've ever been through.\"\n\n10. All I Do is Win, DJ Khaled (feat. Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross)\n\nPeaked at No. 24 in July 2010\n\nIf there's one thing you should know about Khaled, it's that he's persistent. \"He won't let you not do something. If he has an idea, it's going to happen real quick and on his terms. He showed up to my studio one night and I was like, 'Man, I'm doing stuff. I could be here eating steak and lobster, but I'm actually working. Let me chill.' In the next 20 minutes, he had someone show up with a ton of steak and lobster for the whole studio. It was pretty (expletive) impressive. I was like, 'I was just trying to make a statement, but thanks. I'm going to eat it.' \"\n\nAfterward, Khaled gave him a handful of beats to record Win's hook over, including one produced by DJ Nasty and LVM. \"I go in the booth and start doing ad-libs, and it was very confusing for him because I could hear it in my head and he couldn't. So he stopped the beat and was like, 'Yo, I don't think that's it. Let's try something else.' I was like, 'How about this? How about you get the (expletive) out of here and I'll call you when it's time to come back in.' He left, I finished the hook, and he came back in and was like, 'This is the biggest (expletive) hook of all time. This is an anthem.' \"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/08/29/ranking-michael-jacksons-no-1-hits-honor-his-60th-birthday/1112672002/", "title": "Ranking Michael Jackson's No. 1 hits, in honor of what would have ...", "text": "Michael Jackson, the King of Pop, has more No. 1 hits than most artists could ever dream of charting – combined. With 13 No. 1s – and one more to which he contributed vocals – Jackson leads the list of male artists with the most chart-topping hits.\n\nHis catalog has both legendary breadth and depth, considering Jackson was the first artist to score No. 1 hits in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s; and that during the ’80s alone, at his creative peak, he earned 10 No. 1s – more than any other artist that decade.\n\nYet for all his record-holding achievements, listeners may be surprised which of Jackson’s singles hit No. 1 and which songs missed the top spot. Bona fide classics such as “Thriller,” \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin,’ ” \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),” “Got to Be There,” “Smooth Criminal” and his “Scream” collaboration with sister Janet Jackson all failed to reach No. 1, while a good number of arguably lesser singles managed to reach the Billboard Hot 100’s peak.\n\nIn honor of what would’ve been Jackson’s 60th birthday on Aug. 29, revisit Jackson’s 14 songs that reached No. 1, and judge for yourself which were the best – and worst – of his most-popular songs.\n\n14. \"We Are the World\" (1985)\n\nOy. Where to start with \"We Are the World,\" the biggest charity single of all time, which recruited 46 singers to contribute a few words each to raise funds to combat poverty in Africa. Co-written by Jackson and Lionel Richie, \"We Are the World\" may have raised more than $75 million for the USA for Africa organization, but it's less a real song than a star-studded and hopelessly overblown PSA and doesn't deserve to be counted as an official Michael Jackson No. 1.\n\n13. \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" feat. Siedah Garrett (1987)\n\nThe first single from Jackson's \"Bad\" album is also its weakest one. There's nothing egregiously wrong with \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" – it's just that, when it comes to the many superior Jackson hits that missed the No. 1 spot, the song's inclusion on this list feels like a fluke.\n\n12. \"Ben\" (1972)\n\nAfter becoming the youngest artist to collaborate on a No. 1 track with the Jackson 5's charts-topping hit \"I Want You Back,\" Jackson scored his first solo No. 1 with \"Ben\" two years later. \"Ben\" is an earnest ode to a pet rat, recorded for the 1972 horror movie of the same name and written by composer Walter Scharf of \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\"-scoring fame. Like \"We Are the World,\" \"Ben\" is a Michael Jackson No. 1 single in name, but not in spirit.\n\n11. \"You Are Not Alone\" (1995)\n\nIn a more just world, Jackson's final No. 1 hit wouldn't have been “You Are Not Alone,” an overly sentimental ballad that’s more the style of its songwriter, R. Kelly. Considering Jackson recently charted in the top 10 with his unreleased vocals in Drake’s \"Don't Matter to Me,\" there’s still a possibility that another posthumous Jackson feature will replace it as his last charts-topping hit.\n\n10. \"Bad\" (1987)\n\nWith \"Bad,\" Jackson became the first and only male artist to chart five No. 1 hits from one album. Its title track is a testament to how formidable Jackson's singles catalog is: a perfectly strong track in its own right but one that barely cracks the top 10 of his own No. 1s.\n\n9. \"Say Say Say\" feat. Paul McCartney (1983)\n\n“Say Say Say” deserves an apology – or at the very least, a second listen – from every listener who writes off Jackson’s collaborations with McCartney as less than the sum of the two artists’ parts. “Say Say Say” picks up the pace while splitting its verses in two, handing McCartney the earnest opening notes while letting Jackson wail away on his appropriately funky melodies.\n\n8. \"Rock With You\" (1980)\n\nA favorite from Jackson's fifth solo album, “Off the Wall,” the breezy “Rock With You” only scratches the surface of Jackson and Quincy Jones’ collaborations to come.\n\n7. \"Black or White\" (1991)\n\nSome parts of Jackson’s racial-unity anthem hold up less than flawlessly in the current cultural climate, with lines like “I’m not going to spend my life being a color” that are probably in need of some unpacking. Yet “Black or White” actually bangs, its undeniably great guitar line vaulting the song to the best of Jackson’s ’90s No. 1s.\n\n6. \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" (1987)\n\nSandwiched in the “Bad” album run of singles between the swaggering title track and the more profound “Man in the Mirror,” “The Way You Make Me Feel” is proof that, even almost two decades into his career, Jackson could make an earnest love song as pure as his original Jackson 5 recordings.\n\n5. “Dirty Diana\" (1988)\n\nNeither about Princess Diana nor Diana Ross, Jackson's most sinister No. 1 single – also from \"Bad\" – is also one of his best rock songs. The spiritual successor to \"Billie Jean\" as another groupie cautionary tale, “Dirty Diana” is a reminder that Jackson, whose legacy isn’t exactly one as a sex symbol, could channel carnal danger just like the rest of his male pop star peers.\n\n4. \"Man in the Mirror\" (1988)\n\nA career-defining Jackson hit for its statement of self, from an artist with a notoriously conflicted relationship with his own image, “Man in the Mirror” is tragic in the way it foreshadows Jackson’s struggles to come – and triumphant as a pop achievement in its own right.\n\n3. \"Beat It\" (1983)\n\nFrom \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's immortal \"Eat It\" to Fall Out Boy's considerably less-immortal 2008 cover, there's a cartoonish aspect to \"Beat It\" that makes it prime for parody – or fools lesser artists into thinking they can appropriately do the track justice. Yet \"Beat It\" is a top-tier Jackson single because of how absurd, purposefully or otherwise, anyone else singing it sounds. Only Jackson can spit out the track's catchphrase and finesse lyrics like \"Showin’ how funky / And strong is your fight,\" all over a showy Eddie Van Halen guitar line and make it all sound like a pop classic instead of an ’80s fossil.\n\n2. \"Don't Stop ’Til You Get Enough\" (1979)\n\n\"Don't Stop ’Til You Get Enough\" is Jackson's first No. 1 hit that's not about a pet rat, and famously, the first song he claimed he wrote as a whole. And it's a stunner, six minutes of perfect pop music that courses with electricity from Jackson's opening howl.\n\n1. \"Billie Jean\" (1983)\n\nThis ranking was, really, a race for No. 2, because no Jackson single can legitimately hold the No. 1 spot other than \"Billie Jean.\" From its iconic opening drumbeats, the song marches in lockstep deeper into the paranoia-seized psyche of its young star. Not a single one of Quincy Jones' production flourishes is out of place, spanning rock and funk and disco and all anchored by a tortured performance by a 24-year-old Jackson that would remain his all-time career best.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/05/25/june-concert-guide-phoenix-tempe/84821264/", "title": "June concert guide for Phoenix: Brad Paisley, I Love the '90s Tour ...", "text": "Ed Masley\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nBrad Paisley plays Ak-Chin Pavilion to kick off a month that also features shows by Slipknot, Cage the Elephant and the hip-hop nostalgia of the I Love the '90s Tour with Salt-N-Pepa and Vanilla Ice.

Their latest is every bit as edgy and uncompromising, not to mention just as trippy, bringing a Germanic electronic pulse to the garage on 2010's excellent \"Who Killed Sgt.

And \"Everybody's Coming Down\" finds Kasher playing to the strengths that make both projects what they are, from the reflective nature of the lyrics to the instantly engaging melodies. Alternative Press heard \"a spacey rock record with noisy guitars and plenty of dynamics, with all of the endearing alcoholic romanticism that we have grown to love.\" And it's good that they mention those noisy guitars, because every so often, they hit you with noise-rocking shards of explosive guitar that take what would have been a great song somewhere even more exciting — the multi-tracked madness at the end of \"Everybody\" in particular.

Hey, it worked for Cage the Elephant. And these guys are just as effective as crafting a pop hook. PopMatters dismissed it as \"populist KROQ grunge for a new generation, though you get a sense these guys would see that as a compliment.\" That's like taking a bite of the tastiest pizza in town and complaining that it tastes like that pizza you had in the '90s.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, June 15.

The U.K. songwriter rose to fame with the 1979 success of \"Is She Really Going Out With Him,\" a New Wave classic included on Jackson's first album, \"Look Sharp,\" which Rolling Stone magazine later named to a list of the 100 best debuts of all time.

In its place? A collection of heartfelt indie songs that haunt the atmosphere while tugging at the heartstrings, flirting with folktronica along the way. PopMatters says: “In general, you can tell that a lot of thought has gone into Delusions of Grand Fur.

They recently released the long-awaited followup to \"Pleasant Living,\" a fitting successor titled \"Celebrate.\" The vocals are as urgent as ever on the new one but the drums hit harder, which only adds to the sense of catharsis.

Their sound, in fact, is rooted in the music of the early Beatles and the British New Wave movement, which makes sense considering they formed in 1982. Enanitos Verdes are rockers from Argentina.

Three of the six original Body Count members have died since the release of that debut, and they've released four additional albums in the 24 years since becoming a target for everyone from Tipper Gore to Dan Quayle and a guy who starred in \"Planet of the Apes\" when he was almost cool.

Eight years later, they sounded every bit as excited to be keeping rock and roll alive on \"Forcefield,\" thanks in large part to the overcaffeinated drumming of Greg Alsop. Dude can let it rock.

Dressed in ghoulish rubber masks and matching jumpsuits, they crowded the parking-lot stages, brutalizing themselves, their instruments and everything in sight with an intensity the world had rarely seen. They've had their share of rock-radio hits since then, including \"Duality,\" \"Dead Memories,\" \"Snuff\" and last year's \"The Devil in I.\" But really, it's about the live show, which remains a brutal spectacle.

So, yes, a person could hear Sleigh Bells in the mix, but this is way more atmospheric. There's also what sounds like maybe toy piano, maybe xylophone, which suits the wistful, almost childlike vocals to perfection as they make their way from the scene-setting \"How do we get so low? / How do we get so high?\" to conjuring visions of 'Alice in Wonderland' on the semipsychedelic chorus.\" And the other songs are just as good.

The acquisition has the potential to upend not just Twitter itself but politics, media and the tech industry. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has repeatedly stressed that his goal is to bolster what he calls \"free speech\" on the platform, by which he means all legal speech that complies with local laws in the markets where Twitter operates.He has also said he would reverse Twitter's ban of former President Donald Trump\n\nBut the attempt by Musk, a wildly successful entrepreneur with a history of erratic behavior, to buy Twitter has been viewed with some skepticism from the start. On the day he made his offer, Musk said: \"I'm not sure I'll actually be able to acquire it.\" Some have questioned how he would finance the deal, especially as shares of, which he's partially using to back his financing of the Twitter deal, and the broader tech sector have declined in the weeks since.\n\nAfter Musk recently said he was temporarily pausing the deal so he could assess the amount of spam and fake accounts, it prompted speculation that the billionaire might be looking to renegotiate the deal -- or back out of it entirely. His actions in the days that followed only reinforced that thinking.\n\nHere is a look back at the many twists and turns in one of the most high-profile tech deals in recent memory.\n\nJanuary 31: Musk begins building up his Twitter stake\n\nMusk starts quietly buying up Twitter shares, building his stake in the company. But it would be months before he disclosed this fact to the public.\n\nMarch 14: Musk's Twitter stake tops 5%\n\nMusk's stake in Twitter tops 5%, but that fact is not disclosed until the following month. Musk was obligated to disclose his stake within 10 days of crossing the 5% threshold, but waited 21 days to do so. During that time, he continued building up his stake.\n\nMarch 24: Asking whether Twitter should change\n\nThe billionaire begins to make pointed statements about the platform from his account. \"Twitter algorithm should be open source,\" he wrote , with a poll for users to vote \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nThe following day, Musk tweets out another poll to his followers: \"Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?\"\n\nA sign is posted on the exterior of Twitter headquarters on April 27, 2022 in San Francisco, California.\n\nMarch 26: Musk reaches out to Jack Dorsey\n\nMusk reaches out to Twitter cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey to \"discuss the future direction of social media,\" according to a company filing later put out by the company. The two tech founders are known to have a bit of a billionaire bromance on and off Twitter.\n\nApril 3: Twitter leadership meets to discuss Musk\n\nTwitter's board and some of its leadership team meet with representatives from Wilson Sonsini, a law firm, and J.P. Morgan to discuss the possibility of Musk joining the company's board, according a later securities filing . Dorsey is said to have told the board that \"he and Mr. Musk were friends,\" according to the filing.\n\nIn the meeting, the Twitter board discussed wanting Musk to agree to \"'standstill' provisions\",\" according to the filing. This would effectively \"limit his public statements regarding Twitter, including the making of unsolicited public proposals to acquire Twitter (but not private proposals) without the prior consent of the Twitter Board.\"\n\nApril 4: Surprise! Musk becomes Twitter's largest shareholder\n\nMusk is revealed to be Twitter's largest individual shareholder, with a more than 9% stake in the company.\n\nNews of the purchase sends shares of the social media company soaring more than 20% in early trading and kicks off a wave of speculation about how Musk might push for changes on the platform.\n\nApril 5: Musk agrees to join the board\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal announces Musk will join Twitter's board of directors. \"Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board,\" Agrawal says in a post on Twitter.\n\nAs part of the appointment, Musk agrees not to acquire more than 14.9% of the company's shares while he remains on the board. His term on the board is set to go through 2024, according to a regulatory filing\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal (left) and former CEO Jack Dorsey in an undated photo.\n\nApril 10: Just kidding. Musk ditches the board\n\nAgrawal announces that Musk has decided not to join the board after all. \"I believe this is for the best,\" Agrawal writes in a letter to the Twitter team.\n\nThe reversal opens the door for Musk to pursue a greater stake in the company -- and frees him to tweet his many thoughts about the company.\n\nApril 14: Musk offers to buy Twitter and 'unlock' its potential\n\nMusk stuns the industry by making an offer to acquire all the shares in Twitter he does not own at a valuation of $41.4 billion. The cash offer represents a 38% premium over the company's closing price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed that he had become the company's biggest shareholder.\n\n\"I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,\" Musk writes in his offer letter. \"Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.\"\n\nApril 15: The poison pill\n\nTwitter's board of directors adopts a \" poison pill \" provision, a limited-term shareholder rights plan that potentially makes it harder for Musk to acquire the company.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany.\n\nApril 21: Musk lines up $46.5 billion in financing\n\nMusk lines u p $46.5 billion in financing for the deal, including two debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions and one equity commitment letter from himself, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe billionaire also reveals that he has not received a formal response from Twitter a week after his acquisition offer. He said he is \"seeking to negotiate\" a definite acquisition agreement and \"is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately\" — an apparent reversal from his statement in his acquisition offer letter that it would be his \"best and final\" offer.\n\nAlthough he is the richest person in the world, much of Musk's wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, and some followers of the company speculate that it could be challenging for Musk to raise debt against the historically volatile stock.\n\nApril 25: Twitter agrees to sell itself to Elon Musk\n\nTwitter announces that it has agreed to sell itself to Musk in a deal valued at around $44 billion. At a conference later in the day, Musk describes his offer to buy Twitter in characteristically sweeping terms as being about \"the future of civilization,\" not just making money.\n\nAt an all-hands meeting that afternoon, Twitter employees raise questions about everything from what the deal would mean for their compensation to whether former US President Donald Trump would be let back on the platform.\n\nApril 29: Musk cashes out billions in Tesla stock\n\nFilings reveal Musk sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla stock in the three days after Twitter board agreed to the sale for an average of $883.09 per share. The filings did not disclose the reason for the sale, but Musk appeared to be raising funds to buy Twitter.\n\nTesla cars sit in a dealership lot on March 28, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nMay 4: With a little help from his billionaire friends\n\nMusk raises another $7 billion in financing for the deal. The new investors include Oracle founder Larry Ellison, cryptocurrency platform Binance and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, according to a filing\n\nMay 6: Musk's lofty goals for Twitter, revealed\n\nMusk aims to increase Twitter's annual revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028, up from $5 billion last year, according to a New York Times report, citing Musk's pitch deck presented to investors. To achieve that lofty goal, Musk intends to bolster Twitter's subscription revenue and build up a payments business while decreasing the company's reliance on advertising sales, according to the report.\n\nMay 10: Musk says he would reinstate Trump's account\n\nMusk confirms what many have assumed for weeks: he would reverse Twitter's Trump ban if his deal to buy the company is completed.\n\n\"I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,\" Musk said. \"I would reverse the perma-ban. ... Banning Trump from Twitter didn't end Trump's voice, it will amplify it among the right and this is why it's morally wrong and flat out stupid.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump looks at his phone during a roundtable with governors on the reopening of America's small businesses, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, June 18, 2020.\n\nMay 12: A partial hiring freeze and executive departures\n\nTwitter confirms to CNN Business that the platform is pausing most hiring and backfills, except for \"business critical\" roles, and pulling back on other non-labor costs ahead of the acquisition. In addition, Twitter says general manager of consumer, Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead, Bruce Falck, are leaving the company.\n\nMay 13: Twitter deal 'temporarily on hold'\n\nThe figure cited in the report, however, is in line with prior quarterly disclosures. Musk tweets that the deal is on hold, linking to a Reuters report from nearly two weeks earlier, about Twitter's most recent disclosure about its amount of spam and fake accounts.The figure cited in the report, however, is in line with prior quarterly disclosures.\n\n\"Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,\" Musk tweeted.\n\nShares of the social media site plummet after Musk's announcement, dropping more than 10% at market open. Two hours after announcing the hold, Musk says he remains set on purchasing Twitter. \"Still committed to acquisition,\" he wrote\n\nLater in the day, Musk says his team is testing Twitter's numbers and \"picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate.\"\n\nMay 14: Oops. NDA problems?\n\nMusk tweets out that Twitter's legal team accused him of breaking a nondisclosure agreement when the billionaire revealed the platform's sample size for automated user checks is allegedly just 100 users.\n\n\"Twitter legal just called to complain that I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100! This actually happened,\" wrote Musk.\n\nMay 16: Poop emoji\n\nThe standoff over bot accounts continues as Musk exchanges a series of tweets with Agrawal over the issue. After Agrawal carefully explains how Twitter attempts to combat and measure spam accounts, Musk responds with a poop emoji.\n\nMusk follows up with a somewhat more thoughtful question. \"So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money?\" Musk asked. \"This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,\" he added.\n\nMay 17: Musk says Twitter deal 'cannot move forward.' Twitter disagrees\n\nMusk announces that his acquisition of Twitter \"cannot move forward\" until he sees more information about the prevalence of spam accounts, claiming that the social media platform falsified numbers in filings. Without citing a source, he claims in a tweet that Twitter is \"20% fake/spam accounts\" and suggests Twitter's previous filings with the SEC were misleading.\n\nLater in the day, Musk posts a poll to his Twitter followers: \"Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?\" before calling on the SEC to evaluate the platform's numbers. \"Hello @SECGov, anyone home?\" Musk tweets, in an apparent attempt to get the regulator to look into the matter.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter says it remains \"committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.\" Later, the company says it intends to \"enforce the merger agreement.\"\n\nJune 6: A threat to walk away\n\nIn a letter to Twitter's head of legal, Musk threatens to walk away from his purchase of the platform, alleging that Twitter is \"actively resisting and thwarting his information rights\" as outlined by the deal.\n\nIn the letter, an attorney for Musk accuses the social media company of breaching the merger agreement by not providing the data he has requested on Twitter spam bots, stating that the lack of information gives him a right \"not to consummate the transaction\" and \"to terminate the merger agreement.\"\n\nJuly 8: Actually trying to walk away\n\nMusk moved to terminate the acquisition agreement . A lawyer representing him claimed in a letter to Twitter's top lawyer that the company is \"in material breach of multiple provisions\" of the deal over its alleged failure to provide all the data Musk says he needs to evaluate the number of spam and fake accounts on the platform.\n\n\"For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to 'make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter's platform,'\" the letter reads. \"This information is fundamental to Twitter's business and financial performance and is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. ... Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information.\"\n\nTwitter was not having it.\n\n\"The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement,\" Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said in a tweet Friday, echoing earlier statements by the company that it planned to follow through with the deal. \"We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.\"\n\nJuly 12: Twitter sues Musk\n\nTwitter sued the Tesla billionaire in Delaware court in an attempt to force him to complete the deal.\n\nThe 62-page lawsuit, sprinkled with memes, tweets and a poop emoji, effectively highlighted the bizarre spectacle of the deal from the start. The company paints Musk as a non-serious potential owner — alleging at one point that he has \"disdain\" for the company, and at another saying, \"Musk's strategy is ... a model of bad faith\" — while seeking to compel him to become its owner. (Twitter's board has an obligation to its shareholders to try to see the deal through if they believe it is in their best interest. The dispute could also end in a settlement.)\n\nJuly 29: Save the date\n\nTwitter's lawsuit against Musk over his move to terminate their $44 billion acquisition agreement will go to trial on Oct. 17 and run for five days, a Delaware judge ruled.\n\nThe decision came after Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who is overseeing the case, previously ruled in Twitter's favor that the proceedings could be expedited and take place in October. Twitter initially pushed for an October 10th start.\n\nMusk's legal team had asked for the trial to take place in 2023. Twitter's legal team argued it was necessary to expedite the case in order to limit the \"harm\" to its business and to ensure the deal can be completed before Oct. 24, the \"drop dead\" date by which the two sides had previously agreed to close the deal.", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2022/04/11/elon-musk-twitter-board-free-speech/7280156001/", "title": "Elon Musk won't join Twitter board, but he could buy the whole ...", "text": "Noted spaceman Elon Musk has been flittering around Twitter, scaring the bitcoins out of many who wonder what a billionaire oddball and self-declared “free speech absolutist” might do to a social media platform already overrun by racists, misogynists, Nazi wannabes and bigots of all stripes.\n\nFirst, Musk bought a 9% stake in the company.

First, here's some quick background:\n\nThe protests involve a minority of Canada's truck drivers, some far-right activists and a variety of other citizens. The demonstrations began in late January as a \"Freedom Convoy\" of trucks and other vehicles. The convoy then turned into an ongoing demonstration in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, whose mayor declared a state of emergency on Sunday. It has also sparked protests elsewhere and inspired plans for a similar convoy in the US.\n\nThe protests have been touted on right-wing US television station Fox and have been cheered by some prominent Republican officeholders and conservative pundits; organizers have raised millions of dollars . Former President Donald Trump even weighed in with a statement praising the protesters and denouncing Trudeau.\n\nThe convoy started after Canada began requiring truckers who cross the US border to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or have two-week quarantines upon returning home. The Canadian Trucking Alliance, the primary advocacy group for Canadian truckers, has opposed the protests and has said that more than 85% of Canadian truckers who regularly cross the border were fully vaccinated as of late January.\n\nFalse claims about the number of trucks\n\nOrganizers claimed in late January that the convoy had grown to tens of thousands of trucks -- even that the number was around 50,000 . Others repeated this \"50,000\" figure.\n\nTheo Fleury, a retired hockey star who's a frequent critic of Trudeau, said on Fox in late January that there were \"50,000 truckers\" heading to Ottawa. Rogan, who has been criticized for his show's role in promoting Covid-19 misinformation, said on the show in late January that the convoy involved \"apparently some insane amount of people, like 50,000 trucks.\" Even larger figures, like \" 80,000 \" or \" over 130,000 \" trucks, swirled on social media.\n\nFacts First: The number of trucks involved in the protest was never anywhere close to 50,000; such a number of trucks would have taken up : The number of trucks involved in the protest was never anywhere close to 50,000; such a number of trucks would have taken up hundreds of miles more road space than this protest occupied . Canadian journalists put the number of trucks in the hundreds in late January. Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly told reporters on January 31 that it was impossible to provide exact crowd-size figures but that he had \"heard\" numbers as high as 18,000 total demonstrators -- not just truckers -- present in the city at the peak of the protest on January 29. No credible source has reported that the number of participating trucks in particular ever approached tens of thousands, let alone \"50,000.\"\n\nPolice in Kingston, Ontario, a city through which a portion of the protest convoy passed, tweeted on January 28 that they had counted 17 full tractor-trailers, 104 tractors without trailers, 424 passenger vehicles and 6 RVs. The same day, Global News chief political correspondent David Akin tweeted that police sources had told him there were \"230 tractors / tractor-trailers & 725 personal vehicles from Toronto and Western Canada,\" plus 200 vehicles from the eastern provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (he added that there were an \"unknown\" number of others involved).\n\nRogan could not be immediately reached for comment. When Fleury was asked for comment about how he had repeated the false \"50,000 truckers\" claim on Fox, he emailed a reply in which he attacked CNN and the Trudeau government and said, \"Ever heard of a little thing called marketing??? It worked.\"\n\nFalsely captioned photos and videos\n\nNumerous social media posts put inaccurate captions on photos and videos of events that had occurred prior to 2022 -- such as truck demonstrations, other protests, even a parade in support of the Special Olympics -- to falsely claim these images were connected to the Canadian convoy protest.\n\nFacts First: One video that has been shared on various social media platforms was captioned to claim that it showed South Carolina truckers heading to Ottawa to join the convoy -- but it actually showed an August 2021 truck parade in support of the Special Olympics, USA Today : One video that has been shared on various social media platforms was captioned to claim that it showed South Carolina truckers heading to Ottawa to join the convoy -- but it actually showed an August 2021 truck parade in support of the Special Olympics, USA Today reported . A video of honking Brazilian truckers that circulated on Facebook was from a May 2021 demonstration in support of President Jair Bolsonaro, not a demonstration in solidarity with the Canadian truckers as some captions claimed, USA Today also reported . A photo of a massive protest crowd, shared in Twitter posts in both English and Spanish as if it were from Ottawa this year, actually depicted a 1991 demonstration in Moscow against the Communist government of the Soviet Union, Reuters reported . And another photo, which has been described in Facebook posts as a group of Amish people driving to support the convoy, is a shot of Old Order Mennonites simply going to church, PolitiFact reported\n\nEven billionaire Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk got in on the game, though without making an explicitly false claim himself.\n\nMusk, who has more than 73 million followers on Twitter and has expressed support for the Canadian protest, tweeted out an aerial image on January 30 that showed a long line of trucks on a road surrounded by snowy land. The image included the words, \"Taking a break from politics for a while. Here's a nice photo of trucks.\"\n\nMusk didn't say anything about where and when the image had been taken, but the replies to his tweet -- which generated more than 40,000 retweets -- showed that a significant number of people believed that it was a shot of the Canadian convoy this year, as some others on social media strongly suggested in their own captions.\n\nA false claim about police resignations\n\nPat King, who was listed as one of the regional organizers of the convoy and has been one of its leading online promoters, has more than 293,000 followers on his Facebook page . During a Facebook livestream on Sunday, which had been viewed more than 204,000 times as of early Tuesday afternoon, King claimed that \"50% of the Ottawa police force have all turned in their resignation today\" -- suggesting these supposed resignations had happened because the officers support the protests.\n\nThat claim quickly made its way to other social media platforms . British actor John Bowe tweeted on Monday: \"Reports that 50% of @OttawaPolice have tendered their resignation and Canadian Armed forces reportedly vow allegiance to the people.\" Bowe's tweet generated more than 11,000 retweets before he deleted it.\n\nFacts First: These claims were entirely false. Ottawa police spokesperson Constable Amy Gagnon said in Monday emails to CNN that \"there have been no resignations in relation to the Demonstration\" and \"all available officers are working.\" And the Canadian Armed Forces have not made any vow of \"allegiance\" in relation to the protests nor issued any dramatic statements of any kind about this issue. \"In short, no, we have not made any such comment,\" a military spokesperson said in a Monday email to CNN.\n\nKing, who has a history of promoting conspiracy theories and other false claims, did not respond to CNN's requests for comment on Monday. After CNN fact-checked Bowe's tweet on Twitter on Monday, Bowe tweeted to another Twitter user that \"I wish it were (true) but it is disputed. Apparently the reports I read were posted by an imaginative trucker. But we can dream.\"\n\nA false claim about the government and hotels\n\nRupa Subramanya, who has more than 128,000 Twitter followers and writes columns for the National Post , a conservative Canadian newspaper, tweeted on Sunday: \"I've heard from so many today that some Ottawa hotels have been instructed by the city/feds not to give out rooms to the protestors. The Marriott downtown apparently is empty but evidently all the rooms booked. Someone should really investigate if this is true.\"\n\nFacts First: Regardless of what Subramanya may have been told, the claims she amplified were not true. The employees who took CNN's calls at the downtown Marriott and five other Ottawa hotels on Monday said their establishments had not been given any anti-protester instruction by any government; Patrick Champagne, press secretary to Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, told CNN that the claim \"is categorically false\"; Alexander Cohen, spokesperson for Canadian Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino, called the claim \"ludicrous\" and said that \"no one from the federal government has done that\"; Steve Bell, president of the Ottawa Gatineau Hotel Association, said that \"to my knowledge there is no truth to this rumour.\" As for the Marriott in particular, it had rooms available at the time of Subramanya's tweet on Sunday evening and again on Monday evening.\n\nWhen CNN told Subramanya that the claims in her tweet seemed to be false, she said she was glad we had looked into the matter. She insisted she had herself made \"no claim\" and had merely issued a \"call for help\" for journalists to look into what she had been hearing from protesters, since \"frankly I've been working round the clock talking to people on the ground and so I haven't had the time or the opportunity to vet this claim.\"\n\nThe \"mainstream Canadian media should be fact checking these and debunking them if they're false,\" Subramanya said, though she herself writes for a national Canadian newspaper.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/10/fact-check-no-proof-zimbabwean-inventors-chargeless-electric-car/6104513002/", "title": "Fact check: No evidence that Zimbabwean inventor created a ...", "text": "The claim: A Zimbabwean inventor created a chargeless electric vehicle\n\nIn 2013, CEO Elon Musk founded Tesla, which has become the largest American seller of electric vehicles.

To be honest, I hadn’t until today,” wrote Victor Mukandatsama of Techzim. “The company will hold an open day to showcase technologies that they have been working on at the Bluffhill Industrial Park in Harare.”\n\nMukandatsama said the electric car project by Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso was \"another interesting development considering the scarcity of energy and power in Africa.\"\n\nThe promotional event gained a lot of media attention at the time from outlets such as South African news channel SABC Digital News.\n\nFact check: Post quoting Amy Coney Barrett and Greta Thunberg on climate change is true\n\nMedia outlet questions authenticity\n\nAll evidence that has been used throughout the years to support the alleged invention of electric car that needs no charge traces back to photos from the “Open Day” event.\n\nThe only images available on Saith Technologies' Facebook and Twitter page are from that event, and the account has been inactive since 2015.\n\nLeonard Sengere, editor of Techzim, told Snopes that one of its reporters attended the event and was given a tour of the \"inventions.”\n\n“The electric car and the generator were shown running and that was the extent of it,” Sengere said. “There was no chance for anyone to verify exactly what they were running on,” adding that the scientific community “largely just ignored him.”\n\nIn the days following the event, Techzim published an article debunking misconceptions about Saith Technologies' claims, including the electric car.\n\nTechzim reported the \"discovery\" used simple gel batteries of 220 volts into a higher output of 500,000 watts, making his claim \"advanced beyond the law of conservation of energy.\"\n\n\"We are not sure how this assertion can be dispelled and we hope at some forum scientist will put the claims to test,\" Techzim wrote.\n\nThe Associated Press and PolitiFact also previously debunked this claim in 2018.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe claim that a Zimbabwean inventor created an electric car that doesn't need to be charged is FALSE, based on our research. The claim stems from a 2015 event that included a variety of questionable fake inventions. There has been no evidence in the past five years that the car was made and the media outlet that reported on the event later published an article debunking Saith Technologies' claim.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Zipline is a video-sharing platform that allows users the ability to share up to 60-second videos or \"Zips,\" something no other app on the market does.\n\nQ: How did you come up with the name?\n\nAaron Peadbody: I came up with the whole idea one night in my dorm room around 3:30 a.m. I chose the name Zipline because it fits with our vision perfectly.\n\nIf you've ever been on a zip line, it's about a one- or two-minute ride, and it becomes a very vivid memory. That's what we are trying to do with our platform.\n\nQ: Is this your first time developing an app?\n\nPeabody: Yes, among the five of us on the team, this is our first time creating an app. However, one of our investors who partnered in has been running a technology company in Baltimore for around four years, The Demski Group. He and his team have designed apps for years.\n\nQ: How much will it cost?\n\nCaswell: Zipline is a free app.\n\nQ: How will Zipline make money?\n\nCaswell: We have four different ways of generating revenue. The first way is in-app purchases. For example, if a user wants more editing tools or filters, we will be providing upgrades for them to purchase.\n\nThe second way is subscription-based services for businesses or companies in which they can reach their target market by us making them more relevant on the platform. Third is selling advertisements, but rather than being an annoying pop-up ad, companies will create tasteful Zips, and we will sponsor them in people's news feeds.\n\nLast is a service we are working on called Ziptunez, a music service that allows easy access to music people can use in their Zips. Ziptunez will begin being engineered soon, so we are hoping to have this service available within Zipline in the next few months.\n\nQ: Talk about some of the challenges you've faced creating this app.\n\nPeabody: When I first started this, I had no knowledge in coding or business! I still don't have much knowledge in coding, but that's why we partnered in with Andrew Demski from The Demski Group. I knew that if I was going to make this vision a reality, I needed to find someone with the necessary skill sets to code Zip­line.\n\nQ: Any other bumps in the road?\n\nPeabody: With no one on the team who knew how to code and no monetary resources to pay for its development, I found myself thinking Zip­line may not happen. Everyone in entrepreneurial ventures finds themselves thinking at one point or another, \"this may not happen.\" But regardless, you persevere and find a way.\n\nQ: Will the app be available to Android users, too?\n\nSteve Medina: We plan to have the public release on the App Store the first week of July. As far as the Android market goes, we will begin coding after seeing the results of our iOS launch. We plan on having the Android version available in about two months.\n\nQ: What tips do you have for other young entrepreneurs who are interested in getting into the social media app market?\n\nPeabody: Don't do it. I'm just kidding! If you are willing to compete with big companies like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, it is worth it. Just know you are going to be swimming in shark-infested waters, but if you can persevere and come out on top, there will be no better feeling in the world.\n\nQ: What are your plans after graduation?\n\nKeven Tillman: We all have different plans after graduation at Indiana Wesleyan, but we all have one goal, which is Zipline. We want to grow Zipline into another social media giant, and we truly believe it will be. If an acquisition occurs for the right deal, we would be very excited. If not, we want to IPO (initial public offering) Zipline in five years.\n\nQ: Who are your tech role models? Tell us about them.\n\nPeabody: I have so many! I don't really have a technology role model, but I am a true believer and follower of Jesus and Elon Musk. A lot of people don't know about Elon Musk's life before Tesla. He bought an office lease and showered at the YMCA until he made it with PayPal. The way he is able to move massive amounts of capital is extraordinary. Elon Musk makes the impossible possible. I mean, look at the Tesla or SpaceX. He made sustainability sexy.\n\nQ: How many hours a day do you spend using Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or other social media sites?\n\nCaswell: I think I use them the most! But I can get away with it since it's kind of my job right now. Jesse Good and myself do most of the marketing on social media, but I also do it for fun. I couldn't tell you how many hours a day I spend, but I know I find myself checking Twitter and Instagram at least every 20 minutes. That sounds terrible. But hey, I'll be using Zipline even more once it's out on the market.\n\nCall Star reporter Cara Anthony at (317) 444-6049.

Ukraine\n\nRussian troops are escalating their offensive in the south and east of Ukraine but are facing stiff resistance as they target the country's central and western regions, Ukrainian officials said yesterday. This comes as Russian forces took control of the Kherson City Council, weeks after first occupying the southern Ukrainian city. Russia also announced it will stage a referendum asking people to approve the \"independence\" of a new entity called \"the Kherson People's Republic.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the move a \" sham referendum ,\" saying civilians have already shown \"their attitude toward the occupiers\" by protesting in occupied towns. Meanwhile, as the war enters its third month, Zelensky said Russia has fired more than 1,100 missiles at Ukrainian targets, in addition to \"countless bombs and artillery.\"\n\n2. Twitter\n\nTwitter said yesterday it will sell itself to Elon Musk in a roughly $44 billion deal. The agreement, which was unanimously approved by Twitter's board, is expected to close later this year pending approval from shareholders and regulators. In a statement yesterday, Musk reiterated his proposed changes for the platform, including his goal to bolster free speech. He said in a tweet yesterday that he hopes \"even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\" Many people are wondering whether Musk plans to restore former President Donald Trump's account , which was suspended early last year for violating Twitter policies against inciting violence following the Capitol Riot. Such a move could have significant ramifications for the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump says he won't return to Twitter even if he's reinstated by Musk Replay More Videos ...

Immigration\n\nA federal judge in Louisiana yesterday temporarily blocked the Biden administration from ending a Trump-era pandemic restriction on the US-Mexico border that allows authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries. The public health authority, known as Title 42, was on track to end on May 23, but this latest ruling may throw a wrench in the administration's plans moving forward. The decision to lift Title 42 has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike because border authorities say a massive surge of migrants would follow. More than 20 states had asked the court to block the administration from ending the restriction and last week asked the court to immediately intervene.\n\nJUST WATCHED Avlon: Title 42 'is not evidence of open borders, it is just the opposite' Replay More Videos ...

Researchers have targeted 60 genes that make up the mammoth’s distinctive characteristics, and they will use elephant eggs or tissue.\n\nResearchers believe that if the mammoths can be created, they could revitalize grasslands in the Arctic. Colossal said Monday that the project could have “major climate change-combatting properties including carbon sequestering, methane suppression and light reflection.”\n\nLamm told USA TODAY that reintroducing woolly mammoths to the Arctic tundra \"will allow mammoths to trample the taiga and slow growing plants, fertilize the ground, uproot trees, and allow for grasslands to return, which in turn support more life.\"\n\nWoolly Mammoths:World's oldest DNA discovered in 1.2-million-year-old mammoth teeth\n\n'Completely preserved':Ice Age cave bear carcass found by reindeer herders in Russia\n\nResearchers hope to produce mammoth calves within four to six years, Lamm told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We are working hard to scale up not only our genomic editing capabilities but also artificial womb research that will support the development of hundreds and potentially thousands of woolly mammoths at the same time,\" he said.\n\nThe project is not new territory for Church, who is a genetics professor at Harvard Medical School and a core faculty member at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. For eight years, he has been leading a group researching methods of creating mammoths, The New York Times reported.\n\nColossal was launched with $15 million in funding, including investments from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who rose to fame after suing Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe project has garnered concerns from other researchers.

You are talking about hundreds of thousands of mammoths which each take 22 months to gestate and 30 years to grow to maturity.”\n\nLamm noted that \"there have been some questions raised on whether the revival of the woolly mammoth can be done at the required speed needed to make a positive impact on the degrading Arctic ecosystem.\"\n\n\"We are confident that Colossal is up to this challenge as we have brought on world renowned scientists and researchers that are passionate about bringing the woolly mammoth back and successfully rewilding them into the Arctic.\"\n\nGareth Phoenix, a professor of plant and global change ecology at the University of Sheffield, also told the Guardian, “While we do need a multitude of different approaches to stop climate change, we also need to initiate solutions responsibly to avoid unintended damaging consequences.”\n\n“Mammoths are proposed as a solution to help stop permafrost thaw because they will remove trees, trample and compact the ground and convert landscapes to grassland, which can help keep the ground cool,” he said. “However, we know in the forested Arctic regions that trees and moss cover can be critical in protecting permafrost, so removing the trees and trampling the moss would be the last thing you’d want to do.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/world/tasmanian-tiger-thylacine-deextinction-scn/index.html", "title": "Scientists plan the resurrection of an animal that's been extinct since ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more\n\n(CNN) Almost 100 years after its extinction, the Tasmanian tiger may live once again. Scientists want to resurrect the striped carnivorous marsupial, officially known as a thylacine, which used to roam the Australian bush.\n\nThe ambitious project will harness advances in genetics, ancient DNA retrieval and artificial reproduction to bring back the animal.\n\n\"We would strongly advocate that first and foremost we need to protect our biodiversity from further extinctions, but unfortunately we are not seeing a slowing down in species loss,\" said Andrew Pask, a professor at the University of Melbourne and head of its Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research Lab, who is leading the initiative.\n\n\"This technology offers a chance to correct this and could be applied in exceptional circumstances where cornerstone species have been lost,\" he added.\n\nThe project isa collaboration withColossal Biosciences, founded by tech entrepreneur Ben Lamm and Harvard Medical School geneticist George Church, who are working on an equally ambitious, if not bolder, $15 million project to bring back the woolly mammoth in an altered form.\n\neverywhere except the Australian island of Tasmania. As the only marsupial apex predator that lived in modern times, it played a key role in its ecosystem, but that also made it unpopular with humans. About the size of a coyote , the thylacine disappeared about 2,000 years ago virtuallyeverywhere except the Australian island of Tasmania. As the only marsupial apex predator that lived in modern times, it played a key role in its ecosystem,but that also made it unpopular with humans.\n\nEuropean settlers on the island in the 1800s blamed thylacines for livestock losses (although, in most cases, feral dogs and human habitat mismanagement were actually the culprits), and they hunted the shy, seminocturnal Tasmanian tigers to the point of extinction.\n\noccurred shortly after thylacines had been granted protected status, but it was too late to save the species. The last thylacine living in captivity, named Benjamin, died from exposure in 1936 at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania. This monumental lossoccurred shortly after thylacines had been granted protected status, but it was too late to save the species.\n\nGenetic blueprint\n\nThe project involves several complicated steps that incorporate cutting-edge science and technology, such as gene editing and building artificial wombs.\n\nFirst, the team will construct a detailed genome of the extinct animal and compare it with that of its closest living relative -- a mouse-size carnivorous marsupial called the fat-tailed dunnart -- to identify the differences.\n\n\"We then take living cells from our dunnart and edit their DNA every place where it differs from the thylacine. We are essentially engineering our dunnart cell to become a Tasmanian tiger cell,\" Pask explained.\n\nOnce the team has successfully programmed a cell, Pask said stem cell and reproductive techniques involving dunnarts as surrogates would \"turn that cell back into a living animal.\"\n\n\"Our ultimate goal with this technology is to restore these species to the wild, where they played absolutely essential roles in the ecosystem. So our ultimate hope is that you would be seeing them in the Tasmanian bushland again one day,\" he said.\n\nThe fat-tailed dunnart is much smaller than an adult Tasmanian tiger, but Pask said that all marsupials give birth to tiny young, sometimes as small as a grain of rice. This means that even a mouse-size marsupial could serve as a surrogate mother for a much larger adult animal like the thylacine, at least in the early stages.\n\nReintroducing the thylacine to its former habit would have to be done very cautiously, Pask added.\n\n\"Any release such as this requires studying the animal and its interaction in the ecosystem over many seasons and in large areas of enclosed land before you would consider a complete rewilding,\" he said.\n\nThe team hasn't set a time line for the project, but Lamm said he thought progress would be quicker than the efforts to bring back the woolly mammoth, noting that elephants take far longer to gestate than dunnarts.\n\nThe techniques could also help living marsupials, such as the Tasmanian devil, avoid the thylacine's fate as they grapple with intensifying bushfires as a result of the climate crisis.\n\n\"The technologies we are developing to de-extinct the thylacine all have immediate conservation benefits -- right now -- to protect marsupial species. Biobanks of frozen tissue from living marsupial populations have been collected to protect against extinction from fires,\" Pask said via email.\n\n\"However, we still lack the technology to take that tissue -- create marsupial stem cells -- and then turn those cells into a living animal. That is the technology we will develop as a part of this project.\"\n\nHybrid animals\n\nThe path forward, however, is not cut-and-dried. Tom Gilbert, a professor at the University of Copenhagen's GLOBE Institute, said there are significant limitations to de-extinction.\n\nRecreating the full genome of a lost animal from DNA contained in old thylacine skeletons is extremely challenging, and thus some genetic information will be missing, explained Gilbert, who is also director of the Danish National Research Foundation's Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics. He has studied resurrecting the extinct Christmas Island rat, also known as the Maclear's rat, but isn't involved in the thylacine project. The team won't be able to exactly recreate the thylacine but instead will end up creating a hybrid animal, an altered form of thylacine.\n\n\"We are unlikely to get the full genome sequence of the extinct species, thus we will never be able to fully recreate the genome of the lost form. There will always be some parts that can't be changed,\" Gilbert said via email.\n\n\"They will have to cherry pick what changes to make. And thus the result will be a hybrid.\"\n\nIt's possible, he said, that a genetically imperfect hybrid thylacine could have health problems and might not survive without a lot of help from humans. Other experts question the very concept of spending tens of millions of dollars on de-extinction attempts when so many living animals are on the brink of disappearing.\n\n\"To me the real benefit of any de-extinction project such as this is the awesomeness of it. Doing it seems very justified to me simply because it will excite people about science, nature, conservation,\" Gilbert said.\n\n\"And we sure as hell need that in the wonderful citizens of our world if we are to survive into the future. But ... do the stakeholders realize what they will get will not be the thylacine but some imperfect hybrid? What we don't need is yet more people disappointed (or) feeling cheated by science.\"", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/08/17/gas-prices-rudy-giuliani-liz-cheney-tasmanian-tiger-resurrection-its-wednesdays-news/10329723002/", "title": "Gas prices, Rudy Giuliani, Liz Cheney, Tasmanian tiger resurrection ...", "text": "Gas prices are dropping.

Check your local forecast here.\n\nLiz Cheney for president?\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, Trump's most prominent Republican critic, said she's intent on keeping him out of the Oval Office and may consider a presidential run herself. Hours after her stinging defeat in her GOP primary in Wyoming, she said a 2024 campaign \"is something I’m thinking about and I’ll make a decision in the coming months.\" She did not mention party affiliation, and there has been speculation she could run as an independent. But analysts are skeptical, saying Cheney is unlikely to beat Trump or even be a viable independent candidate. Keep reading.\n\nLiz Cheney, from Trump backer - then critic - to considering 2024 run.\n\n- to considering 2024 run. What are Cheney's political positions? What happened in her Wyoming primary? Everything you need to know.\n\n🗳 Wyoming, Alaska primaries recap: Cheney loses to Hageman in Wyoming; Alaska's Murkowski and Palin advance to general.\n\nGiuliani appears before grand jury\n\nRudy Giuliani departed a Georgia courthouse Wednesday, declining to comment following a nearly six-hour session before a special grand jury investigating interference in the 2020 election. Giuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, declined to say whether former President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer invoked his right against self-incrimination after being designated by prosecutors as a target of the inquiry. Giuliani had made wide-ranging claims that voting systems altered Georgia ballots while ignoring a hand-count audit that confirmed President Joe Biden's victory in the state. Giuliani is the closest Trump associate known to have been summoned before the Fulton County grand jury, and demands for the testimony of others are pending. Here's the latest on Trump's investigations.\n\nWhat everyone's talking about\n\nThe Short List is free, but several stories we link to are subscriber-only.

As of Wednesday, AAA data showed the average price per gallon in 29 states was below $4, and a handful of Southern states are inching closer to $3. But experts warn that prices could spike again. See what gas prices look like in each state.\n\nWhy are gas prices falling? Lackluster demand among drivers and oil released from the strategic petroleum reserve have helped, but the majority of the savings come from the drop in oil prices.\n\nLackluster demand among drivers and oil released from the strategic petroleum reserve have helped, but the majority of the savings come from the drop in oil prices. Will they go below $3? Wholesale gasoline futures indicate gas prices in \"quite a few\" areas could fall under $3 around Thanksgiving and Christmas, according to Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. This includes regions in Oklahoma, Kansas and Gulf Coast states like Texas.\n\nFemale athletes stiffed on scholarships\n\nUnder Title IX, schools are required to distribute athletic scholarship dollars equitably between men and women. But each year, thousands of the nation's top college female athletes get the short end of the same stick. And unlike some aspects of Title IX that are subjective and complex, the scholarship requirement is relatively straightforward. USA TODAY analyzed the 107 public universities with top football programs. Only 32 complied.

But a genetic engineering company called Colossal is looking to resurrect it. In a project that sounds like it's straight out of Jurassic Park, scientists will use gene-editing technology and a complete Tasmanian tiger genome from a preserved specimen to create an embryo. The ultimate goal is to reestablish the animal on the island of Tasmania, off the southeast tip of Australia. The predator was exterminated in the early 20th century because it was a threat to livestock. Keep reading.\n\nA break from the news\n\nLaura L. Davis is an Audience Editor at USA TODAY.

Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told USA TODAY. \"(Democrats are) all in this together. We are all making life better for the American people.\"\n\nThe sweeping legislation on health care, climate and taxes passed through the Senate 51-50 along party lines last week after a 15-hour session of debate, amendments and negotiation ending in Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote.\n\n\"There are a few days in a congressional career that feel truly historic. To me, this is one of them,\" House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., said on the floor ahead of the vote.\n\n\"This legislation is historic, it's transformative and really a cause for celebration,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a news conference ahead of the vote.\n\nHouse Republicans criticized the Inflation Reduction Act as overreaching and said the billions of dollars in spending wouldn't solve inflation.\n\n\"Today the majority jams through another spending spree,\" House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy said in his nearly 50-minute speech on the floor ahead of the vote. \"I believe the largest tone-deaf bill we’ve seen in this chamber in 230 years.\n\n\"Passing this bill today means more expensive bills for Americans tomorrow.\"\n\nSome voters, and progressive lawmakers like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have said the Inflation Reduction Act doesn’t do enough to immediately alleviate strains on working families. He voted for the measure despite his tepid backing, saying the bill was a worthy down payment and signaling to other progressives they should support it as well.\n\nMore:Here's how the Inflation Reduction Act could save consumers money and protect the planet\n\nIt’s hard to show how the bill translates into immediate, meaningful change for Americans’ wallets, said Casey Burgat, legislative affairs program director at George Washington University.\n\nBut it is “a huge, landmark piece of legislation,” he said. “It’s a Democratic bill through and through. It’s not as big as they wanted it to be, but it’s what is passable in a 50-50 Senate headed into a midterm.”\n\nThis vote follows a productive summer for Democrats, who passed a gun control bill, the CHIPS Act to boost high-tech manufacturing and the PACT Act to aid veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, as well as approving Finland and Sweden’s entry to NATO.\n\nThat’s a remarkable lineup of legislation in a Senate Democratic majority that can’t afford to lose one vote and has to negotiate with a range of ideologies from Sanders to Sen. Joe Manchin, a coal-country moderate representing West Virginia, Burgat said.\n\n“It’s a surprising amount they’ve gotten done,” he said.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act – a pared-down version of Biden's original Build Back Better plan – will now go to the president's desk for a signature.\n\nBiden's original $1.7 trillion domestic package included an array of social investments like universal preschool, paid family leave and an expanded child tax credit. Those social programs were cut over a year of negotiations in the Senate, with moderate Democrats such as Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona taking aim at the bill's cost and impact on the growing national debt.\n\nEven as concessions in negotiations stripped the bill of many social investments and pared down climate investments by more than $100 billion, progressive Democrats still celebrated the Inflation Reduction Act as a legislative win and the largest investment in climate in the nation's history.\n\n\"There would be no Inflation Reduction Act without Build Back Better, and there would be no Build Back Better without the work of the progressive caucus,\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., said in a progressive caucus news conference early Friday.\n\nThe 10-year, $739 billion package will raise taxes on certain corporations while reducing the deficit by about $100 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe bill would allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices – long opposed by the pharmaceutical industry – and extend Affordable Care Act subsidies three more years through 2025.\n\n\"We have been trying for decades to prevail, to win legislation that enabled the (Health and Human Services) secretary to negotiate lower drug prices,\" Pelosi said in a news conference. \"Big Pharma has had a stranglehold on Congress, and we couldn't get it done until now.\"\n\nIt also would reinstate a tax on the oil industry to help pay for the cleanup of hazardous Superfund sites. And it would add 87,000 IRS workers to help process a lengthy backlog of audits, which McCarthy called the \"most chilling\" part of the act.\n\nCandy Woodall is a Congress reporter for USA TODAY.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. – tackles long-standing liberal priorities. The White House's loftier ambitions to expand the social safety net in last year's Build Back Better bill were scrapped during a roller-coaster year of negotiations among Democrats.\n\n\"I ran for President promising to make government work for working families again, and that is what this bill does – period,\" Biden said in a statement issued by the White House after the vote that thanked Democrats for staying unified. \"It required many compromises. Doing important things almost always does.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had a different view of the $739 billion package that would raise taxes on certain corporations while reducing the deficit by about $100 billion over the next decade.\n\n\"Senate Democrats are misreading the American people’s outrage as a mandate for yet another reckless taxing and spending spree,\" he said in a statement issued Saturday. \"Democrats have already robbed American families once through inflation, and now their solution is to rob American families a second time.\"\n\nThe bill would allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices – long opposed by the pharmaceutical industry – and extend Affordable Care Act subsidies three more years through 2025.\n\n'INFLATION REDUCTION ACT':What you need to know about major effort to fight climate change\n\nTo address climate change, the bill includes $10 billion in tax credits to build electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines; $7,500 tax credit rebates for consumers to buy electric vehicles; and $9 billion for energy-efficient home retrofits for low-income Americans.\n\nThere's up to $20 billion for loans to support electric vehicle plants, $20 billion to assist farmers and ranchers with climate change and $30 billion for cities and states to transition utilities to clean electricity.\n\nTo pay for these and other measures, the bill would establish a 15% corporate minimum tax and beef up enforcement of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe bill would raise about $739 billion in tax revenue, more than offsetting the $433 billion in proposed spending. The legislation would decrease the federal deficit by $102 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bill didn't pass unscathed: Republicans stripped a $35 monthly cap on insulin co-pays via amendment, arguing the provision violated procedural rules. Seven Republicans sided with Democrats to try to keep the measure in place: Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.\n\nDemocrats lowered the cost of insulin through Medicare in the bill, as Republicans' amendment targeted only the cap on insulin co-pays for private insurers.\n\nWHAT LED UP TO THIS?:Senate Democrats push sweeping climate, health care bill as Republicans try to slow passage\n\nNegotiations for the legislation appeared dead on multiple occasions, picking up only in recent weeks and culminating in a surprise agreement by Schumer and Manchin last week.\n\nDemocrats secured enough support to pass the bill in the evenly divided Senate when Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said Thursday she would vote for it after securing commitments on drought relief and tax changes.\n\nAmid 40-year-high inflation, Democrats framed and titled the legislation as a way to bring down consumer costs, but economists disagree on how effective it would be in that regard.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton budget model predicted the impact on inflation would be \"statistically indistinguishable from zero\" over the long term and slightly increase inflation before 2024.\n\nAn analysis from Moody's Analytics found the legislation would \"nudge the economy and inflation in the right direction, while meaningfully addressing climate change and reducing the government’s budget deficits.\"\n\nSchumer, in a news conference after the vote, called the bill “the most significant bill to fight the climate crisis ever.\"\n\nBut he also said throughout negotiations that he told his caucus they “were going to have to swallow some bad stuff to get the good stuff,” like permitting reform backed by Manchin that’s seen as beneficial to the fossil fuel industry.\n\nAnd while the Inflation Reduction Act did not include many of Biden’s sweeping social programs proposed in his original Build Back Better plan, like the child tax credit and family leave, Schumer said that Senate Democrats “would return to those issues with a vengeance in the fall.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/08/senate-inflation-reduction-act-drug-pricing-energy-biden/10271357002/", "title": "Senate passes Inflation Reduction Act to address drug pricing, energy", "text": "Hello, OnPolitics readers!\n\nPresident Joe Biden saw firsthand Monday what he described as \"incredibly heartbreaking\" devastation unleashed by flash flooding that killed at least 37 people in southeastern Kentucky and left a path of destruction across several counties.\n\nKentucky Gov.

Apologies from Ayres: More than 800 people face criminal prosecution for Jan. 6, but Stephen Ayres is the only charged rioter to testify live in front of the House Jan. 6 committee investigating the attack. Should he be forgiven?\n\nBiden has used a wartime power throughout his presidency, but will he rely on it even more?\n\nOn his first full day in office, President Joe Biden took advantage of a special, wartime power to supercharge the U.S. pandemic response, using a tool he would return to multiple times throughout his presidency.\n\nIn an executive order citing authority under the Defense Production Act, the new president directed his administration to secure masks, tests and other equipment in short supply. Biden soon ordered a 100-day White House review of American industry that concluded the act was a “powerful tool” that could be deployed beyond the pandemic and traditional military use.\n\nWhat is the Defense Production Act? The Defense Production Act, enacted in 1950 at the start of the Korean War, is an authority the president has to order private business to prioritize and produce goods needed for the national defense, emergency preparedness and to recover from natural disasters.\n\nBiden went on to issue a series of orders relying on the act – to jumpstart mining of minerals for electric car batteries in March and to increase baby formula supplies in May. In June, he invoked the act in orders authorizing federal investment in manufacturing of solar panel components, insulation, electrical transformers and heat pumps, part of a broader effort to combat climate change.\n\nBiden’s exercising of the unilateral power has also drawn criticism that he has twisted the act beyond its intent to advance his political agenda and, at times, to compensate for administration oversights.\n\nHistory shows Biden is far from the first commanders in chief to use the law. Former Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama used it, as did George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

Dickens secured about 23% of the vote, less than 1% more than Reed did.\n\n“I am confident that people have heard our message for change and agree with us that Atlanta deserves more,” Moore told supporters Tuesday night.\n\nAlthough Reed raised the most money in the nonpartisan race, Dickens picked up momentum in the weeks before the election and was endorsed by former Mayor Shirley Franklin.\n\n“You chose a path to the future tonight,” Dickens told supporters shortly after he inched ahead of Reed early Wednesday. “The people decided that it was time to save the soul of our city and to move this campaign forward into the runoff.

Smith, Vineland Daily Journal\n\nGOP dominates Virginia races\n\nVirginia Republicans completed a sweep of down-ballot statewide offices Wednesday, with victories for attorney general and lieutenant governor, including the first Black woman ever to be elected statewide in the commonwealth.\n\nThe wins echoed the Democrats' defeat in the race for governor, and marked a dramatic turnaround in a state where the GOP had not won a statewide race since 2009.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, Republican Winsome Sears, who returned to Virginia politics after an absence of nearly two decades, defeated Democrat Hala Ayala. Sears becomes the first woman to serve as lieutenant governor and the first woman of color to hold statewide office. Ayala would have broken the same historic barriers had she won.\n\nIn the attorney general's race, Republican Jason Miyares, the son of a Cuban immigrant, defeated the Democratic incumbent, Mark Herring, who was running for a third term. The AG race was called late on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Ayala and Herring conceded.\n\nSears rocketed out of political obscurity earlier this year when she won the GOP nomination on the strength of a campaign photo in which she posed holding a military rifle.

Phil Murphy speaks at victory rally\n\nDemocratic Gov. Phil Murphy, fresh off the Associated Press call that he won re-election in New Jersey, spoke at a victory rally Wednesday night.\n\nIn a brief speech in Asbury Park, New Jersey, Murphy said he was \"humbled\" to win a second term and seemed to acknowledge how divided the electorate was in the results.\n\n\"If you want to be governor of all of New Jersey, you must listen to all of New Jersey. And New Jersey, I hear you,\" he said. \"So tonight I renew my promise to you — whether you voted for me or not — to work every single day of the next four years to keep moving us forward.\"\n\nHowever, the campaign of his Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, did not concede defeat.\n\n\"With the candidates separated by a fraction of a percent out of 2.4 million ballots cast, it’s irresponsible of the media to make this call when the New Jersey Secretary of State doesn’t even know how many ballots are left to be counted,\" spokeswoman Stami Williams said on Twitter.\n\n– Dustin Racioppi\n\n5 election takeaways:Education critical in Virginia; an historic night for candidates of color\n\nIn New Jersey, localized politics\n\nSimilar to Virginia, New Jersey’s matchup between Ciattarelli and Murphy often localized national politics.\n\nWhile Ciattarelli tried to steer attention to the parochial issues of property tax rates, school funding and quality of life, Murphy’s campaign relentlessly tied him to former president Donald Trump.\n\nAnticipating another four years under Murphy, advocates and the governor’s supporters have pushed an ambitious and wide-ranging agenda that includes putting an end to all fossil fuel projects, decriminalizing all drugs, reforming the tax code and studying reparations.\n\nDespite his strong outside support, Murphy would still have to bargain with Democratic lawmakers who have at times served as a check on his ambitions. Democrats retained their control of both chambers of the Legislature, though they appeared to be on pace to lose seats, including the powerful one held by Sweeney. Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin was expected to keep his leadership positions.\n\nRepublicans haven’t controlled the Legislature for 20 years and now, with Ciattarelli’s narrow loss, the question turns to whether they can build on this year's momentum to take back political control in the legislative or executive branches.\n\nRead the whole story here:NJ Gov.

Phil Murphy won reelection, the AP said on Wednesday , the first Democrat voters have sent back to Trenton in nearly half a century.\n\nMurphy, 64, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, in one of two closely watched gubernatorial elections this year. Before Tuesday, a Democrat had not been reelected New Jersey governor since 1977.\n\nThe incumbent governor was long the favorite in the race, but the election drew national attention in the waning days of the campaign as polls showed a narrowing gap between the two candidates.\n\nA former U.S. ambassador to Germany, Murphy was first elected governor in 2017.\n\n-- Rick Rouan\n\nOnce considered sleepy, New Jersey race now in spotlight\n\nNew Jersey's gubernatorial race, widely considered to be a sleepy contest favoring incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy, has suddenly become the country's most-watched election as a potential bellwether for next year's congressional midterms.\n\nMurphy's lead in all public polls, his moneyed apparatus, his marquee endorsements and the advantage of having a million more registered Democrats than Republicans did not translate into a decisive victory Tuesday night — or even a projected one.\n\nInstead, it could be days or longer before a winner is declared, because the race was so close Wednesday and mail-in ballots had to be counted.\n\nEven if Murphy defeats challenger Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican Party is energized in ways it hasn't been in years, and Murphy could hardly claim he has a mandate to build on the progressive framework he built out in his first term, political analysts said.\n\nRead the rest here:Once considered a sleepy race, New Jersey's contest for governor may now be a bellwether\n\n-- Dustin Racioppi\n\n‘People want us to get things done’: Biden responds to Democratic gubernatorial loss in Virginia\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday that Democrats’ disappointing results in Virginia’s gubernatorial election showed that voters want Congress to act on his domestic spending agenda to “produce for the American people.”\n\n\"What I do know is that people want us to get things done,” Biden said when asked how much responsibility he takes for the loss of Democrat Terry McAuliffe. “And that's why I'm continuing to push very hard for the Democratic Party to move along and pass my infrastructure bill and my ‘Build Back Better’ bill.\"\n\nBiden, making his first public comments about the results, did not explicitly accept responsibility for Democrats' bad night. He noted that McAuliffe received the most votes ever for a Democratic candidate for governor in Virginia.\n\nHe said his social spending and infrastructure bills “should have passed” before election day but isn’t sure it would have “changed the number of very conservative folks” who turned out in red districts where Donald Trump is popular to vote for Republican Glenn Youngkin.\n\n\"But maybe, maybe,\" Biden added.\n\nBiden made multiple campaign stops in Virginia for McAuliffe and aggressively sought to tie Youngkin to the divisive politics of Trump.\n\n“People are upset and uncertain about a lot of things,” Biden said, “from COVID, to school, to jobs, to a whole range of things – and the cost of a gallon of gasoline. And so, if I'm able to pass and sign into law my ‘Build Back Better’ initiative, I'm in a position where you're going to see a lot of those things ameliorated quickly and swiftly. So that has to be done.”\n\nAsked what Democrats need to do to respond to Republican attacks over critical race theory and other cultural issues, Biden said, “We should produce for the American people.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nVirginia voters said about race, education and teachers\n\nConcerns about how race is taught in schools brought out voters across Virginia on Election Day, when it emerged as a key reason some residents cast a ballot in the commonwealth’s gubernatorial race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin.\n\nYoungkin, who defeated the former governor, leaned into parents' anger over education during the campaign, vowing to ban the teaching of critical race theory when he enters office. He and his supporters criticized McAuliffe for comments made during a debate on Sept. 29: “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,” McAuliffe said.\n\nCritical race theory is a legal framework that examines how systemic racism continues to permeate U.S. law and society. Virginia public schools do not teach it at K-12 levels. Nevertheless, the candidates and voters appeared focused on the issue this election.\n\n-- Katie Wadington\n\nRead the full story:Here's what Virginia voters said about race, education and teachers in the Youngkin-McAuliffe election\n\nMurphy, Ciattarelli trade leads\n\nAs of midafternoon Wednesday, the New Jersey governor's race remains on a razor's edge, with votes trickling in.\n\nUpdated vote totals have incumbent Phil Murphy ahead of Jack Ciattarelli by nearly 15,000 votes, according to the Associated Press, which put Murphy's vote total at 1,199,614 and Ciattarelli's total at 1,184,723.\n\nThe closeness of the race has surprised experts, who watched public polls showing Murphy leading comfortably and looked to his party's registration advantage of more than a million voters.\n\n“If you asked anybody several months ago within the state, I think anyone would have predicted a high double digit landslide for Murphy,” said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling.\n\nNew Jersey does not have an automatic recount law, but the candidates are permitted to request one. The party that wants a recount has to file a suit in State Superior Court in the counties where they want to contest tallies. That has to be done within 17 days of Election Day.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nAftab Pureval makes history as Cincinnati's first Asian American mayor\n\nAftab Pureval is Cincinnati's next mayor, nabbing a whopping 66% of the vote and becoming the first Asian-American Pacific mayor in the city's history.\n\n\"We made history in Cincinnati,\" Pureval said to supporters who gathered to celebrate his win Tuesday night. He defeated longtime Cincinnati politician David Mann, who conceded the race at 10 p.m.\n\nPureval, 39, of Clifton, is the Hamilton County clerk of courts.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., voiced disappointment with the close results in New Jerseys’ governor’s race, but said Gov. Phil Murphy had a difficult job during the pandemic.\n\n“Clearly I'm disappointed, but I'm glad that it looks like Murphy's gonna pull through,” Booker said.\n\n“Leading during crisis is always hard. We just went through unprecedented pandemic, and he stood in the saddle, made tough choices, kept people safe. But it's a hard job.”\n\nBooker couldn’t say whether the race had any implications for congressional races in 2022.\n\n“I'm not extrapolating anything on this right now,” the second-term senator said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nKaine weighs in on McAuliffe's loss: 'Dems blew the timing'\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said if Democrats in Congress had passed legislation for President Joe Biden’s social welfare program and for infrastructure, the victories would have helped Terry McAuliffe in the race he lost Tuesday for governor of Virginia and helped congressional Democrats in 2022.\n\nProgressive House Democrats have blocked a vote on infrastructure legislation, which the Senate has already approved, until it can be considered with Biden’s broader package.\n\n“Instead, Democrats wanted to be purists about whatever their own particular goals were left, right and center and hold out and dither and delay,” Kaine said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has proposed voting on both bills as early as this week. Kaine said they might both be completed by Thanksgiving. But McAuliffe has already lost.\n\n“A lot of politics is about timing,” Kaine said. “Dems blew the timing.”\n\nKaine said McAuliffe could have campaigned on universal pre-kindergarten and child care in the larger package, and on the jobs that the infrastructure bill would have created.\n\n“He could have had a really great wind at his back if Democrats had been willing to get the deal done,” Kaine said. “So I'm just saying I hope my colleagues absorb this notion that when you’re in the majority, the D in Democrats should stand for doing and not delay, dithering, do nothing, division.”\n\nKaine noted that turnout was 25% higher than the previous governor’s race four years earlier. The state doesn’t require voters to register by party, so Kaine argued Democrats needed to win over independent voters.\n\n“Terry could have won a lot of them over if we had given him some things to sell, instead of the message primarily that, you know, Dems are in disarray,” Kaine said. “I hope the Dems view this as the Ghost of Christmas Future experience. Like this isn't what the future has to be. But if you don't change your ways, this is the future.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\n3 Democratic Senate races now considered toss-ups\n\nA political odds-maker at the University of Virginia changed its ratings Wednesday in four competitive Democratic U.S. Senate races, after Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor’s race.\n\nSabato’s Crystal Ball, which is named for Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said the election confirmed a poor environment for Democrats, which if replicated in 2022 could help Republicans could win control of the House and Senate.\n\nThe ratings changed in three races from “leans Democratic” to a toss-up, for Sens. Mark Kelly in Arizona, Raphael Warnock in Georgia and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. The rating for Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., changed from “safe Democratic” to “likely Democratic.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMcAuliffe concedes to Youngkin in Virginia governor's race\n\nVirginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe conceded his run for governor after a bruising campaign against Republican Glenn Youngkin. The race was widely watched as a bellwether for the national mood amid the coronavirus pandemic and first year of Democrats' unified control of Washington.\n\n“Congratulations to Governor-Elect Glenn Youngkin on his victory. I hope Virginians will join me in wishing the best to him and his family,” McAuliffe said in a Wednesday morning statement.\n\nWhile he acknowledged the campaign “came up short” in the race, McAuliffe reiterated the need to make progress on progressive priorities like health care, voting rights and family policy.\n\nMcAuliffe served as Virginia’s governor after a 2013 victory that presaged Democrats’ later victories in the state legislature in 2018. Youngkin’s victory, as well as a narrow Republican recapture of the state House, came as a shock to Democrats in Virginia and nationally.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nVirginia fallout:Red alert: Crushing defeat in Virginia could signal more bad news for Democrats ahead\n\nGOP says it will target 13 more House Dems in 2022\n\nThe Republican campaign committee for the House announced Wednesday it would add 13 Democrats to the list targeted for defeat in the 2022 election, after Glenn Youngkin’s victory in the Virginia governor’s race.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee had 57 Democratic lawmakers in its sights and added 13 names.\n\n“In a cycle like this, no Democrat is safe,” said Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who is chairman of the campaign committee. “Voters are rejecting Democrat policies that have caused massive price increases, opened our borders and spurred a nationwide crime wave.”\n\nThe Democrats added to the target list are: Reps. Greg Stanton in Arizona, Ed Perlmutter in Colorado, Joe Courtney in Connecticut, Darren Soto in Florida, Sanford Bishop in Georgia, Frank Mrvan in Indiana, David Trone in Maryland, G.K. Butterfield in North Carolina, Annie Kuster in New Hampshire, Teresa Leger-Fernandez in New Mexico, Madeleine Dean in Pennsylvania, Jim Cooper in Tennessee and Jennifer Wexton in Virginia.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMcCarthy: 'America wants new leadership'\n\nNational Republican leaders are wasting no time promoting Glenn Youngkin’s victory in Virginia, calling it a sign that they will triumph in next year’s congressional elections.\n\nIn a memo to colleagues, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy said that “Washington Democrats have ignored their constituents, and they have been punished by the voters they serve.”\n\n“Americans want new leadership,” added McCarthy, who would presumably become Speaker of the House if the Republicans win a majority in next November’s election.\n\nNot so fast, some Democrats said. While reversals in Virginia and elsewhere were disappointing, Democrats and their allies said they still plan to retain the House and Senate - though Tuesday’s election did yield warning signs.\n\nRepublican scare tactics only work “if Democrats in Washington aren’t offering a bold vision for the future and delivering on that promise,” said Ben Jealous, president of People For the American Way. “They have to start delivering, because the midterm election season is now here.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGet politics in your inbox:Subscribe here to our OnPolitics newsletter\n\nMaine voters agree: Food is a basic right\n\nThe right to food won rave reviews Tuesday from Maine voters, who passed the nation's first guarantee for people to grow, harvest and eat according to their own wishes.\n\nThe Maine ballot measure was one of several in states seeking to create new constitutional rights touching on an array of issues. Some were a response to policies put in place during the coronavirus pandemic, including a pair of Texas proposals limiting restrictions on religious gatherings and nursing home visits.\n\nMaine's unique measure declares individuals have an “unalienable right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing.” It passed comfortably.\n\n“It’s always a good idea to secure and protect an individual right in the world we live in. Food is life,” said Democratic state Sen. Craig Hickman, a supporter of the proposal. “I don’t understand why anyone would be afraid of saying so out loud in the constitution.”\n\nOpponents had worried the measure might lead some people to try to raise cattle in cities.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nOpinion:Virginia governor: Youngkin win shows voters will reward Trump's dangerous Republican Party\n\nDems trailing in Virginia's lieutenant governor, AG races\n\nFALLS CHURCH, Va. – Candidates for Virginia's statewide down-ballot offices were engaged in tight races early Wednesday, with the Democrats slightly trailing their GOP rivals. The races were too early to call.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, voters chose between two women for a post that has been held by men for as long as the state has existed. Democrat Hala Ayala, a delegate from Woodbridge, faced Republican Winsome Sears, who served in the legislature for a single term two decades ago and was attempting a political comeback. Either also would be the first woman of color to be elected to statewide office in Virginia.\n\nThe winner will succeed Democrat Justin Fairfax, who unsuccessfully ran for governor. The marquee election Tuesday was the gubernatorial race, which Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin won, defeating former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.\n\nWhile the AP did not call the down-ballot races, Republicans were claiming victories in both. Sears stood with her family in front of cheering supporters at a victory party in Chantilly, saying, \"What you are looking at is the American Dream.\"\n\nAyala did not concede defeat early Wednesday morning.\n\nFor attorney general, Democrat Mark Herring was seeking a third term against Republican Jason Miyares, a delegate from Virginia Beach. Herring would be the first attorney general to win a third term since World War II.\n\nMiyares, the son of a Cuban immigrant, also declared victory early Wednesday, saying he is now the first Latino to be elected statewide in Virginia. \"I can't wait to go to work with Governor Youngkin and Lieutenant Governor Sears for you,\" he said.\n\nHerring had not conceded defeat early Wednesday morning.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nBuffalo mayor's write-in campaign looks successful\n\nBuffalo Mayor Byron Brown appeared to win a fifth term Tuesday after lodging a robust write-in effort against India Walton, a trained nurse and activist whose socialist beliefs became a central issue in the race.\n\nBrown, a Democrat who first took office in 2006, resorted to a write-in campaign after losing a June primary to Walton, a Democrat making her first run for office.\n\nThe effort, initially thought to be a longshot, appeared to be successful, though it won't be official until the write-in votes are verified and mail-in ballots are counted.\n\nWrite-in candidates received 33,994 votes — about 59% of the total — with 98% of election districts reporting late Tuesday, according to the Erie County Board of Elections.\n\n– Jon Campbell, New York State Team\n\nYoungkin flips Virginia\n\nAn excited Glenn Youngkin claimed the governor's office in Virginia by telling supporters he would pursue a transformation of the state's economy and school system.\n\n\"We can build a new day,\" Youngkin told screaming supporters at a hotel in northern Virginia early Wednesday.\n\nYoungkin, a decided underdog at the start of the campaign, overtook Democrat Terry McAuliffe by stressing education – especially the teaching of race and history – and the economy.\n\n\"Together, we will change the trajectory of this Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in his victory speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMore:Red alert: Crushing defeat in Virginia could signal more bad news for Democrats ahead\n\nAdams wins in NYC, Bragg takes Manhattan DA's race\n\nRetired police officer Eric Adams defeated underdog Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa on Tuesday to become the second Black mayor in the history of New York City.

Supporters said a complete overhaul of policing was necessary to stop police violence. Opponents said the proposal had no concrete plan for how to move forward and warned it would leave some communities already affected by violence more vulnerable as crime is on the rise.\n\nThose opponents welcomed the amendment's defeat but stressed the urgency of transforming policing in the city even without it.\n\n“Tonight Minneapolis voters have made clear that we want a planful approach to transforming policing and public safety in our city that needs to include meaningful consultation with the communities that are most impacted by both violent crime and by over-policing,” said Leili Fatehi, manager of the All of Mpls campaign.\n\nThe ballot proposal had roots in the abolish-the-police movement that erupted after Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer last year.\n\n– Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/03/deity-purgatory-virgin-snake-birth-slug-dough-traps-news-around-states/118529798/", "title": "'Deity' in Purgatory, virgin snake birth: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Jordan-Hare Stadium will officially be at full capacity for Auburn football games in 2021, the university said in a release outlining what game days will look like this year. Face coverings are recommended but not required in open-air spaces, the release said. However, the university requires masks in indoor spaces, so fans using elevators, premium indoor seating or transit buses will need to bring them. While some schools such as LSU are requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test for stadium entry, Auburn is not. Tiger Walk will be back, but the team’s pregame procession into the stadium will be shortened. The traditional pregame war eagle flight is also returning this year. The marching band will be allowed on the field for pregame and halftime festivities after being prohibited from the field last season. The university is encouraging fans to use digital ticketing through mobile devices. Merchandising and concessions inside Jordan-Hare will be cashless and contact-free, but game programs will still sell in and around the stadium for $10 cash.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Plastic is no longer a choice when checking out from stores in Anchorage. A ban on plastic bags is back in force in Alaska’s largest city after a temporary suspension during the pandemic, Alaska’s News Source reports. As of Wednesday, the option when checking out is paper or reusable options. The ban first took effect in 2019, but Assembly member Felix Rivera said it was relaxed during the pandemic in part because the supply chain for paper bags was disrupted. There were also concerns about whether reusable bags could transmit the coronavirus, he said. “I think since last year, we’ve learned a lot about the virus, and now nothing that I am reading leads me to have a lot of concern about reusable bags transmitting the virus,” he told the Anchorage television station.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In a process that some people call a “virgin birth,” a Brazilian rainbow boa was born at the Phoenix Zoo with DNA from only one parent. Its mom, who has been at the zoo for 10 years, has never been paired for mating. Imagine the keepers’ surprise when the baby boa was discovered in the snake’s enclosure Aug. 3. The snake was likely born through parthenogenesis, in which one – or multiple – eggs mature without fertilization. The zoo believes this is the second documented birth of its kind among Brazilian rainbow boas. Mom is currently in the Boa Hut on the Forest of Uco Trail, and the zoo plans to house the baby in a reptile nursery on the Children’s Trail. So-called virgin births, or asexual reproduction, may not be that uncommon among vertebrates. Thelma, a reticulated python at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, gave birth to six baby pythons without a partner in 2014. “Once considered an evolutionary novelty, facultative parthenogenesis has now been documented in an increasing number of vertebrate species, ranging from the hammerhead shark to domestic turkeys, komodo dragons to snakes,” Warren Booth, an associate professor of molecular ecology at the University of Tulsa who studies the phenomenon, said in a statement in 2016.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Several inmates say they weren’t told a medication they were given to treat COVID-19 was actually an anti-parasite drug that federal health officials have warned should not be used for that purpose. Three inmates at the Washington County jail said they didn’t know they were being given ivermectin until its use at the facility was revealed last week. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas said it’s heard similar complaints from inmates. The inmates’ comments contradict assertions by the sheriff and the jail’s physician that use of the drug was voluntary. “They were pretty much testing us in here is all they were doing, seeing if it would work,” said William Evans, who said he was given the drug for two weeks after he tested positive for the virus. The drug’s manufacturer, Merck, said in February that it had found no evidence ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients. Edrick Floreal-Wooten said he was given ivermectin after testing positive Aug. 21. “I asked what are they, and they’d just tell me vitamins,” Floreal-Wooten said. He said he refused to take the drug last week after seeing a news article about ivermectin being prescribed to inmates. “Never. I’m not livestock,” he said. “I’m a human.” The ACLU said it has also heard from inmates who say they were told the drug was vitamins or steroids.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon force large department stores to display some child products in gender-neutral ways after the Legislature passed a bill Wednesday aimed at getting rid of traditional pink and blue marketing schemes for items like toys and toothbrushes. The bill would not outlaw boys and girls sections in department stores but would require retailers to have a gender-neutral section to display “a reasonable selection” of items “regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.” It would only apply to department stores with 500 or more employees, so most small businesses would be exempt. It also wouldn’t apply to clothes, just toys and “childcare items,” which include hygiene and teething products. The state Senate passed the bill Wednesday, sending it back to the Assembly for a procedural vote before it heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. If it becomes law, California would become the first state to require these sections in stores, according to the office of Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, the bill’s author. He said the measure was inspired by a 10-year-old whose mother works in his legislative office. “Britten asked her mom while shopping why certain things in a store were ‘off limits’ to her because she was a girl but would be fine if she was a boy,” Low said. “Thankfully, my colleagues recognized the pure intentions of this bill and the need to let kids be kids.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Three suburban police officers and two paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter that provoked national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. The grand jury indictments announced Wednesday by state Attorney General Phil Weiser are the latest chapter for the police department in the city of Aurora, which has been plagued by allegations of misconduct against people of color, including a officer charged this summer with pistol-whipping a Black man. McClain’s death helped inspire a sweeping police accountability law in Colorado, a ban on chokeholds and restrictions on the use of the sedative ketamine, both of which the indictment alleges contributed to his death. The charges were announced days after the second anniversary of when police stopped McClain on the street after a 911 caller reported a man who seemed “sketchy.” “What I set out to do is still not over, but I’m halfway there. I’m halfway there,” McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, said of her efforts to hold police accountable. Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who took over last year and has pledged to work to restore public trust, said the department will continue to cooperate with the judicial process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nFarmington: A small jet crashed shortly after taking off from a small airport Thursday morning, killing all four people aboard, officials said. The jet took off just before 10 a.m. from the Robertson Airport before crashing into the building at Trumpf Inc., a manufacturing company, Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie said. “It appears there was some type of mechanical failure during the takeoff sequence that resulted in the crash behind us,” he said. The plane, a Cessna Citation 560X, was headed to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo, North Carolina, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Two pilots and two passengers aboard the plane were killed, McKenzie said. The crash set off chemical fires inside the Trumpf building, Gov. Ned Lamont said. Everybody who was inside the building has been accounted for, and there were no serious injuries, McKenzie said. Lamont said authorities were in the process of identifying those who died on the plane. He said there was nothing left of it when first responders arrived. “It was just a ball of fire, an explosion, and then the chemical fires afterwards,” he said. “I think they are still trying to identify who was there, identify the next of kin before we can say anything else. I just know it was incredible. The thing was filled with jet fuel.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida overnight, officials said the city was seeing historic flooding Thursday. The Wilmington Fire Department and other agencies were performing water rescues, and many streets and bridges remained closed, officials said. Flooding affected several neighborhoods, and a Wilmington Fire Department spokesperson said crews had rescued 60 to 80 people by noon. Delaware Department of Transportation Community Relations Director CR McLeod said the flooding was affecting homes and businesses, and there were many vehicles underwater, WDEL-FM reports. More than 50 bridges would need to be surveyed and assessed, he said. “A lot of this water is coming down from Pennsylvania with the excessive amounts of rain that they had associated with the storm yesterday,” McLeod said. “All that water is going to make its way down toward the Delaware River, and it’s all coming down the Brandywine.” The Brandywine entered a major flood stage Wednesday night, and by Thursday morning it reached a maximum crest of 23.1 feet, a new record, according to the National Weather Service. Waters began to recede, and the creek was expected to fall below flood stage early Friday, according to the agency.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital ranks last in the country for teacher pay compared to other jobs, WUSA-TV reports, citing a study from business.org. The July study compared the average salary of primary and secondary school teachers to the average salary for all jobs within each state and the district. The data was collected using the National Center for Education Statistics and compared with the salaries of all occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The results found that D.C. and Virginia rank last in the country, with educators earning 17% and 10% less than the average wage, respectively. Virginia and D.C. are among seven states that the study claims pay teachers below the state’s average salary. The study reports that Mississippi has the lowest salary for teachers at just more than $45,000 per year, but that is still 8.6% higher than the average salary in the state. Pennsylvania ranked highest in the country, according to the study, with teachers earning 30% more than the average wage.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: An elementary school was placed in a temporary, limited lockdown after a parent threatened to leave his job and confront an assistant principal for telling his children they couldn’t come to school without being masked. Christopher Kivlin was met by police officers Tuesday outside Ashton Elementary School in Sarasota. No charges were filed, but he was ordered not to come back to the school without calling first and getting permission. An incident report said Kivlin showed up to campus saying the school was violating the law by not allowing his children to attend school. The Sarasota County school district is among a dozen of Florida’s 67 districts, representing about half of the state’s 2.8 million public school students, that have defied Gov. Rob DeSantis’ executive order barring schools from requiring masks over parent objections. A judge last week ruled that DeSantis did not have the authority to issue the order. The DeSantis administration is expected to appeal the decision. Kivlin told television station WFLA he had no intention of hurting anyone but just wanted to talk to a school official. He apologized for scaring anyone and said that “it was just emotions built up.” “I found out after the fact that the school had to go into lockdown, I was like, ‘That’s horrible,’ ” Kivlin said. “I feel like I might have scared other parents.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge’s decision striking down a Trump-era rule that eliminated federal protections for some wetlands and streams is giving hope to opponents of a proposed mine outside the Okefenokee Swamp’s vast wildlife refuge in southeast Georgia. A federal judge in Arizona on Monday tossed the rule that narrowed the types of U.S. waters that qualify for federal protection from pollution under the Clean Water Act. The judge’s order, which applies nationwide, says the rule enacted under former President Donald Trump improperly limited the scope of clean water protections. One high-profile project directly affected by the environmental rollbacks under Trump was a proposal by Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals to mine titanium dioxide on land about 3 miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge near the Georgia-Florida line. Conservationists fear mining close to the swamp’s edge could cause irreparable harm to the largest federal wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. Yet the Army Corps of Engineers declared last year that the project no longer required a federal permit because the rollbacks under Trump excluded wetlands on the site from federal protection. That left sole authority to Georgia state regulators to decide whether it could move forward.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Tourism officials have released a plan to reduce visitors on Oahu, the state’s most frequently visited and populous island. The plan was approved by the Hawaii Tourism Authority in July, and the full plan has now been released to the public, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Decreasing the total number of visitors to Oahu to a manageable level by controlling the number of visitor accommodations and exploring changes to land use, zoning and airport policies,” the plan says. It also establishes a regenerative tourism fee, creates reservation systems for natural and cultural sites, manages visitors’ use of cars, and promotes consumption of locally produced and sold goods. “We appreciate the Oahu residents who participated in the (plan) process and passionately contributed their diverse viewpoints, discussed various tourism-related challenges in their neighborhoods and helped set forth an actionable plan that is necessary for the community’s well-being,” said John De Fries, the Hawaii Tourism Authority’s president and CEO. “It’s about continued collaboration and moving forward together to malama (care for) this cherished place and each other, as desired by the people of Oahu.” The three-year plan was developed by community members and county officials in collaboration with the tourism authority.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: At least two state lawmakers received threatening letters concerning their votes on a law intended to drastically reduce wolf numbers. The anonymous letters to Republican Sen. Dan Johnson and Republican Rep. Caroline Troy say that “just as the wolf went from predator to prey, so shall you.” It’s not clear how many more lawmakers received the letters. The Lewiston Tribune reports some of the lawmakers contacted the Idaho State Police. Backers of the wolf law that took effect July 1 said the state can cut the number of wolves to 150 before federal authorities would take over management. That would be a 90% reduction of the state’s 1,500 wolves. The letters describe lawmakers as “nothing more than a sellout to the Cattle Association and that pitiful minority of cattle producers that seemingly dictate how our wildlife lives and dies.” Johnson said the envelope had a Sacramento postmark, and the return address was the Statehouse in Boise. “It’s OK for people to disagree with my votes or my bills, but some comments cross the line,” he said. “I think this letter comes close to the line, if not stepping over it.” The law passed the Senate 26-7 with no support from Democrats. It passed the House 58-11 with one Democrat in support and no Republicans opposed.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Rowers, kayakers and other users of the Chicago River are getting a real-time look at one measure of water quality in the system that weaves through downtown and several neighborhoods. Chicago nonprofit Current installed three sensors in the river’s three main branches in 2019 to continuously estimate the amount of bacteria from human and other warm-blooded animals’ waste. The organization initially planned to begin making the real-time results public in 2020. But the coronavirus pandemic delayed its plans until Thursday, when a website updating with data taken every 15 minutes went online. The city’s development in the 19th century was thanks to the river – truly a system of rivers and manmade canals – that provided a path between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River system. While the meatpacking and lumber industries could use it for shipping, the waterway also became a dumping ground for those and other industries and for sewage from homes and businesses. Quality of the 156-mile river system has improved in recent years, helped by multibillion-dollar construction of new reservoirs and underground tunnels. But when rain overwhelms Chicago’s sewer systems, sewage and stormwater is diverted to the river, prompting warnings to stay off the water for several days.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Schools got an incentive from the governor Wednesday to require face masks in classrooms in hopes of slowing down the number of COVID-19 outbreaks among students. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a new statewide executive order that eases quarantine requirements for students if all children and adults in the school were wearing masks throughout the day. The revised order comes as many Indiana schools have seen COVID-19 outbreaks and as the state’s vaccination rate remains stubbornly low. Holcomb said the coronavirus’ spread in Indiana was regrettable but avoidable. “To the skeptics or unbelievers or deniers, I would just plead to look at the facts, to look at the numerical data that shows we can all stay safe if you get vaccinated,” Holcomb said. Meanwhile, the state’s largest hospital system will be stopping all inpatient nonemergency surgeries as the state faces a growing surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Indiana University Health announced Thursday that the surgery suspension would start Monday. The decision comes after IU Health said last week that it was cutting such surgeries by half. IU Health, which operates 16 hospitals around the state, also said that more than 1,000 employees did not meet Wednesday’s deadline to get COVID-19 vaccinations and would be suspended immediately.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A federal judge on Thursday ordered a prominent participant in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to return to jail after he was caught accessing the internet to watch false conspiracy theories about the presidential election. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said Doug Jensen, 42, of Des Moines, had violated the strict conditions that were set when he was released from jail July 13, including prohibitions on accessing the internet and using a cellphone. Prosecutors had moved to revoke Jensen’s pretrial release Aug. 19, days after a federal officer found Jensen in his garage using an iPhone to watch news from Rumble, a streaming platform popular with conservatives. Jensen acknowledged that he had earlier watched two days of the cyber symposium sponsored by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ally of former President Donald Trump who used the event to push false theories that the 2020 election’s outcome was changed by Chinese hackers. Kelly noted that he had released Jensen from jail in July after Jensen claimed he had an awakening behind bars and realized the QAnon conspiracy theory to which he adhered was a “pack of lies.” The judge said it was significant that Jensen’s violations were caught during the first unannounced visit to his home by pretrial services officers.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: About a third of Kansas nursing homes have less than half of their health care workers vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data released by the state. Just four of the more than 300 federally licensed nursing homes are meeting the state’s goal for 90% of health care workers vaccinated, the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services and Kansas Department of Health and Environment data shows. The departments released the data about a week after President Joe Biden announced that his administration will require nursing home staff to be vaccinated as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. The department for aging and disability services said in a statement last week that it released the data to prepare for those new rules. Gov. Laura Kelly’s office said in a statement, without offering details, that the administration would encourage nursing home workers to get inoculated. As of Wednesday, about 46% of Kansans were fully vaccinated, according to data provided by the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A judge has refused to grant a divorce decree to a couple who swore under oath that their marriage was irreparably broken. The reason, she said: They were too nice to each other in court. In a decision condemned by divorce lawyers, Bullitt Family Court Judge Monica Meredith at least temporarily declined to dissolve Douglas and Nicole Potts’ 13-year marriage, which both insist can’t be salvaged. In an Aug. 23 order continuing the case and suggesting the couple undergo counseling, Meredith observed they were “respectful and courteous toward one another, and both held themselves in dignified and mature composure.” Meredith, who was elected to Family Court in 2018, said that “divorce court does not typically bring that demeanor out in its participants.” But in interviews and emails, a half-dozen family lawyers said Meredith’s order was inappropriate, unlawful and ridiculous. “It sends a terrible message to litigants: You are better served by acting like a petulant child in court than by acting mature,” said Louisville attorney Hal Helmers, who wasn’t involved in the case. Louise Graham, professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky’s Rosenberg College of Law, said counseling may be ordered only if one side disagrees the marriage is over. “Ninety-nine percent of divorce lawyers agree with the above, and we can never agree on ANYTHING,” Helmers said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPort Fourchon: Photos show what appears to be a miles-long oil slick near an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida, according to aerial survey imagery released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and reviewed by the Associated Press. The government imagery, along with additional photos taken by the AP from a helicopter Tuesday, also show Louisiana port facilities, oil refineries and shipyards in the storm’s path where the telltale rainbow sheen typical of oil and fuel spills is visible in the water of bays and bayous. Both state and federal regulators said Wednesday that they had been unable to reach the stricken area, citing challenging conditions in the disaster zone. The NOAA photos show a black slick floating in the Gulf near a large rig with the name Enterprise Offshore Drilling painted on its helipad. Aerial photos taken by NOAA on Tuesday also show significant flooding to the massive Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery along the bank of the Mississippi River, just south of New Orleans. In some sections of the refinery, rainbow sheen is visible on the water leading toward the river. Asked about reports of levee failures near the refinery Monday, Phillips 66 spokesman Bernardo Fallas said there was “some water” in the facility and stressed that operations were shut down before the storm.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Newly unionized nurses at Maine Medical Center are frustrated over the end of pandemic accommodations. The policies had let high-risk employees work outside COVID-19 care, covered COVID-19 treatment costs, provided quarantine pay for coronavirus exposure outside the workplace and allowed pregnant nurses to start paid maternity leave in the last month of their pregnancy. “In the middle of a spike in infections from a fast-moving variant, this is not the time to remove the protections that have helped both staff and patients here for the past several months,” nurse Madison Light said. The surge is causing nurses to scramble to staff the COVID-19 units. They’re not getting enough breaks, they said. “Now it feels like there is no end in sight. Nurses and caregivers are exhausted, frustrated, and stretched to their physical and emotional limits,” Light said. MaineHealth said its policies on COVID-19 exposure and pregnancy leave follow current clinical and OSHA guidelines. Accommodations for high-risk employees are considered on a case-by-case basis, the company said.\n\nMaryland\n\nThurmont: First responders in western Maryland used a boat to rescue 10 children and a driver from a school bus caught in rising floodwaters as the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped heavy rainfall Wednesday afternoon. Frederick County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Todd Wivell said the bus got stuck when it tried to cross a bridge in the Thurmont area that had water going across it, WTOP-FM reports. The driver and 10 children were rescued from the bus by boat, with the help of first responders from the sheriff’s office and the Frederick County Department of Fire and Rescue Services, he said. Even 6 inches of moving water is enough to knock a person off their feet, Wivell said. Frederick County Public Schools recalled all school buses that were in the process of dropping students off. Parents were asked to pick their kids up from school buildings. Frederick County Public Schools’ Superintendent Terry Alban apologized after facing criticism for not dismissing children early, saying the decision to remain open for a full day led to “stress and anxiety for many,” The Frederick News-Post reports. School systems in neighboring counties sent students home early ahead of forecasted inclement weather.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A question that would require voters to present an ID and a second that would grant new benefits for drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft while stopping short of declaring them employees have cleared an initial hurdle on their way to next year’s ballot. Other proposed initiatives that received a constitutional green light from Attorney General Maura Healey’s office Wednesday would legalize the sale of fireworks, create a “whale safe fishing act,” allow for the return of “happy hours,” and create a “Right to Counsel Program” for those facing eviction. The questions were among 16 proposed laws and one proposed constitutional amendment that met the requirements for ballot initiatives outlined in the Massachusetts Constitution, according to Healey’s office. Another 13 proposals were deemed unconstitutional. The state constitution requires proposed initiatives be in the proper form to present to voters, not be substantially the same as any measure on the ballot in either of the two preceding statewide elections, contain only subjects related to each other and not involve topics specifically excluded from the ballot initiative process.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Thousands of Flint residents were put at potential risk because a New York law firm, for six months, used handheld X-ray devices to scan their bones for lead without first registering the devices and putting recommended safety measures in place, documents obtained by the Detroit Free Press show. Starting in about August 2020, the Napoli Shkolnik firm used the portable scanners – which are tools in the mining and scrap metal industries but are not designed for use on humans – as a way of bolstering residents’ claims for larger shares of a proposed $641.25 million settlement of civil lawsuits arising from the 2014 lead poisoning of Flint’s drinking water supply. The law firm’s failure until February 2021 to register the devices with the state of Michigan, as required by law, and the state’s low-key response once it learned the scanners had been used for months without required approvals add insult to the injury that was the Flint drinking water crisis. “Unfortunately, thousands of bone scans using these devices ... went forward under improper and illegal circumstances,” said Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, a Flint pediatrician and former president and CEO of Mott’s Children’s Health Center, who first raised concerns about the scanners in a February court filing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Attorneys for three former police officers charged in George Floyd’s death asked a judge Thursday to bar their upcoming trial from being livestreamed, saying some witnesses won’t testify if the proceedings are broadcast. The request from attorneys for Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao is an about-face from their earlier request to have the trial publicly broadcast, and it is opposed by prosecutors and news outlets. Lane, Kueng and Thao are scheduled to stand trial next March on charges of aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s May 2020 death. Their co-defendant, Derek Chauvin, was convicted in April of murder and manslaughter after weeks of proceedings that marked the first time in Minnesota that a criminal trial was livestreamed in its entirety. Before Chauvin’s trial, attorneys for all four men requested the trials be broadcast, but Lane and Kueng recently backtracked, with their attorneys saying that the “worldwide publicity” from televised coverage of Chauvin’s trail “crushed” their clients’ right to a fair trial. Attorneys Earl Gray and Tom Plunkett say the public access led some witnesses to decline testifying for the defense, noting one witness in the Chauvin trial has been harassed and another faced professional scrutiny.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The U.S. Marshals Service has arrested a man in connection with an assault on an MSNBC reporter during a live broadcast from the state Monday. Benjamin Dagley was taken into custody Thursday afternoon at a shopping center in Dayton, Ohio, according to a report. With the assistance of the public, the Gulfport Police Department identified Dagley, of Wooster, Ohio, as a suspect in an assault on Shaquille Brewster as he covered Hurricane Ida. Dagley allegedly pulled up in white pickup truck and ran toward the camera crew. The suspect could be heard off-camera repeatedly screaming something about reporting the hurricane accurately. Brewster attempted to go on with the live coverage, even shifting his position to move away from the suspect, but when he realized the accused was not backing down, Brewster tossed it back to the studio. As the camera faded, viewers could see Brewster being physically confronted. Gulfport police issued warrants Tuesday charging Dagley with two counts of simple assault, one count of disturbance of the peace and one count of violating emergency curfew. Police also said Dagley is on probation for a previous charge in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state senator from Kansas City said he is demanding answers after an exhibit on the gay rights movement in Missouri was removed from the state Capitol. Democrat Sen. Greg Razer, the only openly gay member of the Missouri Senate, said he was “appalled” when he was told the exhibit, “Making History: Kansas City and the Rise of Gay Rights,” had been removed from the Missouri State Museum. Connie Patterson, spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources, did not immediately reply to questions about why the exhibit was moved and who made the decision. On Tuesday, Uriah Stark, legislative aide for state Rep. Mitch Boggs, R-La Russell, posted pictures of the exhibit on Facebook and questioned why the “taxpayer funded museum is pushing the LGBT agenda in our state capitol?” The next day, Stark thanked “several of our great elected officials” for having the exhibit removed, specifically mentioning Republican Reps. Ann Kelley, of Lamar, and Brian Seitz, of Branson, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “There is NOTHING controversial about an exhibit that explains how members of the LGBT community fought to end persecution and demand rights as citizens,” Razer tweeted Thursday. “I’m extremely disappointed and angry that @mostateparks may think otherwise.”\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park is ending its reservation requirement to travel on the Going-to-the-Sun Road after Labor Day as the busy summer season winds down. The reservation system has been in place for anyone wanting to travel on the scenic highway since May 28. Reservations were required between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. The pilot program testing the reservation system worked to alleviate traffic, but park officials said some people struggled to find available tickets. The park’s shuttle service will also end after Labor Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government is stepping in to help shuffle patients between local hospitals that are dealing with a surge of people with COVID-19 and other health issues, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. The Republican governor said the state has partnered with Nomi Health, the creators of the TestNebraska program, to offer call centers that overcrowded hospitals can contact when they need to transfer patients elsewhere. The around-the-clock call centers will serve as coordinators for in-state hospitals to try to keep them from getting overwhelmed, at a cost of $200,000 a month. The announcement is another sign that the state is once again struggling with coronavirus cases, even though most of the hospitalizations are patients without the coronavirus. State officials opened a similar call center last year but ended the program after the number of cases and hospitalizations declined. The new call center is scheduled to open Saturday. Nebraska’s hospitals reported to the state Wednesday that 72% of their 3,234 beds were occupied, although some facilities were far more crowded and having to send patients to other places. Ricketts relaxed licensing restrictions for nurses last week in an attempt to fix severe staffing shortages.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Inc. said Wednesday that a conference scheduled next month in Las Vegas by a group espousing the fringe conspiracy theory known as QAnon won’t be held at any Caesars property. It wasn’t immediately clear if the “Patriot Double Down” event organized by Patriot Voice would be moved, postponed or canceled. Caesars Entertainment executive Kate Whiteley confirmed a Las Vegas Review-Journal report that the Oct. 23-25 event billed as a “Great Awakening Weekend” won’t be held at the new Caesars Forum convention space near the Las Vegas Strip. With tickets from $650 to $3,000, the conference was billed to feature speakers including former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn and 8kun website owner Jim Watkins. QAnon is a theory featuring the baseless belief that satanic pedophiles, child sex traffickers and cannibals are in collusion with the so-called deep state and will be uncovered at a reckoning followers call a “Great Awakening.” QAnon signs are often seen at rallies for ex-President Donald Trump, and some adherents are facing trial for roles in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. The group also derides the COVID-19 pandemic as a “plandemic,” suggesting the coronavirus was manufactured and its severity exaggerated.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Dartmouth-Hitchcock says it’s experiencing staff shortages during the coronavirus pandemic that range from nursing positions to food service workers. The health care system said Wednesday that it organized a “Managing and Staffing to Capacity” task force to identify solutions to the shortage, especially in the inpatient units and other care areas at its flagship hospital in Lebanon. Dartmouth-Hitchcock also began planning for reallocation of resources and staff. Earlier this year, it increased the starting rate for newly licensed nurses to $30 per hour and made wage adjustments for experienced clinical nurses and nurse supervisors. It plans to provide a 2% wage increase for other staff beginning in October. Joni Menard, task force leader, said that “the overall situation continues to be challenging as clinical demand increases and the supply of traveling staff is depleted across the nation.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Murphy administration officials used an unapproved encryption app at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and deleted correspondence “on at least one occasion,” according to new court records. The alleged use of the encrypted messaging application Telegram by Department of Health officials shows the limits of New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act and the ability to skirt them and other laws and rules, experts said. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy revealed that health officials were communicating on Telegram in the administration’s latest legal filing in the whistleblower lawsuit brought by Christopher Neuwirth, an assistant health commissioner who was fired shortly after first-wave peak of the coronavirus. In a 308-page response countering Neuwirth’s claim that he was improperly fired last May, Murphy’s lawyers said Neuwirth required employees who reported to him “use a non-state-approved messaging application – Telegram – furthering burdening those state employees.” The Open Public Records Act does not specifically address encrypted messages but does include emails and text messages used for official business in its definition of government records. Such records are subject to public access unless they fall under one of more than two dozen exemptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta officials say they’re canceling some parts of the event and will require guests to wear masks to enter the grounds and while in indoor areas and crowded outdoor settings to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said Wednesday he didn’t believe that face mask requirements and other safety practices would affect attendance numbers for the Oct. 2-10 event. “Masks have been a way of life that we’ve all been experiencing for the past year or more, so I think it’s one of those things that people are used to,” he said. The music fiesta is being canceled this year due to close proximity of guests, and the discovery center is being shelved because of its indoor nature featuring activities with multiple touchpoints, officials said. Other steps being taken include providing cashless options to buy tickets, moving hospitality seating outdoors and increasing spacing between popular special-shape balloons inside the park, officials said. The changes track federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and the current public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The Democratic-led Legislature voted Wednesday to extend an eviction and foreclosure moratorium for commercial and residential tenants who fell behind on their rent because of hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, had called the Legislature to return for an “extraordinary session” to pass the legislation, which will put evictions on hold until Jan. 15. New York’s previous eviction moratorium, which included foreclosure protections for property owners, expired Tuesday. In an Aug. 12 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court nixed part of the moratorium that allowed tenants to pause eviction proceedings simply by filing a form declaring they’d had a COVID-19-related financial hardship or that moving in a pandemic would prove a health risk. The court said landlords should have the ability to challenge those hardships in court. New York is poised to change how the moratorium works in light of that ruling. Landlords will be able to challenge hardship declarations and direct judges to require tenants with hardships to apply for rental assistance. Hochul said the legislation will stand up to legal scrutiny. But the leader of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest organization of landlords in New York, vowed Wednesday to sue to block the moratorium in federal court.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The majority of public school students taking standardized state exams in reading, math and science last school year failed them, data shows. State education leaders cautioned against making year-over-year comparisons with the tests taken during a school year marked by limited in-person instruction because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 45.4% of K-12 students passed the exams for the 2020-21 school year, according to results released at a State Board of Education meeting Wednesday. Two years ago – the last time testing was required – nearly 59% of K-12 students passed state exams. The U.S. Education Department did not require states to test students in the 2019-20 school year but required it this past year to assess pandemic learning loss. Because of coronavirus safety concerns, some high school students this past year took exams months after completing the course on which they were being tested. Some tests were revised, and a lower-than-normal share of students took them, news outlets report. “While the 2018-19 data is included as a way to provide context, comparison of the two years should only be made with a recognition that multiple anomalies occurred during the 2020-21 school year and during test administration,” state board member Jill Camnitz said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A lawmaker who heads the state’s anti-abortion legislative caucus said Thursday that it’s likely the Republican-led Legislature will seek to pass a measure mirroring a new Texas law that virtually bans all abortions and that the Supreme Court has allowed to remain in force. GOP Sen. Janne Myrdal, one of the Legislature’s most ardent anti-abortion lawmakers, said she “assumes” legislation will be crafted eventually that uses the Texas law as a template. “I hear people talking about it,” Myrdal said. About a third of the Legislature’s 141 members are active in the caucus, which already has successfully pushed some of the nation’s toughest abortion laws. If it is drafted, it’s unclear when it would be introduced, though it could happen when the Legislature meets later this year in a reconvened or special session meant to deal with legislative redistricting. North Dakota is one of several states that have so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Myrdal said the high court’s action – or lack thereof – offers “a glimmer of hope” the court might eventually overturn Roe v. Wade because of its shift to the right following the appointment of three conservative justices by former President Donald Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s elections chief this week launched an effort to purge inactive voters from state rolls, while using the announcement to push for passage of a bill making several changes to Ohio’s election process. The four-year process for purging inactive voters targets those who have not voted for two years and whose addresses may have changed and whose voter registration must be updated to reflect the move, according to Wednesday’s directive by GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose to Ohio’s 88 county elections boards. Inactive voters can keep themselves on the rolls by voting in any election in the next four years, submitting an absentee ballot application, registering to vote or taking other election-related steps. Earlier this year, LaRose said 97,795 inactive voter files were removed in scheduled post-2020 election voter roll maintenance, a lower number than predicted after thousands of voters avoided the purge by voting and undertaking other election activities. In his announcement Wednesday, LaRose also urged for the passage of a Republican voting bill introduced this spring that prohibits the placement of ballot drop boxes anywhere but at local elections offices, eliminates a day of early voting, shortens the window for requesting mail-in ballots and tightens voter ID requirements.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge on Wednesday said she will temporarily block a state law banning public school mask mandates, but students or their parents can opt out of the requirement if they choose. Judge Natalie Mai said she will issue a temporary injunction that will go into effect next week when she issues a written order detailing her ruling. Mai said she is blocking the law because it applies only to public, not private, schools, and schools adopting a mask mandate must provide an option for parents or students to opt out of the requirement. The ruling drew praise from Gov. Kevin Stitt, who signed the law and opposes mask mandates without exemptions, and Dr. Mary Clarke, president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, which joined the lawsuit brought by four parents who oppose the law. “This is a victory for parental choice, personal responsibility and the rule of law,” Stitt said in a statement. Clarke said she was also pleased with the ruling. “This is just a first step in ensuring our schools maintain local control and can choose the best path for their students, faculty and staff,” Clarke said in a statement.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Slugs and snails love bread dough, finds recent research from the Oregon State University Extension Service and other universities, suggesting a cheap, easy-to-make, nontoxic and widely available solution for gardeners and farmers alike. The state’s grass seed industry loses roughly $100 million a year to the slimy pests, according to the Oregon Seed Council. “Slugs and snails have a big impact on seed crops,” said Roger Beyer, the council’s executive director. “Our guys will work with anything, be it biological, pesticides or chemicals – whatever it takes to protect their crops, but it has to be economical.” The Oregon Seed Council provides $60,000 to $70,000 a year to fund slug and snail research at OSU, including for the work of gastropod specialist Rory McDonnell, who participated in the multi-university study that discovered bread dough attracts the pests. McDonnell and his fellow researchers ran simple experiments comparing how slugs and snails are attracted to different foods, essentially pitting foods in head-to-head contests until one was determined the most attractive. Cucumber was an early front-runner, and beer and strawberries did well, but bread dough was what really called the mollusks to dinner. McDonnell said it might be deployed in the creation of molluscicides, but dough should work for now.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The centerpiece of Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to fight climate change passed its last regulatory hurdle Wednesday, in a hard-fought bid to make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel state to adopt a carbon pricing policy. The plan to impose a price on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants won a 3-2 party-line vote from the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, a five-member panel of gubernatorial and legislative appointees. The commission voted after almost six hours of testimony and nearly two years of Wolf’s administration working on the regulation and shepherding it through the long regulatory process. The vote allows Pennsylvania, through regulation, to join a multistate consortium, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, that sets a price and declining limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. By joining the consortium, “Pennsylvania is taking a historic, proactive and progressive approach that will have significant positive environmental, public health and economic impacts,” Wolf said in a statement after the vote. Mark Szybist, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it the “most important climate action that Pennsylvania has taken in more than a decade.” At 34%, Pennsylvania’s energy sector is its largest emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: Some residents will be paying more for their health insurance next year, but not as much as insurers wanted them to pay, the state Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner said Thursday. The rate increases for 2022 approved by Commissioner Patrick Tigue were lower than insurers has requested. “As Rhode Islanders confront significant threats to their health and financial well-being due to the spread of COVID-19, my responsibility is to limit the burden of the cost of health insurance within the standards for review and approval set forth by law,” Tigue said in a statement. “Given the strong reserve positions of health insurers operating in the state, I did not believe that charges for profit and contributions to reserves for 2022 were consistent with the proper conduct of the insurers’ business or consistent with the public interest.” Rhode Islanders will save almost $42 million in 2022 compared to what the commercial health insurers requested, his office said. For Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which has 40,255 members in its small group plan and requested an average rate increase of 2.9%, Tigue approved a 0.3% decrease. Gail Carvelli, a spokesperson for BCBSRI, told The Boston Globe the company accepted the modifications and recognized the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Thursday tossed out a school mask mandate in the capital city, saying it contradicts a state budget measure aimed at preventing face covering requirements. State Attorney General Alan Wilson had sued Columbia after the City Council passed the ordinance requiring masks at elementary and middle schools. City leaders said the mask requirement, which carries a $100 violation fine, was meant to protect children too young to be approved for COVID-19 vaccines. But Wilson argued the city’s mask rule conflicts with the budget requirement that went into effect July 1 and bans school districts from using appropriated funds to require face coverings. On Thursday, the state Supreme Court sided unanimously with the attorney general. The Columbia ordinance is written so that the burden of enforcing the mask rule falls on school employees, “all of whom have an obvious connection to state-appropriated funds,” wrote Justice John Kittredge. That means school employees have to choose between violating state or city laws, the opinion said. “The City has made clear that every school employee is in the crosshairs,” Kittredge wrote.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers looking to remake the state’s voter-passed medical marijuana law previewed a coming battle in the Legislature on Wednesday as they recommended outlawing growing the plant in homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. A legislative subcommittee approved a spate of recommended changes to a ballot measure approved by 70% of voters last year. The law is set to take full effect in the coming months as the state government faces deadlines to issue medical marijuana identification cards and provide for the licensure of dispensaries. However, the law will continue to be in flux. Republicans, who dominate the Legislature, are currently debating just how far to go in changing the law. The subcommittee on Wednesday recommended changes that could potentially make it more difficult for people in rural areas to access the drug – most significantly by striking all provisions allowing medical marijuana ID-card holders to grow cannabis plants in their homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. The recommendations will next face approval by the Marijuana Interim Study Committee before they can be passed to the full Legislature.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state Department of Education video celebrating the return to school drew sharp criticism across social media. The 41-second video released Tuesday features Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn, who shares her own memories of excitedly starting school as a kindergartner. “All of our students – 1 million of them – across the state of Tennessee are starting the school year right now,” Schwinn says. “The smell of new books, clean hallways, the energy and feeling of being back in classrooms with their friends and their teachers. It’s such a special time, and I am so excited for our state.” She then asks parents to share stories about why they are excited for the new school year in the comments. The video received swift feedback from parents and teachers experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, quarantines and a growing number of schools already closing as the coronavirus spreads. As of Wednesday, Tennessee was averaging a record-setting 2,330 infections per day among school-age children, ages 5 to 18, according to state data. “How tone deaf do you have to be to ask parents to ‘share their stories’?” commenter Joshua Allen said on Facebook. Several commenters said they sent kids back to school after 18 months of avoiding the virus only to have their children exposed or infected within a few weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The state on Wednesday became the 20th and largest in the nation to allow some form of the unregulated carry of a firearm. Under the new law, most people 21 or older who haven’t been convicted of a felony can carry a holstered handgun – concealed or otherwise – in public without undergoing any training or getting a permit. Supporters of the law, including Gov. Greg Abbott and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature, laud it as a necessary expansion of the so-called constitutional carry movement that will allow people to more easily defend themselves without government interference. But critics, including some law enforcement groups and others, say this further loosening of firearms restrictions in a state that has had more than its share of mass shootings is reckless. Until Wednesday, Texans needed a license to carry a handgun outside their homes and vehicles. To get one, they had to submit fingerprints, go through several hours of training on gun laws and gun safety, and pass a shooting proficiency test. Now, they can still take an online training course that the law requires the state to provide, but it is not necessary. While recent mass shootings have put many on edge, Texas has cultivated a strong culture of gun ownership with echoes of the Wild West, and many residents support the loosened restrictions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A suspect charged with setting fire to three churches in the city and then leading police on a high-speed chase across Washington County that didn’t end until he crashed his minivan inside Zion National Park told police he was a “type of deity” who was acting in “righteous anger.” The man was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility on seven separate charges, including two second-degree felony counts of arson and a third-degree felony count of failing to stop for a police officer, according to a report filed in 5th District Court. Local fire officials and federal agents had been investigating the string of fires as a possible hate crime, as all three happened at houses of worship of The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints. The suspect, a 36-year-old identified as Benjamin Johnson, was being held without bail. The police report suggests investigators worried that he could be a danger to the community and that his mental health was a consideration.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A refugee resettlement organization is offering to accept about 100 Afghan refugees over the next several weeks if its proposal is approved by the U.S. State Department. Amila Merdzanovic of the Vermont chapter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants said that if the request is approved, the state’s well-publicized housing crisis will prompt her organization to look for families to host at least some of the new arrivals. It would not be the first time refugees arriving in Vermont lived with host families. “In the 1970s and 1980s when Laotians and Cambodians were coming into the state, there was no refugee resettlement program, so people were being hosted by Vermonters,” said Merdzanovic, who came to Vermont in 1995 as a refugee from Bosnia and Herzegovina and lived with a host family when she first arrived. “That’s the model we are looking to implement.” She said Thursday that since word of the proposal first became public Wednesday, she has already received dozens of messages of support. Historically, Vermont has not been a location where refugees with the types of visas granted to the Afghans have been resettled. Merdzanovic said last week she was not expecting any Afghans, but she learned Aug. 25 that refugee resettlement agencies had two days to submit proposals.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the state can remove an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a prominent spot in its capital city, saying that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The 7-0 decision cited testimony from historians that the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the Southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. More than a century later, its continued display “communicates principles that many believe to be inconsistent with the values the Commonwealth currently wishes to express,” the justices ruled. The high court’s decision came in two lawsuits filed by residents who attempted to block Gov. Ralph Northam’s order to remove the bronze equestrian sculpture, which shows Lee in military attire atop a massive stone pedestal. Virginia promised to forever maintain the statue in the 1887 and 1890 deeds that transferred its ownership to the state. But the justices said that obligation no longer applies. “Those restrictive covenants are unenforceable as contrary to public policy and for being unreasonable because their effect is to compel government speech, by forcing the Commonwealth to express, in perpetuity, a message with which it now disagrees,” the justices wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, the state’s most populous county is reinstating outdoor mask mandates for large events and strongly encouraging people to wear masks in other outdoor settings when they can’t remain 6 feet apart. In a statement Thursday, Public Health – Seattle & King County said as of Tuesday there will be a requirement for face masks for outdoor events of 500 or more people. The directive applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people over age 5. The recommendation for outdoor masks when people are unable to socially distance from non-household members is also for people 5 and up regardless of vaccination status. “With high rates of disease spread, and our health care system straining to keep up, it is time to take additional steps to keep ourselves and our communities safe,” the health agency said. King County, which includes Seattle, is home to about 2.2 million people. Just last week County Executive Dow Constantine had boasted that King County had one of the highest vaccination rates of any large county in the U.S. As of last week, more than 70% of people 12 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal mine officials have instructed state environmental regulators to propose a change to West Virginia’s mine cleanup program. The federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is giving the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection 60 days to submit an amendment to its reclamation program, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. An Aug. 23 letter from federal officials to state officials said a review found that the program “has not taken sufficient steps” to make sure reclamation obligations are estimated correctly. Such a failure can lead to unfunded environmental liabilities, the letter said. “The WVDEP recognizes the concerns raised in OSMRE’s notice related to reporting and disclosure and those issues will be addressed,” Environmental Protection Department Secretary Harold Ward said in a statement Wednesday, without specifying what kind of amendment the agency plans to submit. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s review of the state’s reclamation program follows lawsuits filed by environmentalist groups.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Calling the situation horrific and inexcusable, city, county and state leaders said this week that they are committed to doing what it takes to improve conditions that leave Black renters in Milwaukee far more vulnerable to electrical fires than anybody else in the city. “These people paid for a place that ultimately took their lives,” said State Sen. LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, who represents part of the city most affected by suspected electrical fires. “That’s inexcusable. ... I have no choice but to find a way to get this addressed. I honestly didn’t know that people were literally losing their lives and everything they own like this.” Johnson said she plans to reach out to Gov. Tony Evers’ office and work with colleagues in the Legislature to consider changes that could help tackle the problem. The reaction follows a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that uncovered how suspected electrical fires disproportionately harm Black renters in the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods and how systems at all levels of government fail to address the underlying issues. “It’s gut-wrenching,” Evers said. “It’s very disheartening.” Evers said he already has spoken to staff members about potential ways to address the problem, which he blamed largely on legislative changes in the last decade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city expects to face labor shortages across all industries as school-related coronavirus cases spike, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.

Parking tag sales, at a modest fee, would provide critically needed support to protect and enhance the visitor experience not just for tomorrow but for generations to come. We appreciate the public's input throughout this process.\"\n\nThe proposal includes $5 for daily parking, $15 for up to seven days and $40 for an annual tag. The rates were determined by comparing similar access on private and public lands, the statement said. The average parking rate in nearby towns where parking fees are charged is $15 per day and $68 per month. In national parks where visitors are charged for parking, the average rate is $9 per day and $50 per year.\n\nVisitors would be required to display a tag on vehicles parked in designated spots within park boundaries. The tag would not guarantee a parking spot at a specific location. Parking would continue to be available on a first-come, first-served basis. In addition, roadside parking would be eliminated to help protect resources, assist traffic flow through congested areas and improve motorist and pedestrian safety.\n\nNoting that it does not charge an entrance fee, the park said parking tags would not be required for motorists who are on scenic drives through the park or use park roads as a commuter route. Pedestrians and cyclists would not be required to purchase parking tags.\n\nBackcountry camping fees would double to $8 per night under the proposal, with a maximum of $40 per camper. The park said such fees have not increased in 10 years while site use has risen to more than 100,000 camper nights per year.\n\nFrontcountry camping fees would be standardized across the park. Nightly family campsite fees would be $30 for primitive sites and $36 for sites with electrical hookups.

The backlog includes repairing and rebuilding roads in the nearly 90-year-old park, rehabilitating buildings and upgrading wastewater facilities, and replacing vital communications equipment including emergency radios.\n\nThis year the park raised its front-country campground fees for the first time in more than a decade. The park retains 100 percent of the camping and pavilion fees to operate these facilities, provide visitor services and fund projects such as replacing picnic tables and grills, Soehn said.\n\nNo other fees are planned.\n\nThe land comprising Great Smoky Mountains National Park was once privately owned. Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as local communities, paid to construct Newfound Gap Road/U.S. 441. When the state of Tennessee transferred ownership of Newfound Gap Road to the federal government, it stipulated that \"no toll or license fee shall ever be imposed…\" to travel the road.\n\n\n\nAction by the Tennessee legislature would be required to lift this deed restriction if the Smokies ever planned to charge an entrance fee.\n\nRELATED: Great Smoky Mountain National Park camping fees to increase\n\nRELATED: Smokies needs help to replace aged-out emergency response radios\n\nRELATED: Blue Ridge Parkway views get major restoration with 'Renew the Views' project\n\nMaintenance backlogs on the parkway, which runs 469 miles from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia to the Smokies’ entrance in Cherokee, total $462 million, said spokeswoman Leesa Brandon.\n\n“We are not considering implementing fees at the parkway,” Brandon said. “However, 20 percent of the entrance fee revenue from other parks supports enhancing visitor services and deferred maintenance at parks that do not collect fees.”\n\nThere are no plans to charge an entrance fee in any current planning documents or projects at Carl Sandburg either, said Sarah Perschall, chief of visitor services.\n\nAll three WNC national parks rely heavily on nonprofit partners for funding.\n\nEntrance fees collected by the National Park Service totaled $199 million in fiscal year 2016. The new fee structure is expected to increase annual entrance fee revenue by about $60 million. But Hunter calls that \"a drop in the bucket\" when trying to chip away at the maintenance backlog.\n\n\"The fees will be helpful with maintenance other needs important to visitors, but given the scope of the problem, the (Trump) administration needs to work with Congress and provide dedicated funding to clear up the maintenance backlog.

Colorful umbrellas flapped in the ocean breeze.\n\nThe Department of Environmental Protection urges park-goers to arrive early to be sure of a spot in parks like Island Beach that frequently reach capacity — as passes don’t guarantee entry.\n\nLinda Jakuboski, of Pine Beach, said she’s been coming to Island Beach for 35 years and noticed it seemed busier than usual for a weekday. She didn’t get the vaccine pass incentive, but did get the shot. If the spike in annual passes leads to crowding, she’s prepared to get there early and frequent one of the less crowded sections of the beach.\n\n“I’m just so used to being here. This is home,” she said. “This is like a second home, really.”\n\nBob Smith, a retiree from nearby Manchester, said he’s a newcomer to Island Beach but was impressed enough to buy an annual pass. He didn’t get the incentive but did get vaccinated, he said.\n\nIf things get crowded, he’ll just enjoy the pool at the 55-plus community where he lives, he said. But the crowds weren’t a big concern now that more people are vaccinated.\n\n“It’s nice to see people’s faces,” he said.\n\nRoughly 70% of adults are vaccinated in the state. Most of the COVID-19 restrictions like face masks have ended.\n\nAfaf Muhammad, of Jersey City, has been camping for years and got her two daughters involved with Team Wilderness, a Jersey City-based nonprofit aimed at getting Black and other kids of color outdoors.\n\nShe opted not to get the vaccine, but praised the idea of getting more people, especially people of color, outdoors. The Outdoors Foundation study found that three-quarters of people doing outdoor activities are white.\n\n“I think that’s so important for children to be in fresh air. We live in public housing. You don’t really see too many trees and grass here,” she said. “You’re not going to see too much real nature. (City) parks aren’t really nature reserves like a state park would be.”\n\nHer daughter Aracelis Hannah is 18, and started Team Wilderness trips five years ago. She, too, opted not to get the vaccine, but said people should take advantage of state parks.\n\n“You don’t know what the wilderness could do to you, to change you … to make you more observant of your surroundings,” she said.\n\nMore:5 national parks you'll feel like you have all to yourself\n\nMore:Headed to Delaware beaches this weekend? What you need to know about parking, dining and more\n\nJuan Melli, an avid hiker and senior vice president at the public affairs firm Mercury, said he got the vaccine pass, but would have gotten the vaccine even without the incentive. He’s noticed more people on hiking trails around the state since the program started.\n\n“Exposing people to outdoors — I think COVID did that anyway: Your weekend plans are canceled. There’s no where to shop so what can you do? You can go outside,” he said. “So if it raises awareness that’s great.\n\n“I just hope this gets people thinking more about the outdoors.”\n\nAsked whether the state’s parks could handle the jump in annual pass holders, DEP spokesperson Caryn Shinske said in an emailed statement that the parks see millions of visitors a year.\n\nAttendance in 2020 was about 14 million, down from 17 million, though parks were closed for about a month starting in April and admittance was limited because of COVID-19.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/12/11/white-sands-national-monument-raise-entrance-fees-2019/2276434002/", "title": "White Sands National Monument to raise fees", "text": "Daily News Reports\n\nALAMOGORDO — National parks have experienced record-breaking visitation, with more than 1.5 billion visitors in the last five years, according to a White Sands National Monument news release.\n\nThroughout the country, the combination of aging infrastructure and increased visitation has put a strain on park roads, bridges, campgrounds, waterlines, restrooms and other visitor services and led to an $11.6 billion deferred maintenance backlog nationwide.\n\nAccording to the release, revenue from entrance fees remains in the National Park Service and helps ensure a quality experience for all who visit.\n\nIn White Sands National Monument, 80 percent of entrance fees stay in the park and are devoted to spending that supports the visitor, the release states.\n\nEntrance fees will increase starting January 2019\n\nIn April, the National Park Service announced service-wide fee increases for all entrance-fee charging parks. Therefore, White Sands will modify its entrance fees to provide additional funding for infrastructure and maintenance needs to enhance the visitor experience.\n\nEffective Jan. 1, 2019, the entrance fees to the park will be $20 per vehicle, $10 per person and $15 per motorcycle.\n\nFor instance, a car with three passengers would pay the $20 per vehicle fee and not $30 for the three individual passengers.\n\nThere are also five fee-free days each year.\n\nIn 2019, the fee-free days are Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21; the first day National Park Week, April 20; National Park Service Anniversary Day, Aug. 25; National Public Lands Day, Sept. 28; and Veterans Day, Nov. 11.\n\nAccording to the release, all of the money received from entrance fees remains with the National Park Service with 80 percent of the revenue staying at White Sands.\n\nThe revenue from entrance fees at White Sands has enabled rehabilitation of the monument’s 1930s era sewage system and replacement of all cedar rail fences. Currently, needed repairs to the park’s accessible Interdune Boardwalk trail and restoration of the porch poles of the historic Spanish pueblo-adobe visitor center are in progress, the release states.\n\nEntrance fees collected by White Sands for the last 10 years have totaled $4.6 million and have been used to add new vault restrooms and picnic shelters in the dunes area, install new museum exhibits in 2010, add new interpretive signage to road pull-offs and hiking trails, and develop education curriculum for K-12 students, the release states.\n\nWhite Sands has charged an entrance fee since 1937 and the current rate of $5 per person has been in effect since 2016.\n\nThe park is one of 117 National Park Service sites that charge an entrance fee; the other 301 national parks remain free to enter.\n\nThe National Park Service has a standardized entrance fee structure, composed of four groups based on park size and type. Some parks not yet aligned with the other parks in their category will raise their fees incrementally and fully incorporate the new entrance fee schedule by Jan. 1, 2020, according to the release.\n\n\n\nThe National Park Service cares for special places saved by the American people so that all may experience our heritage.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2019, the complete fee schedule at White Sands will change according to the following: $20 per vehicle, $10 per person, $15 per motorcycle and $40 for Park Specific Annual Pass. These rates will go up by $5 in 2020.\n\nThe price of annual America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Annual Pass and Lifetime Senior Pass will remain $80. The Access Pass remains free.

The agency received more than 109,000 comments on the plan, most of them opposed.\n\nMost of the rate hikes take effect June 1, the National Park Service said. The $35 fee applies mostly in the West and will affect such popular parks as Yellowstone, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Mount Rainier, Rocky Mountain and Grand Teton parks, among others.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the fee hikes were needed to help maintain the parks and begin to address an $11.6 billion maintenance backlog.\n\n“Every dollar spent to rebuild our parks will help bolster the gateway communities that rely on park visitation for economic vitality,” Zinke said.\n\nZinke thanked those who made their voices heard through the public comment process: “Your input has helped us develop a balanced plan that focuses on modest increases,” he said.\n\nThe maintenance backlog “isn’t going to be solved overnight and will require a multi-tiered approach as we work to provide badly needed revenue to repair infrastructure,” Zinke added.\n\nTheresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Park Conservation Association, hailed the new fee structure.\n\n“The public spoke, and the administration listened,” she said, noting that the plan to nearly triple fees at popular parks was opposed by a range of businesses, gateway communities, governors, tourism groups, conservation organizations and the public.\n\nThe revised fee plan is “a big win for park lovers everywhere,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.\n\n“This is a prime example that activism works,” Grijalva added. “The American people raised their concerns, participated in the public comment period and made sure that the Trump White House knew the proposal was unpopular.”\n\nWashington Sen. Maria Cantwell, top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she was glad Zinke “abandoned his reckless plan to almost triple park fees on American families,” but said the new plan lacks transparency or a full analysis of the impact fee hikes will have on park visitation and local economies.\n\nShe opposes “any action that creates barriers to accessing public lands,” Cantwell said.\n\nThe fee schedule announced Thursday sets a $5 increase for all parks that charge entrance fees. Parks that previously charged $15 will now charge $20; a $20 fee will rise to $25; and a $25 fee will now be $30.\n\nThe current $30 fee is the highest charged by the park service and applies to the 17 most-visited parks.

Odenkirk originated the sleazy lawyer on Breaking Bad in 2009, in what he was told was going to be a brief, three-episode arc, but Goodman proved to be such a popular character that he remained on the series for the rest of its run. Almost immediately following Breaking Bad, Saul became the titular character in the AMC spinoff prequel Better Call Saul. If you’ve been following the show, you’re in luck: Better Call Saul season six premieres today, April 18—and we’ve got the details on how to stream it.\n\nThere’s a lot more where this came from. Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get all our reviews, expert advice, deals and more.\n\nProduction this season has been fraught with off-screen drama, including delays due to COVID-19 and a brief production hiatus after Odenkirk suffered a heart attack last July, but Odenkirk has recovered and the show’s final season (which will reportedly feature Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul playing their Breaking Bad characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, though additional details on the season are scarce) has wrapped production. The show will be available to watch on cable on AMC, but cord-cutters don’t have to worry: There are ways to stream the final season of Better Call Saul.\n\n► Spring Deals: The best spring deals you can shop today\n\nWhere Can You Stream Better Call Saul?\n\nBetter Call Saul is also available to stream on AMC+, the streaming service that offers hundreds of episodes of acclaimed series featured on AMC, from the sly ‘60s drama Mad Men to the intense action of The Walking Dead. There are also titles exclusive to AMC+, from the period drama of The North Water to the animated mystery of Ultra City Smiths. All of that content is topped off with series produced by BBC America, Shudder and IFC Films Unlimited. Plans for AMC+ are available for $6.99 a month with a free 7-day trial period for first-time subscribers, and no cable subscription is necessary to subscribe.\n\nSeason six of Better Call Saul will also be available on Sling TV, the first app-based TV service that allows you to stream live television and on-demand content on the internet.

The second half of season six, consisting of six episodes, premieres on Monday, July 11. Over the last five seasons, we’ve seen the progression of Odenkirk’s character, who starts as a criminal defense lawyer named Jimmy McGill, as he slowly becomes more involved with the criminal world and as he grows into the role of a savvy con-man and assumes the name Saul Goodman (a play on the phrase “It’s all good, man”). In this final season, show creator Vinge Gilligan has confirmed that we will see Saul as he meets Breaking Bad’s Walter White and Jesse Pinkman (Cranston and Paul), narrowing the time-gap between the two shows.\n\nHow To Sign Up For AMC+ and Sling\n\nAMC+ is available as a standalone subscription through the channel’s website, or through your cable provider, starting at $6.99 a month.\n\nVerizon is also offering 12 months of AMC+ access for free to new and existing customers who purchase one of their 5G smartphones with a device payment plan on a Play More, Do More, or Get More Unlimited plan.

But not every TV show is right for every viewer in this tumultuous era (now is probably not a good time to watch HBO's \"The Leftovers,\" wonderful as it may be).\n\nHere are 100 TV shows worth watching while practicing social distancing, whether you want to laugh, bond with your kids or finally discover what's behind the hype about all those \"must watch\" shows your friends are obsessed with.\n\nWhen you need something, unabashedly, positively joyful\n\n1. \"The Carol Burnett Show\" (Amazon) There are a multitude of series from the mid-20th century available to stream, when TV was a positive affair across the board. We're partial to the timeless sketch comedy of Burnett, an American treasure.\n\n2. \"Fixer Upper\" (Hulu) Chip and Joanna Gaines, their sweet kiddos, many adorable pets and can-do attitude may just give you the confidence you need to get through a tough time.\n\n3. \"Gilmore Girls\" (Netflix) Although the Gilmore family has plenty of trials and tribulations, the world of quaint small-town Stars Hollow is usually upbeat in this beloved dramedy.\n\n4. \"The Great British Baking Show\" (Netflix) Warm, friendly and with a focus on decent people doing their best (and doing their best to help each other), this British import is one of the happiest TV series ever made.\n\n5. \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\" (Disney+) A farcical mockumentary about a high school putting on a production of \"High School Musical,\" the stakes are low in this Disney+ series, though they seem very high (teenagers and their hormones, of course).\n\n6. \"Making It\" (Hulu) The closest thing the USA has to \"Baking Show,\" the series manages to find sweetness in its crafting, plus a whole lot of overalls for Amy Poehler to wear.\n\n7. \"Parks and Recreation\" (Netflix, Hulu or Amazon) Nothing can stop Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), not even a pandemic. NBC's workplace sitcom is an inspiring stalwart in this genre, full of generally good people trying to do good things.\n\n8. \"Puppy Prep\" (Hulu) A short-form documentary series about service dogs in training, \"Puppy Prep\" is like injecting furry joy right into your veins.\n\n9. \"Queer Eye\" (Netflix) Inspiration, triumph, overcoming obstacles; all those heartwarming attributes are here when the Fab Five swoop into someone's life to offer as much help as they can in a week.\n\n10. \"Schitt's Creek\" (Netflix) Full of beautiful romance, sunny settings and plenty of humor, Pop TV's sitcom about a rich family that loses it all but gains a little perspective is always a mood booster. (New episodes on Pop Tuesdays, 9 EDT/PDT; series finale airs April.)\n\nWhen you want to travel to a new world\n\n11. “Battlestar Galactica” (Syfy) A bold, breathtaking space opera that is one of the best shows made in response to 9/11; you won't be able to stop hitting \"next episode.\"\n\n12. “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” (Hulu) The story of a 16-year-old charged with protecting the world from supernatural evil is a genuine classic, and most fantasy TV series still sit in its large, fanged shadow, more than 20 years after its debut.\n\n13. “Charmed” (Netflix) The late '90s/early 2000s fashions alone makes \"Charmed\" a nostalgia trip, but the sweet family stories and (slightly silly) demons also help.\n\n14. “A Discovery of Witches” (Sundance Now) A quick, immensely satisfying binge-watch for fans of \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"Outlander,\" the series, based on the \"All Souls\" book trilogy, nails a fantasy romance.\n\n15. “Doctor Who” (BBC America and BritBox) With more than 50 years of time-and-space traveling episodes, there is no limit to where (or when) the Doctor (currently embodied by Jodi Whittaker) can take you in this British institution.\n\n16. “The Expanse” (Amazon) Set in a slightly nearer future than many sci-fi epics, \"Expanse\" marries politics and space battles in the story of a future when we populate the solar system but remain culturally divided.\n\n17. “The Magicians” (Netflix and Syfy) Something of an R-rated hybrid of \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" the superb fantasy series follows a group of adult magicians who discover a fictional world from popular children's books is real – and dangerous.\n\n18. “The Mandalorian” (Disney+) The first live-action \"Star Wars\" TV series lived up to the storied franchise, and not just because of Baby Yoda.\n\nMore:You can get a huge deal if you sign up for this Disney+ bundle\n\n19. “Outlander” (Starz, Netflix) The sweeping, time-traveling romance verges on the melodramatic with its century-hopping plot, but it barely matters as the central love story never loses its chemistry or verve.\n\n20. “Star Trek: The Next Generation” (or any \"Trek\") (CBS All Access, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu) A winning combination of great science-fiction storytelling and a sense of hope and optimism, the \"Trek\" franchise is the kind of inspiration we could all use right now, and \"Next Generation\" remains the best of the bunch.\n\n21. “Wynonna Earp” (Netflix and Syfy) If you've already seen \"Buffy,\" try this similar story of a super-powered young woman protecting her small town, this time a descendant of Wyatt Earp charged with keeping his undead enemies at bay.\n\nWhen you want to watch a comedy with the whole family\n\n22. “Black-ish” (Hulu) Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross do some of their best work as the parents in an upper-middle class black family in this hilarious and profound sitcom.\n\n23. “The Big Bang Theory” (local stations and TBS, available to buy digitally) The hangout sitcom starring Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco was TV's most popular show for a reason – its big, broad humor and nerdy characters are comforting and familiar.\n\n24. “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” (Hulu) If you've already seen \"Parks and Recreation,\" try this similar workplace comedy, set in a police precinct, from the same producer with the same upbeat tone.\n\n25. “Community” (Hulu until March 31; Netflix April 1) This slightly zany comedy about a group of diverse friends attending a local community college has its ups and downs, but its funniest, most ambitious installments are among the best TV episodes ever made.\n\n26. “Friends” (local stations, TBS; available to buy digitally) The hugely popular sitcom isn't streaming anywhere until HBO Max debuts in late spring, but catch it on TV to hang out with Monica, Joey, Chandler, Rachel, Phoebe and Ross.\n\n27. “Golden Girls” (Hulu) They don't make them like they used to, right? A visit from Dorothy, Rose, Blanche and Sophia is always funny and calming, no matter if you're just discovering the beloved sitcom or rewatching it.\n\n28. “Jane the Virgin” (Netflix) The telenovela-style story of a virgin who's artificially inseminated by accident started strong and rode high for five excellent seasons. Although the moving series is more a dramedy than a laugh-out-loud sitcom, its moments of joy and levity are plentiful.\n\n29. “The Middle” (IMDb TV) Never as flashy as its ABC family-sitcom cousins, \"Middle\" is a stalwart, sweet comedy with great performances and nine long seasons to binge-watch.\n\n30. “Modern Family” (Hulu; ABC, Wednesdays, 9 EDT/PDT; local stations and USA Network) The Emmy-winning series has an incredible cast and relatable laughs for families and married couples. And if you hurry, you can catch up on all 11 seasons before ABC's April 8 series finale.\n\n31. “The Office” (Netflix) There is just no getting sick of the ultimate workplace sitcom, no matter how many times you watch Michael Scott burn his foot on a George Foreman grill.\n\n32. “One Day at a Time” (Netflix) Like the Norman Lear original, this family sitcom, about a Cuban-American family in Los Angeles, is expert at combining a frank discussion of social issues with hilarity (new episodes on Pop TV, Tuesdays, 9:30 EDT/PDT).\n\n33. “Speechless” (Hulu) Gone too soon after just three seasons, this comedy about a family in which one son has cerebral palsy is representation of disability like you've never seen before, with searing satire and riotous laughs.\n\n34. “Superstore” (Hulu; NBC) This series, about employees at a big box store, is something of a modern day \"Cheers,\" a workplace comedy set outside a traditional white-collar office in a place we all have wandered into at some point. (The blue vests of the fictional Cloud 9 store might remind you of a certain chain).\n\nWhen you want to watch a comedy after the kids go to bed\n\n35. “30 Rock” (Amazon, Hulu) Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey and Tracey Morgan make an endlessly appealing trio in this award-winning series about a \"Saturday Night Live\"-style sketch comedy series.\n\n36. “Catastrophe” (Amazon) For fans of dry British humor who feel stable in their marriages, this sitcom from Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan is a beautiful portrait of a relationship that begins with an unplanned pregnancy but becomes so much more.\n\n37. “Cheers” (Netflix) You can't visit a real bar right now, but you can still go where everybody knows your name in this classic NBC comedy starring Ted Danson.\n\n38. “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” (Netflix) CW's poignant musical comedy about one woman's (Rachel Bloom) mental health struggles has a tune for every emotion, and you'll be happy to hum them for weeks after finishing all four seasons.\n\n39. “Don’t Trust the B**** in Apt. 23” (Hulu) This quirky series about a nightmare roommate didn't last long on ABC, but made great comedy while it was on, with Krysten Ritter and James Van Der Beek, playing a fictional version of himself.\n\n40. “Happy Endings (Hulu) One of the many \"Friends\"-like hangout sitcoms to emerge over the past two decades, \"Endings\" is on the quirkier, more heightened side, following five 30-somethings in Chicago.\n\n41. “High Maintenance” (HBO) Because there’s only one recurring character – a New York weed dealer – in every episode, you can start anywhere in this HBO anthology series and always know you’re going to get a tight episode that shows a slice of life with authentic dialogue and gorgeous cinematography.\n\n42. “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” (Hulu) If you like crass, cringe comedy, there are over 150 episodes that lovingly poke at Philly, with a lot of mishaps along the way.\n\n43. “Key & Peele” (Hulu) If you're more interested in morsels of comedy rather than long narratives, this Comedy Central sketch show, which jumpstarted the careers of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, is perfect and requires very little commitment to get a laugh.\n\n44. “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Amazon) With mile-a-minute dialogue, impeccable costumes and an incredible cast, this dramedy about a 1950s housewife (Rachel Brosnahan) turned stand-up comic is a pastel pink-covered treat.\n\n45. “Mom” (CBS All Access, Hulu) Anna Faris and Allison Janney deliver smart comedy about family and addiction in producer Chuck Lorre's (\"Big Bang Theory\") best (but most underrated) CBS sitcom.\n\n46. “Seinfeld” (Hulu) If you've never seen Jerry Seinfeld's landmark show about nothing, it's a great time to start. You might want to skip the disappointing series finale, though.\n\n47. “Veep” (Amazon, HBO Go/HBO Now) Some of the political satire's bite has faded as our world has become more absurd and shocking, but that doesn't dull the sharpness of star Julia Louis-Dreyfus's performance.\n\nWhen you want a taste of reality\n\n48. “The Bachelor/Bachelorette” (Netflix, Hulu) If the bachelors and bachelorettes of ABC's long-running reality dating franchise can find love in a hopeless place (like in front of millions of TV viewers), then there's hope for the rest of us, too.\n\n49. “Blown Away” (Netflix) Watching artists blow glass might seem like watching paint dry, but it's a fascinating and soothing sight to behold in this competition show.\n\n50. “Chopped” (Hulu) If you need inspiration on how to turn random pantry ingredients into a delicious meal, Food Network's competition series, in which four chefs cook with odd and challenging mystery ingredients, might get you to zest up your pasta.\n\n51. “The Big Family Cooking Showdown” (Netflix) The positivity and focus on good, old fashioned home cooking makes this show, with British families competing to be named the best, stand out among its hyper-competitive peers.\n\n52. “House Hunters” (Hulu) If you prefer reality TV that's less sappy and more voyeuristic, HGTV's real estate series lets you judge the choices of home buyers across the country.\n\n53. “MasterChef Junior” (Hulu) Almost any reality series is improved by swapping out boring adults for adorable (and talented) children, and this pint-sized version of the amateur chef competition is far sweeter than the original.\n\n54. “Project Runway” (Hulu) The first four seasons of the original fashion reality show are a perfect mix of artistry and drama, although later ones, with help from mentor Christian Siriano, are almost as wonderful.\n\n55. “Survivor” (CBS All Access) It's hard to travel or escape from the news while social distancing, but CBS's survival series offers glimpses of far-off landscapes, and peeks into the human psyche.\n\n56. “Top Chef” (Hulu) There are dozens of food shows and chef competitions on the air, but this Bravo staple remains the best, pitting a group of chefs in a series of grueling competitions.\n\nWhen you want to bond with the teens (and still be entertained)\n\n57. “American Vandal” (Netflix) The rare series in which teen problems are taken seriously, \"Vandal\" is also a hilarious mockumentary that pokes at overly serious true-crime documentaries like \"Making a Murderer.\"\n\n58. “Beverly Hills, 90210” (Hulu) With big drama and even bigger hair, the 1990s high school staple has inspired many shows, but nothing beats the original (or Luke Perry's sideburns).\n\n59. “Derry Girls” (Netflix) This Irish series, best watched with subtitles, follows a group of Catholic teens in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, a period of religious violence in the region. The series is a great comedy about trying to live a daily life amid social unrest and upheaval.\n\n60. \"The Fosters\" (Netflix) The series follows an interracial lesbian couple with a mix of biological, adopted and foster children, and the unique challenges and emotions that come with that kind of family.\n\n61. \"Friday Night Lights\" (Hulu) The drama on NBC's acclaimed high school football series is undeniably one of the best shows to binge-watch, equally entertaining for teens and adults.\n\n62. “My So-Called Life” (ABC.com, IMDb TV) This short-lived 1994-95 Claire Danes series is one of the best portraits of teen emotion and angst, not to mention the very real traumas that adolescence brings.\n\n63. “The O.C.” (Netflix) Travel, via your TV screen, to California and spend some time with Summer, Seth, Ryan and Marissa. Relive the drama and romance when a working-class kid moves in with a rich family. (But skip the last season.)\n\n64. “Pretty Little Liars (Netflix) Although this soapy thriller sometimes goes off the rails, early seasons are gripping and addictive, spinning delicate webs with the mystery of the disappearance of a teen girl, her left-behind friends and their mysterious harasser.\n\n65. “Riverdale” (Netflix; CW, Wednesdays 8 EDT/PDT) \"Riverdale\" takes pages out of the \"Liars\" playbook when it comes to mixing murder with teen hormones, but its Archie Comics inspiration makes it a familiarly fascinating series.\n\nWhen adult animation beckons\n\n66. “Archer” (Hulu) Spy games are never funnier (or sillier) than in this FXX series, which features the voices of Judy Greer, H. John Benjamin and Chris Parnell.\n\n67. “Bob’s Burgers” (Hulu) Heartfelt, offbeat and full of visual humor, the series about a family and its burger joint is the model of modern adult animation.\n\n68. “BoJack Horseman” (Netflix) Not the cheeriest comedy, but one of the most affecting, Netflix’s showbiz satire found unexpected depths by juxtaposing animated, bipedal animals dealing with serious contemporary issues.\n\n69. “The Simpsons” (Disney+; Fox, Sundays, 8 EDT/PDT) Disney+ isn't all princesses and Pixar – the entire library of this seminal comedy is ready for you to stream at a time in which the quirks of Springfield feel less odd than real life.\n\nWhen you want to hang with detectives and lawyers\n\n70. “Alias Grace” (Netflix) A stunning miniseries based on Margaret Atwood's historical fiction novel, \"Grace\" adds new layers to the case of Canada's most infamous accused murderess.\n\n71. “American Crime Story” (Netflix) Whether you tune to the O.J. Simpson or Gianni Versace season of the FX true-crime anthology series, you'll find sharp writing and a dissection of recent historical events from new perspectives.\n\n72. \"Damages\" (Hulu) Glenn Close plays a high-powered lawyer, with Rose Byrne her young protégé, and each serialized season deals with a different case, which separates it from other legal dramas.\n\n73. “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” (Amazon, CBS All Access) Whether your lead character is Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) or Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), these dramas about Chicago lawyers are enthralling.\n\n74. “Law & Order: SVU” (Amazon; NBC, Thursdays, 10 EDT/PDT) There's a comforting sameness to the hundreds of \"SVU\" episodes: Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) investigates the crime, finds her perp, justice is served. It's an appealing simplicity right now.\n\n75. “Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries” (Amazon, AcornTV) This delightful Australian romp finds the eponymous Miss Fisher (Essie Davis) solving crimes in her best flapper attire in 1920s Melbourne.\n\n76. “NYPD Blue” (Hulu, Amazon) So many cop shows are derivative and basic that it can be hard to remember series like \"Blue,\" which transcended the genre as it followed Detective Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) and the rest of the 15th Precinct as they investigated homicides.\n\nWhen you want to finally figure out what all the fuss is about\n\n77. “The Americans” (Amazon) The best show of the 2010s is a delicate portrait of two Soviet spies (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) working undercover in suburban Washington, D.C., that's also a layered examination of family and marriage.\n\n78. “Atlanta” (Hulu) Donald Glover’s audacious series about a college-dropout father trying to climb the economic ladder as a manager for his rapper cousin (Brian Tyree Henry) is proof of the multi-talented artist's creative prowess.\n\n79. “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” (Netflix; \"Saul\" also on AMC, Mondays, 10 EDT/PDT) \"Bad,\" with its celebrated Bryan Cranston performance as a high school teacher turned drug kingpin, is the quintessential antihero tale. Spinoff prequel \"Saul\" is just as good (or sometimes even better).\n\n80. “Fargo” (Hulu) FX's superb anthology crime series, based on the Coen Brothers movie, captures the spirit of the film in each distinctive season.\n\n81. “Fleabag” (Amazon) Hilarious, emotional and utterly surprising, the British comedy from Phoebe Waller Bridge, in which she stars as a struggling young woman, deserves the hype (and all those Emmys).\n\n82. “Game of Thrones” (HBO Go/HBO Now) If you have resisted the pull of the blockbuster fantasy series, now is the perfect time to decide for yourself if it was worth the buzz. But you can probably skip the final season, unless you want to know why so many left it so angry.\n\n83. “The Good Place” (Netflix, Hulu) The recently ended afterlife sitcom feels like a dose of palliative care with its bright colors, puns and visual gags. Underneath its appealing aesthetics, \"Place\" has great performances, great writing and some sincere thoughts about ethics and philosophy.\n\n84. “Halt and Catch Fire” (Netflix) What started as as a “Mad Men” knockoff about the 1980s computer industry morphed into a complex story about communication, connection and women's struggles to achieve power at home and work.\n\n85. “Insecure” (HBO) Issa Rae crafts a distinctly millennial series in this HBO comedy about a black woman in Los Angeles who questions her life decisions, including her long-term boyfriend.\n\n86. “Justified” (Hulu) Timothy Olyphant is at his absolute best in this cowboy tale of a U.S. Marshal with his own code of justice and deep ties to criminals in his small Kentucky town.\n\n87. “Mad Men” (Netflix) Full of metaphor, gorgeous 1960s costumes and set design, and fine performances from Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss, \"Mad\" was so much more than catchy ad copy.\n\n88. “The Sopranos” (HBO Go/HBO Now, Amazon) The New Jersey mobster drama that launched a thousand antihero knockoffs still has punch (pun intended) two decades after its debut.\n\n89. “Twin Peaks” and “Twin Peaks: The Return” (Netflix, Showtime) ABC's mystical murder mystery from director David Lynch was a phenomenon in the 1990s and returned on Showtime in 2018 as one of the most creatively successful TV revivals in our current glut of rehashes.\n\n90.“The West Wing” (Netflix) The simplicity of politics in Aaron Sorkin's White House drama feels almost quaint in 2020, but the rousing speeches of President Jed Bartlett (Martin Sheen) still inspire and captivate.\n\n91. “The Wire” (HBO Go/HBO Now, Amazon) Touted by many as the best TV show of all time, writer David Simon's meticulous crime drama is gorgeously wrought and acted by the likes of Dominic West, Idris Elba and Michael B. Jordan.\n\nWhen you need soapy drama to keep you glued to the screen\n\n92. \"24\" (Hulu) Kiefer Sutherland's Fox espionage thriller is unparalleled in maintaining the tension and keeping stakes high. It's exactly the kind of distraction we need right now.\n\n93. \"Downton Abbey\" (Amazon) What makes the period drama – about an upper-class British family in the early 20th century and its \"downstairs\" household staff – so riveting is the way it dresses up soapy drama in high-class clothes: a little trashy, a little classy and a lot of Maggie Smith asking what a \"weekend\" is. (Be warned, part of Season 2 covers the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, so steer clear if that hits too close to home right now.)\n\n94. \"Homeland\" (Hulu or Showtime) Especially in its initial, acclaimed season, \"Homeland\" was full of twists, turns and cliffhangers that kept us fervently watching.\n\n95. \"Power\" (Hulu, Starz) \"Power\" is so melodramatic it rivals some daytime soaps, and each absurdity makes it more fun to watch. It follows James \"Ghost\" St. Patrick (Omari Hardwick), a nightclub owner and drug kingpin with plenty of money and problems.\n\n96. \"Scandal\" (Netflix) Shonda Rhimes' series became a sensation with its lightning-fast plot and Oval Office relationship drama, and while the series eventually tapered off, those first few seasons had enough shock, awe and giant wine glasses to keep viewers hungry for more.\n\n97. \"True Blood\" (HBO Go/HBO Now, Amazon) HBO's Louisiana vampire series has everything you need: big-name talent (Anna Paquin, Alexander Skarsgaard, Joe Manganiello), wild plots (fairies! psychics! humidity!) and a whole lot of blood (synthetic or otherwise).\n\n98. \"You\" (Netflix) Penn Badgley is at his creepy best in Netflix's drama about a \"nice guy\" who's really a murderous stalker manipulating his way into the lives of his victims.\n\nWhen you want to learn something\n\n99. “Country Music” (PBS) Ken Burns turned his famous documentarian's eye to a distinct piece of Americana in this calming chronicle of the rise of country music.\n\n100. “O.J.: Made in America” (Hulu, ESPN) If the \"ACS\" fictional retelling of O.J. Simpson's story has you interested in the topic, this epic Oscar- and Emmy-winning documentary tells not only Simpson's history but the history of race in 20th-century America.\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/01/08/tv-spinoffs-10-best-and-five-worst-all-time-fosters-goldbergs-joey-colbert-report-good-fight/2472040002/", "title": "TV spinoffs: The 10 best and five worst of all time", "text": "If at first you do succeed, try, try again.\n\nTelevision spinoffs, which seem to have been around since the invention of the cathode-ray tube, are in the spotlight again with this week's premieres of ABC's \"Schooled\" (Wednesday, 8:30 EST/PST), which jumps from '80s-something \"The Goldbergs\" into the next decade, and Freeform's \"Good Trouble\" (Tuesday, 8 EST/PST), which follows two of the now grown-up kids from \"The Fosters,\" now in Los Angeles.\n\nOf the legion of offshoot alternatives, some have spun peripheral concepts into gold. Others simply became canceled dross. Our take on the best and the worst:\n\nThe best\n\n'The Colbert Report' (Comedy Central)\n\nThere's a reason Comedy Central has been having such trouble filling the post-\"Daily Show\" timeslot in recent years – nothing can be better than the original. \"The Colbert Report\" seems more like a fact of life than a spinoff in retrospect, but its origins are in Stephen Colbert's Bill O'Reilly parody from his time as a correspondent on \"The Daily Show.\" Only a comedian with Colbert's talent could take a one-joke persona and turn it into multiple seasons of successful television, books and marches on Washington. When the comedian put aside his frameless glasses to helm CBS's \"The Late Show,\" we lost more than a half-hour of weekly comedy. We lost the \"Stephen Colbert\" we'd come to love.\n\n'The Good Fight' (CBS All Access)\n\nIf there's one gleaming reason for the CBS All Access streaming service to exist, it's this wonderful spinoff of CBS drama \"The Good Wife.\" \"The Good Fight\" gave Christine Baranski's Diane Lockhart her own forum as she and Chicago's best lawyers attempt to function in the post-President Trump era. The series has everything that made \"Wife\" great, and none of the tics that made it frustrating. Plus, free of the FCC broadcast restrictions, \"Fight\" is dirtier and more profane than its predecessor, and unapologetic about political storylines. At this point, \"Wife\" feels like it was just a warmup for creators Robert and Michelle King.\n\n'Daria' (MTV)\n\nThe sullen teen Daria Morgendorffer (voiced by Tracy Grandstaff) appeared sporadically on \"Beavis and Butt-head,\" but in her own series, she finally began to shine (although she was still pretty sullen). The clever series, which lampooned the idea that someone would actually like high school, has achieved cult status over the years, and Daria has given voice to a generation of disaffected, too-cool-for-school '90s kids.\n\n'Xena: Warrior Princess' (Syndicated)\n\nFew probably remember \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,\" but its spinoff, \"Xena: Warrior Princess,\" is a pop-culture touchstone that's easily identifiable even if you've never seen an episode. \"Xena\" outstripped \"Hercules\" in every way, from the magnetic talent of stars Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor to its irresistible campiness.\n\n'Angel' (WB)\n\nBefore he was an FBI agent or a Navy SEAL, David Boreanaz was Angel, a 200-year-old vampire with a soul, a brooding, gorgeous love interest for Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\" Recognizing Boreanaz's star potential early, \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon spun him off into this darker, more mature take on the supernatural than \"Buffy.\" \"Angel\" was never quite as good as \"Buffy,\" but it skated through many peaks, valleys and cast changes because of Boreanaz's charm.\n\n‘Maude,’ ‘Good Times’ and ‘The Jeffersons’ (CBS)\n\nThese three 1970s sitcoms form the greatest group of spinoffs, all descending from Norman Lear’s masterpiece “All in the Family.” The trio dealt with the same hot-button social issues that revolutionized TV in that era. We rate “Maude” at the top of the pyramid, based on Beatrice Arthur’s tour de force performance as a liberal suburbanite waging an early war against the patriarchy while battling her own prejudices and hubris. “Good Times” was the rare show that looked at the struggles of a poor black family led by Maude's former maid, the powerful Florida (Esther Rolle), before it was “dyn-o-mited” by the success of Jimmie Walker’s catchphrase. “The Jeffersons” touched on race, prosperity and pursuit of the American dream, but compact powerhouse George Jefferson (Sherman Helmsley) also brought a physical humor that just made us laugh.\n\n'Boston Legal' (ABC)\n\nThe city stayed the same, and so did the setting – a law firm – but David E. Kelley’s offbeat “Boston Legal” succeeded largely because tonally, it was worlds apart from “The Practice,” a serious, frequently dark look at gritty legal maneuvering. The wry James Spader succeeded earnest Dylan McDermott on “Practice” before embracing the comic quirkiness of “Legal” and his larger-than-life tango partner, William Shatner. Their patio tete-a-tetes offered the ultimate in verbal jousting.\n\n‘Frasier’ (NBC)\n\n“Frasier” wouldn’t have succeeded had it tried to outdo “Cheers,” one of the greatest workplace comedies of all time. The spinoff took stuffy psychologist Frasier Crane (the brilliant Kelsey Grammer), a lesser character whose pomposity and anxiety offered great comic possibility, and moved him from a Boston bar to a Seattle apartment (and radio station, but it thrived at home). With the additions of David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves, John Mahoney and Peri Gilpin, “Frasier” became TV’s best comedy of manners, cranking out 263 episodes (a record for studio-audience comedies recently surpassed by “The Big Bang Theory”), many of which would have been the toast of Broadway.\n\n'Better Call Saul' (AMC)\n\nSpinning off a critical and popular series makes sense, but carries risk: You’ll always be compared to the original. But “Breaking Bad” progeny “Better Call Saul” has been an unqualified success. Like “Frasier,” it focuses on a minor character, Bob Odenkirk’s delightfully shady lawyer Jimmy McGill (later Saul Goodman), but it takes the opposite tack, going backward to retrofit an origin story that eventually ends with Saul's introduction to the world of “Bad’s” Walter White. So far, so good, and with \"Bad\" alum Jonathan Banks and Rhea Seehorn delivering stellar performances, we’re belted in for seedy Saul’s trip to the bottom.\n\n'Lou Grant' (CBS)\n\nIn his comedic form, irascible Minneapolis TV news director Lou Grant (Edward Asner) physically threw inane anchorman Ted Baxter out of the station on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” In his dramatic form, he became a serious newspaper editor at Los Angeles’s Tribune, managing a staff of muckrakers when journalism was enjoying its post-Watergate glow. “Lou Grant” pulled off the ultimate switcheroo as an hour-long drama spun from a sitcom. Gruff, beloved Lou thrived in both environs, earning Asner Emmys in comedy and drama categories.\n\nGoodnight, Mr. Grant: Ed Asner, seven-time Emmy winner, TV's beloved Lou Grant and star of 'Up,' dies at 91\n\nThe worst\n\n'Joey' (NBC)\n\nPoor Matt Le Blanc. He gets an A for effort, but \"Joey\" was doomed from the start, an ill-advised spinoff of one of the most successful sitcoms of all time. Part of what made \"Friends\" work was that it was a well-balanced show that (most of the time) didn't let its over-the-top personalities overpower one another. With Joey Tribbiani at the center, the action moved from New York to L.A. and an annoying cast of characters was thrown in, leaving nothing about \"Joey\" that remotely approached the brilliance of \"Friends.\" Just pretend his story ended with the deconstruction of the foosball table in the \"Friends\" finale.\n\n'Time of Your Life' (Fox)\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt was the most famous cast member on \"Party of Five,\" but she was also the most boring, making her a poor candidate to hold down her own spinoff. \"Time of Your Life\" was a dull drag from the very beginning. Removing the family dynamic by sending Sarah (Hewitt) to New York, and giving her a generic bunch of young-adult friends (played by Jennifer Garner and Pauley Perrette), only made things worse.\n\n'Caprica' (Syfy)\n\n\"Caprica\" was everything the beautiful, politically clever and haunting \"Battlestar Galactica\" wasn't: Trite, boring and phony. A prequel that showed the universe of the series before the nuclear apocalypse that kicked off \"Galactica\" was full of potential. Yet the final product lacked the innovation that made its parent series great.\n\n‘Joanie Loves Chachi’ (ABC)\n\nThe problem here? Too little and too late. The 1982 not-so-“Happy Days” spinoff featured two of the least-interesting characters, Richie’s little sister, Joanie (Erin Moran) and Fonzie Lite Chachi Arcola (Scott Baio). It premiered a full five years after the “Happy Days” episode that originated the phrase “jumping the shark,” proving the original was out of ideas long before this spinoff got rolling, never a good sign. And let’s face it: Chachi’s “Wah-wah-wah” can’t hold a candle to Fonzie’s “Aaaaaay!”\n\n‘AfterMASH’ (CBS)\n\nColonel Potter (Harry Morgan), Father Mulcahy (William Christopher) and Corporal Klinger (Jamie Farr) were beloved supporting characters on one of TV’s greatest comedies, “M*A*S*H,” but a stateside VA hospital paled next to the Korean War as a sitcom setting. Without Hawkeye, B.J. or Margaret Houlihan, the trio couldn’t support the comedy by themselves. And after 200 or so episodes of “M*A*S*H,” there may not have been much left of interest to reveal, either. The title itself suggests more a schedule placeholder than an actual series, which may have been the problem.The smarter move would have been not to re-enlist.\n\nIf you love television and love talking about it even more, USA TODAY Life’s Yes, I’m Still Watching is here for you.

The miniseries far outpaces, in both style and substance, the more famous Atwood adaptation on Hulu.\n\n2. “American Crime Story”\n\nBetween “The People v. O.J. Simpson” and “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” Ryan Murphy’s true-crime anthology has delivered narratives that lack the seedy exploitation so often associated with the genre. Instead, each season is a historical reckoning with huge cultural moments, portrayed with impeccable acting and writing.2.\n\n3. “American Vandal”\n\nA hilarious mockumentary poking at true-crime documentaries like Netflix’s own “Making a Murderer,” this series treats teen problems with the gravitas of a murder investigation. And considering most emotions and dramas feel like life or death in adolescence, “Vandal” is deeply moving in how it brings high school to life.\n\n4. “Avatar: The Last Airbender” and \"The Legend of Korra\"\n\nA Nickelodeon animated series with a devoted adult following, “Airbender” is a fantasy epic in kid's clothing with drama to rival “Game of Thrones.” The gorgeously drawn series takes place in a world torn apart by war and genocide, where a pint-size chosen one might be able to save lives, if he can train hard enough and face his greatest fears. A follow-up series set a generation in the future and aimed at an older audience, \"Korra,\" surpasses its source material in maturity and storytelling complexity, becoming a modern classic.\n\n5. \"The Baby-Sitters Club\"\n\nNetflix's heartwarming and sweet family series, based on the novels by Ann M. Martin, was canceled too soon after just two seasons. The series, about a group of middle school girls who form a babysitting business, is full of life lessons, great acting and humor for all ages. \"Baby-Sitters\" was one of the best shows on TV.\n\n6. “Better Call Saul”\n\nA rare spin-off to nearly outpace its source material in quality and complexity, Bob Odenkirk’s “Breaking Bad” prequel continues to reach new heights in every season and has long since stepped out of its parent show’s shadow.\n\n7. \"Big Mouth\"\n\nNick Kroll's animated celebration of preteen debauchery is one of the most reliably funny series on TV (and definitely the most cringeworthy). The animated middle schoolers navigate first periods, crushes and every other pubescent nightmare, along with actual Hormone Monsters (and a monstress) causing problems along the way. No series will make you happier that you've already lived through adolescence.\n\n8. “Blown Away”\n\nNetflix’s little reality series about competitive glass blowing is mesmerizing to watch, as its highly talented contestants stretch molten materials into stunning works of art. Breezy, funny and surprising, it’s a supremely satisfying series to binge-watch. Season 3 of the dazzling competition arrives July 22.\n\n9. “BoJack Horseman”\n\nA misanthropic Hollywood horse (Will Arnett) leads this animated satire series that is deeper, more clever and more thought-provoking than most live-action series even aspire to be.\n\n10. \"Breaking Bad\"\n\nBryan Cranston and Aaron Paul give unforgettable performances in this AMC series that ranks on the list of the greatest TV shows of all time. The tragedy of high school science teacher Walter White (Cranston) who turned into a meth-dealing kingpin over the series' run is epic and heartbreaking. It's an anti-hero story infinitely copied in other series but never better than it is here.\n\n11. \"Bridgerton\"\n\nA bodice ripper taken seriously by its writers and stars, \"Bridgerton\" is a marvelous first entry in power producer Shonda Rhimes' Netflix deal. The series follows a group of pretty upper-class Brits navigating the marriage market in Regency-era England. The resplendent series is an expensive, glossy manifesto for the weightiness of the romance genre: a story that deals with love, class, race and a host of other topics while expertly landing every choreographed ballroom dance. Season 2, which focuses on eldest son Anthony, lived up to the hype of the first.\n\n12. “Call the Midwife”\n\nThis British period drama, set among nurse midwives serving poor families in 1950s London, is like an epidural injecting joy, tears and adorable babies into your life. Although it gets a little repetitive in later seasons, its raw emotion and British sensibility make it a must-watch for the “Downton Abbey” crowd.\n\nMore:The 40 best TV shows to watch on Paramount+ right now, from 'The Good Fight' to 'The Real World'\n\n13. \"Cobra Kai\"\n\nThe fantastic revival of \"The Karate Kid\" franchise, featuring Ralph Macchio and William Zabka in their original roles, is one of the smartest ways to bring a kids' story into adulthood. It picks up three decades after the All Valley Karate Tournament, with Zabka's Johnny Lawrence a gentler hero and Macchio's Daniel LaRusso playing the villain.\n\n14. “Community”\n\nWacky, weird and often wonderful, NBC’s comedy about a diverse group of friends at a community college defies genre and label in its first few excellent seasons to create engrossing television. The later seasons are fine but never as good as the first three.\n\n15. “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\"\n\nA magnificent mélange of musical might, the four-season CW series ambitiously put original song and dance on network TV week after week. Anchored by creator/star Rachel Bloom as struggling heroine Rebecca Bunch, “Crazy Ex” mixed earworms with one of the best depictions of a mental health journey ever on TV.\n\n16. “The Crown”\n\nFor devoted anglophiles and royal rejecters alike, Netflix’s dramatization of the reign of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II makes a juicy soap out of the royal family, in a prestigious, Emmy-winning package. Season 4 introduces Princess Diana (Emma Corrin), Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) and a lot more drama to the Windsors.\n\n17. \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow\"\n\nThis under-the-radar CW series aired what turned out to be its final season this year. Over the years, the show featured intricately developed characters who fit into the show’s unique tone: super fun, bouncy yet sophisticated science fiction with plenty of romance and comedy thrown in. It’s hard to say a series that ran for seven seasons was canceled too soon, but “Legends” was so superb at reinventing itself that it could have run for many more years.\n\n18. \"Deaf U\"\n\nThis smart, addictive reality series follows college kids at Gallaudet University, a school for the deaf and hard of hearing. In addition to illuminating the deaf and hard of hearing community, the show is incredible at creating relationship drama and comedy out of the lives of the students it follows, and it has the rare reality ensemble that pops off the screen with charm.\n\n19. “Dear White People”\n\nStronger and more self-assured than the movie on which it’s based, this series, about Black students at an elite university full of microaggressions and outright racism, is whip-smart and often hilarious.\n\n20. “Derry Girls”\n\nYou may have to watch with subtitles to parse the strong Irish accents, but this series about Catholic teen girls in Northern Ireland during the 1990s portion of the “Troubles,” the violent religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants, is one of the funniest shows on TV, even for Americans unfamiliar with the history.\n\n21. \"Elite\"\n\nOne of the many stellar foreign-language offerings on Netflix, \"Elite\" is a captivating and thrilling teen drama from Spain. Set in a prestigious high school, the series follows three students enrolled on scholarships and some of their wealthy classmates. While it owes something to \"Gossip Girl,\" \"Big Little Lies\" and \"The O.C.,\" the series never feels derivative or tired. The chemistry of the cast and mystery elements make \"Elite\" an easy and addictive binge-watch. Season 5 arrives April 8.best tv\n\n22. \"Evil\"\n\n\"The Good Wife\" and \"The Good Fight\" creators Robert and Michelle King bring their cutting dialogue and timely stories to this superb CBS series. \"Evil\" follows a psychologist (Katja Herbers), a priest-in-training (Mike Colter) and a tech specialist (Aasif Mandvi) as they investigate alleged demon possessions, miracles and other phenomenon. How much evil is really out there? Season 2 is available on Paramount+.\n\n23. “Friday Night Lights”\n\nThe drama on NBC's acclaimed high school football series undeniably makes it one of the best shows to binge-watch, equally entertaining for teens and adults. They don’t make high school dramas like this anymore. (The drama is available on Peacock and Hulu as well.)\n\n24. \"Girlfriends\"\n\nTracee Ellis Ross, Golden Brooks, Persia White and Jill Marie Jones anchored this hilarious and affecting 2000-2008 UPN sitcom about the love lives and friendships of four Black women in Los Angeles.\n\n25. “The Good Place”\n\nNBC's afterlife sitcom feels like a dose of palliative care with its bright colors, puns and visual gags. Underneath its appealing aesthetics, \"Place\" has great performances, great writing and some sincere thoughts about ethics and philosophy.\n\n26. “Grace and Frankie”\n\nJane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are a magnetic duo in this sitcom from the “Friends” creators. The actresses play the eponymous retirees who learn their husbands are leaving them (for each other). The sometimes raunchy series proves it’s never too late to start over. The seventh and final season premieres on April 29.\n\n27. “The Great British Baking Show”\n\nWarm, friendly, full of soggy bottoms, underproofed loaves and decent people doing their best, this British import is one of the happiest TV series ever made.\n\n28. “Grey’s Anatomy”\n\nShonda Rhimes' seminal hospital drama is still on the air after so many seasons for a reason. Sure, the series crossed over from soapy to full-on soap opera early in its tenure, but amid its constant barrage of tragedy and medical grotesquery are compelling relationship dramas that are emotionally honest.\n\n29. “Halt and Catch Fire”\n\nThis short but impactful drama started as a “Mad Men” knockoff about the 1980s computer industry, but greatly improved on a so-so first season. “Halt” evolved into a complex story about communication, connection and women's struggles to achieve power at home and work.\n\n30. \"Heartstopper\"\n\nElation is the best way to describe how you’ll feel after watching Netflix’s young-adult rom-com about two teen British boys who fall head over heels for each other. Based on the graphic novels by Alice Oseman (and adapted by the author), “Heartstopper” brilliantly portrays the struggles of being a queer teenager, opting not for despair but for jubilant hope. It uses animated imagery from the comics that adds to the feeling that “Heartstopper” is part reality, part fantasy. Its positive take on the story of coming out and falling in love feels essential.\n\n31. “Jane the Virgin”\n\nThe telenovela-style story of a virgin who's artificially inseminated by accident started strong and rode high for five excellent seasons. Although the moving series isn't a laugh-out-loud sitcom, its moments of joy and levity are plentiful.\n\n32. Ken Burns documentaries\n\nThis one is a cheat, because there are just so many great documentaries from the legendary filmmaker. But if you want to be educated, entertained and potentially shocked all at once, try some of the great ones available on Netflix: “Prohibition,” “The Civil War,” “The West” and “The Roosevelts: An Intimate History.”\n\n33. “Lovesick”\n\nIf you like a sweet (but not too saccharine) romantic comedy, this short British series is a good choice. The story starts with a man diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease reaching out to his former flames and morphs into a touching and surprising will they/won’t they love story.\n\n34. “The Magicians”\n\nLike an R-rated mashup of “Game of Thrones,” \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" the superb fantasy series follows a group of adult magicians who discover a fictional world from popular children's books is real – and deathly dangerous.\n\n35. “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”\n\nThere are comedy classics, and then there are the genre’s very foundations. If you are a fan of “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” but have never seen the hysterical, groundbreaking sketch TV show from comedians Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin that came first, now is the time to correct that error.\n\n36. “Never Have I Ever”\n\nMindy Kaling's teen sitcom is a breath of honest, awkward fresh air. Loosely based on Kaling's experiences, the series follows Devi (sparkling new talent Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), an Indian American teen fumbling her way through an angry, frustrating adolescence. Season 3 of the acclaimed comedy arrives Aug. 12.\n\n37. “One Day at a Time”\n\nLike Norman Lear's original, which premiered in 1975, this family sitcom reboot, about a Cuban American family in Los Angeles, is expert at combining frank discussion of social issues with hilarity. A shortened fourth season is available on Paramount+, but the first three wonderful years are still streaming on their original home.\n\n38. “Orange Is the New Black”\n\nNetflix’s groundbreaking series had ups and downs over its run, but especially its first three seasons are exquisite character portraits in a space we’ve rarely seen: the inside of a women’s prison.\n\n39. “Pose”\n\nThe LGBTQ drama, set in 1980s ballroom culture, is ambitious, tragic and complex. It’s gorgeously filmed with especially strong performances from Emmy winner Billy Porter as Pray Tell, Mj Rodriguez as Blanca and Indya Moore as Angel.\n\n40. \"The Queen's Gambit\"\n\nThe story of a fictional 1960s chess prodigy (Anya Taylor-Joy, at her absolute best) battling addiction as she rises through the ranks of the chess elite is far more engrossing than it sounds. The miniseries, from the writer of \"Logan,\" manages to make its chess matches as epic as any football game and features a superb cast.\n\n41. “Queer Eye”\n\nInspiration, triumph, overcoming obstacles: All those heartwarming attributes are here when the Fab Five swoop into someone's life to offer as much help as they can in a week.\n\n42. “Schitt’s Creek”\n\nFull of beautiful romance, sunny settings and plenty of humor, Pop TV's sitcom about a rich family that loses it all but gains love and a little perspective is always a mood-booster.\n\n43. “Sense8”\n\nSometimes logically lacking nonsensical but never emotionally insincere, the Wachowski siblings’ sprawling sci-fi series is a celebration of LGBTQ+ pride and love in many forms.\n\n44. \"Seinfeld\"\n\nIf you've never seen Jerry Seinfeld's landmark NBC sitcom (previously streaming on Hulu), now is a good time to start. Famously a show about \"nothing,\" \"Seinfeld\" is one of the comedies that (mostly) stands the test of time, from its hilarious and talented cast (also including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards), to its enduring jokes and even its own created holiday (a Festivus for \"the rest of us\").\n\n45. “Stranger Things”\n\nThe nostalgic and paranormal series became one of Netflix’s first real sensations, and it almost lives up to all that hype. With fantastic kid actors, terrifying horror homages and all the 1980s pop culture references you can handle, the seasons of “Stranger” are compelling and alluring. Season 4 is now streaming in its entirety, and there is just one season left to tell the full story of the Upside Down.\n\n46. “Unbelievable”\n\nBased on a Pulitzer Prize-winning ProPublica article, \"Unbelievable\" is both infuriating and triumphant, highlighting the deep flaws in our criminal justice system while also celebrating justice eventually done. With a stellar cast, “Unbelievable” tells the story of a rape victim (Kaitlyn Dever) who isn’t believed by police and the two detectives (Toni Collette and Merritt Wever) who bring her attacker to justice years later – after he raped several more women.\n\n47. “Unorthodox”\n\nThis slightly under-the-radar miniseries is based on the true story of a woman who escapes an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in New York and runs away to Germany. Often using Yiddish dialogue and authentic costuming, the series is an immersive, addictive journey.\n\n48. “The Witcher”\n\nThere are TV series that are so bad they’re good, and then there’s “The Witcher,” a bacchanalia of B-movie tropes, nonsensical plots, unnecessary nudity and terrible dialogue that finds the sweet spot of being silly and sensational at once. The writers and actors, including star Henry Cavill, take this fantasy thriller both too seriously and not seriously at all, making it one of the most surprisingly delightful series on Netflix.\n\n49. “When They See Us”\n\nAva DuVernay’s striking miniseries gives voice to the so-called Central Park Five, a group of five Black and Latino boys wrongly convicted of assault in the 1980s. With a talented group of rising stars as the falsely accused adolescents – Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Emmy-winner Jharrel Jerome and Marquis Rodriguez – “Us” brings history to the screen as a brutal, unrelenting tragedy.\n\n50. “You”\n\nThe soapy stalker thriller starring Penn Badgley was a pleasant surprise in its original home on Lifetime and became a sensation once it moved to Netflix. Of all the current series that traffic in bad men doing bad things, “You” remains one of the few that asks interesting questions about its bad guy.\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra\n\nHave a different streaming service?

(AP) — The American Athletic Conference and ESPN have reached agreement on a new 12-year television contract that will increase revenue to the league's schools but is far less than the money provided to their Power Five counterparts.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the negotiations says the conference will receive about $1 billion over the next dozen years and in exchange ESPN will get the rights to AAC games, many of which will be broadcast on ESPN-plus, the company's a la carte digital platform.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the contracts have not been signed, said the deal will provide the conference with about $83.3 million per year, with each member school receiving an average of just under $7 million a year.\n\nThe agreement, first reported by Sports Business Journal Daily, runs from the 2020-21 academic year through 2031-32.\n\nThe deal will more than triple the per school payouts the AAC will provide its members for media rights under its current contract, but falls well short of providing a cash infusion that would support the league's narrative of being \"Power Six\" school.\n\nThe most recent deal the Big Ten signed with Fox and ESPN will pay the conference $2.64 billion over six years. Among the Power Five, the Atlantic Coast Conference had the smallest revenue distribution payouts to its members last year at an average of $26.6 million. That number is likely to go up with the launch of ESPN's ACC Network in August.\n\nBut the American's deal is better than other major college football conferences in the so-called Group of Five.\n\nThe Mountain West, which is nearing the end of its deal with ESPN, pays its members about $1 million per season from media rights deal. The Mid-American Conference is in the middle of 13-year deal with ESPN that pays the conference about $10 million per year to split between its 12 members. Conference USA and the Sun Belt have TV deals that pay about $500,000 annually.\n\nThe American's deal will result in some football games being broadcast on ABC. Other football and basketball games will appear on ESPN's cable television networks, including ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU.\n\nBut most basketball and other AAC sports will be provided only to those who subscribe to ESPN-plus, a separate digital platform that costs just under $5 a month.\n\nThe deal will allow for the broadcast up about 1,000 AAC events per year on ESPN-plus by its third year, the official said.\n\nCBS retains the rights to a small number of basketball games and Navy some football games.\n\nThe ESPN contract also includes language that would protect the network, should marquee schools, such as UCF, Cincinnati or UConn leave for another conference.\n\n__\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super/2014/01/30/super-bowl-nfl-revenue-denver-broncos-seattle-seahawks/5061197/", "title": "NFL takes aim at $25 billion, but at what price?", "text": "Brent Schrotenboer\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says NFL wants to grow from %2410 billlion to %2425 billion by 2027\n\nLeague revenue comes from four major sources%3A media rights%2C sponsors%2C attendance and merchandising\n\nOne risk for the NFL is whether its financial goals might price regular fans out of games\n\nNEW YORK (Jan. 31) — Sunday's Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., might be the most popular and expensive television program in U.S. history – about 110 million viewers watching a football game that commands nearly $4 million for a 30-second commercial.\n\nTickets at the 50-yard line cost about $10,000. A 20-ounce cup of Bud Light will cost $14.\n\n\"Nothing is really sacred anymore,\" said John Vrooman, a sports economics professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\nIt won't stop there. The National Football League hopes to achieve $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027, up from about $10 billion now. Several analysts told USA TODAY Sports that the NFL can get there, but it will be an expensive journey. More palatial stadiums. Expanded playoffs. More exposure in more places, including smartphones, games in London and more Thursday night games sold to the highest-bidding network.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell gave the magic number at a meeting of NFL team owners in 2010: a goal of tripling league revenue in 17 years. If it happens, the NFL would have more income than the gross domestic products of dozens of small countries and would be in the same financial district currently occupied by gigantic global brands such as McDonald's, Nike and Goodyear Tire, each of which recently took in about $21 to $28 billion annually.\n\nWho will pay the price? Fans, sponsors and broadcasters. The NFL remains the most popular sports league in America, and it commands a premium. If the average NFL fan thinks the cost of attending games is already too high, how about paying ever-higher prices to watch games on ESPN and the NFL Network? Cable and satellite TV providers pay ESPN an average of $6.04 per subscription per month, more than double from 10 years ago and dwarfing the likes of CNN (63 cents) and TBS (72 cents), according to SNL Kagan, a market research firm.\n\n\"The standard (cable television) package that households receive is skyrocketing in cost at a point in the U.S. economy when we have increasingly lopsided distribution of income,\" sports economist Andrew Zimbalist told USA TODAY Sports. \"Those two things have to collide.\"\n\nThe future\n\nThe NFL declined to release financial data, but an estimate of its revenue can be pieced together through various sources by economists and market researchers. That $10 billion pie is roughly sliced four ways, according to Navigate Research, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in the evaluation of sports and entertainment marketing investments.\n\nAbout $5 billion from media and television rights to broadcast games.\n\nAbout $1-2 billion in sponsorships, such as its long-running deal with PepsiCo, worth about $90 million to $100 million per year.\n\nAbout $2 billion related to attendance and ticket sales.\n\nAbout $1 billion in merchandise and licensing.\n\nGrowing to $25 billion annually will require compound annual growth of about 7 percent, around $1 billion per year.\n\nCBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN provide the NFL with a total of about $5 billion to $6 billion annually from contracts that run through 2021-22. By 2027, Navigate Research predicts such media rights revenues could reach $17 billion.\n\nThat ambitious projection assumes that live NFL games will continue to be a golden goose for networks and their advertisers for one major reason: NFL games are one of the few remaining programs that huge audiences want to watch live instead of recording to watch later – fast-forwarding through the commercials that companies pay millions to air.\n\n\"We are firm believers that there is nothing more valuable in the world of TV than the NFL – nothing,\" said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson, a stock research firm that specializes in the media and telecommunications industries. \"Their ability to get to $25 billion is kind of predicated on the staying power of the product. I think they're going to ask for whatever they need to from their broadcast partners, their cable partners.\"\n\nVrooman, the Vanderbilt economist, says the NFL can get there primarily because it's a monopoly – the richest sports league on the planet with a business plan built largely through the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, which allows sports leagues to pool their television rights for sale to the highest bidder, protecting them from antitrust laws.\n\n\"The monopoly rule is to gouge half as many fans more than twice as much on everything,\" he said. He also predicts the league will become \"increasingly more exclusive with the same general formula of fewer fans having access at higher prices to generate more certain media, venue and gate revenues.\"\n\nThe NFL disputes that, noting its commitment to broadcast some games on free over-the-air TV networks, which helps it reach bigger audiences. Even games on ESPN, for example, are available on free TV in local markets. But the league is not shy about its appetite for growth.\n\n\"We measure our business very simply: Is consumption going up, and is the economic pie growing?\" said Brian Rolapp, the chief operating officer of NFL media.\n\nRolapp was involved in recent NFL deals with Verizon, Twitter, Microsoft and the television networks. He currently is involved in shopping a Thursday Night Football TV package and working on a new deal with DirecTV. He called the $25 billion goal an aspiration.\n\n\"In order to get to a number that lofty, it requires a lot of different things,\" Rolapp told USA TODAY Sports. \"It requires, clearly, hard work. It requires different thinking. We are relatively strong in our business. We're strong as a league, but what we always say around here is complacency is our enemy.\"\n\nThe formula\n\nFor better or worse, the road to $25 billion probably requires some variation of the following, analysts told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nMore new and upgraded stadiums. This year's Super Bowl is in chilly New Jersey, a reward for the Jets and Giants building the swanky MetLife Stadium, which opened in 2010. Yet it has been 11 years since the Super Bowl was in 70-degree San Diego, where the Chargers still play in outdated Qualcomm Stadium.\n\nTo keep revenue growing, the NFL needs stadiums that are big moneymakers, such as AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, where suites cost up to $500,000 per year and fans pay more than $80 for seats in the upper deck end zone. Levi's Stadium, the new $1.3 billion home of the San Francisco 49ers, opens later this year and will host the Super Bowl in 2016. Later that year, the Minnesota Vikings will open their new stadium.\n\nThe risk for the NFL is that it might price out everyday, jersey-wearing fans, who might decide they'd rather watch games on high-definition TV anyway. Attendance accounts for only about about 25 percent of NFL revenue, and at times there have been signs of sagging demand. Three of the NFL's four first-round playoff games this year struggled to sell out. Will fans keep going to games if the price keeps rising and the view is better on TV?\n\n\"That is a big concern,\" Rolapp said. \"It will always be an important part of the revenue …We still believe it's still the best place to experience NFL football. I think it will be for some time, but we have to keep innovating so it remains that.\"\n\nMore weeknight games, anyone? The NFL has been shopping a Thursday night package to TV networks and could announce a buyer soon with possible simulcasting on the NFL Network, the league's cable outlet. NFL games once were mass-delivered for television consumption on Sunday afternoons and Monday night.\n\nNBC, for example, pays about $1 billion per year for its package of Sunday night games and playoff games.\n\nMore televised content. If there's demand, create more supply. That's why the league is considering expanding the playoffs, creating another product to sell to networks eager to capture big live audiences. The NFL also is turning the offseason into a moneymaker by televising the NFL Combine in February and the NFL Draft in the spring, which has expanded from one day to three days, including two nights in prime time.\n\nNew markets. The NFL has been priming London as a market, with two sold-out games there last year and three games on tap in 2013. Meanwhile, Los Angeles hasn't had an NFL team since 1994. Moving existing teams from weak markets into bigger vacant markets might give team owners a better way to increase their shared revenue as opposed to adding more franchises to the 32-team league.\n\nConversely, Los Angeles has value to the NFL as a bargaining chip – the unstated threat of moving into that big, empty market can help existing franchises wring out taxpayer dollars for stadium upgrades and new construction.\n\nGet ready for NFL teams to make \"renewed threats of franchise relocation to leverage public money for private stadiums in the second venue revolution, just like the first (round of stadium upgrades) over the last two decades,\" Vrooman said. \"Monopoly power over TV rights and franchise location is what provides the real engine for the economic growth of the most powerful sports league in the world.\"\n\nPhones, Internet and new media. More consumers get their news and information from their smartphones –a trend the NFL recognized with its recent $250 million annual deal with Verizon to stream games onto phone screens. The NFL also recently made deals with Twitter and Microsoft's Xbox, giving it new revenue streams in growing interactive and social media.\n\nWith more viewers consuming video content online instead of on cable, cable companies and cable channels could see subscription revenue plummet. Those channels – including ESPN and the NFL Network – can try to recoup that revenue through online content, but it might not be as lucrative.\n\n\"The established content suppliers – NFL, ESPN – are uneasy and so going very slowly,\" said Roger Noll, emeritus economics professor at Stanford. \"They see the potential for a huge payoff, but also for a huge bursting of the bubble, and want to keep control until they know where things are likely to go.\"\n\nTelevision. The NFL's TV rights contracts soon will be worth about $7 billion per year combined, with most of them starting this year and lasting through 2022. What happens in 2023?\n\n\"It's a new day after that,\" Rolapp said. \"We'll just have to see. A lot of things we do digitally along the way are a great experiment for us to see what the world will look like. We will be prepared one way or the other to be able to shift to where the consumer is.\"\n\nTo get to $25 billion, the NFL probably needs about $15-17 billion from networks.\n\nIf networks pay it, those costs likely will be passed down to the consumer. ESPN likely would ask for higher rates from advertisers and higher subscriber fees from cable distributors, and even viewers who don't like football would pay more because cable channels are not offered a la carte.\n\n\"Everything else 10 years from now will be worth less relative to what the NFL is going to be worth,\" said Nathanson, the stock analyst. \"No other sport has that kind of national draw to it.\"\n\nAs long as the NFL can bring big live audiences, it'll be hard for the likes of ESPN to avoid paying up, but the growing risk is viewers who could decide to cancel their cable subscriptions and use other devices to watch what they want.\n\nThe NFL said it is committed to staying on free television, not just cable, where it has its own network and can reap cable subscription revenue in addition to advertising revenue.\n\n\"It would have been very easy years ago to migrate our games to cable,\" Rolapp said. \"In fact, we could have gotten more money in the short term, it could be argued, if we would have done that. But we really are committed to a reach model and free television.\"\n\nStaying power\n\nMuch of this, of course, assumes that the NFL can continue to bring those live audiences well into the next decade.\n\nAnother risk to the league's long-term popularity is the concussion crisis. Amid lawsuits from former players, the league has vowed to make the game safer. This could mean changes in equipment and more rules that restrict bone-jarring hits.\n\n\"To the extent the NFL tries to pass new rules to reduce the force of hitting or the kind of hits you can make, I think it hurts the game,\" Zimbalist said. \"And there signs that parents no longer want their children playing this game. I don't mean to predict doom for the NFL. I don't think there is doom, but the notion that they're going to get to $25 billion seems to be excessively optimistic. I would not bet on that figure.\"\n\nRolapp, the Harvard-educated NFL executive, says the league maintains a \"healthy paranoia\" about all perceived risks, including pushing too much product onto fans. In the meantime, the NFL plans to stick to a simple formula.\n\n\"We're really in the business of aggregating America around events and around our game,\" Rolapp said. \"There are fewer and fewer places that can do that. If you can aggregate audiences, you are going to be more and more valuable.\"\n\nFollow Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer.

How is Rutgers faring in its 2018 recruiting?\n\nAfter a slow start, the Scarlet Knights have picked up commitments from several three-star recruits. But they’ve lost too many recruits, especially to Boston College and Penn State. They have a lot of work to do.\n\n2. How lucrative is the new Big Ten television contract?\n\nThe six-year media rights deal is worth $2.58 billion, with ESPN and Fox to air its football games. Their deal with the Big Ten Network (which the conference owns 49 percent) was extended until 2032.\n\nOFFENSE:North Jersey's all-time best college football players\n\nDEFENSE:North Jersey's all-time best college football players\n\n3. How does Rutgers coach Chris Ash’s contract compare with other Big Ten coaches?\n\nOnly Indiana’s new coach Tom Allen makes less than Ash, who Rutgers will pay $2.1 million in his second season. Allen’s contract ($1.795M) pales in comparison to the $9 million Michigan reportedly is paying Jim Harbaugh in 2017.\n\n4. What Rutgers’ connection helped Tennessee recruit Jarrett Guarantano?\n\nCurrent Vols coach Butch Jones was a graduate assistant at Rutgers from 1980-82 when Guarantano’s father Jim was a star wide receiver. His son, a redshirt freshman from Bergen Catholic, will start the season as Tennessee's backup quarterback.\n\n5. What’s to become of former Rutgers quarterback Michael Dare?\n\nAfter not playing a down in two years at RU, the former Elmwood Park star is attending Lackawanna (Pa.), a junior college power. Dare would have two years of eligibility if he transferred to a Division 1 program.\n\nRUTGERS' HOT SEAT:5 players, coaches to watch as 2017 season begins\n\n6. Which sons of former Giants players are being heavily recruited?\n\nHoward Cross III, son of Howard Jr., is a 235-pound junior defensive lineman at St. Joseph, and R.J. Oben, son of Roman, is a 230-pound junior defensive end at St. Peter’s Prep. Rutgers has made offers to both players.\n\n7. How intense was the football recruiting of Yankees slugger Aaron Judge?\n\nHigh-profile programs such as Notre Dame, UCLA and Michigan were interested before Judge decided on baseball at Fresno State. Most programs wanted him as a tight end, but a few thought Judge, who weighed 240 pounds then, could be a wide receiver.\n\n8. What’s the college football connection to Yankees hitting coach Alan Cockrell?\n\nCockrell was the first true freshman to start at quarterback for Tennessee and was a two-year starter before suffering a career-ending knee injury. As an outfielder, Cockrell was named to Tennessee’s All-Century baseball team.\n\n9. How important has Chris Partridge been to Michigan’s recruiting efforts?\n\nVery important. The former Paramus Catholic head coach recruited many of the 21 four-star players in the incoming class, which is ranked as the fifth best in the country. Partridge was named recruiter of the year by 247Sports.\n\n10. Which parts of the country are hot beds of recruiting by Army?\n\nTwenty of the incoming freshmen are from Georgia and Texas. John Trainer, a senior running back from Harrington Park, and Juwan Griffith-James, a junior defensive lineman from Bergenfield, are two of three Knights from New Jersey.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/investing/dow-stock-market-bonds-earnings-today/index.html", "title": "Dow drops more than 500 points as bond yields rise and earnings ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Wall Stree t had another day in the red at the start of this shortened trading week as investors grapple with earnings seasons and rising Treasury bond yields.\n\nAll three major indexes spent the entire day sharply lower.

You can sign up for free right here.\n\nTwo newspapers owned by Gannett, one in Indiana and one in Ohio, have humanized the new American reality about abortion now that Roe v. Wade has been reversed. And in doing so, they have highlighted the inhumanity of some partisan punditry.\n\nOn July 1, the Indianapolis Star reported that a 10-year-old girl in Ohio was pregnant, and because \"the Buckeye state had outlawed any abortion after six weeks,\" the girl was brought to Indiana for an abortion. The source was Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Indianapolis, who said she had conferred with a child abuse doctor in Ohio.\n\nNo further details about the girl or the alleged rapist were obtainable, even though some news outlets tried. In recent days, after President Biden cited the news report and denounced Ohio's abortion ban, many conservative media outlets and Republican office-holders poured skepticism on the case, and some personalities flatly said they did not believe the 10-year-old existed. Rep. Jim Jordan tweeted: \"Another lie. Anyone surprised?\"\n\nYou know what's coming next. On Wednesday, the Columbus Dispatch reported that a man has been charged in the case. Police say Gerson Fuentes, 27, \"confessed to raping the child on at least two occasions.\"\n\nNone of the media outlets that sowed doubt about the case were in court for the arraignment. Hardly any of them were even in the state. The Dispatch's Bethany Bruner said she was the \"only reporter in the courtroom\" when it happened. \"This confirms that the case exists,\" she wrote on Twitter, sharing the link to her story.\n\nBruner said the Dispatch relied on public records to track down Fuentes. It's \"fitting,\" Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple said , \"that perhaps the biggest abortion story since the SCOTUS overturning of Roe v. Wade stems from regional/local newspapers, because that's where the reporting on this issue will be playing out for months and years. A brand-new test for a hollowed-out American media sector.\"\n\nThe doubters and deniers\n\nRight-wing skepticism about the case bubbled up on social media last week and boiled over after Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler wrote abou t the difficulty in confirming Bernard's account. On Monday Fox's Jesse Watters hosted Ohio's Republican A.G. Dave Yost, who said there was \"not a whisper\" of any evidence that such a crime occurred. Up until Wednesday morning, \"Yost was on a media tour casting doubt on the veracity of the story,\" and criticizing the Indianapolis Star, Vice's Paul Blest wrote . Segments on Fox also heaped suspicion on the Star's story. The WSJ's editorial board called it an \"unlikely story from a biased source that neatly fits the progressive narrative but can't be confirmed,\" adding, \"PJ Media's Megan Fox was first to point this out.\"\n\nOnce the Dispatch reported on the suspect's arrest, Fox came up with other reasons to blast the media , and Watters credited his show with putting on \"the pressure\" to find the suspect, adding, \"we are glad that justice is being served.\" He plastered Bernard's photo on screen and accused her of participating in a coverup. Then his guest attacked the Indy Star and its \"abortionist movement.\" One hour later, Tucker Carlson strongly implied that the identity of the suspect was shrouded in secrecy because, in Carlson's words, \"apparently the rapist was an illegal alien.\" The suspect's immigration status is now the focus of right-wing media coverage.\n\nThere are so many untold stories\n\nFor more on this awful episode, check out NPR's new report by David Folkenflik and Sarah McCammon. They wrote that it \"illustrates the high stakes of both the new legal landscape on abortion and of reporting in an age of deep political polarization and mistrust of major news outlets.\"\n\nThe Dispatch is ready. Wednesday's story by Bruner and her colleagues Monroe Trombly and Tony Cook not only contains critical details from the courtroom, it includes the broader context that everyone on every side of the reproductive rights debate needs to face. Like this: \"An analysis of Columbus police reports filed since May 9 found 50 reports of rape or sexual abuse involving girls 15 years or younger.\"\n\nThat's a report almost every single day, in just one metro area, and certainly a partial count -- underscoring a vast number of untold stories. The Dispatch story also notes that \"the ability of Ohio residents to seek abortion services in Indiana could soon be curtailed,\" since Republican lawmakers in the state are expected to enact new restrictions later this summer.\n\nA 10 year old is being treated \"as a political chess piece\"\n\nEditorial writers and TV talking heads will move on tomorrow, but the people at the center of this case will be changed forever.\n\nWashington Post columnist Alyssa Rosenberg made a really important point here : \"Even if the girl in Ohio remains anonymous — and the national media attention, the arrest of her alleged rapist and his naming in the press make that seem unlikely — she will someday know that her 10-year-old self was treated not as a person the whole nation had an interest in protecting, but as a political chess piece.\" Shame on the nation, she says, \"that put a 10-year-old in the worst possible circumstances through an unnecessary ordeal, and then argued about whether she was a hoax.\"\n\nCorrection: Sarah McCammon's name was misspelled in a previous version of this story.", "authors": ["Analysis Brian Stelter", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/energy/us-oil-production/index.html", "title": "Ramping up oil production would help lower prices.

The core index, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by 6%, slightly higher than estimates of 5.9%.\n\nThose numbers sent investors reeling. Already worried about a possible economic downturn , they now fear that the Federal Reserve will recognize inflation as entrenched in the economy and increase interest rates further.\n\nThe central bank is expected to announce a half-percent interest rate hike next week, but based on this news it could decide to go higher.\n\n\"We think the US central bank now has good reason to surprise markets by hiking more aggressively than expected in June,\" wrote Barclays analysts in a research note on Friday. \"We realize it is a close call and that it could play out in either June or July. But we are changing our forecast to call for a 75 [basis point] hike on June 15.\"\n\nThe move would be historic -- the last time the Fed delivered a 75 basis point hike was in November of 1994, nearly three decades ago.\n\nAnalysts appeared to be unhappily pricing in the potential for the interest rate hike on Friday. And while many analysts feared that the Federal Reserve was doing too little too late to curb rising inflation rates, they also worry that sudden large increases in interest rates will do damage to the economy.\n\n\"The major risk to consumption, employment, and the economy overall, isn't an organic growth slowdown, but the extent to which extreme energy and food price increases could cause central banks to push against the string, and [the economy could] essentially fall into a damaging policy mistake,\" wrote Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock in a note.\n\nThe sell-off on Friday was broad in scope, with stocks in the red on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbering stocks that increased by about nine to one.\n\nThe White House conceded that Friday's inflation number was \"uncomfortably high,\" further stoking investor fears of policy action.\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers have historically focused on Personal Consumption Expenditures and not CPI as their preferred inflation measure. But core PCE also increased 0.34% in April, bringing the year-over-year figure for the measure to 4.9%. That number was down a bit from 5.2% in March but it is still elevated.\n\n\"The probability of a recession in the next year or so is rising,\" said Sung Won Sohn. professor of finance and ecoomics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist of SS Economics. \"Inflation is eating away at consumers' purchasing power.\"\n\nConsumer spending accounts for about 70% of the US economy, and a real decrease in that spending would be a huge blow to gross domestic product. \"The [Federal Reserve] now recognizes that it is way behind the curve on inflation and must act more decisively,\" said Sohn.\n\nThe Dow had its 10th down week in 11 and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq its ninth losing week in the past 10.

I will miss her terribly and cherish all the beautiful memories we have shared.\"\n\nAnne Heche was 'not expected to survive' after crash\n\nHeche had suffered burns that required the use of a ventilator to breathe.\n\nNearly a week after the accident, Heche's publicist told USA TODAY in a statement that the actor was \"not expected to survive.\"\n\n\"It has long been her choice to donate her organs and she is being kept on life support to determine if any are viable,\" the statement read, adding that Heche was being cared for at the Grossman Burn Center at West Hills hospital in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Anne had a huge heart and touched everyone she met with her generous spirit,\" the statement said. \"More than her extraordinary talent, she saw spreading kindness and joy as her life’s work – especially moving the needle for acceptance of who you love.\"\n\nPolice investigated Anne Heche's blood for possible drug/alcohol use\n\nPolice investigated Heche for driving under the influence of drugs when she crashed. Detectives with a search warrant took a sample of Heche's blood and found narcotics in her system, LAPD spokesman Officer Jeff Lee told The Associated Press.\n\n“As of today, there will be no further investigative efforts made in this case,” the department announced Friday. “Any information or records that have been requested prior to this turn of events will still be collected as they arrive as a matter of formalities and included in the overall case. When a person suspected of a crime expires, we do not present for filing consideration.”\n\nHeche was alone in the car and no one in the house was injured. The person living in the home was identified to USA TODAY as Lynne Mischele by her attorney, Shawn Holley. Mischele was a longtime renter of the house, the lawyer said.\n\nHolley provided a statement on behalf of Mischele, saying she was \"devastated\" as she and her pets \"almost lost their lives.\" She said she lost all of her property, including items of \"profound sentimental value,\" in the fire.\n\nAnne Heche's acting career, including 'Another World' and 'Donnie Brasco'\n\nAn Ohio native, Heche rose to fame playing twins Vicky and Marley Hudson on \"Another World\" from 1984 to 1992, earning a Daytime Emmy Award for younger actress in a drama series.\n\nIn the late 1990s, she became one of the hottest actors in Hollywood, a constant on magazine covers and in big-budget films. She co-starred with Johnny Depp in 1997′s “Donnie Brasco,” Tommy Lee Jones in 1997′s “Volcano,” Harrison Ford in 1998′s “Six Days Seven Nights,” Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Phoenix in 1998′s “Return to Paradise” and with an ensemble cast in the original 1997 “I Know What You Did Last Summer.”\n\nAnne Heche's life before near-fatal wreck:Mental health struggles and Ellen DeGeneres romance\n\nAnne Heche and Ellen DeGeneres' relationship\n\nAs her star was on the rise, Heche said her career suffered when she started dating comedian Ellen DeGeneres in the late '90s.\n\nWhile competing on \"Dancing With the Stars\" in 2020, Heche recalled meeting DeGeneres at a 1997 Vanity Fair Oscars party – a \"night that changed my life forever.\"\n\n\"I was in a relationship with Ellen DeGeneres for 3½ years, and the stigma attached to that relationship was so bad that I was fired from my multimillion-dollar picture deal, and I did not work in a studio picture for 10 years,\" she said.\n\nHeche also recalled wanting to bring DeGeneres as her date to the premiere for her disaster picture \"Volcano,\" but Fox studios executives balked.\n\n\"I was told if I took Ellen I would lose my Fox contract,\" said Heche, and DeGeneres urged caution. \"At that moment she took my hand and said, 'Do what they say.' I said, 'No, thanks.'\"\n\nHeche said she took DeGeneres to the premiere anyway, and \"was ushered out by security before the movie even ended, and I was told I was not allowed to go to the after party for fear they would get a picture of me with a woman.\n\n\"It was unbelievable. She was warning me this is going to happen.\"\n\nAnne Heche hospitalized in critical condition after fiery car crash in Los Angeles\n\nIn 2000, soon after the two broke up, Heche was hospitalized after knocking on the door of a stranger in a rural area near Fresno, California. Authorities said she had appeared shaken and disoriented, and spoke incoherently to the residents.\n\nDeGeneres tweeted her condolences Friday.\n\n\"This is a sad day,\" she said. \"I'm sending Anne's children, family and friends all of my love.\"\n\nAnne Heche detailed mental struggles in her memoir\n\nIn her memoir, “Call Me Crazy,” Heche talked about her lifelong struggles with mental health and a childhood of abuse.\n\nAnne Heche tested for drugs and alcohol after fiery car crash, police say\n\nDespite the setbacks, Heche continued to work, mostly in television, appearing on shows like \"All Rise,\" \"Chicago P.D.,\" \"The Brave,\" \"Ally McBeal\" and \"The Michael J. Fox Show,\" among others. She also co-hosted the podcast “Better Together,\" described as a celebration of friendship.\n\nHeche's latest role was in The Weeknd's HBO series \"The Idol,\" starring Depp's daughter, Lily-Rose Depp. The show has not yet premiered.\n\nHeche also finished filming Lifetime movie \"Girl in Room 13,\" which is still set to air Sept. 17, network representative Theresa Black told USA TODAY.\n\nThe film is \"important\" to Heche, executive VP and head of Lifetime programming Amy Winter said while discussing the project during a panel for the TV Critics Association,, as it brings \"attention to the appalling issue of human sex trafficking.\"\n\nAfter Heche split from ex-husband Laffoon, she welcomed a second son, Atlas, with actor James Tupper in 2009.

I always thought they came in oysters,” he said.\n\nPearls do indeed grow in clams and several other mollusks. In this case, the clam was a northern quahog grown by Cherrystone Aqua Farms in the Chesapeake Bay. Salt Air staff confirmed the origin of the clam, and Ballard Clams and Oysters spokesman Tim Parsons confirmed the species.\n\nQuahogs produce non-nacreous, porcelain-like pearls, according to the Gemological Institute of America. They are rarely spherical, and buttonlike specimens such as Overland’s are the most common. They range in color from white to brown to many shades of purple.\n\nParsons said he hears reports of diners finding pearls in their clams or oysters two or three times a year.\n\n'We need to hurry!':Georgia high school football players rescue trapped woman from car crash\n\nMetal in pizza?

The fifth-generation shellfish company has multiple sites in the bay.\n\n“We’ve had some guys that have worked for the company a long time, over 20 years, that have two or three (pearls),” Parsons said.\n\nFor Overland, the “craziest part\" of his story was that he nearly sent the clams back because they came with a pepper garnish. His wife isn’t a fan of peppers.\n\n“I guess sometimes you get rewarded for not being a pain at restaurants!” he said.\n\nOverland plans to have the pearl appraised but may hold on to it.\n\n“It’s a fun story and a fun memory.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/15/delaware-beach-guide-locals-guide-rehoboth-lewes-dewey-more/9940503002/", "title": "Delaware beach guide: A local's guide to Rehoboth, Lewes, Dewey ...", "text": "For a long time, Delaware's beach towns seemed to have their own distinct identities definitively carved out.\n\nFamilies and the LGBTQ community ran Rehoboth Beach, hard-charging partiers drank in Dewey Beach and the older crowd at \"Delaware's Quiet Resort\" enjoyed being in bed early in Bethany Beach.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}]}

Brian Kemp are seeking to quash a subpoena for the Republican’s testimony before the Fulton County grand jury, asserting that he was being pursued for “improper political purposes.”\n\nIn a local court filing made public as another high-profile witness, Rudy Giuliani had finished an hours-long session with the special grand jury investigating interference in the 2020 election, Kemp’s attorneys asserted that local prosecutors had “engineered the governor’s interaction with the investigation to reach a crescendo in the middle of an election cycle.”\n\nKemp’s attorneys argued that the governor had agreed to a “voluntary” July 25 interview but claimed that interview was canceled and a subpoena issued after Kemp’s lawyers inquired about the scope of the interview.\n\n-Kevin Johnson\n\nLawyers say ‘no’ to defending Trump: Report\n\nSince the Aug. 8 search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, Trump and his allies have scrambled to put together a team of top-notch defense lawyers – but they keep being told “no,” the Washington Post reported.\n\n“Everyone is saying no,” a prominent Republican lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Post.\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating Trump in connection with statutes related to the Espionage Act, record mismanagement and obstruction, according to a warrant authorizing the search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump spokesman Taylor Budowich told USA TODAY that the lead legal counsel regarding the search of his home are Jim Trusty and Evan Corcoran, asserting the pair have litigated “some of the most complex cases in American history.”\n\n“President Trump is represented by some of the strongest attorneys in the country, and any suggestion otherwise is only driven by envy,” Budowich said.\n\n– Ella Lee, David Jackson\n\nPence says he would 'consider' testifying before Jan. 6 committee if asked\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he would consider testifying before the House Jan. 6 committee if asked –– some of his most direct and extensive remarks on the subject.\n\n\"If there was an invitation to participate, I would consider it,\" Pence said at a New Hampshire event that were broadcast on NBC News.\n\nThe former vice president expressed constitutional concerns about testifying before the committee, noting that it would be \"unprecedented in history\" for a vice president to be called to testify before Congress.\n\nHowever, it wouldn't be the first time a president or vice president had testified before a congressional committee.

Because we won the state.\"\n\nIn an prior interview with USA TODAY, Willis said that she expected to make a decision on whether to bring criminal charges by the end of the year.\n\nThe subpoena request for Giuliani described the former New York mayor's wide-ranging attempts to invalidate the state's election results in testimony before the Georgia state Senate.

This was shortly after Rowling received a death threat for tweeting her outrage at the stabbing of Salman Rushdie.\n\nIn response, Rowling told The Times that trans rights advocate Harris had “consistently failed” to defend female authors who disagreed “with her personal position on gender identity ideology”, and allowed women to be intimidated into silence.\n\nWhat did Harris say?\n\nThe row erupted after Rowling tweeted her support for Rushdie after he was seriously injured in an attack in New York on Friday. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, received a message that said “don't worry, you are next”.\n\nHarris then tweeted her death threats poll, with the response options being “Yes”, “Hell, yes”, “No, never” and “Show me, dammit”.\n\nThe tone of the Twitter poll, said the Daily Mail, suggested that the Society of Authors chair had some “scepticism” over “how serious the threats were”.\n\nHow has Rowling responded?\n\nRowling told The Times that she had “received no communication whatsoever from Harris expressing sympathy for the death and rape threats I’ve received”.\n\nShe added that Harris had “consistently failed to criticise tactics designed to silence and intimidate women who disagree with her personal position on gender identity ideology and has said publicly, ‘Cancel isn’t a dirty word. We habitually cancel things we no longer want.’\n\n“I find it impossible to square the society’s stated position on freedom of speech with Harris’s public statements over the past two years and stand in solidarity with all female writers in the UK who currently feel betrayed by their professional body and its leader,” said Rowling, who has faced widespread condemnation over her views on gender identity.\n\nHarris fired back that she was “wholly against threats of any kind, to anyone, regardless of their politics, opinions or views. That includes J.K. Rowling, or anyone whose opinions I might sometimes disagree with.\n\n“Some of you may have noticed the volume of harassment I get on a regular basis from certain gender-critical people. This is entirely because I signed a letter supporting trans rights three years ago. I still support trans rights. The same people are behind this latest stunt.”\n\nIn a series of tweets Harris said she had deleted the poll as she felt she had “got the tone wrong”, and replaced it with a new version as she felt it is “important to see the extent of this problem”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/952945/dominic-cummings-vs-boris-johnson-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-perplexing", "title": "Dominic Cummings vs. Boris Johnson: the rise and fall of a 'doomed ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Liz Cheney , the most ardent Republican critic of Donald Trump in Congress, vowed to carry on her fight against the former President and the election-denying movement he leads in a speech Tuesday night after conceding defeat in her primary .\n\n\"This primary election is over,\" Cheney said in her speech. \"But now the real work begins.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, she told NBC's \"Today\" show that she is \"thinking about\" running for president and will make a decision in \"the coming months.\"\n\nThe last of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump's second impeachment to face voters, Cheney now becomes the eighth who will not be returning to Congress next year. Her loss, though widely anticipated, represents a significant marker in the wider fight over the direction of the Republican Party. Once considered an up-and-comer, Cheney was booted from House GOP leadership last year over her unyielding opposition to the former President and trailed in polling back home this year as she helped lead the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThough she made no announcement about her plans Tuesday night, Cheney did hint at a future in elective politics.\n\n\"The great and original champion of our party, Abraham Lincoln, was defeated in elections for the Senate and the House before he won the most important election of all,\" she said. \"Lincoln ultimately prevailed, he saved our union and he defined our obligation as Americans for all of history.\"\n\nOvernight, the Cheney campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called \"The Great Task.\" This is the first of several next steps from Cheney, an adviser told CNN, as she starts to make good on ideas expressed in her election night speech and opens a new chapter in the wake of her landslide defeat. The name of the PAC is a historic nod to Lincoln who spoke at Gettysburg of the \"great task\" facing the country.\n\nCheney's attempt at projecting dignity in defeat in her election night speech was itself a clear rejoinder to Trump's behavior since losing the 2020 election.\n\n\"No House seat, no office in this land is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,\" she said. \"Our republic relies upon the goodwill of all candidates for office to accept, honorably, the outcome of elections. And tonight, Harriet Hageman has received the most votes in this primary. She won. I called her to concede the race.\"\n\nTrump-backed Harriet Hageman speaks to supporters on election night in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nDespite her conservative credentials and party pedigree, her role as Trump's chief GOP critic on Capitol Hill made her a heavy underdog in a state the former President won with nearly 70% of the vote in 2020. His enduring popularity there, coupled with Cheney's role as vice chair of the January 6 committee, made the three-term congresswoman and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney a top target of Trump allies.\n\nCheney said American democracy faced an existential threat -- that \"our survival is not guaranteed\" -- calling out Republican efforts at the state level to decertify 2020 election results and GOP midterm candidates who have already begun to cast doubt on future votes.\n\n\"If we do not condemn the conspiracies and the lies, if we do not hold those responsible to account, we will be excusing this conduct and it will become a feature of all elections,\" she said. \"America will never be the same.\"\n\nTrump's grip on the GOP has been proven again and again since he left Washington. With Wyoming's vote in, Cheney becomes the fourth House Republican who voted to impeach Trump to lose her primary. Four others were not running for another term. The two survivors to date, in California and Washington, benefited from their states' nonpartisan primary system. Cheney had no such cushion, though a late push for Democrats and independents to register for the GOP primary might have somewhat softened the ultimate count.\n\nLeading Republicans on Capitol Hill had coalesced around Hageman, who has embraced Trump's false election fraud claims and called the 2020 contest \"rigged.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, another Hageman supporter, on Monday said during an appearance on Fox News that the election in Wyoming was \"going to be a referendum on the January 6 committee.\"\n\nCheney on Tuesday also addressed the recent search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, denouncing the former President's efforts to sow anger among his supporters and potentially endanger FBI agents involved in the raid by releasing some of their names.\n\n\"That was purposeful and malicious. No patriotic American should excuse these threats or be intimidated by them,\" she said. \"Our great nation must not be ruled by a mob provoked over social media.\"\n\nAs Cheney issued a dire warning in Jackson, Hageman, at her victory rally hours east in Cheyenne, thanked Trump and congressional Republicans for their support.\n\n\"Wyoming has shown today is that while it may not be easy, we can dislodge entrenched politicians who believe they've risen above the people they are supposed to represent and serve,\" Hageman said.\n\nIn a post to his own social media platform, Trump crowed over Cheney's loss, calling it \"a wonderful result for America,\" before denouncing her as \"spiteful\" and \"sanctimonious.\"\n\n\"Now she can finally disappear into the depths of political oblivion where, I am sure, she will be much happier than she is right now,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSarah Palin looks to make a comeback in Alaska\n\nSarah Palin, former governor of Alaska, during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Dallas, Texas, US, on Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022.\n\nWhile Cheney may have been cast into her party's wilderness, a prominent figure from the GOP's recent past is hoping to return from more than a decade off the electoral map. Former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, whose ascent marked a precursor to the party's Trump era, returned to the ballot on Tuesday.\n\nIn this new iteration, she was the Trump-endorsed candidate in a three-deep field vying to fill the remainder of the late GOP Rep. Don Young's at-alarge House seat. But no candidate will secure a majority of the vote in that race, CNN projects, which means it'll head to a ranked-choice voting tabulation that is scheduled to start on August 31.\n\nPalin, who resigned as governor in 2009, squared off with Nick Begich III, the Republican scion of the state's most storied Democratic family, and former Democratic state Rep. Mary Peltola, who was endorsed by independent Al Gross after he dropped out of the race despite also making the final four.\n\nThose three special election contenders were also running in a concurrent primary to determine who will advance to the November general election to fill the at-large House seat for the next full term. All three will advance, CNN projects, along with Republican Tara Sweeney, a former assistant secretary for Indian affairs at the US Interior Department.\n\nGOP senator who voted to convict Trump faces voters\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski outside the Senate chambers on July 21, 2022.\n\nWhile Cheney's fate in Wyoming has grabbed the most headlines, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who voted to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial, was also facing new competition this year fueled by her lack of fealty to the former President. Unlike Cheney, however, Murkowski -- herself the latest in a proud statewide political dynasty -- was a better bet to overcome the forces arrayed against her.\n\nThat's in large part due to Alaska's new nonpartisan top-four primary, which, like in the House race, sends the top four candidates to the general election, which will be decided by a ranked-choice vote if no one receives a majority.\n\nMurkowski, Republican Kelly Tshibaka and Democrat Patricia Chesbro will advance to the November election, CNN projects, against a fourth candidate yet to be determined. The top-four system is expected to aid Murkowski against the Trump-backed Tshibaka, who's the former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Administration.\n\nMurkowski has in the past enjoyed broad support, across partisan lines, in a state that elected her father, Frank Murkowski, first to the Senate and then as its governor. He then appointed his daughter to her current position in 2002. When she was defeated in a 2010 Republican primary during the tea party wave, Murkowski launched a write-in campaign and defeated GOP nominee Joe Miller in the fall.\n\nIn the governor's race, Republican Gov.

Trump proxy battle\n\nThe Republican primary for Alaska Senate is as much about former President Donald Trump’s rivalry with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as it is about the two candidates on the ballot.\n\nFor months Trump has been heckling McConnell, calling the GOP leader an “Old Crow” who got “played like a fiddle” after Senate Democrats successfully pushed through their health care, tax and climate package.\n\nThe former president is also holding a grudge against incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a McConnell ally who was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict him during his impeachment trial. As a result she is facing Trump-backed Kelly Tshibaka, who has also pledged she won’t support McConnell to hold the majority leader position should the GOP regain the Senate this fall.\n\nThe Alaska primary mirrors the Wyoming GOP contest, where Rep. Liz Cheney, another Trump antagonist, was defeated on Tuesday.\n\nBut unlike Cheney, who was kicked out of House Republican leadership, Murkowski has retained the support of Senate GOP chiefs and its political establishment.\n\nIn April, for instance, McConnell’s super PAC — the Senate Leadership Fund — dropped $7 million in ad buys for Murkowski.\n\n— Phillip M.

Rand Paul of Kentucky, said in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nOne of Cheney’s soon-to-be former colleagues, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, kept things short: “Girl, BYE!”\n\nSen. John Barrasso, of Wyoming, tried a more diplomatic approach, saying Cheney’s opponent, Harriet Hageman, will join the state’s federal delegation to make up a “strong, conservative, and effective team for the people of Wyoming.”\n\nThe Trump critics didn’t remain silent, however.\n\nFormer Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele quoted Cheney’s concession speech where she pledged to do everything to keep Trump from returning to the White House.\n\n“With every fiber of my being,” Steele said in a tweet Tuesday. “Sign me up for that mission!

We can educate the country.\"\n\nOther Cheney backers in the smallish crowd – a few hundred – declined to be interviewed, or refused to give their names.\n\nAs the sun set behind the Teton mountains, the Cheney backers drifted away, while the staff urged members of the media to pack up and leave.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhy Trump targeted Cheney (partly):Cheney: Committee, DOJ could each make Trump criminal referrals in connection with Jan. 6\n\nTrump celebrates Cheney defeat\n\nDonald Trump couldn't wait to crow about Liz Cheney.\n\nAfter congratulating Harriet Hageman \"on her great and very decisive WIN in Wyoming,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post that Cheney \"should be ashamed of herself, the way she acted, and her spiteful, sanctimonious words and actions towards others.

I called her to concede the race. This primary election is over but now the real work begins.”\n\nCheney again denounced Trump for \"lies\" about the 2020 election, and indicated she would work against other Republican \"election deniers\" who are seeking offices across the country in this year's election.\n\nThe three-term lawmaker did not allude to a presidential campaign of her own in 2024, nor did she discuss in detail her ongoing work on the Jan. 6 congressional committee investigation.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nHageman, once a Cheney supporter, defeats the incumbent\n\nHarriet Hageman, a trial lawyer and Trump ally who challenged the Cheney political dynasty, defeated the incumbent congresswoman in one of the most-watched House Republican primaries in the country.\n\nHageman’s win was expected, coming days after a University of Wyoming poll showed Rep. Liz Cheney trailing by 29 points.\n\nBut they weren’t always political foes. Hageman campaigned for Cheney during previous congressional runs, calling her a “friend” and “constitutional conservative” who could fight for Wyoming.\n\nIn this cycle, it was Cheney’s commitment to the constitution that the congresswoman said would cost her a seat. She said she knew her loss was imminent when she put her oath of office above loyalty to former President Trump.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nWhy she did it:Republican Rep.

Liz Cheney, the highest profile Trump GOP target this primary season, has lost her primary to Trump-endorsed challenger Harriet Hageman, CNN and NBC projected.\n\nTrump singled out Cheney after she voted to impeach him over the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021. Trump and Hageman also criticized Cheney for working on the Jan. 6 congressional committee investigating the attack.\n\nCheney promoted her disdain of Trump throughout the campaign, saying Republican Party members in Wyoming and across the country need to move on from volatile and oft-investigated ex-president.\n\nHageman, an attorney and one-time supporter of Cheney, said during the campaign that the House member first elected in 2016 was more interested in pursuing Trump than in serving the needs of Wyoming voters.\n\n–- David Jackson\n\nHageman takes huge lead; Cheney backers brace; no call yet\n\nAs expected, Harriet Hageman has taken a huge lead over Liz Cheney in the Wyoming race, though the Associated Press and the networks have not yet projected a winner.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCheney plans speech on democracy, win or lose\n\nHundreds of supporters have gathered in Jackson for what many expect to be a concession speech - a unique one.\n\nCheney is expected to deliver an address about the threat to the country posed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nSignaling her approach in remarks with reporters earlier today, Cheney said democracy itself is at stake.\n\n“Those of us across the board – Republicans, Democrats and independents – who believe deeply in freedom and who care about the Constitution and the future of the country, I think, have an obligation to put that above party,\" Cheney said after casting her vote in Jackson\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow it happened:How Liz Cheney went from Trump backer and GOP leader, to his fiercest critic and GOP outcast\n\nHow have House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump fared?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's vow to seek revenge on the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him for alleged incitement of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack is being tested in key primary elections this season.\n\nThe second House impeachment vote against Trump was the most bipartisan ever when those 10 Republicans defected from their party and joined with 222 other House Democrats to impeach him.\n\nTrump has dedicated much of his post-presidency to purging the GOP of anyone he sees as disloyal.\n\nFour of those 10 Republicans are retiring from Congress, while the other six faced re-election bids, including primaries in which Trump often loomed larger than their actual opponent.\n\nTonight, one of those Republicans, Wyoming Rep.

How are they faring now?\n\nPolls close in Wyoming; Cheney and Hageman await results\n\nThe voting is over in Wyoming, as U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and Donald Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman await their fates.\n\nRecent polls established Hageman as a favorite, but Cheney hopes enough Democrats and independents cross over to the Republican primary to make things interesting.\n\nThis is probably the most watched race of the night, another test of Trump's dominance within the Republican Party.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nWho is Kelly Tshibaka?\n\nA former Alaska state official who has the endorsement of Donald Trump will try to unseat Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski on Tuesday.\n\nRepublican-supported Kelly Tshibaka and Murkowski are both expected to advance beyond Tuesday's primary in Alaska's new voting system.\n\nKelly Tshibaka was born and raised in Alaska. She received a bachelor's degree from Texas A&M University in 1999 and earned a law degree from Harvard University in 2002.\n\nHer father worked as a union electrician and her mother as one of the first workers at the startup of Alaska’s largest oil field, according to her campaign website.\n\n-- Merdie Nzanga\n\nRead more about her:What to know about Kelly Tshibaka, who is trying to unseat Alaska GOP Sen.

The rest have lost or declined to seek reelection.

How have things gone for them since?\n\nFlashback:Senate acquits Trump in historic second impeachment trial over Capitol riot\n\nAlaska voting changes could help Murkowski\n\nIn Alaska, winner-take-all party primaries, like the one Cheney is facing, have been replaced by a voter-approved process in which all candidates are listed together. The four who get the most votes, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election in which ranked voting will be used.\n\nMurkowski benefits from avoiding a Republican primary, “which she would have had a zero percent — I mean zero percent — chance of winning,” said Alaska pollster Ivan Moore.\n\nMurkowski was censured by Alaska Republican Party leaders last year over numerous grievances, including the impeachment vote and speaking critically of Trump and her support of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s nomination.\n\nTuckerman Babcock, a former state Republican Party chair who is running for state Senate, said Murkowski has lost the support of many Alaska Republicans, which he called a “political reality over a record of many years.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nDouble Palin on Alaska ballot\n\nSarah Palin is on the ballot twice in Alaska: once in a special election to complete Young’s term and another for a primary for a full two-year House term starting in January.\n\nVoters approved an elections overhaul in 2020, ending party primaries and instituting ranked voting in general elections. Endorsed by Trump, Palin finished first among 48 candidates to qualify for a special election. They were seeking to replace Young, who died in March at age 88, after 49 years as Alaska’s lone House member.\n\nPalin is now trying to secure the win against the No. 2 and 4 finishers, Republican Nick Begich and Democrat Mary Peltola. The third-place vote-getter pulled out of the race after the special primary.\n\nThe House primary, meanwhile, has 22 candidates, including Palin, Begich and Peltola.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEarlier this year:Sarah Palin has early lead in Alaska special primary for U.S. House seat\n\nA voter theme in the Cheney-Hagerman race: No comment\n\nJACKSON, Wyo. – The most frequent comment that voters have made about the Liz Cheney-Harriet Hageman race is ... no comment.\n\nMany voters said they did not want to discuss the primary because it has brought harassment from people who don't share their opinion of Cheney, Hageman, or, especially, Donald Trump.\n\nThe political tensions of the Trump era have come to Jackson Hole, much to the dismay of residents of a community that prides itself on being a laid-back mountain-and-forest resort.\n\n\"It's not good to be anti-Trump in this state,\" said a voter who would identify herself only as Deborah. \"And I don't want to be a target.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nMurkowski and Palin show deepening fissures in GOP\n\nWASHINGTON – The almost continual daylight in Alaska this month is revealing more than the state's sweeping mountains and shorelines. It's also showing the deep fissures in the Republican Party.\n\nTwo candidates on the ballot for two different offices – Sen. Lisa Murkowski and former Gov. Sarah Palin – represent a growing divide in the GOP that is largely decided by a candidate's allegiance to former President Donald Trump. Murkowski is fighting off a Trump challenger. Palin is fighting as a Trump challenger.\n\nMurkowski is a moderate Republican who has crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats on some big issues. In February 2021, she was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote in favor of convicting Trump during his second impeachment, drawing ire from the former president and others in her party. She is the only one of the seven on the ballot this year.\n\nPalin, once John McCain's running mate in 2008, leans to the far right. She has been in lock step with Trump and joined him and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell last month at a \"Save America\" rally in Anchorage. After the FBI search last week of the former president's Florida residence, she called the country's top law enforcement agencies \"dangerous thugs.\"\n\nWho else is in Jackson Hole? Liz Cheney nemesis Kevin McCarthy\n\nLiz Cheney isn't the only prominent member of Congress in Jackson Hole on this primary Tuesday.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who turned on Cheney during her battle with Donald Trump, is reportedly hosting a two-day fundraiser in Teton Village, Wyo. That's about 10 miles from Jackson, where Cheney is expected to address supporters about her primary battle with Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman.\n\n10 Republicans voted to impeach Trump:Will any be left in Congress after November?\n\nNBC News reported that McCarthy would be in Wyoming on Monday and Tuesday \"raising money for both the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund.\"\n\nOther Republican lawmakers who now oppose Cheney are also at the resort where McCarthy is holding court, according to news reports. (So is Elon Musk, reportedly.)\n\nMcCarthy, who is hoping to become speaker of the House after the midterm election, initially supported Cheney after she voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6. He later changed his mind and backed Cheney's expulsion from House GOP leadership over the Trump issue.\n\nCheney said McCarthy sold out to Trump and is part of the problem Republicans face moving forward.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAnother break between Cheney and GOP: criticism of FBI\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., called out fellow Republicans on Thursday for their criticism of the FBI in the hours and days after its agents searched the Florida home of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I have been ashamed to hear members of my party attacking the integrity of the FBI agents involved with the recent Mar-a-Lago search. These are sickening comments that put the lives of patriotic public servants at risk,\" Cheney tweeted on Thursday, shortly after Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke at the Justice Department about the search.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday denounced the threats circulating online against federal agents and the Justice Department, calling them \"deplorable and dangerous.\"\n\nRead the whole story:GOP Rep. Liz Cheney criticizes Republicans 'attacking the integrity of the FBI'\n\nBracing for results in Wyoming\n\nJACKSON, Wyo. – Liz Cheney's political world, based in this valley resort town, is bracing for the worst – largely because Wyoming as a whole has become Donald Trump country.\n\nTrump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman is heavily favored to win the Republican primary for Cheney's U.S. House seat and end Cheney's three-term congressional career.\n\n\"It will be closer than most people think, but I think Hagesman will win ... unfortunately,\" said Hal Wheeler, 40, the owner of a bicycle shop in the quaint western-themed downtown of Jackson.\n\nHageman supporters said that Cheney, in her zeal to get Trump, has ignored the needs of people in Wyoming, on issue ranging from energy production to drug abuse.\n\n\"I think she went clear overboard,\" said Dan Winder, 69, a local property manager who stood in a long line at the Teton County administration building to cast an early vote for Hageman. \"She represents Wyoming – she's not representing Liz Cheney.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPreviously:Trump glued to TV, Secret Service fears, Cheney forecasts 'dam' break: Takeaways from the Jan. 6 hearing\n\nAlaska's new ranked choice voting system\n\nIn the 2020 general election, Alaskans voted to rid their elections of partisan primaries, instead implementing a ranked choice voting system across all parties.\n\nThe new system has lowered the stakes in races like Alaska's Senate primary, where incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is all but guaranteed one of four spots in the November general election.\n\nTwo other candidates, Trump-backed Republican Kelly Tshibaka and Democrat Pat Chesbro, are expected to make the cut for the fall general election, the Anchorage Daily News reported.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nLearn more:Alaska to use final-four primary, ranked-choice general election for Congress.

Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., tweeted actor Kevin Costner's endorsement of her, noting \"real men put country over party.\"\n\nCheney, who has been in the spotlight for her position on the House Jan. 6 committee investigating the Capitol attack and her criticism of former President Donald Trump, tweeted a photo of Costner in a T-shirt that read \"I'M FOR LIZ CHENEY.\"\n\n– Merdie Nzanga\n\nEndorsement count:Liz Cheney gets Kevin Costner's endorsement and adds, 'real men put country over party'\n\nLiz Cheney: Democracy is 'under attack and under threat'\n\nLiz Cheney showed up at the polls Tuesday with a special guest – father and former Vice President Dick Cheney – and a special message: Win or lose this primary, the fight for democracy goes on.\n\nSpeaking briefly with reporters, Cheney said that, win or lose, the primary is the only the start of a long-term battle for the future of democracy and against her nemesis, Donald Trump.\n\nIt is “certainly the beginning of a battle that is going to continue to go on,\" Cheney told CBS News. \"And as a country, we’re facing a moment where our democracy really is under attack and under threat.”\n\nThe Cheneys stood in line with other voters before casting ballots in a primary in which Liz Cheney is a decided underdog.\n\nDick Cheney made a much-discussed ad during the campaign, saying: “In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who has been a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\"\n\nAfter casting her ballot, Cheney tweeted: \"Proud to cast my ballot today. The challenges we are facing require serious leaders who will abide by their oath and uphold the Constitution- no matter what.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMoney likely won't help Cheney win Wyoming primary\n\nMany elections are won by the best-funded candidate, but the money hasn't shown signs of helping Cheney.\n\nThrough June 30, Cheney raised $11.3 million, and Hageman raised $3.7 million. That’s $15 million in a state with about 280,000 registered voters. And yet, a July 15 poll from the Casper Star Tribune showed Cheney 22 points behind Hageman and an Aug. 11 University of Wyoming survey found that just over one quarter of GOP primary voters support incumbent candidate Cheney.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Cheney received 76% of her donations from large donors, and 73% were from out of state residents and political actions committees, or PACs, which are often formed to raise money for a candidate or group of candidates.\n\nHageman is getting 40% of her donations from Cowboy State residents and PACs. Hageman also has more pull with small donors, who make up 43% of her donations, a signal of grassroots support.\n\n– Erin Mansfield, Ella Lee\n\nMore campaign finance news:Trump PAC formed to push debunked voter fraud claims paid $60K to Melania Trump's fashion designer\n\nWho is Harriet Hageman, Cheney's Trump-backed opponent?\n\nWyoming lawyer Harriet Hageman is the leading Republican challenger for Cheney’s congressional seat. She unsuccessfully ran for governor of Wyoming in 2018.\n\nA former supporter of Cheney, having donated to her 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns, Hageman unsuccessfully ran for governor of Wyoming in 2018 and sat on the Wyoming state Republican committee until announcing her challenge to Cheney.\n\nThe main difference between the two candidates is their relationship with Trump. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to vote for Trump’s impeachment over his alleged incitement of a riot, and she lost her spot as head of the House GOP conference after refusing to endorse the former president’s false claims of election fraud. Hageman, on the other hand, has Trump's endorsement and is vocal in her support of him.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nWhere are they now:10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump.

Liz Cheney and former President Donald Trump will play out Tuesday as Cheney faces Trump-backed lawyer Harriet Hageman for the state's sole House seat.\n\nCheney — whose leadership on the Jan. 6 House committee and persistent criticism of Trump has landed her on the former president's political hit list — is not expected to win the race.

Liz Cheney's uphill battle to keep her seat in Wyoming's GOP primary on Tuesday underscores how Donald Trump's hold on the Republican Party is tightening even as the former President's legal challenges are mounting. That dynamic poses stark choices for the thin band of Republican elected officials and voters resistant to his dominance within the party.\n\nIf Cheney loses Tuesday, as expected, the result will place an exclamation point on a summer that has seen Trump-backed candidates, almost all of whom echo his falsehoods about the 2020 election, win most hotly contested party primaries. Virtually no GOP elected officials have dared to criticize him over damaging revelations either from the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, or the Justice Department investigation of his handling of classified information\n\nTrump's muscle-flexing has dashed the expectations, or maybe the hopes, of many conservative commentators who took his losses in several late May Georgia primaries as evidence that his influence was waning. Instead, by rejecting multiple opportunities to move away from the former President, both Republican officials and voters in the three months since have sent an unmistakable message to Trump skeptics that they remain the subordinate minority in the party.\n\n\"There is no lane in the Republican Party that is viable for [a] Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, or Mike Madrid,\" Madrid, a long-time strategist who has become one of Trump's sharpest Republican critics, told me. \"The party is never going to go back to what it was.\"\n\nAnd that means, in the near term at least, there's a hard choice facing the leaders and voters in the GOP coalition who view Trump as a threat to American democracy. Do they continue to support a party that remains in thrall to him or launch a more direct attack against his influence, even if that helps Democrats in the 2022 and 2024 elections?\n\nMany Trump critics are expecting Cheney's remarks on Tuesday night, if she loses, to signal her intention to rally such an anti-Trump effort as a contender in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, and perhaps even into the general election as an independent candidate if the party nominates Trump again.\n\nGeorgia was an aberration\n\nBreathless reports of Trump's allegedly eroding position in the GOP have appeared all year, particularly after his nemeses in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, easily defeated the primary challengers he recruited to run against them. Axios , in a reaction typical of the response at the time, declared those results \"cast doubt on the 2020 election's continued salience for GOP voters — and may presage his weakened lock on the party.\"\n\nThose claiming the GOP was moving beyond Trump pointed to both objective and subjective shifts: growing interest among some party activists and donors in a possible 2024 candidacy from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis less obsessive coverage of Trump's every word at Fox News, polls showing some decline in the share of Republican voters who wanted him to seek the presidency in 2024, and occasional defeats through the primary season for some of his preferred candidates, such as his scandal-tarred choice in the Nebraska governor's race.\n\nYet over the summer, both Republican leaders and voters have sent a very different message. On both fronts, recent events have underlined Trump's continuing preeminence --to the point where experts who study democracy see growing parallels between the contemporary GOP and the compliant parties that have been subjugated by authoritarian-minded strongmen in other countries, such as media mogul and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey.\n\n\"The GOP is a party now dominated by authoritarian dynamics,\" Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history at New York University and author of the 2020 book \"Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,\" told me. \"It is so domesticated and subjected by Trump to this authoritarian style discipline that there is no space within the party for dissenters.\"\n\nThat shift has been evident both in election results and the behavior of elected GOP officials.\n\nLike any political leader, Trump has not delivered victory for every candidate he has endorsed. Candidates who have kept their distance from his false fraud claims about the 2020 election have won some GOP nominations this summer, including contests for attorney general in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and secretary of state in Kansas.\n\nBut candidates endorsing Trump's discredited claims about 2020 have experienced a remarkable run of success, often defeating candidates backed by more mainstream Republican leaders. Election deniers rode his endorsements to a clean sweep of all the top GOP nominations in Arizona (including governor, attorney general, secretary of state and US senator), surging past contenders supported by outgoing Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTrump-backed election deniers likewise swept the top nominations in Michigan (for governor, attorney general and secretary of state). Earlier this month, Trump's choice for Wisconsin governor, construction executive Tim Michels, muscled past former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch (who herself had called the 2020 election \"rigged\" and had the support of Pence and former Gov. Scott Walker) for the GOP nomination. Trump-backed election deniers this summer also won gubernatorial nods in Kansas and Maryland as well as the secretary of state nod in Nevada.\n\nrecent CNN tally found that at least 20 GOP nominees out of this year's 36 gubernatorial races have questioned or outright dismissed the 2020 election results, with the final tally expected to rise as the last nominations are completed. Election deniers have won 10 GOP nominations for secretary of state, another CNN compilation found.\n\nIn a parallel push, Trump has eviscerated the ranks of the House Republicans who voted for his impeachment after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Of the 10 Republicans who voted for Trump's impeachment, four have retired, three have already lost GOP primaries (including two in contests on August 2) and Cheney, who has trailed in poling behind Trump-backed election denier Harriet Hageman, is likely to join the ranks of the ousted on Tuesday. Only two of the 10 have won primaries to advance to the November midterms (Dan Newhouse in Washington and David Valadao in California both finished in the top two in their states' primary systems in which candidates of all parties run together.)\n\nAt the same time, GOP elected officials, almost without exception, have locked arms to defend Trump amid ethical and legal questions. Hardly any GOP elected leaders have expressed concern about the many damaging revelations about his behavior unearthed by the House January 6 committee and his broader efforts to overturn the 2020 result. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- who, like fellow Sens. Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz, has morphed from a Trump antagonist in the 2016 presidential primary election into an unstinting defender -- set the tone early on when he dismissed the committee as a \"circus\" and \"garbage\" before it had held a single hearing.\n\nIn a recent interview with Chicago television, Kinzinger, the other Republican beside Cheney on the January 6 committee, acknowledged that the silence of GOP leaders showed that Trump, at least for now, had \"won\" the battle for control of the Republican Party. \"Maybe there wasn't going to be a tidal wave of people to come over, but I certainly didn't think I'd be alone,\" said the Illinois Republican, who is not running for reelection this fall.\n\nThe rush of GOP leaders to defend Trump after the FBI executed the search warrant on his Florida mansion -- even before any information was available about what the FBI was seeking -- has offered another measure of his dominance. Once again, Rubio set the pace for abject devotion: \"Using government power to persecute political opponents is something we have seen many times from 3rd world Marxist dictatorships. But never before in America,\" Rubio tweeted the day of the search.\n\nOnly after an apparent Trump supporter attacked an FBI office in Ohio last week -- and violent threats against federal law enforcement proliferated on the right --- did some Republicans ( including Rubio ) qualify their criticism with denunciations of violence or praise for federal law enforcement.\n\nInternational parallels suggest GOP loyalty to Trump isn't fading anytime soon\n\nCheney's likely defeat on Tuesday will cap these demonstrations of strength from Trump. To experts who study authoritarian movements, it follows a pattern evident in other countries.\n\nBen-Ghiat notes that in Italy, Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, remained firmly in his grip for years despite an unending succession of financial, political and sexual scandals reminiscent of Trump's travails. As she wrote in her book \"Strongmen,\" Berlusconi's \"personality cult left Forza Italia no space to develop a political identity independent of him and no respite from his endless judicial woes, scandals and loyalty tests.\"\n\nShe sees the same dynamic hardening into place among Republicans. \"Since January 6 [2021], the party has become way more radicalized,\" she told me. \"When parties make these bargains with these charismatic demagogues they stick with them to the bitter end.\"\n\nSusan Stokes, director of the Chicago Center on Democracy at the University of Chicago, sees another international parallel to the GOP's continuing deference to Trump. \"The case that jumps to mind,\" she told me, \"is Erdogan and his party, the AKP in Turkey, where you have a very charismatic, persuasive leader who always has a narrative to explain things that, to our eyes, is super crazy but he gets people to believe it.\"\n\nLike Ben-Ghiat, Stokes says the international precedents leave her skeptical that the GOP will reject Trump's direction -- or even move away from Trump personally -- any time soon. Madrid likewise agrees that Republicans critical of Trump must recognize that his forces unequivocally remain the party's ruling faction. \"What we are witnessing right now is just the calcification of the establishment as he has taken over the party,\" Madrid says. \"You cannot buck this party\" and win primaries inside the GOP except in rare cases, he adds.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that Republicans resistant to Trump's direction have no leverage over the GOP's direction, Madrid argues. Depending on how it's asked in polling, somewhere around one-fifth to one-fourth of self-identified Republican voters (and sometimes more) reject Trump's lies about the election, believe he acted improperly on January 6 or in how he contested the 2020 result or that his statements encouraged violence before the insurrection.\n\nMadrid says that if even about half of those voters withheld their support from Republican office-holders enabling Trump, or from Trump himself if the GOP nominates him again in 2024, the party could not survive those defections in a general election. \"There is really no leverage within the party for these 20% of Republicans,\" he says. \"There is leverage in the general election because they essentially will have veto power\" over whether a Republican can win the White House in 2024.\n\nLike many Republicans opposed to Trump, Madrid wants and expects Cheney to run in the 2024 GOP presidential primary to try to coalesce the minority of party voters resistant to the former President into a more unified faction. If the GOP nominates him again, Madrid and like-minded Trump-skeptics argue, Cheney should try to siphon away right-leaning voters who would find it difficult to vote for a Democrat by running as a conservative independent in the general election. If Cheney provides \"a banner to rally around,\" Madrid predicts, the critical sliver of traditionally Republican-leaning voters -- many of them college-educated suburbanites who defected from Trump in 2020 in key states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona -- would grow larger in 2024.\n\nOther Trump critics aren't as certain that a Cheney independent general election bid, if it came to that, wouldn't do more to help than hurt the former President by dividing the voters hostile to him.\n\nThe larger issue may be that the GOP's choice to double down on its commitment to Trump, even as multiple probes into his actions uncover new evidence, underscores how much of the party's leadership and base alike have fully enlisted into his efforts to destabilize American democracy.\n\n\"Where do you go with that?\" asks Stokes. \"I don't see where you go except in the direction of complete constitutional crisis, stalemate and violence. That's a really scary thought.\"", "authors": ["Analysis Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/politics/wyoming-alaska-primary-election-takeaways/index.html", "title": "Six takeaways from primaries in Wyoming and Alaska - CNNPolitics", "text": "Jackson, Wyoming (CNN) Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney , who since the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol has become the Republican Party's most forceful critic of former President Donald Trump, was ousted from her House seat by Trump-backed Harriet Hageman , CNN projected Tuesday.\n\nIn Alaska , voters cast ballots in another race the former President is focused on, with Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski squaring off in the first of two rounds against the Trump-endorsed Kelly Tshibaka.\n\nFormer Gov. Sarah Palin, meanwhile, is attempting a political comeback in a special election for the state's lone House seat.\n\nHere are six takeaways from Tuesday's contests in Wyoming and Alaska:\n\nTrump caps his purge of intraparty rivals\n\nTrump and his allies have spent the spring and summer turning Republican primaries across the political map into bitter fights in which loyalty to the former President was the central factor.\n\nHe lost some high-profile battles, including in Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger held off Trump-back challengers.\n\nBut in most open-seat races, Trump's candidates triumphed. And on Tuesday in Wyoming , Trump, who had endorsed Hageman on the day she entered the race against Cheney, claimed his biggest victory yet.\n\nCheney is now the eighth of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump following the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol to exit the House. Four have opted not to seek reelection, and four more have lost GOP primaries.\n\nRepublican congressional candidate Harriet Hageman waves, along with her husband, John Sundahl, during her election night party in Cheyenne, Wyoming, on August 16, 2022.\n\nCheney chose to go down fighting Trump\n\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday's primary , Cheney insisted she was trying to win.\n\nBut her strategy -- attempting to convince the Republican electorate in a state the former President won by a margin of 43 percentage points in 2020 to turn on him -- suggests she'd made a different choice: to go down swinging.\n\nShe infuriated Republicans by urging Wyoming Democrats and unaffiliated voters to switch their party registration and vote in Tuesday's GOP primary.\n\nSurrounded by US Capitol Police officers on the campaign trail, Cheney opted for small, private events over rallies. She lambasted Trump in television interviews.\n\nHer campaign's closing message was a TV ad featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, calling Trump a \"coward\" who lies to his supporters and \"tried to steal the last election\" using violence.\n\nHer election night event, on a ranch in Jackson Hole with the sun setting over the Grand Tetons in the background, didn't feature any television screens for supporters to watch results tabulated in a race Cheney was all but certain to lose.\n\nShe told supporters that she could have cozied up to Trump and did what she'd done in the primary two years earlier: win with 73% of the vote.\n\n\"That was a path I could not and would not take,\" Cheney said. \"No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Watch what Liz Cheney told supporters after conceding primary Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch what Liz Cheney told supporters after conceding primary 03:12\n\nCheney's decision to use the spotlight of her high-profile House primary to tee off on Trump was never a winning one in Wyoming. But it did endear her to a segment of anti-Trump donors and position her as the GOP's most strident critic of Trump.\n\nWhat's next for Cheney?\n\nThe three-term congresswoman has not been definitive about her next political moves . On Wednesday, she told NBC's \"Today\" show that she is \"thinking about\" running for president and will make a decision in \"the coming months.\" And following her loss, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called \"The Great Task\" -- a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the \"great task\" facing the country.\n\nCheney used her election night speech to preview a continued fight against Trump, without laying out exactly what that means.\n\n\"I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it. This is a fight for all of us, together,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm a conservative Republican. ... But I love my country more. So I ask you tonight to join me: As we leave here, let us resolve that we will stand together, Republicans, Democrats and independents, against those who would destroy our republic.\"\n\nAs she left the stage, Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" blared over the event's speakers.\n\nWaiting on Alaska special election result\n\nPalin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee who has not run for office since then, is attempting a political comeback in the special House election to fill the remaining months of the late GOP Rep. Don Young 's term.\n\nBut it will take weeks to sort out whether she wins the runoff election against businessman and fellow Republican Nick Begich III and Democratic former state lawmaker Mary Peltola.\n\nThe special election is Alaska's first using the state's new ranked-choice voting system. CNN projected that none of the three candidates will receive more than 50% of the vote in the first round, meaning that the state will tabulate second-choice votes on August 31.\n\nThe ranked-choice system could prove problematic for Palin, whose decision to quit midway through her one term as governor, in 2009, still angers many of the state's voters. Begich III, the Republican scion of Alaska's most famous Democratic political family -- his grandfather Nick Begich was the state's congressman until his plane disappeared in 1972, and his uncle Mark Begich was a senator -- is seeking to capitalize on that hardened opposition to Palin.\n\nThe top four candidates from a wide-open June special primary advanced to the runoff. But one of those candidates, independent Al Gross, later dropped out of the race, a decision that likely boosted Peltola, who is seeking to make history as the state's first Alaska Native in Congress.\n\nJUST WATCHED Palin: McCain's presidential campaign had 'shackles on me' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Palin: McCain's presidential campaign had 'shackles on me' 04:50\n\nA second race for the same seat\n\nAt the same time that Alaska was filling its at-large House seat in Tuesday's special election, the state held a primary for November's general election for a full term for the same seat. Palin, Begich III and Peltola will all advance to another top-four runoff, CNN projected, along with Republican Tara Sweeney, an Alaska Native backed by the state's powerful Native-owned corporations who served as assistant secretary for Indian affairs at the US Interior Department during the Trump administration.\n\nOther key races to watch in Alaska\n\nTrump has also set his sights on Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who was among the seven Republican senators who voted to convict him during his second impeachment trial. Trump is backing former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner Kelly Tshibaka; he traveled to the state to hold a rally for Tshibaka in July.\n\nHowever, Alaska's nonpartisan primary system -- like the House race, the top four finishers, regardless of party, advance to the general election -- means that both Murkowski and Tshibaka will advance to the general election, CNN projected . Democrat Patricia Chesbro will also advance, and a fourth candidate has not yet been projected.\n\nIn another competitive top-four primary in Alaska, the current governor, Republican Mike Dunleavy, and his independent predecessor, Bill Walker, will both advance to the general election, alongside Democrat Les Gara, CNN projected . The fourth candidate has not yet been projected. Walker, who was elected in 2014 but dropped his 2018 reelection bid to back a Democrat who lost to Dunleavy, is supported by some Democrats and moderate Republicans who tout his decision to expand Medicaid and his opposition to restrictions on abortion rights.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/politics/why-liz-cheney-lost/index.html", "title": "How Liz Cheney lost Wyoming's lone seat in the House - CNNPolitics", "text": "Jackson, Wyoming (CNN) Rep. Liz Cheney's supporters say her reelection hopes were doomed on January 13, 2021, when a week after the insurrection at the Capitol, she and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach former President Donald Trump.\n\nEverything since that day -- Cheney's role on the House select committee investigating the insurrection; her ads featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, eviscerating Trump; her speeches attempting to steer the GOP away from Trump's influence -- only served Harriet Hageman's victory in Wyoming's primary for its lone House seat on Tuesday.\n\nCheney's ouster caps a summer in which Trump has purged the GOP of many of his critics, while elevating candidates -- including Hageman -- who have parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Trump-aligned candidates have won primaries for governor in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Senate in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Candidates backed by the former President have positioned themselves to take over the election machinery in a series of key states if they win in November.\n\nPrimaries in recent months have also brought into focus the role a handful of prominent Republicans, including Cheney and former Vice President Mike Pence, are seeking to play in moving the GOP beyond Trump and his election denialism.\n\nBut Wyoming's results on Tuesday demonstrated the long odds those Trump critics face in a party in which the former President remains the most dominant figure and is teasing a third run for the White House in 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Cheney following her primary loss, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to divulge the contents of the conversation. Bloomberg was first to report the call.\n\nCheney attempted to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate and anti-Trump Republicans -- many of them ideological opponents of the neoconservative congresswoman before the last 19 months -- to save her seat. Her campaign sent information to registered Democrats in Wyoming about how to change their party registration, and in interviews across the state in the lead-up to the election, a number of Democrats did say they were voting for Cheney.\n\nBut the Cowboy State's electorate is almost entirely Republican. Wyoming has more than 215,000 registered Republicans compared to just 36,000 registered Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state's office . That's a drop of about 15,000 registered Democrats from early 2021, but the pool of party-switchers, along with a fall-off of more than 3,000 independent voters who likely became Republicans, was nowhere near large enough to save Cheney from defeat in a Republican Party that had turned against her.\n\n\"I think she stood up for what she believes in,\" said John Grant, a Republican who cast his ballot for Cheney, even though he suspected she would fall short. \"It took a lot of courage to stand against the Republican Party and Donald Trump.\"\n\n'Uneasy from the beginning'\n\nThe roots of Cheney's loss were planted long before Tuesday's primary. And in some cases, the seeds were planted during the factional battles within the Wyoming GOP that date back to the tea party era, when Cheney was still a resident of Virginia.\n\nThe state's GOP, with no real competition from Democrats, has divided into two factions, with a more moderate establishment wing butting heads with a more conservative faction that has increasingly wrested away control.\n\nThe establishment wing retains some power in Wyoming. Gov. Mark Gordon, a part of that wing, won Tuesday. But the conservative faction has seized control of the state Republican Party and many of its local organizations.\n\n\"In Wyoming, we don't necessarily embrace the idea of a big tent,\" Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne said on Fox earlier this year.\n\nPhotos: Embattled Congresswoman Liz Cheney Photos: Embattled Congresswoman Liz Cheney US Rep.

Hide Caption 31 of 31\n\nWyoming Republicans' reservations about Cheney were first evident in 2016, when she won her House seat after winning just 39% of the vote in the GOP primary against a fractured field. She was cast as too close to the establishment by some rivals, and as a carpetbagger by others -- including Tim Stubson, a former state lawmaker who now supports Cheney.\n\nBut, she was by far the best-known candidate in the race thanks to the decade her father spent representing Wyoming in Congress prior to becoming secretary of defense and later, vice president.\n\nCheney had coasted to reelection since then, largely because she had not broken with conservatives on major issues. Stubson said she was on course to do so again, until the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, when Cheney became a leading critic of Trump's actions and defender of the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nThe makings for a divorce from Cheney were immediately evident. Though Wyoming's GOP has been fractured by warring factions, one thing that has broadly united those factions is support for Trump. He won Wyoming in 2020 by 43.3 percentage points over Biden -- Trump's largest margin of victory anywhere in the nation.\n\n\"Yes, there may have been an undercurrent there of anti-Liz sentiment, but there is no way she would have had any trouble getting elected,\" Stubson said.\n\n\"Her relationship with that portion of the party has been uneasy from the beginning, and they probably never totally embraced her because she has been the definition of an establishment Republican. But she was right on the policies,\" he said. \"In my mind, it's a sort of binary issue: If she votes for impeachment, it doesn't matter what she does afterward.\"\n\nVoters say Cheney was too focused on Trump\n\nWhile Trump's shadow loomed large over the race, conversations with voters across Wyoming over the last week often came across with a sense of disappointment in Cheney, more than a burning sentiment of anger. Several people said they felt Cheney devoted far more time on national issues -- to the detriment of her focusing on energy and natural resource priorities of critical importance to the state.\n\n\"I want Wyoming to be protected and I don't feel Liz is doing that job,\" said Jenille Thomas, who lives in the coal-mining town of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming.\n\nFor many Republican voters in Wyoming, though, it was Cheney's vote to impeach Trump that spurred them to action.\n\nEsther Egan, a 68-year-old who cleans houses and lives in Jackson, said she voted for Hageman because Cheney \"bailed on us when we need her the most.\"\n\n\"They can say whatever they want about Trump, but he did a damn good job. And then she turns tail,\" Egan said. \"She's with Nancy Pelosi.\"\n\nCatherine Norsworthy, a 68-year-old homemaker in Jackson, said she switched from being an unaffiliated voter to a Republican to vote for Hageman, citing Trump's endorsement of her.\n\n\"I'm not in favor of the January 6 hearings at all,\" she said. \"I didn't like her voting against Trump. I'm very pro-Trump. I listen to him.\"\n\nU.S. Representatives Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Elaine Luria (D-VA) listen during a public hearing of the U.S. House Select Committee to investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., July 21, 2022.\n\nGoing down swinging\n\nCheney was by far the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans to vote in January 2021 for Trump's impeachment. She revealed her decision to do so the day before the House vote, saying in a statement that Trump \"summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.\"\n\nThe retribution she faced within the GOP built over the following months. In May 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly endorsed removing Cheney from her position as the No. 3 spot in the party's leadership team.\n\nThat same month, the House GOP removed Cheney from her leadership post on a voice vote.\n\nShe followed the ouster by telling reporters , in a preview of how she would approach the following year and her reelection campaign: \"I will do everything I can to ensure that the former President never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.\"\n\nIn July 2021, Cheney accepted a position as one of two Republicans, along with retiring Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAs the committee conducted its probe, Trump set his sights on revenge, endorsing challengers to most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him.\n\nTrump's biggest target was Cheney. He endorsed Hageman , a former Republican National Committee member and lawyer who had once been a Cheney ally, on the day she entered the race in September 2021.\n\nFor the most part, Trump's efforts have succeeded. Four of the 10 have retired. Three more, in addition to Cheney, lost their primaries. Only two survived their primaries, and California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse did so in part because their states hold all-party open primaries.\n\nAs those retirements piled up and those primaries unfolded, Cheney was busy playing a leading role on that committee, in its interviews of former Trump administration officials and in its public hearings in which the panel has revealed some of its findings.\n\nShe has also sought out opportunities to confront the GOP's direction. She delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and her party's leadership in a late June speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\n\"We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before -- and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,\" Cheney said then . \"And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.\"\n\nWeeks after that speech, Cheney was elusive when asked about the possibility of running for president in 2024. She told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that she will \"make a decision on 2024 down the road.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Kasie Hunt earlier this month, Cheney made clear she would not temper her criticism of Trump at all -- even if it costs her the House seat that her father once held and that she has held since 2017.\n\n\"We're in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he's lied to them,\" she said . \"And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.\"\n\nEven as polls showed Cheney was on her way to a resounding defeat, she stuck to a message focused squarely on Trump.\n\nHer campaign bought ad time on Fox for a spot featuring Dick Cheney, in which he called Trump a \"coward\" who lies to his supporters and \"tried to steal the last election\" using violence.\n\nRepublican candidate U.S. Representative Liz Cheney speaks during her primary election night party in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. August 16, 2022.\n\nWhat's next\n\nIt didn't take long for the outcome of Tuesday's primary to become clear. Cheney had been badly defeated, and conceded the race to Hageman quickly.\n\nShe told supporters that she'd won the primary with 73% support two years ago, and \"could easily have done the same again.\" But doing so, she said, would have required embracing Trump's lies about election fraud.\n\n\"That was a path I could not and would not take,\" Cheney said.\n\n\"No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,\" she said.\n\nAfter a primary that Cheney and her allies knew she was set to lose, the question is, what's next for the Wyoming congresswoman who had in a short time rocketed up the House Republican ranks?\n\nShe did not answer that question Tuesday night, at her election night event on a ranch in Jackson Hole. But overnight, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called \"The Great Task\" -- a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the \"great task\" facing the country. And on Wednesday morning, she told NBC's \"Today\" show that she is \"thinking about\" running for president and will make a decision in \"the coming months.\"\n\nIn her election night speech, Cheney previewed a continued fight against Trump: \"I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it. This is a fight for all of us, together.\"\n\n\"I ask you tonight to join me: As we leave here, let us resolve that we will stand together, Republicans, Democrats and independents, against those who would destroy our republic,\" she added.\n\nAs she left the stage, Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" blared over the event's speakers as the sun set over the Grand Teton mountain peak.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/13/politics/harriet-hageman-wyoming-primary-liz-cheney/index.html", "title": "Harriet Hageman: From Liz Cheney friend to foe, Trump's candidate ...", "text": "Rock Springs, Wyoming (CNN) Harriet Hageman proudly wears Wyoming on her sleeve -- and wields it like a hammer against Liz Cheney.\n\n\"I know Wyoming. I love Wyoming. I am Wyoming,\" Hageman tells audiences as she travels across her state, entering the closing days of a bitter Republican duel in one of the highest-profile congressional races in the country\n\n\"I am going to reclaim Wyoming's lone congressional seat from that Virginian who currently holds it,\" Hageman likes to say, casting aside the Cheney family's deep roots in the state and suggesting the three-term congresswoman is more at home in the Washington suburbs.\n\nThese days, signs of trouble for Cheney are easy to spot here in Wyoming. Hageman holds a commanding lead in the final weekend of a primary election that stands as yet another reminder of the Republican Party's evolution in the era of Donald Trump.\n\nA University of Wyoming poll released this week found that Cheney is trailing Hageman by 29 points. Yet one question looming over the Republican primary is how many Democrats and independents will switch parties and vote for Cheney, which even her supporters acknowledge is her only chance to stay competitive.\n\n\"If it's a big Republican vote, there aren't enough Democrats to change it, even if we all crossed over,\" former Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan said in an interview Friday, noting that he is among the Democrats who have temporarily switched parties to support Cheney. \"Out of honor and respect for her leadership, I cast my vote her way.\"\n\nThe venom in the Cheney-Hageman race comes alive in conversations with voters, dueling television ads and reports of stolen yard signs. Their relationship wasn't always acrimonious, when Hageman stood alongside Cheney and showered her with praise during Cheney's first bid for Congress in 2016.\n\n\"I am proud to introduce my friend Liz Cheney,\" Hageman said then. \"I know Liz Cheney is a proven, courageous, constitutional conservative, someone who has the education, the background and experience to fight effectively for Wyoming on a national stage.\"\n\nToday, that national stage is starkly different than it was six years ago, back when Cheney and Trump were elected on the same day. Now, the former President is at the center of her political fall in a state where he won 70% of the vote, his widest margin anywhere.\n\nHe traveled to Wyoming three months ago to put his stamp on the race.\n\n\"Liz, you're fired,\" Trump told thousands of admirers at a rally in Casper. \"Wyoming deserves a congresswoman who stands up for you and your values, not one who spends all of her time putting you down and going after your president in the most vicious way possible.\"\n\nEmphasizing ties to state\n\nYet here in Wyoming, Hageman is seen as far more than Trump's hand-picked candidate.\n\nShe grew up on her family's small ranch near Fort Laramie, population 207, not far from the state's border with Nebraska. Long before her fight with Cheney, Hageman gained prominence as a natural resources attorney, specializing on cases protecting the state's water, public lands and agriculture.\n\n\"One of the things, I think, we need to do is make the federal government largely irrelevant to our everyday lives,\" Hageman told voters this week during a stop at the Rock Springs Chamber of Commerce luncheon, highlighting decades of legal work fighting against such policies as protecting gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act and broader plans of national forest conservation.\n\nHageman, 59, spent most of her career doing this work at her own law firm in Cheyenne. But now, she is a senior litigation counsel for the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a group based in Washington that battles environmental regulations, taxes, campaign finance restrictions and far more.\n\nShe has spent much of the last year driving around the state to build a campaign against Cheney, telling voters that she's traveled about 40,000 miles since announcing her campaign nearly a year ago. Yet in the final week of the primary here, she had no public campaign events, rather meeting privately with groups.\n\nHageman declined to answer questions when CNN caught up with her in Rock Springs, a coal mining town in the southwestern part of the state, saying only: \"This race is about Wyoming, nothing else.\"\n\nThe race, of course, has become about far more. But several Wyoming voters this week said they appreciated the attention Hageman was devoting to energy, agriculture and other issues of direct importance to the state.\n\n\"We voted for Harriet,\" said Scott Vetter of Carpenter, who works in agriculture sales. \"When you dive into the work that she's done, it's been stellar. She's close to agriculture, which is our bread and butter, and what we do to make a living.\"\n\nHe said he and his wife voted early, insisting it wasn't a knock against Cheney, but an affirmative vote for Hageman and her intense focus on Wyoming issues. He said Trump's endorsement was not the decisive factor in his decision.\n\n\"We're not Trump lovers, but we're not Trump haters,\" Vetter said, talking during the Laramie County Fair. \"We just want to get the country moving again. I would say Harriet had our votes from the beginning.\"\n\nHageman made an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2018. Even though she placed third in the Republican primary, the race elevated her profile across Wyoming. She went on to represent the state on the Republican National Committee, a position she resigned when she announced her campaign to challenge Cheney last year.\n\n'We're fed up with Liz Cheney'\n\nHageman has sought to capitalize on the anger among Trump loyalists -- much of which is directed at Cheney and her leading role in the Congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n\"We're fed up with the January 6 commission and those who think they can gaslight us,\" Hageman told a cheering crowd at the Trump rally in Casper in May. \"And we're fed up with Liz Cheney.\"\n\nFor her part, Hageman has wavered about the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nDuring a contentious debate in June, Cheney pressed her rival, saying: \"I think that she can't say that it wasn't stolen because she's completely beholden to Donald Trump. And if she says it wasn't stolen, he will not support her.\"\n\nIt wasn't until last week, during a campaign stop in Casper, that Hageman fully embraced the former President's baseless election denial rhetoric.\n\n\"Absolutely the election was rigged,\" Hageman said. \"It was rigged to make sure that President Trump could not get reelected.\"\n\nWhat Hageman doesn't tell her audiences is that she once opposed Trump -- and supported Ted Cruz in 2016. She was among the final wave of Republicans hoping to block Trump from clinching the party's nomination at the GOP convention in Cleveland.\n\nIt's a sign of her own transformation -- from Cheney ally to Trump loyalist -- with her sights now set on Washington.\n\n\"I will be taking that fight to DC,\" Hageman said, \"just as soon as I defeat Liz Cheney.\"", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny", "Chief National Affairs Correspondent"], "publish_date": "2022/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/25/liz-cheney-wyoming-republican-primary/10098801002/", "title": "Liz Cheney is up for reelection in Wyoming.

She was one of two Republicans to join the committee and one of just ten to vote to impeach Trump.\n\nConceding defeat, Cheney said she could have “easily” won the election if she had been willing to side with the former president over claims the 2020 election was rigged. Instead, she declared that “no office in this land is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect” and said she would “do whatever it takes” to stop Trump from becoming president for a second term in 2024.\n\n‘A rising Republican star’\n\nCheney was once seen as a “rising Republican star” but after becoming “her party’s most dogged Trump detractor” she has found herself as an outlier, wrote Shane Goldmacher in The New York Times (NYT).\n\nHer landslide defeat shows the “remarkable degree” to which Donald Trump has control over the Republican Party, and is the most “revealing” indication so far of the “party’s realignment”.\n\nThe daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, she has been part of “political royalty”, said Smith in The Guardian, and her defeat to a Trump-backed candidate is a “blow to the last vestiges of the Republican Party establishment”.\n\nCheney has been one of the “most conservative lawmakers in the US” and is “far from being moderate”, said Edward Luce in the Financial Times, voting with Trump 93% of the time during his stint in the White House. Her subsequent “fixation” with bringing about Trump’s downfall has seen her become “America’s most celebrated electoral suicide”, but her ousting “begs the question: what defines today’s Republican Party?”.\n\n‘The new orthodoxy’\n\nIn the case of the current Republican Party “the extreme sets the narrative”, wrote Luce. The GOP is more “strongly motivated by what it hates than by admiration of Trump”.\n\nLike Cheney, many anti-Trump Republicans have seen themselves alienated from the party in a “cleansing of Trump critics”, wrote Goldmacher in the NYT. Trump allies are working to “censure or oust those who break with the new orthodoxy”.\n\nDespite her defeat, Cheney has “issued a rallying cry for the defence of democracy”, said The Guardian, and we should “not accept that her political career is over”.

Outside they were greeted by cheers from the crowd that well outweighed the boos. That would have been heartening for the couple, in light of so much bad press about them. Even critics of the Sussexes in the crowd that CNN spoke to gave the couple credit for being there and showing their respect for the Queen\n\nThis wasn't just their first public appearance as a couple at a royal event in more than two years, it was a major state event -- a thanksgiving for the Queen's unprecedented reign in the hallowed surroundings of St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nInside, they made their way down the long aisle, heads turning as they went along and the television cameras locked in on them to an almost uncomfortable extent.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrive for a service of thanksgiving for the reign of Queen Elizabeth II at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Friday.\n\nAnyone hoping to see rifts from the past couple of years healed in front of the cameras were left disappointed as Harry and Meghan took their seats amongst junior royals (including Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, and their husbands, with whom the Sussexes have no beef).\n\nWhat we don't know yet is whether the couple had any private meetings with Prince Charles and Prince William to resolve outstanding differences.\n\nAhead of the event, there had been plenty of speculation in the British press over how the couple would be received. But they've taken a low-key approach to their jubilee attendance which may play in their favor.\n\nOn Thursday they didn't appear in front of the cameras at all. They watched the Trooping the Colour military display from a window overlooking Horse Guards Parade. Were it not for confirmation of the pair's attendance and eagle-eyed photographers with their long-lens cameras capturing grainy snaps, they might have slipped completely under the radar.\n\nThis was clearly a visit rooted in reverence for the Queen and her historic reign. If their strategy was to avoid overshadowing the 96-year-old's milestone moment, it worked and may have gone some way to start healing that rift.\n\n\"There was this huge roar when the Sussexes arrived, real popularity. People were really thrilled to see them. There was this real closeness -- the family was together,\" CNN royal historian Kate Williams said. \"There's been a lot of negative press about Meghan and Harry and it's time to look past that and see that they were there to support the Queen.\"\n\nShe continued: \"As the Queen said in her statement when Meghan and Harry left the royal family, left as full-time royals, she said they are 'much loved' members of our family and that was very clear today.\"\n\nThe couple take their seats within St Paul's.\n\nEmily Nash, CNN royal contributor and royal editor for Hello! magazine, said it was \"huge\" to see the Sussexes back in the royal fold.\n\n\"Not least because it sends out a signal that the family is united behind the Queen and they are prepared to put whatever has happened behind the scenes behind them,\" she explained. \"Whether by accident or by design, chances are relationships are going to thaw. They're going to be able to spend some time together. Hopefully, that is going to build bridges again.\"\n\n\"But there is a lot contingent on this. We have Harry's book coming out at some point, we have the Netflix documentary -- there are all things that are going to cause concern to the royal family,\" she added. \"Whether or not, behind the scenes, these are things that are being discussed remains to be seen. But I think the very fact that they are here obviously is a cause of great pleasure for the Queen.\"\n\nIt's unclear at this point if we'll see the Sussexes again over the weekend . We're finding out day-to-day about their presence at the celebrations. But so far it looks like there has been some healing.

For more exclusive news and takes on Afghanistan and the day's biggest news, please subscribe to USA TODAY.\n\nWASHINGTON — A week after Afghanistan swiftly fell to the Taliban, the U.S. ramped up its effort to evacuate Americans from the country ahead of an Aug. 31 deadline. But a frenzied scene at Kabul's airport showed no sign of abating, as Afghans tried to escape their new government.\n\nThe government's rapid collapse on Aug. 15 came 20 years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to fight the \"war on terror\" following the 9/11 attacks. The Taliban regime that the U.S. toppled in 2001 is now back in power.\n\nCrowds of people swarmed the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, creating a chaotic and dangerous situation as they try to board planes to exit the country.\n\nThe Biden administration says it has an agreement with the Taliban for the militant group to allow the safe passage of Americans and others to the airport, but there have been reports of the Taliban harassing Americans at checkpoints.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden said the U.S. knows that terrorists – singling out ISIS-K – may seek to exploit the situation at the airport and harm innocent people: \"The security situation is changing rapidly,\" he said. \"We're under no illusions about the threat.\"\n\nHere's what has happened in Afghanistan in just one week:\n\nHow many people have been evacuated?\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that 30,000 people – Americans and Afghan allies – have been evacuated from Afghanistan since late July. Biden said Sunday afternoon that 11,000 people had been airlifted in the last 30 hours.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it is unclear how many Americans are in Afghanistan, but the president vowed that any American seeking to return home will be able to do so.\n\n\"Let me clear,\" Biden said Friday. \"Any American who wants to come home, we will get you home.\" He made that point again on Sunday.\n\n20 deaths in one week\n\nAt least 20 people have been killed in and around the Kabul airport since the Taliban takeover, a NATO official told Reuters. That includes seven people who were killed Sunday.\n\nMore:Chaos at Kabul airport raises questions about U.S. evacuation effort\n\nOn Saturday, troops from several nations tried to control the crush of people pressing to get into the airport.\n\nEarlier in the week, thousands of Afghans desperate to flee their besieged country poured onto the runways. At least seven people died in the mayhem just a day afer Afghanistan collapsed.\n\nUS commercial airlines joining evacuation efforts\n\nOn Sunday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin activated civilian planes to help the State Department with its airlift as part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement.\n\nMore:Latest from Afghanistan: US airlines activated to help evacuation, Biden will speak Sunday\n\nThe addition of 18 commercial aircraft – from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, Omni Air, Hawaiian Airlines and United Airlines – is not expected to strain commercial flights, Kirby said. Those planes will not fly into Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. \"They will be used for the onward movement of passengers from temporary safe havens and interim staging bases,\" according to Kirby's statement.\n\nBiden, military say no one predicted a collapse this fast\n\nDays after the Taliban took Kabul, Biden and the Pentagon said U.S. intelligence did not predict a rapid Afghanistan collapse. \"Not even close,\" Biden said told ABC News. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said \"nothing\" he saw indicated a collapse of the Afghan army in 11 days.\n\nYet The Wall Street Journal reported that diplomats in Afghanistan sent a classified memo last month warning Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Kabul could quickly fall after the Aug. 31 U.S. deadline to withdraw.\n\nBiden said last week there was no way to leave Afghanistan \"without chaos ensuing.\" But on July 8, the president said it was \"highly unlikely\" exiting Afghanistan would lead to a Taliban takeover.\n\nTaliban vows to uphold rights of women, but White House skeptical\n\nAfter taking over Afghanistan, the Taliban declared \"amnesty\" for government officials Tuesday and vowed to uphold women's rights under Islamic law – a pledge being viewed skeptically.\n\nPrior to the 2001 U.S. invasion, women had virtually had no rights under the fundamentalist Taliban's oppressive rule. But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid promised during a news conference last week that the militant group is \"committed to the rights of women under the system of sharia (Islamic) law.\"\n\nMore:Taliban promise to uphold rights for women and US allies, but White House is skeptical\n\nHe also said the Taliban was still working to form a government and that \"nobody will be harmed.\"\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S.won't take the group at its word but will watch its actions when it comes to human rights.\n\n“This is not about trust. This is about verify,\" Sullivan said.\n\n'It's just rubbish':Experts doubt Taliban's promises on women and girls\n\nWhy did the Afghan army not put up a fight?\n\nThe U.S. pumped more than $80 billion in equipment and training into the Afghan National Security Forces since the start of the war in Afghanistan to enable it to fight off the Taliban, But in the end, it took over with minimal bloodshed.\n\nBiden said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani assured him that the Afghan National Security Forces would fight, but \"obviously he was wrong.\" He said the Afghan army had the resources to mount a defense but lacked \"the will.\"\n\nOdds against:'Nobody should be surprised': Why Afghan security forces crumbled so quickly to the Taliban\n\nFormer military officers who served in Afghanistan said there were signs the Afghan military – unmotivated, disorganized and plagued by low morale – would struggle against the Taliban.\n\nThe army had experienced considerable attrition in recent years. Rather than dig in, soldiers calculated they couldn't defeat the Taliban, experts say. The withdrawal of U.S. military backing, particularly airstrikes, and the Taliban gaining support from Pakistan, China, Iran and Russia, left Afghan forces largely on their own.\n\nAfghan president flees country, capping rapid Taliban takeover\n\nClinching the takeover, Taliban fighters marched into Kabul on Aug. 15 and sought the unconditional surrender of the central government. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country as the Taliban said it would move further into Kabul. As of Aug. 16, he was said to be in the United Arab Emirites.\n\nFor years, U.S. and Afghan forces focused on controlling key supply chains and major cities in the country, forcing the Taliban into Afghanistan’s rugged hinterland. The Taliban remained strong in the country’s mountainous rural areas, using those regions as bases of attack to seize territory once US forces began their drawdown.\n\nThe Taliban also remained in control of strategic border crossings, allowing them to smuggle weapons and other key goods while also rejuvenating forces outside the country.\n\nAt the start of August, the Taliban controlled none of the country’s provincial capitals. Now, they are in possession of most of the country’s territory.\n\nWhy was the U.S. in Afghanistan?\n\nThe U.S. entered Afghanistan in October 2001, under President George W. Bush, in response to the 9/11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centers in New York and the Pentagon just outside of Washington.\n\nThe U.S. sought the al-Qaida militants who had planned the attack there and received support from the Taliban.\n\nThe Backstory:Why we published the 2,443 names of US soldiers who died over 20 years of war in Afghanistan\n\nBut the U.S. remained in the country for 10 more years after the death of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, who was killed in Pakistan during the Obama administration.\n\nOver the 20 years, 2,443 American soldiers died in Afghanistan.\n\nWhy did Biden decide to leave now?\n\nUnder a deal orchestrated by the Trump administration with the Taliban, the U.S. agreed to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by May 1.\n\nBiden also supported ending what he called \"America's longest war,\" and in April he announced plans to withdraw by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Under the plan, American began withdrawing troops in May.\n\n\"We delivered justice to bin Laden a decade ago, and we've stayed in Afghanistan a decade since then,\" Biden said. \"Since then, our reasons for remaining in Afghanistan are becoming increasingly unclear.\"\n\nTime 'to come home':Biden announces Afghanistan withdrawal by Sept. 11\n\nThe U.S. military presence had decreased to 2,500 soldiers in Afghanistan when Biden entered office, down from 15,500 at the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nBiden said the U.S. has accomplished its main objective of ensuring Afghanistan won't remain a base from which terrorists can attack the homeland again. He said the U.S. must shift its focus to target terrorism threats that \"have become more dispersed and metastasized around the world.\"\n\nBiden remains defiant as he takes a hit politically\n\nDespite the botched withdrawal, Biden said the decision to leave Afghanistan was the right call and he's remaining defiant, saying he wouldn't have done anything differently.\n\n\"I stand squarely behind my decision,\" Biden said last Monday. \" After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces.\n\nMore:For Biden, fallout from the Afghanistan withdrawal abroad complicates agenda at home\n\nBut recent polls have suggested that Biden has taken a hit politically from the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, with his job performance falling below 50% in multiple surveys.\n\n\"There will be plenty of time to criticize and second-guess when this operation is over. But now – now – I'm focused on getting this job done,\" Biden said Friday.\n\nContributing: Associated Press; Courtney Subramanian, Kim Hjelmgaard, Michael Collins, Matthew Brown and Katie Wadington of USA TODAY.

Instead, the expectation is that a range of administration officials and military personnel will talk about the service and sacrifice that was carried out.\n\nThe end of August will also mark one year since a bungled US drone strike killed 10 civilians, including seven children on August 29, 2021, in Kabul.\n\nA Pentagon \"after action review\" of all military efforts in Afghanistan from February 2020 to the end of August 2021 appears to have run into trouble after an initial draft prepared by outside independent experts was rejected, according to a defense official.\n\nThe draft apparently did not have the level of detail the Defense Department was seeking. \"It did not touch on specific matters we wanted,\" the official said, declining to offer specifics. It's not clear if portions of the classified work will ever be made public and how soon a new version will even be ready for internal review.\n\nIn February 2020, the Trump administration signed an agreement between the US and the Taliban on drawing down US involvement based on conditions on the ground.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ordered all troops to withdraw from the country by an end of August 2021 deadline , triggering a chaotic withdrawal just as the Taliban rapidly seized control of the country.\n\nThe after action review is expected to look at all of the elements of what happened during the total time frame -- what worked well and what did not, the official said. It is not clear how much the report will rely on previous work such as the extensive review of the bomb attack at the airport.\n\nThe Pentagon is updating its procedures on conducting non-combatant evacuations, although it's not clear how much of the work is due to what happened in Kabul.\n\nAlso unclear is when a congressionally ordered bipartisan 16-member commission on the 20 years of the war will begin any substantive work.

Bush, who has worked with special forces in Afghanistan.\n\nWardak — called Khalid by friends — and his family were unable to get inside the airport where the Taliban controlled the entrances. He was widely known because of his position as police chief in eastern Afghanistan’s Helmand province and from television appearances, including one in which he challenged the Taliban to a fight, supporters said.\n\nMcCreary said multiple allies, including the British, helped, and that Khalid, his wife and their four sons, ages 3 to 12, were “safe in an undisclosed location under the protection of the United States.”\n\nOfficials said other Afghan partners, including police and military, also deserved to be saved and that more rescue efforts were in progress, but they could not discuss details.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nPentagon: U.S. forces in communication with Taliban 'several times a day'\n\n\n\nU.S. forces are in direct contact with the Taliban outside Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport, where evacuations of American citizens and allied Afghans are underway, the Pentagon said Thursday.\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters in a briefing that Rear Adm. Peter Vasely, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, is having direction conversations with the Taliban's designated representative outside the airport \"several times a day.\"\n\n\"We remain in frequent communication with the Taliban about the facilitation of free passage and the credentialing that goes along with that,\" Kirby said of American citizens and at-risk Afghans, including special immigrant visa applicants who are trying to access the airport.\n\nPressed about reports of U.S. citizens who are unable to get to the airport gates, Kirby conceded the Pentagon didn't have a clear picture of Taliban treatment of American citizens trying to leave the country.\n\n\"I am not certain that it's not happening,\" Kirby said, noting that the Pentagon hadn't seen any reports that indicated American citizens were being stopped or harassed by Taliban fighters.\n\n\"We obviously don't have perfect visibility into what is going on outside the airport,\" he added.\n\nKirby said the Taliban indicated that people with the proper credentials will be allowed through.\n\n\"It's a very fluid situation.\"\n\n--Courtney Subramanian\n\nState Department: 6,000 waiting at Kabul airport for evacuation\n\nThe State Department has received a “small handful of reports” from Americans who haven’t been able to reach the airport in Afghanistan’s capital, department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Thursday as he updated evacuation efforts.\n\nPrice said all such reports are cause for concern, but things are “moving quite efficiently” at the airport in Kabul.\n\nHe said 6,000 people have been processed and will soon board planes. Twenty flights are expected to leave Thursday night.\n\n“Our hope is that tomorrow, we’ll be able to process even more,” he said.\n\nPrice said all Americans who have expressed an interest in leaving were contacted overnight and told to consider going to Hamid Karzai International Airport. The U.S. has been working with the Taliban, which has said Americans will receive safe passage to the airport.\n\nThe 6,000 people waiting there to board planes include American citizens, locally employed staff and some Afghans who qualify for special immigrant visas.\n\nPrice said he couldn’t break down how many people are in each category either for those at the airport or for the 7,000 who have left since Aug. 14. Those departed also include people who are citizens of countries other than the U.S. and Afghanistan.\n\nAmerican citizens and permanent residents are given the first chance to board.\n\nThe U.S. military is able to fly out up to 9,000 people a day.\n\nWhile pledging the United States will “bring home all the Americans who wish to come,” Price said he could not put a number on how many that is.\n\n“In some cases, they may opt not to come to the airport,” he said. “They may opt not to be relocated for whatever reason.”\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nTaliban kill Deutsche Welle reporter’s relative\n\nBERLIN — German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle says the Taliban shot and killed a family member of one of their reporters in Afghanistan and severely injured a second family member.\n\nThe broadcaster said in a statement on Thursday that Taliban fighters were looking for the Deutsche Welle reporter and searching homes in western Afghanistan. It said other family members managed to escape.\n\nDeutsche Well says the reporter himself, whose identity was not revealed, is already based in Germany where he is also working. Deutsche Welle didn’t give further details on the killed and injured family members or say where and when exactly in Afghanistan the killing took place.\n\nThe director of Deutsche Welle, Peter Limbourg, sharply condemned the killing, saying that, “the killing of a close family member of one of our journalists by the Taliban is incredible tragic and a proof for the imminent danger that all of our workers and their families are exposed to in Afghanistan.”\n\nHe added: “The Taliban are obviously conducting organized searches for journalists in Kabul and the provinces. Time is running out.”\n\nLimbourg added that the homes of at least three other Deutsche Welle reporters were searched by the Taliban in Afghanistan in recent days and weeks.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nExactly what US military equipment do Taliban now have?\n\nOn Tuesday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said a \"fair amount\" of military equipment the U.S. provided the Afghan National Security Forces was seized by the Taliban in the militant group's quick route of Afghanistan.\n\nSince then, officials have put more definition on that description.\n\nReuters reports that an official said, \"the Taliban are believed to control more than 2,000 armored vehicles, including U.S. Humvees, and up to 40 aircraft potentially including UH-60 Black Hawks, scout attack helicopters, and ScanEagle military drones,\" citing a current intelligence assessment.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, since 2002, the Americans have given Afghan security forces 600,000 weapons, such as rifles; 76,000 vehicles, such as Humvees; 16,000 equipment items for intelligence, surveillance like drones; and 208 aircraft.\n\nAfter seizing control of Afghanistan, the Taliban released photos of U.S. Black Hawk military helicopters at the Kandahar International Airport that the U.S. had provided the Afghan army.\n\nMore:Here's how to help people fleeing Afghanistan and the families still in the country\n\nPentagon: More than 7,000 evacuees airlifted from Kabul since Aug. 14\n\nThe U.S. has airlifted more than 7,000 evacuees from Kabul since operations began on Aug. 14, Army Maj. Gen. William Taylor announced Thursday. He estimated the total number of people moved out of Afghanistan since July is somewhere near 12,000. That includes American citizens, U.S. embassy personnel and individuals designated by the State Department, including special immigrant visa applicants and other Afghans who supported the U.S. war effort.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, 13 C-17 military planes arrived with additional troops and equipment and 12 C-17 planes left Hamid Karzai International Airport carrying more than 2,000 passengers, Taylor said. More than 5,200 troops are on the ground to assist with evacuations.\n\nThe military has the capacity to evacuate as many as 9,000 people per day, Taylor said.\n\nTaylor also announced that F-18 fighters jets are providing \"overwatch\" for American troops at the airport, should the need arise for close-air support.\n\nIn an operational update briefing, Pentagon officials emphasized there has been \"no decision to change the deadline\" of the scheduled completion of U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan on Aug. 31.\n\nVideo:US rushing troops to Kabul for evacuations\n\n\"If and where there's a decision to change that, then obviously that would require additional conversations with the Taliban as well,\" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said.\n\nTaliban militants, who overthrew the U.S.-backed government over the weekend, have seized control of Kabul outside the gates of Hamid Karzai International Airport. There are reports of civilians having difficulty reaching the airport, on the north side of Kabul, to escape the country.\n\nU.S. and Taliban commanders have reached an agreement to allow the evacuation to continue. There have been no clashes between the Taliban and U.S. forces or impeding American citizens from reaching the airport, Kirby said.\n\n“Obviously we want to see that continue,” he said.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBiden: Terrorism threat not as great from Afghanistan as elsewhere in world\n\nThe threat of terrorist groups using Afghanistan as a safe haven is not reason enough to keep military forces in the country, President Joe Biden said in an ABC interview that aired Thursday.\n\n“The threat from al-Qaida and their associate organizations is greater in other parts of the world to the United States than it is from Afghanistan,” Biden told “Good Morning America.” “We should be focusing on where the threat is the greatest.”\n\nBiden acknowledged that al-Qaida could return to Afghanistan.

Most were forced to quit their jobs and stay at home, denied access to education and health care, enduring high rates of illiteracy and maternal mortality.\n\nSince taking over Afghanistan, the Taliban has said it will uphold the rights of women, but within the norms of Islamic law.\n\nBiden told ABC that Afghan women should be helped to leave if they want out.\n\n\"I told 'em, 'Get 'em on the planes. Get them out. Get them out. Get their families out if you can,'\" Biden said of the women trying to leave the country.\n\nBut the United States can’t send troops to every part of the world where women are being subjugated, he added. Instead, Biden said, nations can use economic, diplomatic and international pressure to help women.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nRelated:Taliban promise to uphold rights for women and US allies, but White House is skeptical\n\nMcConnell, McCarthy push Biden for answers\n\nRepublicans are pushing the Biden administration for answers.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a joint letter to President Joe Biden late Wednesday, asking for a classified briefing on the situation on the ground in Kabul.\n\nThey say the Gang of Eight – leaders from both political parties in the House and Senate, plus bipartisan leaders of both chambers' intelligence committees – should receive details on the following: the number and location of Americans in Afghanistan, the status of talks with the Taliban to ensure Americans' safety, the White House's plan to evacuate remaining Americans and more.\n\n\"We all share in the desire to see Americans safely returned home, and we hope to gain clarity as to the means and methods for accomplishing that goal,\" the letter states.\n\nWhat went wrong in Afghanistan?:Perspectives on the 'forever war' from those who saw it up close\n\nProtesters push Taliban, who try to suppress dissent\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan - Afghan protesters defied the Taliban for a second day Thursday, waving their national flag in scattered demonstrations that were met with renewed violence by the militants, who are facing growing challenges to their rule.\n\nOn Thursday, a procession of cars and people near Kabul's airport carried long black, red and green banners in honor of the Afghan flag — a banner that is becoming a symbol of defiance since the militants have their own flag.

Biden told reporters it was not inevitable the Taliban would seize control of the government and that he trusts the ability of the Afghan National and Defense Security Forces, who is \"better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”\n\nHe defended his decision to end the war and appeared to push back on criticism among some defense officials and Republicans who argue Afghanistan is on the verge of collapse.\n\n\"I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome,\" he said.\n\nBiden and his national security advisers have repeatedly emphasized the U.S. will continue to provide humanitarian and economic assistance to Afghanistan, but the security situation has rapidly deteriorated as Taliban fighters continue to overtake Afghan security forces across the country.\n\nMore:He risked his life helping US troops in Afghanistan before seeking asylum in Iowa.

British Prime Minster Boris Johnson confirmed earlier Thursday that most British troops had also left Afghanistan.\n\nAfghan evacuations to begin in July\n\nThousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military, as translators and in other roles, have been seeking to leave their homeland before the U.S. completes its military withdrawal. These Afghans fear that once U.S. forces are gone, the Taliban will sweep back into power and target them as traitors.\n\nThe president said this month the U.S. began relocation flights to third-party countries for Afghans applying for a special immigrant visa and that his administration was working with Congress to change the law to accelerate the application process.\n\n\"Our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States, if you so choose. And we will stand with you, just as you stood with us,\" he said.\n\nNed Price, the State Department’s chief spokesman, said the administration was in talks with a number of countries about hosting the Afghan applicants on a temporary basis, but he declined to identify possible locations.\n\nHe said the administration had identified an initial number of at-risk Afghans who are eligible for relocation now and could be moved in the coming weeks but did not rule out evacuating additional applicants at a future date.\n\n“We’re preparing for any number of contingencies,” Price said.\n\nMore:Biden administration will relocate thousands of Afghan interpreters who worked with US military\n\nBiden's advisers have also not said how many Afghans will be included in the evacuation plans.

About 9,000 of them have filled out the necessary paperwork and the other 9,000 are still at the beginning of the process.\n\nLeaving Bagram Airfield\n\nThe dramatic acceleration of Biden's timeline comes after U.S. troops quietly departed Bagram Airfield, which served as the pivotal base of the American-led war against al-Qaida and the Taliban, effectively ending the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan after nearly two decades.\n\nThe White House has been steadfast in adhering to its plan to end military operations in the country by the end of August, despite criticism from some U.S. officials and Republicans who warn the Taliban's rapid advancement could soon overtake the capital of Kabul.\n\nBiden told Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani at a White House meeting in June the U.S. will continue to support Afghanistan from U.S. bases outside the country. As many as 650 U.S. troops will stay in Afghanistan indefinitely to protect the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.\n\nMore:Biden meets with Afghanistan leaders as US troop withdrawal expected well ahead of 9/11 deadline\n\nThe president declared there is no \"mission accomplished\" moment.\n\n“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” he said.\n\nMark Jacobson, former deputy NATO senior civilian representative in Afghanistan, said while he doesn't agree with Biden's assessment on Afghanistan's ability to keep the threat of terror at bay, the president \"took ownership of his decision.\"\n\n\"He made a very strong justification of what he did. There's going to be disagreement over whether he's much too optimistic on what happens in Afghanistan next, but it's very clear that he knows he owns this and he knows this is not going to end well for the people on the ground in Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nMore:Biden meets with Afghanistan leaders as US troop withdrawal expected well ahead of 9/11 deadline\n\nFollowing the speech, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the decision would be Biden's \"biggest mistake yet.\"\n\n\"President Biden does not understand conditions are developing in Afghanistan for a reemergence of al-Qaeda and ISIS which will directly threaten the American homeland and our allies,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was set in motion by former President Donald Trump. Under an agreement Trump's advisers brokered with the Taliban, the U.S. agreed to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan and the Taliban promised to sever its ties with al-Qaida and end its attacks on American forces.\n\nAt the war’s peak, the U.S. and NATO military numbers surpassed 150,000. The conflict has cost more than $2 trillion, according to a Brown University analysis released in April. More than 2,400 American service members were killed, along with scores of allied troops, humanitarian workers, journalists and tens of thousands of civilians.\n\nContributing: Deirdre Shesgreen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/953998/joe-biden-failed-no-fail-mission-afghanistan-withdrawal-white-house-claims", "title": "Joe Biden failed a 'no-fail mission' in Afghanistan, official claims ...", "text": "Officials in Joe Biden’s administration are “absolutely appalled” and “horrified” that the US evacuation of Afghanistan failed to airlift all US citizens out of the country before troops were taken off the ground, it has emerged.\n\nA White House official told Politico that Biden had “failed” at a “no-fail mission” during the withdrawal, adding that the evacuation was “a hostage rescue of thousands of Americans in the guise of an NEO [noncombatant evacuation operations]”.\n\n“I am absolutely appalled and literally horrified we left Americans there,” they added.\n\nThe criticism came as Biden sought to “shift blame” over the chaotic evacuation, the news site said, “brushing off criticism about the way the war ended” when he yesterday told reporters: “I give you my word with all of my heart, I believe this is the right decision, the wise decision, and the best decision for America.”\n\nAsked about the “hundred-plus American citizens who didn’t make it out”, the news site added, Biden continued that they were given “multiple warnings and offers to help them leave Afghanistan, all the way back as far as March”.\n\n“The bottom line is, there is no evacuation from the end of a war that you can run without the kinds of complexities, challenges, threats we faced,” he said.\n\nSince the last military flight departed, a “​blame game” has begun over who is responsible for the rushed effort, reported Reuters. “The Biden administration’s scramble was emblematic of failures over the past month”, the news agency added, “which culminated with a hastily organized airlift that left thousands of US-allied Afghans behind”.\n\nThe evacuation is one of the largest airlift operations in history and saw more than 120,000 Americans, Afghans and people of other nationalities taken out of the country.\n\nHowever, “finger-pointing is an ugly Washington sport”, according to Dan Fried, a former senior US diplomat now at the Atlantic Council think tank. He told Reuters that “in this case, fingers could be pointed in all directions and probably be right in each case”.\n\n“A failure like this is collective. Everybody screwed up,” he added.\n\nIn attempting to distance his administration from the chaotic scenes at Hamid Karzai International Airport, Biden has sought to paint the evacuation as an “extraordinary success”, adding in a speech at the White House that “no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history; only the US had the capacity and the will and ability to do it”.\n\nBut questions have also been raised “about why Biden didn't continue the airlift for at least another day”, Euronews said.\n\nThe last US plane departed on Monday, however, the president had “set Tuesday as a deadline for ending the evacuation and pulling out remaining troops after the Taliban took over the country”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/joe-biden-first-year-in-office/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden enters the second year of his presidency looking for a ...", "text": "(CNN) As he walked through the front gate of the White House complex last year for the first time as President, Joe Biden declared it felt like \"going home.\"\n\nIf the presidency seemed then like a natural fit for a 50-year creature of Washington, today its limits are leading to a reckoning over expectations and ambitions in a country as exhausted, angry and divided as ever.\n\nBiden enters the second year of his term with one of the lowest approval ratings of a modern-day president, depleted of the political capital and sense of confidence that followed him into office.\n\nA sense of normalcy returned to the White House following the whiplash of Donald Trump's presidency , but a string of setbacks -- at home and abroad -- have eroded the air of competence that once surrounded a President and his team, who have spent most of their lives in government and campaigned for the job on a pledge of restoring order.\n\nOn most days since January 20, 2021, the President has arrived at the Oval Office early in the morning, peppered his team with detailed questions and tried not to think too much about the man who'd just vacated the building, leaving behind a pandemic, angry divisions and -- inside a drawer of the Resolute Desk -- a lengthy letter for Biden. The President has worked to make the place his own, installing his family's furniture, ordering up chocolate ice cream bars branded with the presidential seal and returning to traditions his predecessor abandoned.\n\nYet for all that, the country remains fractured and irritable. A \"malaise\" has sunk in as the pandemic persists, his vice president conceded in an interview this month. Americans are misbehaving on airplanes, in school board meetings and at grocery stores. So entrenched is the anger that one father felt comfortable blurting out a coded derogatory phrase about Biden when he was speaking to the President on the phone last Christmas Eve -- while his own son watched on.\n\n\"There are successes that he's had, but people do not feel it and you can't persuade people to feel better. You can't jawbone that,\" said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in former President Barack Obama's White House and a CNN senior political commentator.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden is not actively stoking the anger. But his inaugural speech pledge to \"end this uncivil war\" remains unfulfilled.\n\nBiden's trademark personal style -- wielded over breakfasts in Delaware, inside caucus rooms on Capitol Hill and across the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office -- hasn't brought around holdout Democrats to some of his boldest ideas, let alone many Republicans.\n\nOverseas, a full-blown conflict now looms with Moscow just six months after coming face-to-face with the Russian leader in an old villa in Geneva. And after declaring \"independence from the virus\" on the South Lawn in July, Biden is contemplating Covid's permanent presence going forward.\n\nOn a personal level, just adjusting to life in the White House has been a struggle. By his own admission, Biden finds the place stifling and regularly spends three nights a week elsewhere.\n\nBlame game\n\nEven as top advisers and longtime friends of Biden try to help reset a floundering presidency, recriminations have quietly surfaced inside the West Wing about the fundamental causes of the challenges.\n\nA considerable share of finger-pointing is aimed at deep divisions among Democrats and how some top officials have sought to accommodate progressives in hopes of keeping peace inside the party.\n\n\"Over the last year, the White House has allowed the left to hijack and misinterpret the rationale for Biden's election,\" said one former Democratic official in regular touch with the President, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the West Wing. \"He was not elected to transform the country.\"\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain, a longtime Biden adviser, is at the middle of those internal tensions. He is seen by some observers as pushing his own agenda or being too quick to side with demands from liberals, which raises expectations that ultimately lead to disappointment.\n\nWhen Democrats clinched their razor-thin majority in the Senate, following the Georgia runoff victories for Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, those expectations skyrocketed far beyond what the narrowly divided Senate has been able to deliver. The expected failure of voting rights legislation is only the latest example.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to members of the media as he leaves a meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus to discuss voting rights and election integrity on Capitol Hill on January 13.\n\n\"They pushed for everything you would have thought they would have done if they had 58 or 60 Democrats,\" one lawmaker told CNN, who lamented how Biden's first year is ending with a focus on what he didn't accomplish rather than what he did.\n\n\"Either your message is wrong, or your approach is wrong. Something is wrong.\"\n\nAt the center of the White House challenges, though, is Biden himself and what even many longtime admirers describe as unremarkable and uneven performances. Several members of Congress who speak with Biden frequently told CNN that his grasp of details is impressive, but how he communicates that publicly is often anything but.\n\nHeading into a tumultuous midterm election year, where Democrats are already bracing for the prospect of losing control of the House and possibly the Senate, the White House said Biden will spend more of his time communicating directly with the American people, rather than trying to negotiate deals in Congress.\n\nThat promise, however, rings familiar. The administration has repeatedly promised that Biden would spend more time on the road selling his plans, yet he has traveled less than most recent predecessors.\n\n\"There should be some really significant issues that we should be able to come around and coalesce around and get done. And I think we can. I think we can get it done. And we need the President, we need the administration to lead the way. They're in charge. The buck stops there. There is no doubt about, and we need to get things done. We're not doing good enough,\" said Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who is running for Senate in the state.\n\n\"The President is the President, and there is no question that he bears some responsibility for it. But there is also Congress and the Senate, and the Republicans are MIA. They're worthless,\" Ryan said on CNN.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday hailed the legislative successes and the economic strides, despite coming into office under what she described as \"an incredibly difficult circumstance.\"\n\n\"You don't get everything done in the first year,\" Psaki said. \"The work is not done. The job is not done, and we are certainly not conveying that it is.\"\n\nConfronting Covid\n\nAs his second year begins, advisers tell CNN that Covid-19 and its messy fallout is the biggest weight on Biden -- the one challenge he believes could reverse his fortunes or forever damage his presidency.\n\nBiden has made significant strides, particularly in getting hundreds of millions of Americans vaccinated. But millions still refuse to get shots, a persistent source of frustration for the President.\n\n\"This virus has fooled us multiple times,\" one senior health official told CNN. \"Nobody expected Delta to just blow us away. And then to have Omicron come out of nowhere, it's a big, big surprise.\"\n\nStill, the President has maintained the same mentality throughout. He has repeatedly advised his team that while outsiders will quickly point out any of their missteps, \"you should keep your head down and keep working.\"\n\n\"He's not panicking. He's not blaming anyone,\" the official said.\n\nTrillions of dollars in Covid relief funds helped alleviate some of the economic stresses of the pandemic, but even Biden has admitted the influx of cash into the economy may have driven up consumer prices. Inflation triggered by a Covid-related mismatch between supply and demand remains a drag on the President's approval ratings.\n\nPresident Joe Biden removes his mask before speaking about updated CDC mask guidance on the North Lawn of the White House on April 27, 2021 in Washington, DC.\n\nBiden's poll numbers began taking a southward turn over the summer, when it became clear his celebrations of a waning virus were premature. Mask recommendations returned, shutdowns persisted and the once-hopeful feeling disappeared. Confusing messaging from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been a source of constant irritation in the West Wing.\n\nIn other ways, the pandemic has altered the normal rhythms of executive branch life. Unable to travel as extensively as he'd once hoped, Biden has taken to conducting events from an elaborate stage-set built in a White House auditorium where participants can beam in on video-chat. He has traveled abroad only twice, a slower pace than his predecessors.\n\nOrdinarily the West Wing and its adjacent offices are a hive of activity, where at any single moment meetings could be unfolding on dozens of pressing topics. But even a year into his presidency, Covid has left some staffers still working at home. Those who are selected for a meeting with the President himself must arrive well beforehand to undergo testing by the White House Medical Unit. What once could have been a 30-minute block of a Cabinet secretary or lawmaker's day becomes more of an ordeal.\n\n\"You know what it takes to go meet with the President?\" said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra last month. \"It's just a pain. And you knock out so much of your day. You've got to get tested, what is it, an hour and a half before you can see the President, you got to hang around there. So, the actual physical one-on-one, not as often.\"\n\nCalls for a reset\n\nGrowing anxious ahead of this year's midterm elections, many Democrats have issued various calls for a strategy reset -- on Covid, the economy and communications. Some have privately questioned whether Biden -- whose public schedule sometimes contains only a few events per week -- is doing enough to promote his accomplishments and break through to voters.\n\nBiden's speeches often rely on the same lengthy passages, recited verbatim from a teleprompter. When he does leave Washington, his events have tended to adopt a familiar look: a tour of a factory or plant, a speech to a group of unionized workers and up to an hour of shaking hands afterward. His top-visited state, aside from Delaware where he travels home on weekends, was Pennsylvania.\n\nAt moments, the nation's oldest President shows his age. After he reminisced about working with noted segregationist Strom Thurmond in a speech about voting rights last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed perplexed: \"None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond,\" she said afterward.\n\nQuestions persist about whether he plans to run again in 2024 . And missteps by his vice president, Kamala Harris -- whose allies believe she is both underutilized as a political asset and overexposed to difficult issues -- have led to deeper introspection about the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nAfter urging from party strategists, Biden has lately begun drawing sharper contrasts with Republicans and speaking out louder about the corrosive lies peddled by Trump. The President has begun staging more events meant to highlight the benefits of what he has been able to accomplish, like passing the largest public works bill in decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden disembarks from Air Force One upon arrival at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, July 28, 2021, after traveling to Pennsylvania to speak on the economy.\n\nHeading into the new year, the White House has drawn up executive actions on issues like police reform for Biden to act where Congress won't.\n\nAnd White House officials and Democratic lawmakers are beginning to quietly plot a way forward on Biden's sweeping spending agenda, including potentially splitting it into pieces.\n\nBiden has stood accused by some progressives, including his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Bernie Sanders, of failing to pursue an agenda focused on real-world economic issues. It's a charge that stings for the President who still makes a point in meetings of asking how policy proposals will affect pipefitters and construction workers in his Pennsylvania hometown, and angrily scolds advisers for using jargon those people wouldn't understand.\n\nHis top aides insist Biden's achievements have been squarely focused on improving conditions for the working class.\n\n\"I would not say that the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class. We have had historic successes in the first year of the Biden presidency, the passage of the American Rescue Plan, to give one example, has cut child poverty in this country almost in half,\" said Susan Rice, Biden's domestic policy adviser, last week on CNN. \"We have put very important supports in the pockets of the American people at a time when the pandemic has made their economic prospects perilous.\"\n\nManaging expectations\n\nIn many ways, Biden's first year was defined by expectations getting away from him: about the trajectory of the pandemic, the durability of Trump and the ability of a governing veteran to find solutions to any of it. At junctures throughout the year, Biden appeared caught by surprise when challenges arose that, at least in retrospect, were not surprising.\n\nWhen the Taliban swiftly took control of Afghanistan in August, Biden said it happened quicker than anyone expected -- despite intelligence warnings painting a grim picture following a complete American withdrawal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he listens to a question about the bombings at the Kabul airport that killed at least 12 U.S. service members, from the East Room of the White House in August 2021.\n\nWhen France erupted in anger following his deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, Biden said he thought someone had given Paris a heads up that their own agreement to provide conventional subs was off -- even though no one had.\n\nWhen Biden said in June that inflation would \"pop up a little bit and then go back down,\" he was discounting warnings from veterans of Democratic administrations of a more serious trend -- one that continues six months later.\n\nAnd when testing shortages at the start of the latest Covid surge caused mile-long lines, Biden said he wished he'd thought of ordering millions more tests earlier -- even though health experts have been warning for months of a looming shortage.\n\nRepeatedly appearing caught off-guard by events undercut Biden's promise of restoring competence to government and predictability on the world stage and led to accusations he was being poorly served by his team. It belied a President who, behind the scenes, solicits a wide range of opinions on critical issues and engages a panel of advisers inside and outside government. The process has sometimes delayed critical decisions, giving the impression of indecisiveness.\n\nAfter the harrowing Afghanistan ordeal, there were calls to fire his national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Others have urged Biden to replace his Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients. After publicly sinking prospects for quick passage of the Build Back Better plan, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia vented frustration at White House staff he said drove him to his \"wit's end.\"\n\nWhether Biden plans to replace anyone in the new year remains to be seen; he is a known deliberator and hasn't executed any major personnel changes since taking office. The advisers he continues to rely upon most -- chief of staff Ron Klain and senior advisers Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti -- have worked for him for decades.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't voices advocating for changes in the West Wing.\n\n\"If I was down [this much] in my ratings, I'd have a new chief of staff,\" one prominent Democrat who speaks regularly with Biden said.\n\nA struggle to adjust\n\nThe pandemic has not been the only factor contributing to an uneasy transition to White House life. After spending eight years haunting the West Wing, Biden had only been upstairs to the private presidential residence once during his time as vice president.\n\nWhen he moved into the executive mansion last year, staff crowded him at awkward hours, including in the early mornings. Someone was always just outside the door or walking quietly through the hallways. It was a way of life Biden wasn't accustomed to -- and did not enjoy.\n\nAttempts to make the place feel more like home had mixed results. Some of the furniture from his home in Delaware made its way to the White House. Books and family photographs adorn shelves and tables that previously held antiques from the White House collection. But the family German Shepherd Major was dispatched permanently to a friend's house after a series of nipping incidents (a new puppy, Commander , arrived late last year).\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, look at their new dog Commander, after speaking virtually with military service members to thank them for their service and wish them a Merry Christmas, from the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC.\n\nOver the course of the year, Biden and the first lady requested some changes. No longer are chefs or Secret Service agents posted in the private kitchen on his third-floor residence during breakfast hours; instead, he can wander in wearing a bathrobe and pour himself a bowl of Special K cereal before lifting weights in the residence gym.\n\nWaiting for him in the morning is a notecard with his schedule for the day, which Biden marks with checks as each meeting is completed, and a stapled-together compilation of daily news clips called \"The Bulletin.\" He packs it all in a worn leather briefcase to carry with him downstairs to the office.\n\nA focus on the familiar has extended beyond the White House. When Biden met Putin in Geneva last summer, an aide made sure to bring along a bottle of orange Gatorade, the President's preferred drink. And even when he is traveling, Biden places daily phone calls to his grandchildren, who remain at the center of his personal life.\n\nThe third time was a charm in Biden's quest for the presidency, with a triumph in 2020 after falling well short in the campaigns of 1988 and 2008. The question that many of his longtime admirers raise in quiet conversations is whether Biden still approaches the job and, in fact, Washington in the same way he might have decades ago.\n\nThere's little question that the outcome of his second year -- and his ability to spark a turnaround, as many presidents before him have -- will help shape how Biden answers the biggest question of all, likely by this time next year: whether he will run again in 2024.", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/politics/gallery/biden-first-year-photos/index.html", "title": "In pictures: Biden's first year as President", "text": "Chang W.

Afghanistan fell back into the hands of the Taliban after the United States withdrew its troops from the country. At home, America is dealing with its worst inflation in nearly 40 years.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has been a constant throughout. From the start of his term, Biden has been pushing to get more Americans vaccinated. He met his goal of administering 100 million doses within his first 100 days in office, but despite his urging, nearly 40% of the population still isn't fully vaccinated.\n\nHere are some of the key moments of Biden's first year through the lens of photographers who have covered him along the way.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/08/19/covid-19-unemployment-benefits-afghanistan-update-us-capitol-bomb-threat-hurricane-grace-its-thursda/8173661002/", "title": "COVID-19, unemployment benefits, Afghanistan update, US Capitol ...", "text": "The Biden administration won't look to extend weekly enhanced unemployment benefits.

The enhanced benefits, designed to help Americans who lost jobs because of the pandemic, were enacted last year in the federal CARES Act under then-President Donald Trump. The boost, originally $600 but later cut in half, was extended twice, most recently to Sept. 6 under Biden's American Rescue Plan that Congress passed in March.

U.S. Capitol Police identified the suspect as Floyd Ray Roseberry, who ultimately crawled from the cluttered cab of his pickup, ending an unusual confrontation – some of it livestreamed on Facebook by Roseberry. Officials first seized on the vehicle Thursday morning after it had been driven on the sidewalk outside the Library of Congress building by Roseberry, who claimed to have a device and what appeared to be a detonator in his hand. Roseberry livestreamed part of the standoff, where he repeatedly appealed to President Joe Biden, referred to an approaching \"revolution\" and warned of four other devices that had been planted across the city.\n\nPhoto gallery: Police respond to potential bomb threat on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhat everyone's talking about\n\nAfghans protest Taliban takeover\n\nIn the days after the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, the Afghan people are starting to push back against their new rulers. A day after a protest in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, drew a violent Taliban rebuke, demonstrations grew on Thursday. Afghan people pushed their new rulers by waving the national flag and marking the nation's 102nd anniversary of independence from Britain. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden held firm on his stance on why he chose now to withdraw from the country after nearly two decades. \"There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would have been a problem, 15 years from now.

The research shows the vaccines' effectiveness against the delta variant is also \"generally decreased,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said. The drop in effectiveness varies depending on the cohort, but the data consistently demonstrate a reduction. What about variants?

They say the ongoing research has helped increase beach safety by giving local officials and beachgoers alike a better understanding of where great whites tend to appear, as well as what times of the day they tend to be most active.\n\nSkomal says there’s been a marked change in beachgoer behavior since the region saw two shark attacks on humans — one of them fatal — in 2018.\n\nMany are increasingly keeping closer to shore when they swim, with others not venturing into the waters at all, he said.\n\n“It’s a conservation success story in terms of sharks and seals,” Winton said. “At the same time, this is an important place for people to recreate, so it’s important to find ways to coexist.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/19/rip-currents-how-to-spot-one-beach-how-to-escape/1454613001/", "title": "Beach rip currents can be deadly, but experts say you can escape", "text": "Summer officially begins Friday and that means more people will start spending time at the beach.\n\nBut if you've ever soaked up the sun and sand, you've probably seen a scary sign telling you to watch out for rip currents. Rip currents are a real danger for beachgoers: The U.S. Lifesaving Association estimates more than 100 people are killed by rip currents every year, and lifeguards rescue at least 30,000 swimmers a year from rip currents.\n\nBut what are rip currents? Why are they so dangerous? Why should you avoid your gut instinct if you get caught in one?\n\nHere's what to know before heading to the beach this summer.\n\nWhat are rip currents?\n\nYou might have heard of rip currents by the common misnomer \"rip tides.\" They are actually two different things, according to the National Ocean Service.\n\nA rip tide is a specific type of current associated with the swift movement of tidal water through inlets and the mouths of rivers and harbors.\n\nRip currents occur in bodies of water with breaking waves; they are channels of water that flow at a faster pace than the surrounding area. Swimmers who are caught in rip currents can get sucked away at speeds of up to 8 feet per second, far too fast for many swimmers to make it safely back to shore.\n\nThe National Weather Service and other websites post warnings about high chances of rip currents, so swimmers almost always have ample warning that rip currents are possible or are occurring.\n\nIdentify:Rip currents are dangerous; here's how to spot them\n\nWhat should I do if I get caught in one?\n\nFirst, don't panic – there is a way out.\n\nRemain calm and swim parallel to the shoreline, which is perpendicular to the current. Or just go with the flow and ride out the rip current, saving your energy for the swim back to shore.\n\nDon’t become a victim by trying to save someone. If you see someone caught in a rip current, get help from a lifeguard, if available. Call 911 for further assistance.\n\nFalk Feddersen, professor of physical oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, told USA TODAY that when people are not strong swimmers, they tend to panic and try to swim against the current, which results in exhaustion and drowning.\n\nHe recommended simply bobbing with the water until you make it back to shore or you are away from the active parts of the rip current.\n\n\"Once you’re away from the active current, you can swim back to shore,\" he said.\n\nApril 2019:California high school football player presumed drowned in rip current\n\nJuly 2017:Bystanders form human chain to rescue swimmers from Lake Michigan\n\nWhy are rip currents so dangerous?\n\nTo get an idea of how dangerous a rip current can be, you only need to look at the many deaths or near-deaths over the years.\n\nA California high school football player drowned in a rip current while boogie boarding at Half Moon Bay in April. In July 2017, at least 30 people formed a human chain to rescue nine people from a rip current in Lake Michigan. A tourist died after saving a Michigan mayor caught in a rip current in the Caribbean in March 2015.\n\nA 2014 study by the University of New South Wales says that the rapid expelling of energy – which can be caused by panicking or swimming to the shore – often leads to drowning.\n\n\"Energy should be conserved wherever possible,\" wrote Rob Brander, author of the study.\n\nFeddersen explained that it's unlikely that a rip current will pull you out to sea.\n\nHe added that once you have knowledge of rip currents and how to deal with them, they can be a \"beautiful, cool and fun\" feature to a beach vacation.\n\nFollow Elinor Aspegren on Twitter: @elinoraspegren.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2021/06/05/nj-jersey-shore-beach-rip-current-forecast-ocean-hazards/7417868002/", "title": "NJ beach rip currents: A new forecast could keep you safe", "text": "Salvatore Carnesi of Belmar never worried about dangerous waves — he swam competitively and thought he could handle the ocean. But all that changed the day he got caught in a rip current, and it pulled him so deep into the ocean that he couldn't escape on his own and had to be rescued by lifeguards.\n\n\"I realized I wasn't getting any farther to the shore, and realized I needed help because of how strong and extremely difficult it was to get out of,\" said Carnesi, 39. \"I remember at one point, it really did feel like something was pulling you down, but luckily I got out of it unharmed.\"\n\nRip currents are the ocean's silent killers — they can drag even the strongest swimmers out into the sea, struggling to fight against the tide.\n\nBut, for the first time, a rip current forecast model has been created by the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, which aims to help meteorologists and lifeguards save lives of beachgoers across the country.\n\nThis new model has not been released publicly yet, as meteorologists are still experimenting with the system and want to run more tests before making it available, according to Jonathan O'Brien, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.\n\nMeteorologists, however, continue to use the model internally, which has allowed them to accurately predict the hourly probability everyday up to six days out across all U.S. beaches.\n\nBeachgoers wanting to know about the risk for rip currents will be able to see daily and next-day surf zone forecasts on the Philadelphia/Mount Holly office of the National Weather Service website or through their social media. There, the weather service provides a forecast that gives updates on the rip current risk at Monmouth beaches, including Sandy Hook; Ocean County beaches, including Long Beach Island; and Atlantic County, including Atlantic City.\n\n\"Rip currents have always been one of our foremost hazards when it comes to the summer and certainly if there happen to be fewer lifeguards, that contributes more to the dangers of when someone gets caught in one,\" said Nick Carr, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Mount Holly.\n\nIn addition to the website, the Mount Holly office also has been tweeting the rip current risks. Here's one they sent out on Sunday for Memorial Day:\n\nFor this weekend, the weather service is warning of a moderate risk of rip tides at New Jersey's ocean beaches, which they define as \"life-threatening rip currents are possible in the surf zone.\" The other options are low or high risk. It also tells of wave height (2 feet on Saturday) and thunderstorm risk (none Saturday). The tip current risk is low on Sunday with a potential wave height of 2 feet.\n\n\"(The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service) collaboratively developed and implemented the model, which leverages wave and water level information from the recently upgraded NWS' nearshore wave prediction system,\" the weather service has said. \"Similar to predicting weather or precipitation, the model predicts the likelihood of dangerous seaward currents on a sliding scale - from 0 to 100%.\"\n\nSummer Guide:Great eating at the Jersey Shore, including fun and new restaurants\n\nRip currents are powerful, narrow flowing channels of fast-moving water moving away from the shore that are often found on the East Coast of the United States, moving at speeds of up to 8 feet per second. If you get caught in one and are pulled out, these currents will suck you in and take you down no matter how much you try to fight, according to Carr.\n\nWhat should you do in a rip current?\n\nSwimmers often try to fight the rip currents by swimming straight back to shore, but this only increases their risk of drowning because of the amount of fatigue used.\n\nOfficials say the best way to avoid a rip current is to avoid the high tide. Additionally, never swim without a lifeguard nearby and take note of what color flags are on the beach. Red flags warn swimmers to stay out of the ocean; yellow are caution flags\n\nIf you are ever caught in a rip tide or current, attempt to swim parallel to shore to escape it. While they are quite powerful, rip currents are generally narrow and only about 10 to 20 feet, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\"Never swim against the current, as this will only make you more tired and continue to suck you in,\" the weather service said. \"Do not panic and remember that rip currents won't take you under the water unless deep into the ocean. If you cannot escape, remain calm, and tread water or float as this will help you not tire out, along with calling for help if needed.\"\n\nAccording to the National Ocean Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the United States Lifesaving Association, lifeguards across the country rescue tens of thousands of people from rip currents every year, with an estimation that 100 people are killed by rip currents annually.\n\nBoth groups also state that rip currents account for more than 80% of rescues by beach lifeguards.\n\nDune damage:Weekend storm erodes recently repaired dunes in Ortley Beach\n\nAnd with some towns across the Shore not having lifeguards or the necessary amount of beach patrols during the work week until the middle of June, officials are concerned for beachgoers heading into the waters.\n\n\"Because schools are still in session, most beaches will not be widely patrolled during the week till at least the middle of June because there will be no lifeguards on duty-in most towns,\" said Joe Bongiovanni, beach safety supervisor for Asbury Park. \"So people should be aware when heading out to the waters that are left unguarded, especially when the risk for hazardous rip currents may be high.\"\n\nStory continues below gallery.\n\nPrior to the new model, meteorologists were unable to specifically predict where rip currents will be, as computer models would only forecast some of the factors that could contribute to rip currents such as the height of the surf, tidal influx, direction of the surf, and all things that were found to correlate for rip current risk.\n\nThe rip current model uses machine learning techniques based off years of training data that look at rip current incidents and the various parameters into it such as wave height, time periods, and how the tide cycle is, according to Carr. This new system has recently allowed forecasters to accurately predict whether or not rip currents are likely on any given day.\n\n\"People often 'respect' the dangers of when it comes to thunderstorms, but when it comes to rip currents, people often don't think about it and it can be surprising for many if they experience it,\" Carr added.\n\nCarnesi said any technology that could help save lives when there is a high risk of rip currents on any given day or notify those heading to the beach to stay out of the waters and not get themselves in dangerous situations like he found himself in is important.\n\nIf you do not follow alerts being sent out from the weather service on Twitter or checking the surface zone forecast and head straight to the beach without any warning, rip currents can be difficult to spot.\n\nSummer Guide:Things to do, concerts, activities and more at the Jersey Shore\n\nSeaside Heights Police Chief Thomas Boyd, who was also a former lifeguard for the borough, said rip currents are difficult to recognize to those not familiar with them.\n\n\"First off, simply don't go into the ocean if the waves are rough, there's nothing to argue on that,\" Boyd said. \"Rip currents are difficult to find, but you'll have a better idea if you look at them from an elevated position and they often have a slightly different color from the rest of the water and sometimes have this sort of foam on top.\"\n\nBoyd agrees that anything the weather service can develop to warn beachgoers of where the rip currents will be is always a great idea, but he believes the problem is, after every storm the rip currents will change where they move.\n\nHe emphasized that if there are breaks between multiple storm periods, it's still going to be difficult to track where exactly the rip currents are even with this new model.\n\n\"It depends on how the sandbar shifts, as rip tides only start when the water goes over the sandbar and it's like pulling a plug out of a bathtub,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"The water only goes toward where it's easiest to get out and that's my biggest concern if the weather service can still track this,\" he said. \"What I mean is that, can this still work if there are multiple periods of storms in one day and not just predicting based off an upcoming storm.\"\n\nWhat's that?:Minke whale skull discovered at Island Beach State Park\n\nCarr, the meteorologist from the National Weather Service, said they are still in the early stages of experimenting with the new model and not everything will be perfect right away. But he said as they continue to test it out, the model will certainly be an important tool to use going forward.\n\nOcean waters can be dangerous — first responders made five water rescues off Seaside Height's beaches on May 23 as summer-like temperatures sent visitors flocking to shores that were left unguarded. In neighboring Seaside Park, officials made three water rescues within two hours as no lifeguards were on duty during the time.\n\nSeaside Park Mayor John A. Peterson Jr. knows his staff is fully trained and experienced when it comes to dealing with life-threatening situations in the waters, but warns beachgoers that if there are no lifeguards or beach patrols available to assist, they should avoid the waters at all costs.\n\n\"I think people would be well-served to pay careful attention to any and all warnings they see in weather reports and the National Weather Service, who often make references to potential rip tides,\" Peterson said. \"It can be very treacherous and they absolutely should refrain from going into the water in unprotected areas. Even if it looks safe, you never know.\"\n\nLorrie Ciro agrees. After owning a beach house for over 10 years, Ciro has witnessed dozens of beachgoers get sucked in to the waters from rip currents every year.\n\nShe believe people who are eager to head to the beach, even on a day when the weather is looking discouraging, should be mindful of the risks that come when heading near the waters.\n\nJersey Shore:NJ beach badge revenue soared in 2020, even as COVID shook the Shore\n\n\"It's a scary thing to watch,\" said Ciro, 48, of Manasquan. \"People don't realize how dangerous those waves are when the weather gets rough. I've followed those folks over at the weather service before and if they have this new technology that can predict these rip currents, then everyone should be reading up on it because it might help save people.\"\n\nJoshua Chung is the 9-5 breaking news and weather reporter.

A woman was killed on July 27, 2020, by a great white while swimming about 20 yards offshore in Harpswell.\n\n\"Sharks aren't new to the state, but the horrible tragedy last year raised everyone's awareness,\" Gary Best, state park regional manager at the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, told the Times Record.\n\nThe shark warning flag is widely used in Cape Cod, which sees more white sharks than Maine, Best said.\n\n'We always hope to see something':Basking sharks cause stir near beaches in York\n\nThe flag — purple with a white shark silhouette in the middle — will also be hoisted in Harpswell when a shark is seen in nearby waters.\n\nThe flag will be visible at Mitchell Field, Mackerel Cove and Cedar Beach when there is a reported shark sighting within a quarter mile, said Arthur Howe, Harpswell's fire administrator and emergency management agent.\n\nThe flag isn't intended to alarm people, but to keep them \"aware and educated that we have sharks in our waters,\" Howe said.\n\nShark sightings could become more frequent in Maine because they're drawn to the state's healthy seal population.\n\n\"Seals are the food source of white sharks, and if there's a lot of food around, you're going to undoubtedly have more sharks taking advantage of it,\" said James Sulikowski, a former University of New England professor who conducts shark research in Maine and worldwide.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/20/sharks-cape-cod-beach-seals-ocean-new-england/1953956001/", "title": "Cape Cod shark sightings up, prompting more beach evacuations", "text": "ORLEANS, Mass. – It's 11:30 a.m. on a sticky August morning at Nauset Beach here in this Cape Cod town when another call comes in on the walkie-talkie of Sarah Newcomb-Baker, the beach's head lifeguard.\n\nThe voice is one of her employees flagging a scene similar to the one spotted just two hours before: a great white shark attacking a seal offshore.\n\nAnother lifeguard buzzes in to say she saw a large splash in the area earlier: \"I'm wondering if that's the same thing.\"\n\nMinutes later, Nauset Beach announced its second shark evacuation just that morning, forcing beachgoers out of the water for the next hour. The previous closure happened at 9:45 a.m. after a lifeguard spotted a shark devouring a seal about 100 feet offshore on a different wing of the beach.\n\nShark sightings have been a regular occurrence this summer on the sandy beaches that dot Cape Cod, a popular vacation hub of New England. Brochures distributed on beaches urge visitors to \"Be shark smart.\" Signs warn, \"Know your risk when entering the water.\" After the back-to-back sightings this day, Nauset Beach has purple shark flags erected throughout. It means sharks are in the area.\n\nSharks have long been tied to the folklore of Cape Cod thanks to the Steven Spielberg movie classic \"Jaws,\" filmed at Martha's Vineyard in 1975. But spotting a shark had for decades been rare until recently.\n\n\"Never even thought about it,\" said Newcomb-Baker, recalling her start as a lifeguard on Cape Cod 22 years ago.\n\nNow sharks – namely great white sharks that can be 6 feet to 18 feet long – are part of the everyday beach life. They've congregated here in pursuit of dinner in the form of gray seals, which have repopulated in Cape Cod after a federal prohibition on hunting seals was enacted a half-century ago.\n\nThe sharks swim up from the south Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere each year in May and June, and more appear each month. They will largely leave when the waters cool in the fall.\n\n\"The ocean is changing, so we're going to have to change our behaviors as well,\" Newcomb-Baker said. A beach policy prohibits swimmers from drifting off into water deeper than the waist. \"We're way more strict this year.\"\n\nFirst anniversary of fatal shark attack\n\nSharks started popping up more frequently off Cape Cod about a decade ago, but the activity has picked up more in the past five to seven years.\n\nThe key moment was the death of 26-year-old Arthur Medici, who on Sept. 15, 2018, became the first person killed by a shark off Cape Cod since 1936. Medici was boogie boarding off Newcomb Hollow Beach in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, when he was attacked. His family was on the beach when it happened.\n\n\"That has definitely strengthened us as a unit, us as a town, along with the seashore,\" Newcomb-Baker said.\n\nThe attack came just weeks after William Lytton, 61, a neurologist from Scarsdale, New York, was bitten by a great white shark while swimming off Truro Beach on Aug. 15, 2018. He said he escaped by punching the shark as it bit into his left leg.\n\nMore:Suspected shark attack kills man in his 20s near Cape Cod, police say\n\nThis summer there have been no reported shark attacks, just a constant stream of alerts and videos posted on social media of close encounters. A family had a 16-foot shark brush against their boat in Provincetown. A charity swim had to be rerouted because of sharks. One great white shark jumped out of the water to snag a child's fishing line.\n\nHigh above the water, the Massachusetts State Police has responded by sending more helicopters to patrol the coastline in search of sharks near the shore. \"When we're up there, we have the ability to discern whether or not it's an actual threat,\" said Lt. Tom Ryan, a police department spokesman.\n\nResearchers study sharks' eating habits to prevent the next attack\n\nThe sharks' comeback is tied directly to the resurgence of the seals after the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1972. The law sought to protect seals and other wildlife on the verge of extinction from hunting.\n\nAlthough an exact number is unclear, one recent estimate using Google Earth imagery had the gray seal population at 30,000 to 50,000.\n\n\"It's somewhat of a conservation success story, really,\" said Gregory Skomal, a marine fisheries biologist at the Massachusetts Division of Urban Fisheries.\n\nSkomal is the leading shark expert in Cape Cod. Since 2009, he and a team of researchers have tagged sharks to track their movement. More recently, in 2014, he partnered with the nonprofit Atlantic White Shark Conservancy to figure out just how many sharks come to the region each year.\n\nThey've identified more than 350 great whites off Cape Cod and have tagged about 175 of them. This July they saw more sharks than last July.\n\nNow their work has a new focus: studying sharks' behavior as they prey on seals. Skomal and his researchers are using acoustic and satellite technology while individually placing tags called acceleration data loggers on the sharks from boats. The research has unearthed new data about the sharks' eating habits.\n\nThe goal of the multiyear study: to be able to forecast when and where sharks will attack seals next.\n\n\"We firmly believe that bites on people are mistakes. That's a shark thinking they are biting a seal,\" Skomal said. \"If we can get a better understanding of the shark-seal relationship – where, when and how white sharks attack their prey – I think that we'll be able to provide beach managers and the general public with patterns that we will use to try to keep people safe.\"\n\nMore:Great white sharks: Cape Cod study to examine feeding habits following two attacks\n\nStatistically, going to the beach in Cape Cod is safer than driving a car. But Skomal said something about sharks stick with people.\n\n\"The fear of shark attack, I think, is profound. Although there are not many shark attacks locally and very few are fatal, people think about it. It impacts an area and people's psyche.\"\n\nGroup takes aim at gray seals\n\nAlthough some observers wonder whether warmer waters have attracted sharks to Cape Cod, Skomal said there's no evidence yet to conclude climate change has played a role.\n\nThe increase in sharks has added to an existing debate about seals in Cape Cod. Commercial and recreational fishers blame the growing number of seals in recent decades for already decimating a once-thriving fishing industry. Now, they say, the seals have brought unwanted sharks to beaches.\n\nA new group started by residents of Nantucket island, dubbed the Coalition to Amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act, is pushing to change the law to allow gray seals, which can weigh more than 800 pounds, to be hunted again.\n\nThe coalition, led by Peter Howell, a recreational fisherman and a director of the Atlantic Salmon Federation, is lobbying to create a new provision in the law for removing species like gray seals that have been recovered and a separate provision to ensure they remain. It would require action by Congress.\n\n\"We certainly acknowledge that the Marine Mammal Protection Act has been a great help and, as far as gray seals are concerned, a great success,\" Howell said. \"We just think it was shortsighted in providing for what happens when in fact a species has recovered.\"\n\nStates do have the right to assume control over a species under the law if it has reached an \"optimum sustainable population.\" But Howell said such a threshold is unattainable because no one really knows how many seals are on the Massachusetts coast. He said he has nothing against seals or sharks but believes there just needs to be a better \"balance.\"\n\nThe coalition has evolved from the Seal Action Committee, led by friend Peter Krogh, a former dean at Georgetown University who resides in Nantucket. Krogh and Howell tell stories about bait shops on Cape Cod that have shut down and the once-iconic fishing spot, Great Point, having now been taken over by seals. It's not uncommon to start reeling in a fish, they say, only to have it yanked by a seal.\n\n\"These are the consequences, and now people are afraid to go into the water – surfers, swimmers, you name it,\" Krogh said. \"There's more protections for gray seals than there are for humans. It's just absolutely crazy.\"\n\nBut scientists warn that getting rid of gray seals isn't so simple, arguing that seals, in fact, haven't reached their saturation point in Cape Cod.\n\nSharon Young, senior strategist for marine issues for the Humane Society of the United States, said the fact that seals are reproducing at a high rate means they have not hit their carrying capacity. Reproduction rates tends to slow when a species has reached its limit.\n\n\"'Enough' is not a concept in biology,\" she said. \"The environment has a fairly clear number that it will tolerate, (even if) our social tolerance may have been exceeded.\"\n\nShe accused the group of not being upfront about what their real intent – killing seals. \"They don't like to say things like 'cull.'\"\n\nAnd even if seals were hunted again, Young said, they would keep coming back.\n\n\"Unless we are proposing to kill literally hundreds and thousands of seals, which is what we did back in the day, you can't kill your way out of this. So it's a little bit naive to say we're going to take them off the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\"\n\nTourism down, but are sharks to blame?\n\nTourism is down slightly this year on Cape Cod, with rentals decreasing by about 5% in the first half of 2019 compared with the year before. But Wendy Northcross, CEO of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, said she wants to review figures from the rest of the summer and fall before she determines if there's a larger trend.\n\nShe believes sharks might just be one of several reasons to explain the soft market, noting that the dip coincides with a drop nationally in domestic tourism.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of things at play here and sharks might be one tiny little bit of it,\" Northcross said.\n\nThe chamber conducted focus group this spring that concluded traditional Cape Cod visitors would return even if they knew the sharks were there. Northcross said beachgoers are practicing better safety habits this year. Some tourists even inquire about the best place to see sharks.\n\nAt Nauset Beach, beachgoers don't seem to mind even after back-to-back shark closures.\n\n\"For us, it's not impacted our decision to come to the cape during the summer,\" said Joe Bradley of Newton, Massachusetts, who made his annual trip down with his wife and two daughters, ages 12 and 9. \"It's just a little bit of an added frustration.\"\n\nHe jokes that he tells his daughters: \"Try and catch the seals. That way there's no sharks.\" Kidding aside, he said his family is \"very conscientious\" about whether flags are up and how far their kids are from the shore.\n\nYoung, who is based in Cape Cod with the Humane Society, said beaches in Hawaii, California and Florida have remained popular despite hotbeds of sharks and even an occasional attack. People there know to be smart about where they go and how they behave, she said.\n\n\"We're just not used to that mindset here. But we need to remember that just because it's new here doesn't mean it is unique.\n\n\"The return of seals and sharks is a sign that the ocean is trying to correct itself for some grotesque mismanagement on our part. We just need to think about a new normal.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @Joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/us/great-white-shark-jersey-shore-scn-trnd/index.html", "title": "There's a 1,000-pound great white shark swimming near the Jersey ...", "text": "(CNN) A massive great white shark has been recorded swimming off the New Jersey shore.\n\nThe shark is named Ironbound, after the West Ironbound Island near Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, where it was first spotted. The creature is 12 feet, 4 inches long and weighs an estimated 998 pounds, according to OCEARCH , a nonprofit marine research group that provides open-source data about shark migration.\n\nIronbound was first tagged on October 3, 2019 , in the waters around Nova Scotia. As part of its data collection process, OCEARCH captures and fits sharks with an electronic tracker that pings whenever they break the ocean surface.\n\nIronbound, migrating north, pinged in the waters off the coast of New Jersey about 10:30 p.m. on April 28.\n\nThe large fish is likely around 20 years old, according to Bob Hueter, chief scientist at OCEARCH. Although formidable, Ironbound isn't the biggest shark the organization has encountered: Hueter said that OCEARCH has tagged great white sharks as long as 17.5 feet and as heavy as 4,000 pounds.\n\n\"When we tagged him, he was impressive,\" Hueter said of the shark.\n\nIronbound has traveled an estimated 13,000 miles since the organization first started tracking his movements. \"He's gone back and forth from where we found him in Nova Scotia and the Florida Keys several times,\" Hueter said.\n\nHueter explained that great white sharks in the Atlantic Ocean make this migration each year, spending their summers in the northern waters near Canada and their winters as far south as the eastern Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"Ironbound is no exception,\" he said. In November, Ironbound pinged in the Pamlico Sound off the coast of North Carolina, and by March he had made it close to Georgia.\n\nAround this time of year, the sharks usually start moving north.\n\n\"They're moving north to the very rich feeding grounds off of Canada and the northeastern US,\" said Hueter. Ironbound will likely spend most of his summer and early fall in those northern waters around Nova Scotia before turning around and returning to Florida.\n\nThe migration \"is an adaptation, of course, to seasonal temperature fluxes, to where the food is,\" Hueter said. He said that while scientists aren't completely sure where great white sharks mate, they have theorized that it happens off the coast of the Carolinas during their journeys.\n\n\"Mating season is over, we think, and Ironbound is on his way north to get into some good feeding ground and bulk up again for the next year,\" Hueter said.\n\nGreat white sharks are an important piece of marine ecosystems.\n\n\"Sharks have been around for about 400 million years,\" Hueter said. \"They in many cases occupy what's called the apex predator position, in marine food webs. Just like on land, that is an important role in terms of keeping the lower parts of the food web healthy and balanced.\"\n\nAlthough shark populations fell sharply over the last four decades, great white shark populations have started to rebound on the East Coast, Hueter said. The animals, marked as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) , mostly face population decline due to overfishing.\n\nSharks are accidentally caught by fishermen and also face feeding problems due to the overfishing of their prey.\n\nOCEARCH uses data is gleans to learn about migration patterns and uncover previously unknown details about shark lives.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/05/08"}]}

Britons can travel to those on the green list without having to quarantine when they return. However, many of these destinations are not allowing foreign visitors.\n\nFully vaccinated Britons arriving in England from “amber list” countries no longer have to quarantine following a change to the rules that began on 19 July. Being fully vaccinated means “14 days have passed since your final dose of the vaccine”, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said last month.\n\nOnly jabs given by the NHS allowed quarantine-free travel under the amber-list system until 3 August, meaning UK residents vaccinated abroad were still required to quarantine on return from an amber-list country. However, a rule change now means people who have been fully vaccinated in the US and EU can travel without quarantining on arrival in the UK.\n\nUnder the new rules, fully vaccinated people travelling from amber-list destinations are still required to take a test three days before going home and on the second day after returning, but will now be exempted from a day-eight test.\n\nTory MPs and Labour responded with anger to the shelved plan to introduce another tier to the system known as an “amber travel watch-list”, Sky News says. The list would have comprised countries “which could move to the red list with little warning”.\n\nOne Tory MP told The Telegraph that the plan was “genuinely vote-losing stuff”, adding: “People are genuinely pissed off with this.” The plan to add a sixth tier also triggered a backlash from the travel industry, with bosses warning that holiday plans for countries on the list would be cancelled as travellers were unwilling to take the risk.\n\nThe government is still advising against any travel to red-list countries.\n\nWhat countries are on the green list?\n\nA “traffic light reshuffle” on 24 June “finally heralded some positive news for the travel industry”, with 16 new additions added to the UK’s green list, as The Independent reported when the changes kicked in.\n\nThe additions took the tally to 29 countries and territories, which are:\n\nAnguilla\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\n\nAustralia\n\nBarbados\n\nBermuda\n\nBritish Antarctic Territory\n\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory\n\nBrunei\n\nBulgaria\n\nCayman Islands\n\nCroatia\n\nDominica\n\nFalkland Islands\n\nFaroe Islands\n\nGibraltar\n\nGrenada\n\nHong Kong\n\nIceland\n\nIsrael and Jerusalem\n\nMadeira\n\nMalta\n\nMontserrat\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Georgia and South Sandwich Islands\n\nSt Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\n\nTaiwan\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands\n\nMore than half have been on the green “watch list”, which means that “if conditions change in any of the countries, they are at risk of being moved to the amber or red list”, the BBC explains.\n\nThe i says that a further 12 countries could also qualify to be added to the “green watch-list”, namely Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2021/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/shortlist-breyer-replacement-supreme-court/index.html", "title": "Biden said he will put a Black woman on the Supreme Court. Here's ...", "text": "(CNN) In what will be one of the most monumental endeavors of Joe Biden's presidency, the retirement of Stephen Breyer sets the stage for an immensely important decision by the President.\n\nBreyer's seat may be the only one that Biden fills on the Supreme Court , and it may not be one he fills at all -- if Republicans retake the Senate before the President's choice for a replacement is confirmed.\n\nBiden at the White House on Thursday confirmed the nominee will be the first Black woman on the high court.\n\n\"It's long overdue, in my opinion,\" the President said.\n\n\"Our process is going to be rigorous. I will select a nominee worthy of Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence and decency. While I've been studying candidates' backgrounds and writings, I've made no decision except one: the person I will nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity. And that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court,\" Biden said.\n\nA short list of potential nominees had been circulating Washington well before Breyer's retirement plans became public, and officials in the White House Counsel's office built files on various candidates in anticipation of a potential vacancy. Biden said he will make his choice by the end of February.\n\nThe White House is stacked with officials deeply familiar with the confirmation process, starting with Biden himself -- who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee -- as well as White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has experience both at the White House counsel's office and working for the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nWith Democrats holding the narrowest of majorities in the upper chamber, Biden will have to choose someone who can safely get 50 votes in the Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris could provide the tie-breaking vote if the Senate is split on the nomination). In addition to the vote count, Biden also has to keep an eye on the calendar. Senate Republicans are likely to retake the chamber in this year's midterms and have already signaled they would block a Biden nominee to the Supreme Court. It typically takes two to three months for a president to see his nominee confirmed by the Senate once he or she is named. The most recent justice, however, was confirmed in just a month and a half, as Senate Republicans rushed to get Justice Amy Coney Barrett approved before the 2020 election.\n\nGiven the disappointments that have been recently dealt to the progressives under the Biden administration -- between the congressional demise of the President's Build Back Better proposal and his failure to find a way forward on voting rights legislation -- Biden's choice for the Supreme Court gives him the opportunity to reinvigorate the democratic base. If his nominee is confirmed, Biden will secure a much-needed victory for his administration.\n\nHere are potential nominees who have been on observers' short list.\n\nDC Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson, nominee to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, testifies during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing.\n\nBiden has already elevated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson once, appointing her last year to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is considered the second-most powerful federal court in the country. Previously, the 51-year-old judge served on the federal district court in DC. Because of that appellate appointment, she's already been through a vetting process that included an interview with the President himself. Fittingly, she clerked for Breyer and holds degrees from Harvard and Harvard Law School. She also served as an assistant federal public defender, making her a prime example of the Biden's White House focus on appointing judges with backgrounds that are outside the typical prosecutor and Big Law box.\n\nAs a judge, Jackson has ruled on high profile cases including the Don McGahn congressional subpoena lawsuit (where, as a district court, she ordered the former Trump White House counsel to comply with the House's subpoena). As an appellate judge, she signed on to the recent opinion ordering the disclosure of Trump White House documents being sought by the House January 6 committee. The Supreme Court declined Trump's request that it reverse the decision in an order this month allowing the documents to be released.\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger\n\nIn this Dec. 22, 2014, photo, Leondra Kruger addresses the Commission of Judicial Appointments during her confirmation hearing to the California Supreme Court in San Francisco.\n\nKruger, now 45, was the youngest person to be appointed to the California Supreme Court when then-Gov. Jerry Brown nominated her in 2014.\n\nKruger is intimately familiar with the Supreme Court having worked as a clerk for the late Justice John Paul Stevens and served as acting deputy solicitor general in the Obama administration. While in the Solicitor General's office, she argued 12 cases in front of the Supreme Court representing the government. At the Justice Department, she also earned the Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service, the department's highest award for employee performance, in 2013 and 2014.\n\nAt the California Supreme Court, she has authored notable opinions on the 4th Amendment -- holding that law enforcement could not search a woman's purse without a warrant after she declined to provide a driver's license -- and upholding a California law that requires law enforcement to collect DNA samples as well as fingerprints from all persons arrested for or convicted of felony offenses.\n\nThough she is said to be well-liked among the alumni of the Solicitor General's office, she has not yet received the thorough vetting that other potential nominees have gone through.\n\nSouth Carolina US District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs\n\nJudge J. Michelle Childs, who was nominated by President Barack Obama to the U.S. District Court, listens during her nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, April 16, 2010.\n\nChilds , a judge on South Carolina's federal court, is said to have a major booster in House Majority Whip James Clyburn, a Biden ally who helped deliver South Carolina for the eventual nominee in the 2020 Democratic primary. Just last month, Biden nominated Childs to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the nomination remains pending.\n\nA graduate of the University of South Carolina School of Law, Childs does not have the Ivy League pedigree shared by eight of the nine justices. Her cheerleaders have touted her public-school education and other elements of her background as an advantage for Democrats, according to a 2021 New York Times report, and as a way to fight back against claims that the party has become too elitist in its makeup.\n\nIn addition to a decade spent in private practice, the 55-year-old served as a state court trial judge on the South Carolina Circuit, as the deputy director of the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, and as a commissioner on the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission.\n\nOther names that have been floated\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, a civil rights attorney who recently announced plans to step down from her role as President and Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, speaks with reporters outside the White House on July 8, 2021.\n\nAnita Earls, a 61-year-old North Carolina Supreme Court associate justice whose age would likely hamper serious consideration from Democrats looking to seat a younger nominee on the high court.\n\nAnita Earls, an associate justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina\n\nDistrict Judge Wilhelmina \"Mimi\" Wright, a judge on Minnesota's federal district court whose consideration would likely please Sen.

Then from Sunday, travellers will have to take a lateral flow test before the end of day two after arriving.\n\nOmicron is now so widespread in the UK that “testing has outlived its usefulness”, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News. “So we are able to withdraw it from international travel.”\n\nEluned Morgan, Wales’s minister for health and social services, confirmed that she had “reluctantly agreed” to the plans to follow England’s easing of testing rules, The Independent reported.

The lateral flow tests must be bought from a private test provider – free NHS tests are not allowed.\n\nThe rules for unvaccinated passengers have not changed. They will need to “continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and self-isolate for ten days”, the BBC reported.\n\nHow the travel industry reacted\n\nSpeaking on Twitter, travel expert Paul Charles said this is the change in government rules needed for a “bounce back in travel” and that “2022 is now looking very promising for recovery in the sector”.\n\nA “surge in holiday bookings” is expected in the coming weeks, The Independent said.

But some on social media are claiming not everyone is beholden to the new rules.\n\n\"Post office workers exempt from vaccine mandates...Are you paying attention yet,\" a Sept. 9 Facebook post reads.\n\nThe post, which attributes its information to The Washington Post, acquired more than 900 likes and 400 shares in two days.\n\nWhile the original assertion that postal workers were exempt from the vaccine mandate did come from a Washington Post reporter, that's false. Postal workers will be required to abide by the rules from the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The Washington Post reporter issued an update on social media and the story itself.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the post's creator for comment.\n\nPostal workers included under OSHA guidance, not executive order\n\nAs part of his plan to quash COVID-19, President Joe Biden announced a set of executive orders Sept. 9 that mandate vaccination for federal workers in the executive branch, as well as contractors.\n\nHe also said OSHA will issue an “emergency temporary standard” that will require businesses with more than 100 employees to fully vaccinate their workers or face weekly testing, a plan that could affect more than 80 million people.\n\nLearn more:Who's covered by Biden's new vaccine mandates? When do they go into effect? Here's what we know.\n\nShortly after the news broke, Washington Post reporter Jacob Bogage tweeted that an unnamed White House official told him postal workers would not be included in Biden's vaccine requirement, though they would be \"strongly encouraged\" to comply.\n\nUSPS has more than 600,000 employees, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nBut the Post reporter later issued an update on Twitter to reflect that the information was incorrect.\n\n\"JUST IN: White House official now says USPS workers ARE part of the federal vaccine mandate under OSHA jurisdiction, though technically not under the executive order,\" Bogage tweeted, adding that he had deleted the previous Twitter thread based on earlier reporting.\n\nMore:'Patience is wearing thin': Biden rolls out vaccine requirements that will affect 100 million workers\n\nBecause USPS is an independent agency within the executive branch, it does not fall under the jurisdiction of the executive order. But postal workers will still be subject to the OSHA requirements, White House officials confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\n“USPS is not included in the executive order requiring vaccination of federal employees,\" a White House spokesperson said in an email statement. \"USPS has a separate statutory scheme and is traditionally independent of federal personnel actions like this. That said, USPS is strongly encouraged to comply. Also, OSHA will cover USPS through the ETS, meaning that postal workers will be subject to the vaccination or testing policy announced yesterday.\"\n\nA spokesperson for USPS told USA TODAY in an email statement that the executive order doesn’t explicitly apply to the agency because of the same reasons outlined by the White House, adding that the agency is working with union leadership to determine how to implement OSHA's regulations.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nWe rate the claim that postal workers are exempt from the Biden administration's vaccine mandate FALSE, because it is not supported by our research.

Stellar credentials were essential, but Biden also wanted candidates who would bring a fresh professional and demographic diversity to benches across the country dominated by White males. He sought nominees who had worked as public defenders and civil rights attorneys, for instance.\n\nJackson -- then serving on a federal trial court in Washington, DC -- fit the bill perfectly. She had a glittering resume that included Harvard degrees and federal clerkships, but her lived experience was rooted in public service.\n\nLooming in the future was the possibility that Justice Stephen Breyer would retire from the Supreme Court , and the federal appeals court in Washington has been a stepping stone for high court nominees.\n\nBiden had pledged to make history by naming a Black woman to the Supreme Court. Such an historic move would highlight a group of female potential nominees who have breached barriers to reach the top of the legal profession. Jackson, who is African American and a former Breyer clerk, would likely be a top contender for that seat. An appeals court post would serve to further season her and boost her profile.\n\nAsked about race during her confirmation hearing last year, Jackson responded carefully. She said that she didn't think race played a role in the kind of judge that she had been or would be, but she thought her professional background, especially as a trial court judge, would bring value.\n\n\"I've experienced life in perhaps a different way than some of my colleagues because of who I am, and that might be valuable,\" she said. \"I hope it would be valuable if I was confirmed to the circuit court.\" Last June, the Senate confirmed Jackson by a 53-44 vote\n\nNow, Jackson, 51, is believed to be at the top of Biden's list of potential candidates to replace Breyer , who intends to retire at the end of the current Supreme Court term.\n\n\"The bench of Black women attorneys with stellar credentials is extremely deep,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. But, she noted, Jackson brings more than just a distinguished judicial record.\n\nShe has \"an understanding of how the law affects people based on both her professional and lived experiences, and a powerful commitment to equal justice,\" Wydra said.\n\nJackson has served as an assistant federal public defender, a commissioner on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a lawyer in private practice and on two prestigious federal courts.\n\nIf elevated to the high court, she would follow in the footsteps of the likes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who took the seats of the justices they had worked for.\n\nJackson clerked for Breyer during the 1999 term after serving as a clerk in 1997-1998 to Judge Bruce M. Selya, a federal judge in Massachusetts.\n\nAt an event in 2017 sponsored by the liberal American Constitution Society, she called working for Breyer an opportunity of a lifetime \"to bear witness to the workings of his brilliant legal mind.\" She also joked about how the justice often biked to work and would show up in his majestic chamber wearing \"full bicycle regalia.\"\n\nJackson often speaks about areas of her expertise in the law, when she addresses audiences, but she also talks about diversity and work-life balance.\n\nIn a 2017 speech at the University of Georgia School of Law, she reflected on her journey as a mother and a judge, emphasizing how hard it is for mothers to serve in big law firms -- something she said she had done at times to help support her family.\n\nShe noted that the hours are long and there is little control over the schedule, which is \"constantly in conflict with the needs of your children and your family.\" She also highlighted the traps of launching a career in the law and pointed to recent studies that show that lawyers of color -- both male and female -- constitute only 8% of law firm equity partners nationwide.\n\nGlittering resume\n\nJackson left law firm life behind in 2010 to become a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission, an independent agency that establishes sentencing policies and practices for the federal courts. She has said she learned to knit during her Senate confirmation process to channel her nervous energy.\n\nRachel Barkow, now a professor of law at New York University, served with Jackson on the bipartisan commission and noted pointedly how well the members worked together despite ideological differences. Another commissioner at the time was William H. Pryor Jr., a conservative judge who sits on the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nBarkow said Jackson was an \"upbeat presence\" who always does \"what she is supposed to do, when she says she is going to do it.\"\n\nAt the time, federal prisons were over capacity, and there was widespread bipartisan acknowledgement that federal drug sentences were too long. The seven-member body unanimously decided to lower federal drug sentences. They made the reductions retroactive, Barkow said, which meant more than 30,000 federal prisoners got lower sentences.\n\nPresident Barack Obama would go on to nominate Jackson to the US District Court for the District of Columbia, which she joined in 2013. For that confirmation hearing, she was introduced by a well-known Republican, Wisconsin's Paul Ryan, who would go on to become speaker of the House and who happened to be related to her by marriage. (Jackson's husband's twin brother is married to the sister of Ryan's wife.)\n\n\"I know she is clearly qualified,\" Ryan said. \"But it bears repeating just how qualified she is.\"\n\n\"Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, is unequivocal,\" he added.\n\nAt each of her judicial confirmation hearings, her husband, Patrick Jackson, a DC-based surgeon, has been pictured sitting behind her. The couple share two daughters, Talia and Leila. Her mother, a former public school science teacher and principal of a public magnet school in South Florida, and her father, a public high school teacher who was later chief counsel to the Miami-Dade County school board, also have been in attendance.\n\nIn 2008, when she was in private practice and well before she became a judge, Jackson referred her uncle's file to WilmerHale, a law firm that handles numerous clemency petitions, according to a spokesperson for the firm.\n\nThe firm submitted the petition on Brown's behalf on October 7, 2014, and Obama commuted his sentence on November 22, 2016. According to the firm, Jackson had \"no further involvement in the matter\" after making the referral. Jackson's chambers said she would decline comment on the issue.\n\nPublic service\n\nAt her 2021 confirmation hearing for the seat on the federal appeals court, Jackson talked about her professional trajectory, peppered with stints in public service.\n\nAsked why she had chosen to go into public service earlier in her career, she said, \"I remember thinking very clearly that I felt like I didn't have enough of an idea of what really happened in criminal cases, I wanted to understand the system.\"\n\n\"I thought it would be an opportunity to help people as well, I come from a background of public service. My parents were in public service my brother was a police officer and in the military and being in the public defenders office felt very much like the opportunity to help with my skills and talents,\" Jackson added.\n\nShe said the experience had made her a better judge because she remembered that many of her clients hadn't really understood what had happened to them in the system. As a trial judge, Jackson said, she took extra care to communicate with the defendants who came before her. \"I speak to them directly,\" she said, because \"I want them to know what is going on.\"\n\nA.J. Kramer worked with Jackson at the Federal Public Defender's office in DC and still keeps in touch with her. He said no current member of the Supreme Court has worked as a public defender and \"seen the system from that side of the aisle\".\n\n\"It's not that you have more or less sympathy,\" Kramer said in an interview, \"but that you have an idea how the system actually works.\"\n\nConfirmation hearing and discussion of race and being a judge\n\nAt her most recent Senate hearing, there were no real fireworks, but instead, an air of the inevitability of her confirmation. Republicans spent more time attacking the Biden administration or Democrats in general than targeting Jackson.\n\nTexas GOP Sen. John Cornyn did ask Jackson about professional diversity and race.\n\nHe said her experience as a trial judge would be a \"very important qualification\" and praised her \"impressive\" background. Cornyn added that it was important for the public to have confidence in the judiciary \"and I think part of that confidence is knowing that people like them can serve on the bench and that we applaud that diversity.\"\n\nBut Cornyn later said that \"since our Democratic colleagues seem to be placing so much emphasis on race,\" he wanted to know something else. \"What role does race play, Judge Jackson, in the kind of judge you have been and the kind of judge you will be?\"\n\nWithout skipping a beat, Jackson said, \"I don't think that race plays a role in the kind of judge that I have been and that I would be in the way you asked that question.\"\n\n\"I'm looking at the arguments, the facts and the law, I'm methodically and intentionally setting aside personal views, any other inappropriate considerations and I would think that race would be the kind of thing that would be inappropriate to inject in my evaluation of a case,\" she continued.\n\n\"I would say that my different professional background than many of the court of appeals judges, including my district court background,\" she said, \"would bring value.\"\n\n\"I've experienced life in perhaps a different way than some of my colleagues because of who I am and that might be valuable -- I hope it would be valuable if I was confirmed to the circuit court, \" she added.\n\nTennessee GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn brought up early rumors about the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I know you are fully aware that you are discussed regularly as a Supreme Court nominee\", Blackburn said before asking what the judge thought about recent proposals -- driven by Democrats to try to dilute the conservative majority on the high court -- to add more justices to the bench.\n\nJackson declined to comment.\n\nIn follow-up written questions, she was asked whether a number of Supreme Court cases, including those that concern abortion, religious liberty and the Second Amendment, were correctly decided. She said that as a federal judge all of the Supreme Court's pronouncements would be binding and that it would be inappropriate to comment on the \"merits or demerits\" of particular cases. But she made exceptions, including for Brown v. Board of Education -- the landmark 1954 opinion that struck down school segregation and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. She said the ruling overturned the \"manifest injustice\" of Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\n\"The underlying premise of the Brown decision -- i.e. that 'separate but equal is inherently unequal' -- is beyond dispute and judges can express their agreement with that principle without calling into question their ability to apply the law faithfully to cases raising similar issues,\" Jackson said.\n\nShe was also pressed on the fact that as an assistant federal public defender she represented a detainee held at Guantanamo Bay, Khi Ali Gul. She said that as an attorney she had a duty to represent her clients zealously but also was mindful of the \"tragic and deplorable circumstances\" that gave rise to the U.S. government's apprehension of persons secured at Gitmo. She noted that she was \"keenly aware\" of the threat the September 11, 2001, attacks posed on \"foundational constitutional principles \"and that her own brother at the time was enlisted as a U.S. Army infantryman deployed in Iraq.\n\nShe also provided senators a citation for an interview she gave in 2007 to The Washington Post for a story about Justice Clarence Thomas -- the only African American currently on the high court.\n\nAccording to the article, she recalled sitting across from Thomas at lunch once -- the date of the encounter was not revealed -- with a quizzical expression on her face.\n\n\"Jackson, who is black, said Thomas 'spoke the language,' meaning he reminded her of the black men she knew. 'But I just sat there the whole time thinking: 'I don't understand you. You sound like my parents. You sound like the people I grew up with.' But the lessons he tended to draw from the experiences of the segregated South seemed to be different than those of everybody I know,'\" the article read.\n\nRepublicans who ended up voting to confirm her to the DC Circuit were Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nOpinions\n\nThrough her service on the DC district and appeals courts, Jackson has been involved in recent litigation involving former President Donald Trump and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nOn the appeals court, she voted against Trump when his lawyers sought to block records related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot from going to the House select committee investigating the attack. The Supreme Court later cleared the way for the records to be released. In August, she voted to allow Biden's eviction moratorium -- put in place during the pandemic -- to remain in place. The Supreme Court later blocked it over the dissent of the court's three liberals.\n\nWhile on the district court, Jackson penned more than 500 opinions.\n\nIn one notable case, she ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to block then-White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying as part of Congress' impeachment probe.\n\n\"Presidents are not kings,\" she said in the 2019 opinion, adding that the Trump administration's assertion that it had \"absolute testimonial immunity\" protecting its senior level aides \"is a proposition that cannot be squared with core constitutional values\" and \"cannot be sustained.\"\n\nShe concluded that the \"United States of America has a government of laws, not of men.\"\n\nIn a separate case from 2018 brought by federal employee unions challenging executive orders issued by Trump, Jackson held that most but not all of the provisions in the orders conflicted with the collective bargaining rights of federal workers under federal law. Her judgment was vacated by the appeals court.\n\nIn Make the Road New York v. McAleenan, Jackson ruled against the Trump administration in a case brought by the ACLU and other immigrant rights groups that were challenging the Department of Homeland Security's decision to expand the categories of non-citizens who could be subject to expedited removal procedures without being able to appear before a judge. The groups said the orders had sparked fear in immigrant communities around the county. The federal appeals court agreed that Jackson's court had the power to rule over the case, but reversed her decision, holding that DHS had the discretion to act.\n\nShe also sentenced Edgar Maddison Welch to 48 months in prison in 2017 after he fired an assault rifle inside a Washington, DC, pizzeria.

The grid operator expects summer demand to reach 124 gigawatts, though there will be only 119 gigawatts of available energy.\n\nIt warned that Iowa's largest utilities, MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy, as well as dozens of municipal and rural electric cooperatives, may be asked to cut power to customers if demand appears on track to exceed available electricity.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting above-average temperatures for Iowa through August.\n\nAlliant Energy, whose Iowa subsidiary, Interstate Power & Light, is in Cedar Rapids, noted in a filing with the Iowa Utilities Board that Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin have capacity that exceeds required reserves, while Illinois, Missouri, Indiana and Michigan do not. But MISO members have agreed to provide power — and curtail usage throughout the grid — to prevent widespread outages like those that occurred in Texas in the winter of 2020-21, leaving millions of people in the dark and leading to the deaths of more than 200 people.\n\nWhile the greatest risk of summer outages is in the Midwest, most of the western U.S. will be at moderate risk, NERC said. That forecast includes Southwest Power Pool, another grid operator that includes part of western Iowa.\n\nMore:Des Moines City Council approves franchise agreement extensions with MidAmerican Energy\n\nSummer outages 'won't be perceived well,' Iowa Utilities Board member warns\n\nJoshua Byrnes, an Iowa Utilities Board member, urged utilities Tuesday to prepare customers for the possibility of outages.\n\n\"People aren't used to conversations about shedding load\" through outages, Byrnes said. \"We're used to things like ice storms and our electricity going off — or weather-related issues. This is something new … and it won't be perceived well.\"\n\nIowa utility leaders told state regulators they anticipate having enough energy to meet consumer demand for electricity. But if MISO calls for reducing energy use — or for outages — they have plans in place to comply.\n\nFor example, MidAmerican has a program that will cut 25% of its peak demand, said Dan Custer, director of MidAmerican's electrical system control. But he said the system won't disrupt service to critical facilities such as hospitals.\n\nOfficials said service would be disrupted for only about an hour at a time before rolling on to another group of customers, if required by MISO.\n\nWhether the shortage of power will result in increased bills is unclear. MidAmerican and Alliant both said the cost of providing electricity is rising as the price of fuel climbs. Natural gas, for instance, costs twice what it did a year ago. MidAmerican said it does not expect consumer prices to climb, but Alliant didn't respond to questions about the effect on consumers.\n\nMore:Iowan Greg Abel is a ‘regular guy’ with a ‘shocking workload.’ He’s also Warren Buffett’s chosen successor.\n\nMidAmerican officials and other utility representatives said they are unable to specifically prevent electricity losses to homes of customers who need power for medical equipment, but added that most devices are backed up by batteries that last six to eight hours — sufficient to carry them through the hour-long outages.\n\nBecause the Ames Electric Department is a municipal utility, director Don Kom said the city's fire department reaches out to customers with medical equipment to ensure it's reconnected.\n\nNoting that central Iowa has several Facebook data centers, Byrnes asked Custer if the leading social media site would continue getting power \"so people can complain about not having power.\"\n\nCuster said cutting power to a large user like Facebook may be more of a reduction than MISO would require.\n\nMore:As big business keeps getting bigger, how 2 Iowa electric cooperatives find success staying small\n\nIn connection with the expected shortages, some groups voiced concern about the country's push to renewable energy.\n\nThe Iowa Association of Municipal Utilities, representing 135 city power providers, urged a sensible, balanced transition to renewable energy that \"must not sacrifice reliability, as we are now experiencing.\"\n\n\"The risk to human life and livelihood caused by an unreliable system is significant, as is the tremendous economic impact on customers,\" the association said in a filing with the utilities board.\n\nThat debate is playing out in Iowa, which gets nearly 60% of its energy from wind, the largest share in the nation. While MidAmerican Energy has aggressively adopted wind energy, for example, it's also resisted environmental groups' calls for to retire more coal generation plants, saying it needs to retain them to ensure service reliability.\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

Here's ...", "text": "Christopher Elliott\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nLook at your travel itinerary closely. Notice anything different? That's right, your hotel reservation may be totally nonrefundable. Yes, even during a pandemic.\n\nSo if you have second thoughts about traveling, and want to get a refund on a nonrefundable hotel room, you might be out of luck.\n\nSometimes, you don't even have a choice. Consider what happened to Liam Goodman. He booked a last-minute nonrefundable hotel room in New York from Priceline. When the property ran out of rooms and he had to stay in another hotel, Priceline pocketed his money.\n\n\"Priceline says I never checked in and was a no-show,\" says Goodman, a photographer from Beacon, New York.\n\n► USA TODAY Travel newsletter: Get the latest headlines in your inbox daily\n\nNonrefundable hotel rooms are becoming more common\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that nonrefundable (or \"prepaid\") hotel rooms are becoming more common. No one tracks and reports the number of nonrefundable hotel rooms in a systematic way. The deal is simple: You pay in advance for the hotel room(s) and you get a modest discount. There's no chance for a refund, even if you change your mind within 24 hours of making the reservation, unlike airlines.\n\nOK, did you check your itinerary yet? If you're stuck with one of these nonrefundable hotel rooms, don't worry. There are ways to get your money back. But maybe the best strategy is to avoid these tricky hotel reservations in the first place.\n\nGoodman wishes he had. He could have avoided the trouble by asking his original hotel to \"walk\" him to a comparable property, which is a hotel industry standard practice. Instead, he contacted Priceline for help – and it turned him down. I asked Priceline about his case. It reviewed its records and discovered that he wasn't a no-show, after all. The online agency offered him a full refund.\n\n► Small planes, cheap tickets but no help by phone: The inside scoop on budget-friendly Breeze Airways\n\nSo you want a refund for a nonrefundable room?\n\nI asked frequent travelers how they've received refunds for nonrefundable rooms. Turns out, many of them were able to get their money back under certain circumstances.\n\nWhen the hotel isn't as advertised. I've seen many cases where the hotel fell short of expectations. All bets are off when that happens. Take a lot of photos and appeal to the highest level possible – and if necessary to your credit card company. If the answer is still \"no,\" you might be able to salvage your stay. For example, when Heidi Vanderlee discovered she'd have to share a bathroom with another guest in her London hotel, she appealed to her online travel agent. After a lot of back and forth, the online agency fixed her reservation, allowing her to upgrade to quarters with a private bathroom. \"Could have been a much worse outcome,\" says Vanderlee, a publicist who lives in New York.\n\nWhen you're sick. That's what Grant Sabatier discovered recently when he fell ill and canceled a nonrefundable hotel room in Washington, D.C. A valid medical excuse can secure a full refund, particularly if it's COVID-19. But he had to call the hotel three times before it saw things his way. \"This has only worked for me when booking directly with a hotel,\" adds Sabatier, the founder of the financial advice site Millennial Money.\n\n► Bad news for United passengers: Airline says 3,000 employees COVID-19 positive, plans more flight cuts\n\nWhen your circumstances change. Hotels understand that your plans can change. Chris Michaels recently asked for a refund for two nonrefundable nights at a chain hotel in Chicago. \"In a friendly manner, I explained to a front-desk employee that I was part of the large tournament in town and that my team had been eliminated from the tournament. I also said I was a rewards member of the chain, and I've stayed at that location in the past,\" recalls Michaels, the founder of a personal finance site Frugal Reality. \"The hotel offered to charge me a $50 cleaning fee to get out of the remaining balance for the night. Needless to say, I paid it and headed home.\"\n\nWhen you have a death in the family. But don't expect it to be easy. Alex Beene had to cancel a nonrefundable reservation once because a relative died. The hotel forwarded him to a \"skeptical\" manager. \"But when I offered to provide documentation, he offered to go on and refund my stay and offered me condolences,\" says Beene, who works for the state of Tennessee. \"Just the idea that you have written justification for canceling a nonrefundable stay will show the hotel how serious you are about the claim.\"\n\n► 'We found out while we were flying': Last-minute cruise cancellations leave travelers scrambling\n\nWhat if you don't have a case?\n\nFace it, most of the time people just want a refund on a nonrefundable room without a valid reason. And why not? Hotels can often resell the rooms, so it's only fair that we should receive at least some of the money back, right?\n\nFrequent hotel guests like Anna DiTommaso, who owns a web design firm in Dallas, say it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n\"The hotel has the legal right to keep the money,\" she says. \"But I've found that if you have a reasonable excuse for canceling the room, most places will offer you a refund without you even having to ask.\"\n\nI agree. \"Prepaid\" rooms and nonrefundable rates are not customer-friendly. The discounts are too small, and the risks too big. Often, guests don't even know they have a nonrefundable rate until it's too late. Yep, hotels bury the terms in their fine print, just like other travel companies.\n\nBottom line: Nonrefundable hotel rooms shouldn't exist. But they do. Now you may have a way around them.\n\n► Hours in line or a $110 test: How the COVID test shortage is 'frustrating' Puerto Rico visitors\n\n3 ways avoid getting stuck with a nonrefundable room\n\nTravel insurance. If you have to cancel your hotel stay for a covered reason, you can receive reimbursement for your nonrefundable hotel cost from your insurance company. Seven Corners CEO Justin Tysdal recommends a \"cancel for any reason\" benefit. \"It allows you to cancel your trip for any reason you wish,\" he says. \"That way, should anything unexpected occur, you can cancel your trip and receive at least 75% of your nonrefundable trip cost back.\"\n\nChange the date of your reservation. Sometimes, nonrefundable hotel rooms can be changed to a future date. Andy Abramson, who runs a communications firm in Los Angeles, says for some hotels, once you move the date you can ask for – and receive a refund. \"I've used this trick several times.\"\n\nResell the room. Yes, it's possible. \"You can resell your nonrefundable hotel bookings to other people and receive a refund that way,\" says Galena Stavreva, CEO of SpareFare.net, which facilitates these room changes. She says hotels allow for changes of the name of the main guest under the reservation. Booking.com and Expedia facilitate name changes as well. You can recover some or all of your hotel room costs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/14"}]}

He had taken for granted the things that enriched his life such as love, friendship and the conveniences of a modern world.\n\nIt was only after surviving and his return to a life he had left behind that he truly appreciated what mattered to him, and embarked on a new journey filled with hope, uncertainty and promise.\n\nThis sentiment embodies the current life of a restaurateur and I am sure the thousands of entrepreneurs across the country.\n\nCOVID-19 has taken its toll on many industries and has shown no mercy for the restaurant business. We have seen our dining rooms get restricted to 10 percent, shut down completely, brought back to 25 percent and now 50 percent capacity.\n\nWe had to furlough much of our office staff temporarily as well as much of our service staff due to a lack of in-house guests. We helped our employees get set up on unemployment, which proved to be a difficult and frustrating task. Many of our employees who were furloughed did not receive a check for up to eight weeks.\n\nWe reached out to our partners, vendors and manufacturers to see if they could offer food donations to support our employees who were out of work. The outpouring of generosity was awe-inspiring and confirmed the goodness of so many people we get to work with every day.\n\nOur partners at the Jaguars, Jumbo Shrimp, Icemen, JU, UNF, and local radio stations all put out media on our behalf helping to promote our takeout and delivery business during our time of need.\n\nServing on the Board of Feeding Northeast Florida, it became apparent there was a dire need to feed the seniors in our community who were at-risk and unable to leave their homes. They were food insecure and had no way of being provided with healthy meals.\n\nWe were able to create Project Share and through the generosity of organizations like the Chartrand Foundation, VyStar, The Insetta Family and many others, grants were procured to deliver food from the Food Bank to local restaurants. That food was turned into tens of thousands of healthy meals for seniors, at-risk children and many others. Many restaurant employees were able to come back to work and receive a paycheck while literally producing life-saving meals for those in need. The soul and purpose of this project lifted our employees' spirits during an otherwise stressful and anxiety-laden time.\n\nThe health and wellness of our customers and staff are paramount and we have taken as many precautions as we can to ensure a safe and clean workplace. Due to a lack of professional guidelines in many of the states we have restaurants, we came up with our own protocols for safety.\n\nWe take the temperature of every employee as they arrive for work, we mandate masks and gloves, use disposable menus only, clean frequently the dining room, use plexiglass partitions and follow mandatory protocols in the event we have an employee show symptoms or test positive. The restaurant experience is based exclusively on hospitality and making guests feel welcome while providing them with the best culinary experience we are capable of.\n\nShared ownership develops when guests talk about a restaurant as if it's theirs. They cannot wait to share it with friends, and what they're really sharing, beyond the culinary experience, is the experience of feeling important and loved.\n\nAll these protocols have made it difficult and awkward to achieve our normal expectations of hospitality, but we are certainly striving to do our best every day under the circumstances. Our online ordering and third-party delivery have been the lifeline we have counted on for the last few months. We are fortunate we have been set up for many years on these platforms and our staff has vast training in making that an outstanding experience for our customers.\n\nWe continue to innovate with better packaging, new menu offerings and a new design prototype we hope to unveil in 2021.\n\nWe feel that due to the “new normal” in the restaurant industry, these trends will continue to dominate for years to come.\n\nThanks to the loyal and continued support of our customers, Bono’s will survive this strange and unusual time. We believe that we are never lost if we can find each other. Just like Chuck in “Castaway,” whenever we come out the other side of this time in our lives we will do so with a renewed perspective. We will appreciate all our many good fortunes and give no thought to the mindless minutia that unconsciously consumed us before.\n\nWe are determined to live an intentional life. We are here to truly live, not surrender. To embrace meaning. To love unconditionally. To give without expectation. To participate, not watch. To create, not copy. To be unapologetically who we are. To rise up, and help others rise.\n\nI believe that this moment seeds every moment. Vulnerability is a virtue. Presence beats presents. Compassion is a gateway to connection. Life is a co-creative process. With rare exceptions, everything is better when it is shared.\n\nThe best way to cope with loss is to treasure what you have right in front of you. These things I know. These things, on my best days, I aspire to live. We are now and always will be a work in progress. In other words, we are human.\n\nWhat happens next is up to all of us and I believe we are ready.\n\nJosh Martino is president of Bono’s Pit Bar-B-Q and Willie Jewell’s Old School Bar-B-Q.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/02/01/8-crazy-survival-movies-watch-arctic-cast-away/2748184002/", "title": "'Arctic' to 'Cast Away': 8 crazy survival movies to watch", "text": "Did icicles form on your eyebrows during those polar vortex-level snowstorms? Was your coffee run akin, at least in the moment, to climbing Everest?\n\nSit back and let Hollywood fight the elements for you. Here are eight epic survival movies – both old and new – that pit man against nature.\n\n1. 'Arctic'\n\nThe latest drop-a-guy-into-the-freezing-mountains flick is \"Arctic,\" a nail-biter of a wintry tale starring Mads Mikkelsen, who plays a pilot stranded in the Arctic after a plane crash. His survival skills are impressive. He ice fishes! He turns his crashed plane into a cabin! He duels it out with a polar bear! But when a rescue chopper crashes instead of rescuing him, forcing him to care for its half-dead co-pilot, his will to survive is tested. (In theaters now.)\n\n2. 'Free Solo' (2018)\n\nNo rope? No problem. \"Free Solo\" is the Oscar-nominated documentary everyone's talking about this year. In the film, a 15-person crew follows free climber Alex Honnold as he takes on a daring climb up the face of El Capitan – without any safety gear. Gulp. (\"Free Solo\" is in IMAX theaters nationwide through Thursday.)\n\nMore:How 'Free Solo' filmmakers avoided killing Alex Honnold as he climbed without a rope\n\n3. 'The Mountain Between Us' (2017)\n\nBring on the streaming picks! In the film adaptation of the 2011 novel by Charles Martin, Idris Elba plays an in-demand surgeon whose flight is canceled, opposite Kate Winslet, playing a bride-to-be photojournalist afraid of missing her wedding. Despite rampant weather warnings, the two strangers decide to charter a jet from Idaho – and are left with only each other when the plane goes down. This adventure film is also kind of a love story, and (bonus!) it has an adorable dog.\n\n4. 'The Martian' (2015)\n\nEnter the space survival movie! Only Matt Damon could make a man trapped alone on Mars entertaining for two hours straight. From planting his own spuds on a lifeless planet to producing water and breathable air, Damon makes for an intergalactic MacGyver. (P.S. Did you know the film shot partially in Jordan's red desert?)\n\n5. 'The Revenant' (2015)\n\nOK, so \"The Revenant\" isn't technically a survival movie. But a heavily bearded Leonardo DiCaprio crawls, swims and limps through the brutal winter in Canada as he plays 19th-century frontiersman Hugh Glass. Plus, he fights a bear!\n\n6. '127 Hours' (2010)\n\nJames Franco entered the Oscar race after portraying the true story of Aron Ralston, a man who went hiking solo in Utah and got stuck under a boulder in an isolated canyon. Trapped with only a limited supply of food and water, Franco makes it all too real as his hiker debates when and how to cut off an arm to escape.\n\n7. 'All Is Lost' (2013)\n\nLooking for peril at sea? Robert Redford is the man of the hour in \"All Is Lost,\" a ship disaster flick in which he plays an unnamed sailor facing a series of worsening crises on the Indian Ocean. Alone in the elements for eight days, Redford's character, while barely uttering a word, fights to survive alone in a 39-foot sailboat in this captivating, nail-biting thriller.\n\n8. 'Cast Away' (2000)\n\nAnd finally, we end with Tom Hanks' harrowing \"Cast Away,\" a now-touchstone survival film about a FedEx engineer stranded on a tropical island. Hanks gives a tour de force performance playing Chuck, a man determined to survive – and stay sane – as he spends four years alone in the tropics.

Reed took the oath of office after easily winning the mayoral runoff last month. He is the first black mayor of a city that was the first capital of the Confederacy and later the birthplace of the civil rights movement. “We are assembled here because we chose destiny over division. Today, we are assembled here because we chose the future over fear,” Reed said. In a nod to his history-making win, Reed said his inauguration was an event that the enslaved people who were once sold on the banks of the Alabama River just a few feet from his inauguration ceremony “could only have imagined.” Reed is the first black mayor of the city where Southern delegates voted to form the Confederacy in 1861.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The city has been well represented in pageants this year, as the newly crowned Miss Alaska USA 2020 and Miss Alaska Teen USA 2020 both hail from the city. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports Hannah Carlile accepted the Miss Alaska USA crown, and Jadyn Fraser was awarded the Miss Alaska Teen USA crown. Officials say the Nov. 2 pageant in Anchorage was a preliminary event to the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants. Carlile is a graduate student at Vanderbilt University pursuing a master’s degree in international education policy and management. Fraser is a graduate of West Valley High School who says she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to advocate for people with depression, anxiety and other diseases.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s rural students are graduating from high school at one of the lowest rates in the nation, according to a new report. The Rural School and Community Trust’s biennial nationwide examination of America’s rural schools, “Why Rural Matters,” pinpoints how states can improve the quality of education in rural areas. A little more than 50,000 of Arizona’s 1.1 million public district and charter school students attend rural schools, according to the report. The state’s rural four-year high school graduation rate increased from 77.5% to 81.8% from the 2015-2016 report to the 2018-2019 report. But while the rate increased, the state ranks as the fifth-worst in the nation for the percentage of seniors who graduate from high school in four years. The average four-year high school graduation rate nationally for rural districts is 88.7%.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Democratic candidate hoping to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton has dropped out of the race, citing a family health concern. Josh Mahony announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he was dropping out of the race, hours after the filing deadline for Arkansas expired. Mahony did not immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday afternoon. Mahony was the only Democrat who had filed to run against Cotton. The announcement leaves Democrats without a candidate to challenge Cotton, who was first elected to the Senate in 2014. Mahony had badly trailed Cotton in fundraising and faced an uphill challenge in the solidly red state. Mahony last year unsuccessfully challenged Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Womack in northwest Arkansas.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A man who spent 11 years in prison for a series of armed robberies he didn’t commit was exonerated Tuesday after prosecutors agreed he had been wrongly convicted. A courtroom full of family members and friends erupted in applause as Ruben Martinez Jr. was found innocent and walked free from Los Angeles Superior Court. The rare reversal of fortune after all appeals had been exhausted came about after Martinez’s wife, who had been a secretary for the Sheriff’s Department, and a close friend who was a retired homicide detective prevailed on prosecutors to review the case. Investigators then tracked down alibi witnesses who said Martinez was at work during some of the crimes that were believed to have been committed by a serial robber. A jubilant Martinez, 49, said his prayers had been answered, and he was not a bitter man. He thanked his wife, Maria.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: The University of Colorado at Boulder has announced that the school’s live buffalo mascot, Ralphie V, will retire. The Daily Camera reports Tuesday’s announcement came after the 13-year-old buffalo did not lead the football team onto Folsom Field in the last two games. The university has not yet found a replacement. University officials say Ralphie V is in great health and receives regular check-ups but was not showing the same consistency as in previous years. They cited safety concerns for her and her handlers. Ralphie V, who came to the university in 2007 and led the team in 76 games, will live on a ranch alongside a companion buffalo. She is the fifth buffalo in the Ralphie program, which launched in 1967.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new state report indicates consumers are remembering to bring their own bags to the supermarket. Revenue estimates released Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget office and the legislative Office of Fiscal Analysis project the new 10-cent fee for disposable plastic bags will generate $7 million in the current fiscal year, not the $27.7 million included in the state budget. Office of Policy and Management Secretary Melissa McCaw says the 75% drop in anticipated revenue from the tax is not a sign of economic weakness. Rather, she says consumers and businesses have adapted to the goal of reducing the number of these non-recyclable bags in the environment. The same report shows consumer spending is stronger, with sales tax revenues estimated to be $46.8 million higher than originally budgeted.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The company responsible for a toxic gas leak that shut down the Delaware Memorial Bridge for hours last November has been given the go-ahead to restart its chemical plant along the Delaware River. Croda Inc., which operates in the Atlas Point chemical facility at the base of the bridge, had started manufacturing a highly flammable and explosive chemical called ethylene oxide just months before the Thanksgiving weekend leak. It has not been making the bio-based chemical, which is used in other products manufactured at the plant, on-site since the accident. Officials with the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control on Wednesday announced that the company could resume its ethylene oxide production after an investigation of the leak and making required safety and monitoring improvements.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Some bars in the nation’s capital have been screening the first public impeachment inquiry hearing into President Donald Trump’s Ukraine dealings and offering related specials. The inquiry into Trump’s actions toward Ukraine was being broadcast Wednesday, allowing the public its first glimpse into testimony about whether Trump used foreign policy for personal and political gain. News outlets report at least half a dozen bars were screening the 10 a.m. hearing, with some even opening early. Attendees could choose from a variety of themed specials, such as Union Pub’s “ImPEACHment Please” and The Partisan’s combo that features Colonel E. H. Taylor whiskey. The whiskey was chosen for Ukraine Ambassador William Taylor, who was testifying Wednesday along with George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary in Washington.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: Donald Trump isn’t the only president facing an impeachment inquiry. The student body president of the University of Florida is facing an impeachment threat for spending $50,000 in student fees to bring Trump’s eldest son and his girlfriend to campus. Members of the university’s student senate on Tuesday filed a resolution to impeach Student Body President Michael Murphy for malfeasance and abuse of power. The resolution accuses Murphy of spending mandatory student fees to push his own political beliefs when he brought Donald Trump Jr., and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, to speak on campus last month. The resolution says Student Body statutes forbid student money from being spent in support of or against a political party. The Tampa Bay Times reports Murphy has maintained that the visit wasn’t campaign-related.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city is seeking an artist to create 30 drawings or paintings of the victims of the Atlanta child murders that terrorized the city in the 1970s and ’80s. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the exhibit honoring the victims, mostly black boys, will be displayed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The Mayor’s Office of Cultural Affairs is sponsoring the project, which will net the artist $18,000. Eligible artists must live in Fulton or DeKalb counties and submit a digital photo and drawing of 13-year-old Clifford Jones. Clifford’s death led city police to recognize the slayings were connected and part of a pattern. Wayne Williams was convicted in two of the deaths. Many of the cases remain unsolved. Applications are due by Nov. 22.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources is expected to seek funding from the Legislature to establish ocean access at a boat ramp cut off by the Kilauea eruption. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports the Pohoiki boat ramp facility on the Big Island closed shortly after Kilauea began erupting in May 2018. Officials say the only ramp between Hilo and Milolii became landlocked, affecting the ability of fishermen to access the ocean. Officials say a short-term proposal involves driving sheet-pile walls into the ground on either side of the ramp entrance and dredging the channel. The department estimates a cost of $8 million to $9 million. A long-term solution under consideration involves a new boat ramp on the north side of Pohoiki Bay.\n\nIdaho\n\nChallis: Nearly 300 wild horses have been captured in central Idaho as part of a plan by federal land managers to reduce the number of wild horses roaming the area to about 185. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management says 295 wild horses were rounded up over seven days ending Monday in the Challis Herd Management Area near the town of Challis. Aerial census flights are planned this week to determine the number of wild horses remaining in the area. The agency says balancing herd size with what the 260-square-mile management area can support will help protect habitat for wildlife species such as sage grouse, pronghorn antelope, mule deer and elk. The agency says mares released back into the management area will be treated with fertility control, and horses not released will be readied for an adoption and sale program.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state’s environmental agency is enlisting fifth and sixth grade students to educate people about how algae affects bodies of water using art or language. The theme for this year’s contest held by the Illinois Environment Protection Agency is “Algae: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly … How Can You Keep Your Local Pond Healthy?” Students’ work can be in the form of a poster, a poem or other writing. Each school can enter up to four posters and four written entries. The deadline to submit entries is Feb. 3. The winners’ entries will be featured on the agency’s website. All finalists will be invited to an awards ceremony in Springfield in April, and their work will be displayed this spring at the Old State Capitol.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Indiana University officials say enrollment in online courses has soared during the past decade across the school’s campuses even as overall student enrollment has dropped. School research shows total enrollment of degree-seeking students at IU campuses fell by nearly 5% from the fall of 2011 to the fall of 2019. But The Herald-Times reports the number of students taking at least one online course has more than doubled during the same time. IU’s online education director Chris Foley noted that most students who take online classes are undergraduates and typically in their early 20s. Administrators say IU must continue to prioritize growth in its online space as students’ expectations change and the university prepares for a decline in the number of high school graduates.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Regulators have recommended a nearly $73,000 fine against the Iowa Department of Human Services after finding serious workplace safety violations at a state-run psychiatric hospital where several employees have been assaulted by combative patients. Staffers at the Independence Mental Health Institute struggle to manage violent outbursts due to inadequate emergency response plans, low staffing levels, poor communication and ineffective safety shields that they’re not trained to use, according to an inspection conducted by the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 61, a union that represents hospital employees, said the institute faced an urgent “safety crisis” after employees were injured in at least four incidents over nine days in June.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state transportation agency says Kansas hit a 10-year high for deer-related crashes last year. The agency says 10,734 deer-related wrecks were reported in 2018. The Department of Transportation says that accounted for 16.5% of total wrecks for the year. The department’s big game coordinator, Levi Jaster, said the increase in crashes is partly due to an increase in the deer population. Disease reduced the population beginning in 2008 until 2013, which is when the agency recorded the lowest number of deer-related wrecks in the past 10 years. The Wichita Eagle reports the deer population has been increasing since then. Three people died in deer-related accidents last year. The highest number of deer-related wrecks in 2018 was in Sedgwick County, which had 418.\n\nKentucky\n\nWinchester: A principal who once made headlines for trying to ban books with what he deemed inappropriate content has been indicted on child pornography charges. News outlets reported Tuesday that a grand jury charged 54-year-old Phillip Todd Wilson, principal of the Clark County Area Technology Center, with 17 child pornography possession and distribution charges. Kentucky State police filed 15 counts each of the charges against Wilson in August. Clark County Schools officials told news outlets they were “shocked and dismayed” at the accusations. WKYT-TV reports the education department no longer employs Wilson. The Lexington Herald-Leader says when Wilson was the principal of Montgomery County High School in 2009, he fought to ban books with what he labeled “homosexual” or otherwise inappropriate material, including sex, abuse and drugs.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation are creating four artificial reefs in Lake Borgne and the Mississippi Sound. Spokesman Rene LeBreton says contractors have put down a total of 880 tons of limestone. Next, they’ll set out 130 perforated concrete domes called reef balls. More than 80 cubic yards of oyster shells will finish the work. LeBreton says it should be complete this month. The area’s bottom is soft mud. The reefs will provide hard-bottom habitat where saltwater sport fish such as speckled trout, redfish and flounder are likely to hang out. Oystering is barred from the reefs, so oysters that settle there can serve as broodstock. A large, yellow-lighted buoy marks each reef.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: Regulators are investigating concerns about marijuana-related advertisements at a sports arena. The Portland Press Herald reports several parents whose children play sports at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston have complained about the ads. State laws prohibits marijuana advertising that will reach people under the age of 21 or is designed to appeal to those under 21. Parents complained about one ad for Strawberry Fields Apothecary that featured marijuana leaves over red strawberries. The ad was removed, but other text-only signs for two other local dispensaries remain. Colisee owner and general manager Mike Cain told The Sun Journal he is working with Strawberry Fields to change the advertising. A spokesman for the state’s Office of Marijuana Policy said the agency would review the situation.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Housing Authority of Baltimore City says it will soon stop accepting applications because more than 14,000 applicants are already on a waitlist that’s averaging a wait time of more than five years. News outlets report the agency announced Tuesday that residents have until Dec. 13 to apply for public housing before the authority stops taking applications. Housing President Janet Abrahams says continuing to accept applications would be performing a disservice and create a false sense of accommodation security. She says public housing is under-invested, causing a severe shortage. A news release says officials “streamlined” the waitlist this year, reducing the total applications from 27,000 to 14,000, but the wait time is still averaging between five and seven years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nUxbridge: Members of the town’s Historical Commission received word last week that the Mrs. Nancy Adams Burial Site, marking the resting ground of a woman who escaped slavery three times and is linked to the region’s rich involvement with the Underground Railroad, was accepted by the National Park Service into the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. The Telegram & Gazette reports the designation places the site on a permanent database for researchers and allows local historians to pursue grants and receive technical assistance as part of the mission to “honor, preserve and promote the history of resistance to enslavement through escape and flight, which continues to inspire people worldwide,” according to the Network to Freedom website.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: Hunting wildlife has long been ingrained in the Wolverine State’s culture, but it is on a decline as young adults opt for other activities. Michigan had as many as 1.2 million hunters in the 1970s, ’80s and into the ’90s. But MLive.com reports by 2018, fewer than 675,000 people had at least one hunting license. The decline is partly due to baby boomers aging out. But young adults, urbanites and others are also far less likely to partake in hunting. Fishing also is on a downward trend, though its drop has been less steep. From 2013 to 2018, state residents obtaining fishing licenses fell 5%, compared to a 18% decline in hunting licenses during that same period. The decline has an impact on conservation efforts, according to Department of Natural Resources officials. Hunting and fishing fees account for more than 90% of the agency’s $42 million wildlife conservation budget.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: More than half of the state’s lakes, rivers and streams don’t meet state pollution standards. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has added 581 waterways to its list of impaired waters in its biennial report to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released Wednesday. The 3,416 waterways represent 56% of the state’s waters. They have a range of problems, including excess mercury, bacteria, phosphorus, nitrate and other pollutants, as well as struggling fish and insect populations. The impaired waters include a lower stretch of the St. Croix River, considered one of the Upper Midwest’s most pristine waterways. About one-third of the waterways are impaired for recreational use because of high bacteria in streams and phosphorus in lakes.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: An animal shelter has been over capacity for months, forcing it to stop taking in any animals brought in by the public. The Leflore County Humane Society’s volunteer interim director, Janice McCurdy, tells The Greenwood Commonwealth that the shelter turns away at least 10 animals daily. She says the shelter has about 65 dogs and 50 cats in its custody. Its capacity is 40 dogs and 20 cats. In August, the shelter started only accepting animals from animal control. The society’s board president, Aubrey Whittington, says she doesn’t remember ever turning away so many animals for so long. A new, 6,200-square-foot shelter facility is in the works but likely won’t open until 2020. Whittington says the shelter’s capacity will stay the same despite the increased shelter size.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: NASA says a meteor seen streaking through the sky behind the Gateway Arch was a basketball-size hunk of rock that broke off from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that experts used hundreds of eyewitness accounts from as far away as South Dakota and Minnesota along with two videos to calculate information about the meteor. They determined the approximately 220-pound rock traveled through the sky Monday night at 33,500 mph , causing a sonic boom. A NASA weather satellite helped the agency confirm it was brighter than Venus in the sky, making it a fireball. Bill Cooke, of the NASA Meteoroid Environments Office in Huntsville, Alabama, says it broke into pieces 12 miles above the ground.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The state health department has adopted new rules to regulate private alternative residential treatment programs for troubled teens. The 2019 Legislature put such treatment programs under the supervision of the Department of Public Health and Human Services starting July 1 after a series of stories by the Missoulian indicated an oversight board was not acting on complaints. The department removed 27 children from The Ranch for Kids in northwestern Montana on July 23 following escalating reports of physical and psychological abuse. The ranch’s license was suspended. The Missoulian reports the rules adopted Friday include licensing requirements, protocols for reporting abuse and neglect, and staff qualifications. Programs are not allowed to punish residents’ behavior through seclusion, physical discipline, excessive exercise, withholding food or water, or denying family visits or calls.\n\nNebraska\n\nMitchell: Out where Wyoming is only a 15-minute drive away, some Panhandle conservationists are seeking to improve on Mother Nature. They’re building a cold-water trout stream – something pretty rare in Nebraska – in an area where, decades ago, anglers used to hook into monstrous, migrating fish of up to 10 pounds in a man-made irrigation ditch. Having a meandering trout stream, the conservationists believe, will help revive a trout-fishing tradition in this part of the state. “These cold-water fisheries are super important for western Nebraska,” Bob Smith, a retired Scottsbluff banker, told the Omaha World-Herald. Smith is part of Platte River Basin Environments, a local group that has dedicated its time and money since 1992 to acquiring and preserving land in the Panhandle for free hunting, fishing and hiking. While Nebraska has a lot of streams, most are shallow and get too hot and muddy to sustain cold-water-loving trout.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The Generator art space has undergone a lot of changes this year, but the address will not be one of them. Following concerns that its landlord might boot the arts organization from its home of six years, the Generator – known for cranking out spectacular Burning Man installations – has signed a three-year lease extension at its location in industrial Sparks. The lease was up in June, although the building owners extended it through the end of November to allow artists to complete their Burning Man projects. The organization theoretically has an extra three years to figure out where it will permanently call home, but the building is still on the market for more than $3.8 million. Tolles Development Co., the owner, agreed in the new lease that – should the building sell – the occupants cannot be forced out during the months of June through September, peak time for Burning Man art production.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire State Police is collecting new, unwrapped toys to support the U.S. Marine Corps with its annual Toys for Tots Campaign. The collection drive is running through Dec. 8. Police are hosting several “Stuff a Cruiser” events throughout the state, as well as accepting collections at headquarters, barracks sites and stores, and other places. Additional information is available by contacting Sgt. Chad Lavoie at 603-223-8688 or following New Hampshire State Police on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The state would become the second in the nation with a publicly run bank – after North Dakota and its century-old institution – under the aims of an executive order Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed Wednesday. Murphy, a wealthy former executive at Goldman Sachs who’s in his first term as governor, campaigned on creating a state-run bank that uses some state deposits for projects considered worthwhile, like low-income housing and student loans. The effort has stalled since Murphy took office nearly two years ago, with some in the state scratching their heads about the need for such a bank, but he said Wednesday that “the time is right right now” to consider the project. On Wednesday, alongside organized labor representatives and members of a liberal-leaning think tank called New Jersey Citizen Action, Murphy signed an executive order creating a 14-member board charged with setting up the bank.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials want to spend an additional $8 million to ensure residents are not left out of the 2020 census. Population-studies expert Robert Rhatigan of the University of New Mexico told a panel of lawmakers Tuesday that state finance and workforce officials still fear an undercount that could reduce federal spending in New Mexico by hundreds of millions of dollars. Lawmakers this year set aside $3.4 million to help counties, public schools and Native American communities encourage participation in the federal population survey. An additional $8 million is now being sought for the effort by the administration of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. Remote desert communities and gaps in communications infrastructure make New Mexico one of the hardest states to accurately survey for population changes.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The Empire State has now raised the minimum age to buy tobacco and electronic cigarettes to 21 years old, from 18. The law went into effect Wednesday. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the goal is to prevent addictive cigarette and vaping products from getting to young people. The New York Department of Health says nearly 40% of 12th grade students and 27% of high school students are now using e-cigarettes. They say the increase is largely driven by flavored e-liquids. The surgeon general says 88% of adult smokers started using tobacco as minors, and 90% of those who purchase cigarettes for minors are between 18 and 20 years old. Cuomo’s administration has pushed to outlaw flavored e-cigarettes, but a court has blocked that ban for now.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCape Lookout: A trio of castaway cows has been discovered on the Outer Banks, where they apparently washed up after swimming for miles to escape Hurricane Dorian’s storm surge. Cape Lookout National Seashore officials think the stranded cows swam up to 5 miles during the September storm before being found near Cape Lookout this month. The cows belong to a herd that roams freely on Cedar Island, across the sound. When Dorian generated an 8-foot “mini tsunami,” it washed them and dozens of other animals away, including 28 wild horses that died. Seashore spokesman B.G. Horvat told McClatchy news group the cows are grazing peacefully after a harrowing feat of survival, but they need to go home. He thinks they’ll have to be sedated for the boat trip.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Kris Kristofferson surprised customers when he performed with an acoustic guitar at a local bar after a band taped a request to the singer-songwriter’s tour bus. Kristofferson stopped at Dempsey’s Public House in downtown Fargo on Saturday night and asked to sing with the band 32 Below. KFGO-AM reports the band had taped a note to Kristofferson’s tour bus door. The note said the band was “huge fans” and “would be absolutely stoked” if Kristofferson came to the bar and allowed them to buy him “a beer or five.” Dempsey’s General Manager Jeff Fonder says Kristofferson performed “Me and Bobby McGee.” 32 Below later said on Facebook: “We played a legendary song with the legend who wrote it!” Kristofferson was in town to perform at the Fargo Theatre.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Resuming the state’s attempt to allow cryptocurrency in certain tax payments is up in the air after the state’s top lawyer found a Bitcoin program launched by the former state treasurer was illegal. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost’s Nov. 5 opinion found then-Treasurer Josh Mandel skirted state law when he launched OhioCrypto.com last year for paying business taxes. Yost found that Atlanta-based BitPay, the third-party processor that converted bitcoins to U.S. currency, was functioning as a “financial transaction device.” That meant Mandel was required to use a competitive selection process before hiring it. Treasurer Robert Sprague, a fellow Republican who succeeded Mandel in January, abruptly shut down the site last month after an internal review raised issues. The Board of Deposit he chairs must now decide how to proceed.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A gun rights activist accused of illegally taking a rifle into a restaurant is facing a felony charge. Timothy A. Harper, 52, was arrested Tuesday after he violated a state law that bars possessing or carrying a rifle in any establishment where alcoholic beverages are consumed, authorities said. Harper told another activist in an online interview Monday that he took his rifle into Twin Peaks on Nov. 2 in celebration of the state’s new “permitless carry” gun law, which went into effect Nov. 1, The Oklahoman reports. Police reported recovering surveillance video from the restaurant that shows Harper, of Choctaw, walking in “with an AR-style rifle slung to the front of his body.” Police noted he was asked to leave the restaurant, but he initially refused. “Timothy responded that he was not going anywhere,” a police lieutenant wrote in an affidavit, which indicates prosecutors have agreed to charge Harper. If convicted, he faces up to two years in prison and a $1,000 fine. He’s being held at the county jail. No bail has been set.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: No large trees will be harmed in the making of this memorial – that’s a promise from organizers. The Vietnam War Memorial proposed for the southwest corner of the Oregon State Capitol grounds will incorporate six existing trees, ranging from 21 to 72 feet tall. Perhaps the most distinctive is a 31-foot Western red cedar with no central trunk and giant, almost human-like branches. “I call it the embracing tree,” landscape designer Mike Abbate says. “I really wanted to celebrate that tree. The embracing arms are there to help give comfort to visitors.” The location and design still need to be reviewed by an Oregon Parks and Recreation Department committee – the first step in a long approval process – and an estimated $2.7 million still needs to be raised by the Vietnam War Memorial Fund Steering Committee. The goals is to complete the memorial by Veterans Day 2022.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Dauphin County, home to the state capital, is signaling it won’t go along with Gov. Tom Wolf’s insistence that counties buy new voting systems as a security measure in 2020’s election, when the state is expected to be a premier presidential battleground. County Commissioner Mike Pries said Wednesday that he’s comfortable with the county’s old machines, particularly after hearing about paper jams, long lines and other problems in other counties that debuted new machines in last week’s election. Wolf began pressing counties last year to get new voting machines that have an auditable paper backup, after federal authorities warned Pennsylvania and other states that Russian hackers targeted them during 2016’s election. Wolf has warned that he’ll decertify the counties’ old voting systems before the 2020 primary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Council members in three Rhode Island cities say they support a New York City program that has moved homeless families to their communities despite pushback from their mayors. The Providence Journal reports that the Special One-Time Assistance Program allows homeless families from New York to move to the states of their choosing with one year of paid rent. City councilors Alex Kithes of Woonsocket, Meghan Kallman of Pawtucket, and Rachel Miller and Katherine Kerwin of Providence – all Democrats – said in a joint statement that “it is dehumanizing and hurtful” to treat homeless people as a burden. Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza, Pawtucket Mayor Donald Grebien and Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt have expressed concern that the families were moved to cities without notice and could strain public services.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMount Pleasant: Charleston County has paid $7.1 million to protect a nearly 340-year-old plantation from development. The Post and Courier reports the county now owns development rights to Boone Hall Plantation, which covers about 600 acres in Mount Pleasant. The property is now under a conservation easement, limiting its use without changing its ownership. Co-owner Willie McRae says it’s a “perpetual agreement” never to develop the land and aligns with the wishes of the McRaes, who have owned it since the 1950s. He says the Charleston County Greenbelt Fund and S.C. Conservation Bank money will go toward improving the land and creating a foundation to run it after the family is gone. The nonprofit Lowcounty Land Trust says the McRaes declined an estimated $21 million by not selling to developers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe is asking for the state’s help to change an 1863 federal law that technically keeps the tribe from owning land in Minnesota. The law removed Dakota people from Minnesota and relocated them to several other states in the Midwest. It was signed by President Abraham Lincoln after conflicts between white settlers and Dakota people in Minnesota. Though the law is no longer enforced, tribal leaders call it racist. They’re asking the state to pass a resolution of support and raised the subject Tuesday at a meeting of the State-Tribal Relations committee in Pierre. Crow Creek Sioux Chairman Lester Thompson Jr. called it similar to old Jim Crow laws. A similar request didn’t make it out of committee at the Legislature this year. Thompson says he’s taking a new approach – educating lawmakers and Gov. Kristi Noem on the history of the law.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Forestry officials say a strike team is being created to perform prescribed burning on public and private forest land in the Cumberland Plateau. Tennessee Division of Forestry officials said Tuesday that a $200,000 grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation will be used to expand forest fire use and management in the state. Officials say the forest strike team will perform prescribed burns on more than 1,200 acres to help reduce damage from wildfires caused by excessive brush, shrubs and trees. Officials say prescribed fires also encourage native vegetation to grow and maintain plant and animal species whose habitats depend on periodic fire. Tennessee’s forests cover 14 million acres. That’s more than half of the state’s total acreage.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: A state law that gives families 10 days to find a new hospital if they disagree with doctors who decide to take a patient off life support is once again under the spotlight after a judge halted a hospital’s plan to remove a 9-month-old girl from a ventilator against her family’s wishes. Doctors at Cook Children’s Medical Center planned to stop treatment Sunday for Tinslee Lewis after invoking the state’s “10-day rule.” The hospital said Tinslee was born prematurely with a rare heart defect and suffers from chronic lung disease and severe chronic high blood pressure. She has been hospitalized since birth and on a ventilator since July. Not only is her condition fatal, the hospital said, but doctors believe she’s suffering. Cook Children’s says it has reached out to nearly 20 facilities around the country, and none felt the hospital’s assessment was incorrect.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A former San Juan County commissioner has sued a federal land agency after he spent 10 days in jail for trespassing in an illegal ATV protest ride in a southern Utah canyon. Rep. Phil Lyman filed the $10 million lawsuit in U.S. District Court on Friday accusing Bureau of Land Management officials of lying during his trial. The first-term Republican Utah House member is acting as his own attorney. Lyman says he suffered damages to his name, reputation, business and political relationships. An agency spokeswoman in Utah says it doesn’t comment on pending litigation. A jury found Lyman guilty of misdemeanor illegal use of ATVs and conspiracy for organizing the 2014 protest challenging federal management of Western public lands. A judge sentenced him to 10 days in jail and imposed $96,000 restitution.\n\nVermont\n\nClarendon: State agencies are using aerial drones to discover more about toxic chemical contamination underneath an airport. The Agency of Transportation’s Rail and Aviation Bureau and the Vermont Geological Survey spent the last week of October using a drone to gather data for a map about what is underneath the rocks below the Rutland Southern Vermont Regional Airport. The Rutland Herald reports the contamination of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively called PFAS, was found near the airport in 2018 and is believed to be from firefighting foam. Vermont has since determined a limit of 20 parts per trillion on certain types of the toxic chemicals. Geologists say probes are also being used to study groundwater beneath the facility by drilling into wells and dropping probes into them.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state recycled almost half of its trash last year, setting a record despite China’s ban on importing plastic and other solid waste. The statewide recycling rate in 2018 was 46% – up 3 percentage points from the previous year, according to data released this week by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. The data showed that the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority, which includes Richmond and surrounding localities, had the highest recycling rate in the commonwealth at 59%. The Virginia Peninsulas Public Service Authority, which includes Hampton, Poquoson and Williamsburg and nearby counties, had the lowest rate – 29%. The city of Newport News had the biggest improvement in recycling in recent years. Its rate jumped from 38% in 2016 to 57% last year.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Voters have narrowly rejected a ballot measure seeking to reinstate the use of affirmative action in state employment, contracting, and admission to public colleges and universities. Referendum 88 was rejected Tuesday by 50.4% of voters with a margin of just over 14,000 votes. Counties in vote-by-mail Washington had been updating their counts daily since last week’s election, and while the final margin of the loss may change as remaining votes are counted, the bulk of the approximately 2 million ballots cast have been tallied. The measure asked voters whether they wanted to approve or reject Initiative 1000, which the Legislature passed in April. Along with race, sex and ethnicity, the measure allowed for consideration of age, disability, and honorable discharge or military status. It would have prohibited using factors such as race as the sole qualifier and banned mandatory quotas.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two colleges in the state are teaming up to offer a seven-year Doctor of Pharmacy program. West Virginia State University and the University of Charleston announced the dual degree in a news release. Under the agreement signed last week, students would complete a three-year undergraduate program in pre-pharmacy at West Virginia State in Institute, then enroll in the University of Charleston’s School of Pharmacy. After completing the first year at the School of Pharmacy, the students will return to West Virginia State to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry or biology. They will complete coursework over the next three years toward a doctorate degree.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said Wednesday that he doesn’t believe Republicans are “bastards” for firing his agriculture secretary, despite using the word when urging state workers not to be deterred by the move. Evers stressed that he wasn’t referring to GOP lawmakers when he told agriculture department workers last week not to let the “bastards” keep them from doing their work. He noted that the phrase he invoked – “don’t let the bastards grind you down” – was well known and used throughout history. “It’s not something I just pulled out of thin air,” Evers said following a bill signing in Wisconsin Dells. “It’s a saying; it’s a thing. I don’t think they’re bastards, but I do think they made a huge mistake doing what they did to Brad Pfaff.” Evers said he was angry after the Senate voted along party lines to reject the confirmation of Pfaff, Evers’ agriculture secretary. It was the first time the Senate had fired a Cabinet secretary since at least 1987.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A legislative committee has advanced a bill that allows Gov. Mark Gordon to explore expanding Medicaid in the state. The lawmakers on the Joint Revenue Committee voted 8 to 5 on Tuesday to move the bill forward to the full Legislature, which meets next February. Under the proposed bill, the governor must first direct the departments of health and insurance to explore options for expanding Medicaid eligibility. If expansion is recommended, the Legislature would have to give its approval, convening a special session if necessary. Gordon has not supported Medicaid expansion in the past because of the costs to the state, but he says he recognizes the challenges residents face in being able to afford health care. An estimated 19,000 residents would be covered initially if Medicaid expansion were approved.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/14"}]}
