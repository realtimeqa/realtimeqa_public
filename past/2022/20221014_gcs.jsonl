Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe life cycle of plastic begins underground, where oil and gas are extracted from deep below the surface of the planet. These fossil fuels are then refined in facilities, using extreme temperatures and significant amount of water and energy, where they are transformed into pellets that are eventually melted and molded into things like water bottles, packaging, garbage bags and clothes.\n\nAnd the widespread use of single-use plastic — the stuff we use once and then throw away — is only made worse by its disposal. Plastics do not break down once they’re thrown into nature. And, alarmingly, only around 9% plastic in the US is actually recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency — even the stuff you specifically threw into the recycle bin.\n\nWhat you might not realize is this isn’t just a pollution problem. It’s a climate problem. And by the time we start talking about recycling, the damage is already done.\n\nThe process of making plastic is so energy intensive that if the plastics industry were a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, according to a 2021 report from Beyond Plastics.\n\nPlastics are the “new coal,” said Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator and now president of Beyond Plastics. Generating energy from coal — the most polluting fossil fuel — is already being phased out. But Enck said it’s likely that plastics may be sticking for a while longer, unless consumers significant cut their plastic use.\n\n“It’s a climate killer,” Enck told CNN. “We’re finally seeing an increase in renewable energy and energy efficiency. And the fossil fuel industry knew that they were losing market share on transportation and electricity generation, so plastic production is the plan B for the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nFrom its production to its end-of-life, plastic belches greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its life cycle. Here’s why experts say the convenience of plastic comes at a terrible cost for the climate, and what you can do to help reduce its impact.\n\nQuantifying the impact\n\nSwitch to reusable bags for shopping to cut down on single-use plastic. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\n\nThe plastic industry is responsible for at least 232 million tons of planet-warming emissions each year, according to the Beyond Plastics report.\n\nThat’s the same amount as the average emissions released by 116 coal-fired power plants in 2020, according to the report’s authors. It’s also the same annual emissions as around 50 million cars, according to the EPA. And more plastic-making facilities continue to come online.\n\n“Remember that when you’re making plastic, there’s the greenhouse gas emissions, but these facilities also emit massive amounts of air toxins and particulates,” Enck added. “It’s really a health threat.”\n\nRefineries and production facilities also tend to set up shop in marginalized communities of color, Enck said.\n\n“If you look at where more than 90% of the climate pollution is released by the plastic industry, it’s in 18 communities in the whole country, and they’re all low-income communities and the residents are more likely to be people of color,” Enck said, outlining other findings in the report. “Plastic production is an environmental justice issue.”\n\nAnd plastic recycling doesn’t work, Enck said, because most of what we think we’re recycling just ends up in the landfill. It also doesn’t address the planet-warming emissions that comes from making it in the first place.\n\nJacqueline Savitz, chief policy officer for Oceana in North America, said people should think of the plastic crisis as an overflowing bathtub.\n\n“When the bathtub is overflowing, you don’t want to just run for the mop; first, you want to turn off the faucet,” Savitz said. “Recycling is the mop. You’re not going to get very far, if the faucet is still on. So what we have to do is reduce the amount of plastics that we’re producing at the source, and that’s turning off the faucet.”\n\nWhat you can do about it\n\nSaying \"no\" to plastic cutlery is one way to limit your use of single-use plastic. Adobe Stock\n\nRecycling alone will not solve this massive problem, Enck said, but we should still do it — bearing in mind what can and cannot be recycled.\n\nThe number system on the bottom of plastic items are not a guarantee they will be recycled. Only things marked 1 and 2 — and on rare occasion, 5 — are sure bets, depending on what your municipality can handle.\n\nThis is why it’s so important to focus on reducing plastic use in the first place, Enck said, and our individual changes can add up.\n\n“It’s just not going to solve the problem unless we change the law,” Enck said. “But with individual actions, what I urge people to do is look at their own home or their worksite — what is your heaviest use of plastic?”\n\nYou won’t know what you can change until you take stock. Make note of all of the plastics in your home. Most of the single-use stuff you’ll find around the kitchen and the bathroom. Then, armed with a list of where you use single-use plastic the most, you can start to make replacements.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nSay no to bottled water — Get a couple of canteens and cut a major source of plastic out of your life.\n\nReusable grocery bags — You can easily go a step further by not using the plastic produce bags the store provides for your apples and broccoli. If you’re uncomfortable putting produce directly in the cart, have a special bag to carry it in until you get to the checkout. There’s no rule that says you have to wrap your fruits and veggies at the store.\n\nChoose paper (or no) packaging over plastic — If you’re looking at two versions of the same product and one is packaged in paper or cardboard and the other is in plastic, then the choice is obvious. And look for plastic-free options like bar shampoo.\n\nBuy in bulk to reduce plastic waste — Nuts, rice and beans are all things that come in plastic bags, but they don’t need to. Bring your own reusable containers to fill with your favorite bulk foods. (Just make sure to zero-out the scale before you start filling them, so you don’t pay for the weight of your container.)\n\nRefuse plastic cutlery — Take your own utensils to restaurants that typically provide plastics. Or, if you’re ordering takeout, tell the restaurant they don’t need to add it to your bag.\n\nAnd Enck’s group has more suggestions for how to cut your personal plastic use.\n\nThink bigger\n\nWe can do our part to minimize our own plastic use, but the world needs big solutions for this big problem. Natan Dvir/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nUltimately, the world needs large-scale change to address the climate impact of the fossil fuel and plastics industries, Savitz said. Oceana, for example, is working with local volunteers from cities and counties around the country to help pass new laws to reduce single-use plastics, in hopes of sparking change at the national level.\n\n“We think that if we could start to reduce single-use plastics at the local level with local ordinances, that can start to become more of the norm,” she said. “Then we can start taking it to higher levels of government, even getting to the point of getting national policies that will drive reductions in plastic use.”\n\nUltimately, Savitz said consumers need to continue urging major corporations to provide plastic-free solutions and help support refill and reuse programs to encourage society to shy away from plastic use and stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\n“Our country is burning and flooding and hurricanes are coming earlier and earlier,” she told CNN. “I really think it’s shocking that one of the things that’s really leading to that is plastics, and it’s hurting us in other ways, too. So if we could find a way to reduce our production of plastics as a country and as a global society, we’d be taking a bite out of climate change.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/04/22/plastics-recycling-united-states-earth-day/7234651001/", "title": "Recycling on Earth Day: Where recycled plastic actually ends up", "text": "Just 9% of all plastic waste ever created has been recycled, researchers estimate.\n\nLast year, the U.S. exported 74,000 shipping containers of plastic waste to low-income countries, researcher Jan Dell said.\n\nFor decades, China was the primary destination for global plastic waste.

And waste.\n\nIf you're surrounded by endless wrapping paper, festive bows and Christmas cards this holiday, it's important to note proper recycling protocols – especially for paper products, the most recycled material in the U.S, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\"Millions of Americans can also do their part during the holiday season by recycling paper-based products at home,\" Heidi Brock, President and CEO of the American Forest & Paper Association, said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nBrock added that a common mistake people make at the end of the year is \"wishcycling.\"\n\n\"The act of putting something in the recycling bin in the hope that someone else will figure out what to do with it actually impedes the recycling process,\" she said, urging communities to help educate consumers about local guidelines.\n\nNot everything can go in those blue bins. Glue, ribbons and glitter-dusted decorations can clog the recycling process. Most nonpaper products need to be tossed or reused.\n\nEach holiday gift wrap is disposed of differently at the end of the year.

Your shipping questions, answered\n\nWill gifts arrive in time for Christmas?:Target, Macy's, other stores offering same-day delivery for holiday rush\n\nWrapping paper\n\nBrock said plain wrapping paper can be recycled. Sheets with foil, glitter and plastic or poly coatings cannot. Additional nonpaper embellishments should also be avoided.\n\nAccording to Lisa Skumatz, National Recycling Coalition chairperson, wrapping paper should be separated from your regular curbside mix. It can be recycled with special programs for collection and drop-off in some cities.\n\nTry reusing wrapping paper that can't be recycled. If Christmas morning causes damage beyond repair, trash it – and maybe consider sturdier gift bags to easily reuse in the future.\n\n“We do discourage people from using wrapping paper because it is difficult to recycle and instead encourage people to either use reusable gift bags or other types of materials or use recyclable material like calendars, maps, etc,\" said Randy Moorman of Ecocycle, a recycling nonprofit in Colorado.\n\nGift bags\n\nGift bag recycling requirements are similar to wrapping paper. Plain paper bags can be put in the recycling bin – but not bags made with plastic, foil, or fabric according to Brock and the American Forest and Paper Association.\n\nIf a paper bag has rope handles, beads, or other nonpaper decorative elements, remove them before recycling.\n\nIf your bags don't fit recycling requirements, they will need to be trashed or reused. The good news is, they are easy to preserve.\n\nRibbons and bows\n\nRibbons and bows are not accepted at recycling bins. The decorations can clog production at recycling plants.\n\nTo fix the problem, \"the facility then needs to shut down all the equipment so they can get in and cut out all the junk,” Peter Spendelow, a materials management specialist for Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nWhen ribbons and bows are too ugly to reuse, trash them. Otherwise, save them for next year – tape can be a perfect substitute adhesive.\n\nChristmas cards\n\nDon't forget to sort holiday cards.\n\nAccording to the American Forest and Paper Association, cards and envelopes made of paper can be recycled. But those with glitter, plastic, or metallic accents should be tossed in the trash.\n\nMost recycling processes will remove stamps.\n\nMore:Don't make these mistakes when addressing holiday cards\n\n'Well...

The work of sorting recycling at the centers is done by prison inmates, and while some are back at work, there are currently not enough workers to handle the labor-intensive process of sorting plastic, she said.\n\n\"Plastic need a lot of extra hands because there are so many plastics that are not actually recyclable,\" Glanz said. \"Most goes into the garbage, unfortunately, because they don't have enough heft to be reused.\"\n\nPrior to the March shutdown of the city's recycling program, the city only accepted plastics numbered 1 and 2.

We can be more conscious about reducing pollution, protecting wildlife, conserving natural resources and take other actions that can help slow the rate of climate change.\n\nEveryone can make a difference, particularly when smart environmental choices become a habit and perhaps even begins influencing others into taking similar actions. Doing the right thing for the future of life on Earth can even have immediate personal benefits. It can tap into your creativity, can get you more engaged with your community and the world, and may contribute to a healthier lifestyle.\n\nWe need to reduce the amount of trash we create, and to reuse or repurpose consumer goods rather than throwing them away. United States is among the countries in the world that produce the most waste.\n\nAlternatives to plastic:19 genius inventions\n\nIt is not possible to offer an exhaustive list of things you can do to help protect the environment or rank them based on impact, but here is a short list of relatively easy things you can do to shrink your carbon footprint, lead to more green actions, and initiate change on a larger scale, so there are no more climate change effects that can’t be stopped.\n\nTo compile a list of ways people can reduce their environmental impact, 24/7 Tempo reviewed numerous scientific studies on sources of greenhouse gases and consulted dozens of non-profit organizations working to raise awareness about ethical consumerism such as Green America and government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n1. Recycle\n\nRecycling conserves natural resources, reduces pollution and saves energy. Recycling involves sorting and cleaning up trash to produce \"secondary materials\" — mainly glass, paper, metal and plastic — for reuse in products. Recycled aluminum, for example, is a particularly valuable resource; manufacturing using recycled aluminum is 92% more efficient than when unused raw materials are used, according to the Aluminum Association. About 40% of the country's aluminum supply comes from recycling, but we are still throwing away nearly $1 billion worth of aluminum cans that could have been recycled every year.\n\n2. Turn down the bag\n\nPlastic bags pose ecological problems. They take hundreds of years to decompose and pose a particular threat to wildlife. Hundreds of thousands of marine mammals die every year after mistaking plastic bags, which are laced with chemicals, for food. Many animals get entangled in plastic bags and suffocate.\n\nA sound approach to retail bags is to decline them when your purchase is otherwise carriable or bring your own bags. Use and reuse all those bags — paper, plastic, cloth — that have been accumulating in the closet over the years — whether or not they are designed to be \"reusable.\" If they become too grubby to carry your new purchases, use them to line waste cans or for picking up litter. And, ultimately, dispose of them properly — recycle them if you can.\n\n3. Buy only what you will use\n\nAmericans are huge consumers of cars, food, furnishings, household products, recreational equipment, and electronics — and we buy much more than we need with many of our consumer purchases getting very little use. Excessive personal consumption of goods means higher direct and indirect costs to the environment, including the energy used and pollution emitted in the extraction of natural resources, and in the manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of goods.\n\nThese costs can be substantially reduced by avoiding impulse buying and making a realistic assessment of need before making a purchase. When you do have to buy goods, find durable alternatives with the smallest amount of packaging and the lowest possible carbon footprint and keep them in good repair.\n\n4. Buy second hand\n\nUse eBay, Craigslist or other means to buy used items, particularly durable goods that are needed for a limited time, like nursery furniture. Second-hand goods can be nearly as attractive and often just as functional as brand new purchases, and giving a household item a second life cuts its carbon footprint in half. A third or fourth life is even better.\n\n5. Don't invest in idle equipment\n\nYou are wasting money and natural resources used to produce them when you buy items you won't regularly need. When the equipment, tools, or party supplies that you need once in a great while are not available through friends, rent them from a specialty rental business or a home improvement store. For those items you already have in the tool shed that you don't regularly depend on, let friends and family know you are happy to share. Use block parties and everyday interactions to initiate a sharing culture in your neighborhood.\n\n6. Donate used goods\n\nDonation is a particularly positive alternative to throwing away used consumer goods in the trash. Give your used clothing, appliances, and furniture to GoodWill, the Salvation Army, or a local church; computers to schools or needy families; and building materials and tools to Habitat for Humanity. Of course, these are just a few suggested organizations and any organization will do. In addition to the environmental benefits of giving these items a second life, you are helping others and may be eligible for a tax deduction.\n\n7. Buy products with less packaging\n\nThe waste landfills are bulked up with consumer product packaging. Containers and packaging made up the largest portion of municipal waste at almost 78 million tons, or nearly 30%, according to the EPA. Slightly more than a third gets recycled, but huge amounts end up in landfills. Packaging also adds significantly to both the cost and carbon footprint of consumer products.\n\nWhen it's not possible to avoid packaging, reuse containers, polystyrene (styrofoam) fillers, and bubble wrap, or see if your local shipping service can use them. The third best alternative, after reducing and reusing, is recycling.\n\n8. Avoid disposable products\n\nPaper and plastic plates and utensils, disposable diapers, paper towels and napkins, cheap plasticware, and other non-durable consumer goods (goods designed to last for a short period of time) make up about 20% of America's waste stream, which amounted to 50 million tons in 2015, according to the EPA.\n\nA great concern are the greenhouse gas emissions that result from these items manufacture and disposal. Store away a quantity of durable, bargain-priced dishes, flatware, and glassware for parties and picnics. Use cloth napkins, cloth diapers, cloth rags, rechargeable batteries, durable razors, and refillable coffee thermoses for take-out coffee.\n\n9. Kick the bottled water habit\n\nAmericans consumed 13.7 billion gallons of bottled water in 2017, beating carbonated drinks for a second year in a row. Though America's tap drinking water supplies are generally clean and have to meet EPA standards for potability, it's the convenience of bottled water that makes it so popular. And consumption continues to grow as consumers move away from sugary drinks in pursuit of better health and still use bottled water to the detriment of environmental health.\n\nAccording to researchers from the Pacific Institute in Oakland, California, energy required to produce, transport, and chill bottled water requires up to 2,000 times the energy required to produce tap water. In addition, plastic bottles can take 450 years or more to decompose. So, yes, drink plenty of water for good health, but use a reusable water bottle or simply a glass as you pour water from your tap.\n\n10. Upcycle\n\nRepurpose items that still have life in them. The internet is full of crafty ideas for reusing waste materials, from high concept artistic statements — like a chandelier from bicycle parts, an aquarium from an upright piano, or a pool table from classic car — to simple DIY projects like turning plastic bottles into planters, wine bottle corks into bath mats, and various containers into toy organizers. These kinds of reuses do not remove a large percentage of material from the waste stream, but, to the extent the reimagined objects take the place of new purchases, they save the energy and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions required for their manufacture.\n\n11. Give new life to old electronics\n\nThe world's output of discarded electronic devices — known as e-waste — reached nearly 45 million metric tons in 2016, according to a report by United Nations Environment Program. Electronics require a lot of water, energy, and valuable resources in their manufacture, so their reuse and recycling are particularly critical to environmentally-sound waste management.\n\nIf your TV, computer, cell phone or other consumer product containing electronics still works, give it to someone who can use it. There are nonprofits that specialize in the charitable redistribution of computers and companies that refurbish electronics for resale. If your electronic device is no longer serviceable, there are many recyclers who are interested in the valuable metals it contains.\n\n12. Upgrade to a green computer\n\nWhen you are ready to buy a new computer, buy one with an Energy Star label to save 35%-65% in energy use, and consider a laptop, which uses much less energy than a desktop computer. Donate your old computer rather than recycling it. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, reusing just one computer with a CRT monitor, as opposed to buying a new one, keeps 1,333 pound of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\n\n13. Invest in a clothesline\n\nYour clothes dryer is one of the largest energy users in the home, and, for the average family emits over a ton of carbon a year. Air-drying can reduce the average household's carbon footprint by 2,400 pounds a year, according to Green America, a non-profit organization. Many retail outlets sell racks and well-designed accessories for indoor drying. When you do use your dryer, use the setting that provides an automatic shut-off when your clothes are no longer damp. Use just enough energy to get the laundry dry. Be aware that you will lose energy if you add wet clothes to a load that is already partially dry.\n\n14. Switch out your light bulbs\n\nLED lights use 75% less energy to deliver the same amount of light as incandescents, and LED bulbs last 25 times longer. LED holiday string lights are not only more energy efficient and much cheaper over time, they also emit less heat (and therefore safer) and more durable. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, by 2027, the widespread use of LED lighting could save $30 billion in energy costs and reduce the use of electricity by the equivalent of 44 1,000-megawatt power plants.\n\n15. Shut off lights\n\nThe cost of keeping a single light bulb on doesn't amount to much on an hourly basis: using a 60-watt bulb for one hour requires 0.06 kilowatt hours of electricity, costing about 1.2 cents if your electric rate is 20 cents per kilowatt hour. But the costs add up. Based on consumption data from 2015, lighting accounts for 12% of the average household electric bill. By shutting off unnecessary lights, such as in empty rooms, you will not only save money but also lower your carbon footprint.\n\n16. Unplug electronics\n\nEven when not in use, many electronic devices, including televisions, microwaves, scanners, and printers, use standby power to save warm-up time. In the United States, the total electricity consumed by idle electronics — sometimes referred to as vampire or phantom electricity — equals the annual output of 12 power plants, according to the Office of Sustainability at Harvard University. Use power strips for these devices to simplify plugging and unplugging.\n\n17. Turn off your computer\n\nIt is true that your computer uses a surge of electricity when it starts up, but it's a small surge. The Department of Energy suggests that you turn off your monitor if you aren't going to use your PC for more than 20 minutes, and turn off your CPU and monitor if you're not going to use your PC for more than 2 hours.\n\n18. Rein in heating and cooling\n\nCombined, heating and cooling accounts for nearly half of household energy consumption. You can reduce energy consumption and save money by using a programmable thermostat. For every degree you reduce the temperature in the winter or raise it in the summer you are saving up to 1% in energy costs for each 8-hour period, according to the Department of Energy. Lowering your heating setting or raising your air conditioning settings by 10 degrees for eight hours a day could save you 10% on your energy bill — and reduce your carbon footprint.\n\nThere is added efficiency in doing this, in that lower interior temperatures in winter will slow the flow of heat to the outdoors, and higher interior temperatures in summer will slow the flow of heat into the house.\n\n19. Eat healthier\n\nYou will reduce your carbon footprint if you limit the amount of meat and dairy you consume. Animal-derived food production has a much higher greenhouse gas output than grain and vegetable production because of the highly inefficient transfer of plant energy to animal energy. Depending on how it's measured, animal-based agriculture is responsible for about 15% of all worldwide GHG emissions, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nYou don't need to become a vegetarian or a vegan to reduce your foodprint. By eating chicken instead of beef for one year, you will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 882 pounds, and by having just one vegetarian meal a week you could save the GHG equivalent of driving 1,160 miles, according to the Center of Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan.\n\n20. Choose local and organic\n\nGrowing organic food is labor intensive but requires 30%-50% less energy to produce.\n\nEating locally-grown food also saves energy because of the lower transportation costs. Eating all locally-grown food for one year could save the GHG equivalent of driving 1,000 miles, according to the Center of Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan.\n\n21. Stop throwing out food\n\nAccording to a 2012 study by The Natural Resource Defense Council, American families throw out approximately 25% of the food and beverages they buy, costing the average family of four between $1,365 and $2,275 every year — even more in today's dollars. There are also energy, production costs, and resources involved in the production and transport of this thrown food. You can save these by matching your food purchases to your actual consumption through menu planning and grocery lists.\n\n22. Compost\n\nNearly 30% of the waste stream consists of food and yard waste, according to the EPA. Over 50 million tons go to a landfill or incinerator. Composting not only saves disposal costs — and reduces the methane emitted from landfills — but it also creates a valuable soil amendment, reducing the need for manufactured fertilizers. You don't need to have a lot of land or technology to compost your household food and yard waste, so long as you follow a simple formula and keep meat, bones and dairy products out of the mix.\n\n23. Save water\n\nUsing less water saves energy and infrastructure costs. Saving water also means less water is lost to contamination, and it helps assure an adequate supply of clean water for the future. In your own household you can conserve outdoor water use by mulching your gardens, keeping your grass a little longer, and washing your car on the lawn. Indoors, simply keep the water off when you are not actively using it, like when washing dishes, brushing your teeth, or generally cleaning up. Try this in the shower by turning the water on to the lather up, off while scrubbing up, and on again for the rinse. Shorter showers are good too.\n\n24. Buy a cleaner car\n\nVehicles produce about one-third of all U.S. air pollution, and the contaminants emitted are more of a health threat than those from smoke stacks because they are at ground level, where we live, work, and play. Cars and trucks also account for 23% of total U.S. GHG emissions, with the average passenger vehicle producing about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the EPA.\n\nBuying a fuel-efficient car reduces air pollution and your carbon footprint, and can also save you money. The difference between a car that gets 20 miles per gallon (mpg) and one that gets 30 mpg amounts to about $708 in fuel costs per year, or $3,538 over five years. The U.S. Department of Energy has an online calculator that allows you to assess the efficiency of your car and compare it to others, including hybrids and all electric cars.\n\n25. Drive efficiently\n\nFast accelerations and high speeds use up fuel, and abrupt stops waste energy. By driving gently you can lower your gas mileage by up to 33% on the highway and 5% in the city, according to the Department of Energy. The optimal highway speed for gas mileage is 50 mph; after that, your gas mileage drops quickly. Don't idle your car, especially while running the air conditioner. In the winter, give your car only 30 seconds to warm up — it will warm up quickly when you start driving. Regular maintenance will help your car run at top efficiency — fixing serious maintenance problems can improve mileage by up to 40%.\n\n26. Leave your car home\n\nWhile great strides have been made to reduce tailpipe emissions — 99% since the 1960s — we are driving more than ever. There are more cars on the road than there are licensed drivers, and each vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.\n\nWhenever you avoid getting into your car, you are doing the environment a favor. Walk or bike when you can, and use public transportation where you can't. Find companionable people who make the same routine trips you do and form a carpool. Rather than taking short trips to do your errands, combine your trips, thereby reducing mileage and avoiding a number of cold starts.\n\n27. Consider alternatives to air travel\n\nAir travel represents a growing percentage of the world's greenhouse gases. If you take a round-trip flight between New York and San Francisco, or to Europe, your travel represents the environmental release of up to 2 or 3 tons of carbon dioxide per person, compared to the 19 tons generated by the average American per year. (The average European generates 10.) In business, you can reduce your company's flights by sending fewer people to events, using video conferencing, and communicating using a variety of online tools.\n\nFor pleasure travel, consider alternating \"staycations\" with travel vacations. Generally speaking, the energy intensity per passenger mile of air travel is comparable to driving an SUV or to taking a train. Driving with passengers (a family road trip) or in a hybrid car will make your travel much more efficient than any other transportation option.\n\n28. Green your school\n\nWork with your local school administrators and PTAs to shrink the carbon footprint of your child's school through architectural design, waste management, cafeteria choices, and energy conservation. Involve students in green programs, such as student-maintained gardens, cafeteria composting, and initiatives to reduce energy use and waste. Environmental projects are fun, and will raise awareness in parents, school personnel and children alike.\n\n29. Involve the workforce\n\nJoin or start a workplace environmental committee to work with your company in making environmental impacts a consideration in everyday operations, by, for example, facilitating telecommuting and carpooling, reducing paper use, and providing drinking glasses instead of bottled water at meetings and events. Make sure someone has the responsibility of turning off electronics, lights, and heat in the evening and encourage the proliferation of green plants to improve air quality.\n\n30. Volunteer\n\nMany environmental groups, land conservancies and other environmental stewardship organizations have volunteer programs. Whether it is picking up litter, fund-raising, clearing trails, stuffing envelopes, or educating others, by volunteering you will meet new people, stay on top of current environmental issues, and make a difference in protecting our one world.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Multiple explosions shook the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv following weeks of relative calm, prompting widespread condemnation from global leaders. “They are trying to annihilate us and wipe us off the face of the earth,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today. The mayor of Kyiv has urged residents to remain in shelters after a children’s playground was among the sites hit by the apparent Russian strikes. Several blasts also rocked the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk. This comes just two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin was humiliated following a massive explosion on a key strategic bridge linking Crimea and Russia.\n\n2. Hurricane Ian\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Ian, the lack of flood insurance in Central Florida has left many families struggling to rebuild amid the devastation. Homeowners’ insurance policies typically don’t cover flood damage and most people living in Ian’s path across Florida didn’t have a separate flood insurance policy. Inland areas that experienced historic rainfall and catastrophic floodwaters were especially unprepared, according to a CNN analysis of FEMA flood insurance data. While people without flood insurance will still be eligible for assistance payments from FEMA and potentially other aid approved by Congress, experts say many homeowners will likely only receive a tiny fraction of the cost of the damage they suffered.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Immigrant workers head to Florida to help with hurricane relief 03:31 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Venezuela\n\nA landslide in Venezuela on Sunday killed at least 25 people and left more than 50 missing in the north central state of Aragua, officials said. The landslide came down in the Santos Michelena municipality after days of heavy rainfall caused the five streams of the Las Tejerías river to overflow, officials said. On Sunday, Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro tweeted that he ordered the “maximum deployment” of the interior ministry and security agencies to respond to the emergency. Maduro also declared three days of national mourning “in solidarity with the families affected.”\n\n4. Griner & Whelan\n\nFormer Gov.

Richardson also said that he’s working with the families of both Americans and coordinating with the White House for their release. “All I can say is that the Biden administration is working hard on it,” Richardson told CNN, adding his meetings have been with “senior Russian officials, individuals close to President (Vladimir) Putin.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bill Richardson on what he saw inside Russia 01:41 - Source: CNN\n\n5. NFL\n\nThe National Football League and the NFL Players Association agreed to update the league’s concussion protocol over the weekend. The decision follows a review of the response to Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa’s injury on September 25 after he suffered an apparent head injury and was later allowed to reenter the game. He was later hospitalized for a concussion. Under the new protocols, players will be unable to compete if they are experiencing ataxia, which describes a lack of coordination caused by poor muscle control. The NFL’s chief medical officer said the NFL would take a “conservative” approach to ruling players out. On Sunday, the new concussion protocol went into effect and several players were sidelined under the new rules.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nVideo shows volcano eruption in Italy\n\nWatch the moment a volcano erupted on the Italian island of Stromboli.

They talked about how much plastic they use in their lives — plastic grocery bags, straws, coffee cup lids, storage containers and packing materials.\n\nIt was overwhelming naming off the things they bought, used and then discarded that were made of plastic.\n\nThey realized most of that waste wasn't being recycled, it was being dumped elsewhere.\n\nHumans buy about 1,000,000 plastic bottles per minute in total. Only about 23 percent of plastic bottles are recycled within the United States, according to the Earth Day Network.\n\nAbout 4.13 million tons of plastic bags, sacks and wraps were generated in 2015, and .53 million tons were recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 12.8 percent of plastic bags, sacks and wraps were recycled in 2015, the EPA said.\n\nCheck out more statistics here.\n\n\"We just gathered as friends at lunch at the beginning of December,\" Tennant said. \"Then it ended up with us making a pact to try and collect all the plastic we used during the month so we could raise our awareness and reduce our use.\"\n\nIt worked.\n\nTennant, along with Brock and Ayers, had three separate collections of plastic on Jan. 4. They had bags and boxes filled with an entire month's worth of plastic for three separate households accounting for six people.\n\nHolding themselves accountable on how much plastic they used in their daily lives changed the way they thought on a day-to-day basis. It was frustrating for them to find a way to live their lives and not have everything packaged in plastic.\n\n\"I think what is eye opening for me is that most of mine is in three different things, they're all lettuce and spinach containers ... they're yogurt or dairy things ... even bulk stuff,\" Ayers said. \"You can't find honey that's not in a plastic container. That's leading me to look for other alternatives.\"\n\nThey even asked those they shopped from to make an effort. Tennant said it became more apparent how much plastic she used in her life when she went to a farmers market to buy a cake. But she couldn't — it was in a plastic container.\n\nTennant ended up asking the vendor to put it in a reusable container that she would bring back. Then the vendor became aware of her own plastic use.\n\nAyers began thinking of ways to reduce plastic in her life when she noticed how much she was gathering with yogurt containers. She started by looking at ways to make her own yogurt to reduce plastic use.\n\n\"Dealing with plastic in our life has been something that I've known for a long time,\" she said. \"It's a really hard issue because we're all busy ... we just have no choices anymore. You want lettuce? They come in plastic containers.\"\n\nMore:Ben Cline made it to Congress, here's how his first day went\n\nEven at grocery stores, Tennant said the employees at the check-out counters would look at her and roll their eyes when she specifically asked for no extra plastic. That means no plastic around produce or meats. All her purchased items were placed in reusable bags.\n\n\"I think you look at this and you think how much do you use in a year?\" Brock said. \"It's a lot of plastic. We have over the course of time, especially this month, tried to reduce our plastic.\"\n\nFor Brock, she struggled with her plastic intake in the form of packaging materials. Everything she ordered online would come with massive amounts of plastic packaging materials.\n\nPlastic packaging was 42 percent of all non-fiber plastic produced in 2015, and it also made up 52 percent of plastics thrown away, according to the Earth Day Network.\n\nBrock was traveling for most of December, but gathered every piece of plastic she used. She started pulling out bags and bags of plastic, especially ones that are used to hold newspapers.\n\n\"Mine's all plastic bags,\" she said. \"There's so much frivolous plastic.\"\n\nThey've all started thinking more systematically about their plastic use and have also started noticing more and more plastic. Tennant is looking at reusable containers for locally sourced products like soaps.\n\n\"We have local people that can do some of these things,\" Ayers said. \"What we're trying to do is figure out where we can reduce.\"\n\nThey always bring reusable bags and store them in their cars so they don't forget. They also repurpose what plastic they have.\n\nWhat was eye opening to Brock was something she noticed on her daily travels. She lives in Middlebrook and travels to Lexington and Staunton throughout the week. Brock started noticing all the trash on the roads she drove.\n\n\"The sides of those roads are littered with plastic,\" she said. \"It's so ugly. It's so disheartening. What happens to that? The esthetic impact of that is terrible, but the impact of litter nationally is huge.\n\n\"For no other reason than to beautify our country roads, we should reduce our plastic,\" she added.\n\nThe three plan on meeting up next week and coming up with bigger plans on reducing their plastic use. Moving forward, they are all making a conscious effort in shrinking their carbon footprints.\n\nMore:Former Mockingbird restaurant sold to Zynodoa owners\n\nFollow Laura Peters @peterslaura.

Gavin Newsom | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn an attempt to slash the wide-ranging impacts of plastic pollution, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law the country’s most sweeping restrictions on single-use plastics and packaging on Thursday, the same day the Supreme Court limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to tackle the worsening climate crisis.\n\nThe law requires that single-use packaging and plastic single-use food serviceware be recyclable or compostable by 2032. It also requires by 2032 a 25% reduction in the sales of plastic packaging and for 65% of all single-use plastic packaging to be recycled. And it establishes an accountability group, which will include industry representatives, to run a new recycling program overseen by the state.\n\n“Our kids deserve a future free of plastic waste and all its dangerous impacts, everything from clogging our oceans to killing animals — contaminating the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat,” Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement. “No more.”\n\nStakeholders negotiated the language around the bill, attempting to design a law that would significantly cut plastic production, ramp up recycling and composting and shift the burden of plastics pollution to industry.\n\nNewsom signed the law just as the US Supreme Court ruled that the federal Clean Air Act does not give the Environmental Protection Agency broad authority to regulate planet-warming emissions from power plants. The opinion was roundly criticized by environmental advocates and scientists who have been sounding the alarm that the world is running out of time to get the climate crisis under control.\n\nPlastics are responsible for at least 232 million tons of planet-warming emissions each year, according to a report released last year. That’s around the same amount as the average emissions released by 116 coal-fired power plants.\n\n“Remember that when you’re making plastic, there’s the greenhouse gas emissions, but these facilities also emit massive amounts of air toxins and particulates,” Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator and now president of Beyond Plastics, told CNN. “It’s really a health threat.”\n\nPlastics also exacerbate environmental injustice. As the industry expands, refineries and production facilities tend to set up shop in largely marginalized communities of color. According to the report, more than 90% of the climate pollution from the plastics industry occurs in 18 communities along the Gulf Coast that are home to mostly low-income residents and people of color.\n\n“California won’t tolerate plastic waste that’s filling our waterways and making it harder to breathe,” Newsom said. “We’re holding polluters responsible and cutting plastics at the source.”\n\nOcean Conservancy, one of the non-profits involved in crafting the language of the bill, estimated the newly passed law alone could eliminate 23 million tons of plastic waste in the next decade — about 26 times the weight of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n“It’s hard to capture how momentous this feels,” Anja Brandon, US plastics policy analyst at Ocean Conservancy and a principal contributor to the bill text, said in a statement. “We can’t solve this problem without U.S. leadership, and by passing this law, California is righting the ship. This is a huge win for our ocean.”\n\nWhile the new law is a clear win for the climate, the environment and communities around plastics facilities, leaders within the plastics industry do not support it.\n\n“The Plastics Industry Association is disappointed that, in the end, we cannot support today’s signed version of Senate bill 54,” Matt Seaholm, Plastics Industry Association president and CEO, said in a statement. “The plastics industry remained dedicated to a final compromise bill that we could get behind, supportive of a circular approach to eliminating plastic waste, which we, unfortunately, do not feel this bill accomplishes.”\n\nA key measure in the law requires plastic producers to pay $500 million to the state each year for 10 years starting in 2027, which will be collected into the California Plastic Pollution Mitigation Fund. The fund will then be dedicated to “mitigating the environmental impacts of plastic,” the law says.\n\nWhile the new California law puts a special emphasis on recycling, environmental experts have been sounding the alarm about the ineffectiveness of plastics recycling. California, for example, has fallen short of statewide goals of recycling 75% of waste by 2020. Of the state’s 77.4 million tons of waste generated in 2020, approximately 42% was recycled or diverted, according to a report from California’s Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery.\n\nIn 2021, Americans recycled only about 5% of their plastic waste, a decline from the high of 9.5% in 2014.\n\n“In this time of extreme polarization in our nation, California was able to show that we can pass strong environmental legislation with bipartisan support that brought together the environmental and business communities,” California state Sen. Ben Allen, author of the legislation, said in a statement. “With this new law, California continues its tradition of global environmental leadership.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez Taylor Romine", "Rachel Ramirez", "Taylor Romine"], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/23/recycling-crisis-has-come-holidays/2054199002/", "title": "Holiday boxes: Recycling crisis hits; US has higher collection fees", "text": "As millions of holiday deliveries head to doorsteps around the country, it's becoming clear that some of this year's gift boxes may not necessarily become next year's gift boxes.\n\nThis holiday season collides with what has become known as the great recycling crisis. Earlier this year, China, which for years has been America's go-to nation for processing recyclables into new boxes, started rejecting all but the cleanest, purest loads.\n\nChina's decision left recyclers without a market, causing recyclables to pile up and prices to plummet. Their value fell by about half from pre-crisis levels, making it much more expensive to recycle glass, plastic and paper, according to Waste Management, the trash-hauling giant that bills itself as the nation's largest residential recycler.\n\n\"The economics aren't in our favor anymore,\" said Brandon Wright, spokesman for the National Waste and Recycling Association.\n\nThe shift doesn't bode well for the future of recycling. After years of conditioning Americans to throw all their reusable containers and paper in bins, cities across the U.S. are now imposing higher collection fees, eliminating items they are willing to pick up, or in a few cases, weighing whether to curtail recycling altogether.\n\nIt isn't good news for the environment. Roughly 35 percent of the U.S.' total waste is diverted to recycling from the overall solid waste stream. That's millions of tons of materials that can be reused rather than having to use virgin materials. It also saves on the energy and effort required to make new items from scratch.\n\nAt holiday time, recycling bins can overflow with mountains of leftover packaging, not to mention soft-drink cans and New Year's champagne bottles. UPS alone forecasts its crews will deliver 800 million packages this season, up from 762 million at the same time last year. Add another 400 million or so for FedEx if its total matches last year's volume.\n\nNo longer accepted\n\nThe online retailing revolution – and home delivery – have forced big changes in recycling. More cardboard boxes now go to homes rather than businesses, complicating pickup.\n\nNormally, discarded holiday gift boxes and other recyclables would be put out for recycling in tiny Bosque Farms, New Mexico. But this year, the enclave's private trash hauler is no longer accepting recyclables because it's too costly.\n\nTo deal with dwindling revenue, city leaders in Dothan, Alabama, are thinking of suspending curbside pickup of recyclables and instead creating one or two recycling centers where people can take cans, bottles, paper and more.\n\nIn Sacramento County, California, recycling goes on, but the economic toll is adding up. Mixed paper was worth $85 to $95 a ton to recyclers a year ago. Lately, it's been fetching $6.50 to $8.50. Lesser-quality plastics were worth $45 a ton. Now it costs $35 to get it recycled. Cardboard prices fell, too.\n\n\"For a long time, China was taking all of our waste paper, and we were feeling pretty good about it,\" said Dave Vaccarezza, who heads the family-owned Cal-Waste Recovery Systems in Galt, California, which handles recyclables for Sacramento and three other counties. \"Now they've shut that down.\"\n\nWaste Management, which has about 100 recycling processing facilities around the nation, says the cost of processing recyclables was once $85 a ton. Now the sorted loads collectively only bring in about $65 a ton. Instead of receiving a check for their recyclables, cities are now being asked to pay to have them taken away, said Brent Bell, the company's vice president of recycling.\n\nThe good news, he said, is that his company has managed to find markets for recycled materials other than China, but they are in India and other South Asian nations where it can cost more to ship.\n\nRecycle this, not that\n\nSelling recycled materials is supposed to be a profit center for communities, offsetting the cost of collecting them. Recycling is big business, accounting for 757,000 jobs in the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency estimates.\n\nBut with China pulling out of the market, the recycling industry, or the private haulers and processors locked into contracts with cities and counties to sort and find markets for the materials, now either needs to demand extra compensation or lose money fulfilling their obligations.\n\nThe problem, in large measure, surrounds how Americans recycle. City dwellers love the convenience of piling all their cans, bottles, paper and other items into a single bin. But the mixing also creates issues when it comes to sorting.\n\nAmazon boxes are environmentally friendly and completely recyclable, but not if they become saturated with battery acid or Thanksgiving turkey gravy. Paper is fine to recycle, but not if it's a grease-smeared pizza box.\n\nBins are also contaminated with junk that shouldn't be there at all, like spent garden hoses, broken-down lawn chairs, dead car batteries or the industry's top bugaboo, grocery bags made of plastic film. Waste Management said the overall contamination rate of recycled materials is about 25 percent.\n\nThe mixing of waste materials has led to recycling bin inspections, which can lead to either warnings from the haulers or the city about putting the wrong items in bins or refusal to pick up loads until the homeowner eliminates the problem.\n\nVermont's Agency of Natural Resources is going further, with public-service ads \"to encourage residents and businesses to recycle right,\" said Josh Kelly, the agency's material management section chief.\n\nThe state also recently enacted a law amending the state's landfill disposal requirements allowing the agency to issue a waiver that let mixed paper – typically catalogs, junk mail and alike – be sent to landfills instead of being recycled if there are no markets for it. So far, Kelly said, it hasn't been needed.\n\nWhile the China ban is expected to lead to the building of more plants to process recycled paper and plastic back to raw materials in the U.S., \"those in the recycling industry expect it will take at least a few years before a true market rebound is felt,\" he said.\n\nRecycling robots\n\nUntil then, recycling firms have hired more workers to painstakingly reduce the contamination rate by separating materials. Some save on labor by investing millions in recycling \"robots,\" giant machines that can carefully separate materials that came from single residential bins.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of American households have some form of curbside pickup of recyclables, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition found in a study. Other communities still cling to having residents separate their trash and bring it to a single collection point.\n\nIn Teton County, Wyoming – home to Jackson Hole – government officials say they are able to reduce contamination and cut the volume of trash they would otherwise send to its landfill about 100 miles away in Idaho by having residents sort their own waste.\n\nHaving the landfill so far away is expensive, said Heather Overholser, the county's superintendent of Solid Waste and Recycling. \"Therefore recycling makes a lot of economic sense as well as environmental sense.\"\n\nMost cities are just anxious for some sort of resolution to the crisis.\n\nBecause recycling is in so much turmoil, \"we would like to get it solved,\" said Gretchen Olsen, solid waste manager for Stockton, California.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/07/landfill-waste-how-prevent-disposable-razor-plastic-pollution/1943345001/", "title": "Landfill waste: How to prevent disposable razor plastic pollution", "text": "Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK — How bad is your disposable razor for the environment? The question is gaining attention among consumers amid a growing global campaign against plastic waste, with cities and countries introducing bans on single-use plastic bags and straws.\n\nDon't worry, there's no talk of banning your razor, which isn't exactly single use. Still, billions of plastic razors and refill blade cartridges get tossed in landfills each year. Municipal recycling programs in the U.S. will not accept them because they are sharp objects made of mixed materials.\n\nWhat can be done? Well, there are no perfectly convenient options, aside from foregoing shaving altogether. For those concerned about an eco-friendlier shave, here are some things to know.\n\nCrack open a cold one:PepsiCo testing canned water to cut down plastic use\n\nOpinion:Recycling can really pay off\n\nThe fate of disposable razors\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency once estimated that 2 billion razors and refill blades get tossed out in the U.S. each year. That figure is widely cited by recycling advocates and startups marketing eco-friendly razors. Gillette, the world's leading razor brand, also cites the number on a website detailing a new recycling program for razors launched earlier this year.\n\nBut the figure appears to date back to an EPA campaign from the late 1980s against a national \"garbage crisis.\" A 1990 \"Environmental Consumer's Handbook\" on the EPA's website says the U.S. produces \"2 billion throwaway razors and blades\" each year. The EPA now says it does not track the impact of disposable razors on the environment and has no update on the figure.\n\nIt's likely even higher. Last year, more than $1.2 billion in disposable razors were sold in the U.S, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Prices vary widely but many disposables are less than $1 each.\n\nHow to recycle your razors\n\nThere are few options for recycling razors. The French company BIC started a razor recycling program in France a few years ago that didn't last.\n\nNow, Gillette is trying out a similar idea in the U.S. in partnership with Terracycle, an organization that specializes in hard-to-recycle waste. All brands of razors are accepted.\n\nThe easiest option is mailing the razors to Terracycle, but the shipping costs are on you. At no cost, you can deliver razors to drop-off centers on Terracycle's interactive map. But with only 200 locations so far, the option is not practical for many. (There's only one site so far in California, and six in Florida.) Stephanie Moses, an account director for Terracycle, said the program is growing quickly, and the map will be updated to show 350 locations by mid-August.\n\nMan accidentally throws away $23K:Somehow recovers it at a recycling facility\n\nThe comeback of the double-edged safety razors\n\nRemember the old-school safety razor your grandfather used? It's making a comeback. Trendy direct-to-consumer brands have reintroduced them to younger generations, most prominently Bevel, the grooming lined aimed at black men, and Oui Shave, one of the few safety razor brands aimed at women.\n\nSafety razors are built to last, usually made of materials like steel or chrome. The only waste is the steel blades, and some municipalities recycle them. Oui founder Karen Young said she's developing a map for her site to show which ones. Newcomer brand Leaf Shave allows customers to mail back their blades in a custom-made tin box for recycling.\n\nThe tricky thing is that safety razors come with a higher upfront cost, ranging anywhere from $15 to more than $200 depending on the brand. However, the refill blades are cheap, as low as 20 cents each, compared to $2 for the average modern cartridge.\n\nYou can familiarize yourself with established brands through long-time retailers like GroomingLounge.com and The Art of Shaving. Michael Gilman, founder of GroomingLounge.com, said safety razors are a small but fast-growing part of his business, with blade sales tripling in the past year. Beginners should go for the lower-priced razors and look for closed-comb design and weighted handles, he said.\n\nIf you are looking to try one out, however, most of the newer digital brands offer 30-day returns, regardless of whether the razor is used.\n\nAre there other eco-friendly options?\n\nSafety razors are not made for rushed morning routines. And frequent fliers be warned: you can't throw the blades into your carry-on luggage.

But this metric doesn’t factor the number of cars in line. In that category, Chick-fil-A is the clear leader, with 16% of its lines surveyed counting ten or more cars. McDonald’s, which was in second place, only had 2% with that many customers.\n\nBased on the total time cars spent in line, Chick-fil-A came out on top, with an average of about 107 seconds. McDonald’s came in second at 118 seconds, followed by Taco Bell and Arby’s.\n\nQSR and Intouch Insight published its annual Drive-Thru Report, surveying more than 1,000 consumers who ranked ten industry leaders: Wendy’s, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Dunkin’, McDonald’s, Arby’s, Carl’s Jr., Hardee’s, Taco Bell, and KFC.\n\nDrive-thrus got bogged down last year mostly because of a shortage of restaurant workers, as thousands left the industry. The pandemic surge of drive-thru and pickup and delivery orders only exacerbated the issue\n\nBut luckily for customers, drive-thrus have gotten nearly 10 seconds faster compared to last year — and that can be a big advantage in this highly competitive industry.\n\n“Mere seconds can be a make-it or break-it in terms of where a consumer decides to order,” Amanda Topper, a research director at Mintel, said to CNN Business last year.\n\nHowever, the current average is still about 45 seconds slower than the 2019 pace. The study said pre-sell menu boards, order accuracy and friendliness helped decrease the wait times at drive-thrus this year.\n\nService and speed\n\nDuring peak Covid, Chick-fil-A was one of the first brands to close its dining rooms, focusing its attention on bringing hospitality to the drive-thru outside.\n\n“We believe that looking eye-to-eye with the customer allows for a connection that happens at the beginning of the drive-thru,” Matt Abercrombie, Chick-fil-A’s senior director of service and hospitality, said in the study.\n\nThe researchers found that Chick-fil-A had fine tuned the “check-point system,” which keeps customers engaged through different interactions with employees.\n\nAnd that’s clear in consumer sentiment too — 88% of respondents said Chick-fil-A had friendly service, placing it at the top of the industry. Only 1.7% said the service was “not friendly.”\n\nBut when it comes to customer satisfaction, respondents said Arby’s had the most accurate orders filled, at 89.6%. McDonald’s and Burger King closely followed.\n\nWendy’s\n\nWendy’s founder Dave Thomas named the first modern drive-thru in 1970, coining the term “Pick-Up Window.” And though the company this year announced a makeover that places an “emphasis on convenience, speed and accuracy,” it has lagged behind its competitors in the survey.\n\nThe chain plans to redesign its interiors and implement new pick-up windows and a more technologically advanced kitchen.\n\nThe pandemic has opened up a new consumer demand for the drive-thru, pressuring fast food companies to upgrade signage, sanitation and technology.\n\nIn the survey, Wendy’s came in 7th for speed of service and was also the lowest for order accuracy, at 79.4%.

They ordered one main item, one side item and one drink, and included a small modification, like no ice in a soda. The data was based on a total of 1,948 visits across all restaurants.\n\nThe average time to get through the drive-thru line at all restaurants was 226.3 seconds, or 3.8 minutes. The fastest was Wendy's, which serves up Baconators in 2.8 minutes. The slowest was Starbucks, which takes five minutes, probably because you keep ordering a venti non-fat PSL with a double shot and soy whip.

The study, to be released today, also says that industry giant McDonald's posted its slowest-ever drive-thru time in the 15-year history of the drive-thru study — requiring an average 189.5 seconds for the typical drive-thru customer to go from order to pickup. That's roughly nine seconds longer than the industry average, reports the study conducted this summer by Insula Research.\n\nThe importance of the drive-thru business to the $299 billion fast-food industry cannot be overstated. Many major chains do 60% to 70% of their business at the drive-thru. That's even nudged so-called fast-casual chains like Panera to move into the drive-thru arena and increase the number of drive-thrus it opens.\n\nThe industry issue that's slowing down service: menu bloat. Fast food's ongoing market-share battle is forcing big chains to roll out more premium and more complex products more often. \"The operational pressures to assemble those items are slowing down the drive-thru,\" says Sam Oches, editor of QSR.\n\nFor example, Taco Bell told QSR that its Cantina Bell bowls sometimes have up to 12 ingredients — which are much more complex to assemble than, say, a Doritos Locos Taco.\n\nThere's another factor at work, too: accuracy.\n\n\"The one thing that angers a customer most is to not get the right food,\" says Oches. \"It's possible to be too fast.\"\n\nConsumers get so upset when they find the wrong kind of burger — or the wrong toppings — in their bags, that many fast-food sellers are either slowing down the process or adding additional order-accuracy checks to assure correct orders. Some chains are \"doubling down\" on order accuracy, says Oches.\n\n\"Customers will be patient if you give them hot, accurate orders,\" says Oches.\n\nEven then, 2013 has not been the industry's best year in order accuracy, either. Order accuracy for drive-thru meals for the industry was at 87.2% this year vs. 88.8% last year. The chain ranking highest in accuracy: Chick-fil-A at 91.6%. The lowest was Burger King at 82.3%.\n\nBut Chick-fil-A customers paid for that industry-leading accuracy at the other end — they waited in the drive-thru line longer than anyone this year: 203.9 seconds, on average. By comparison, Wendy's was the fastest drive-thru, at an average 133.6 seconds, says Oches.\n\nBut even Wendy's has seen some increase in the time it takes to fill an order. Way back in 2003, Wendy's posted the industry's best-ever average order time of 116 seconds.\n\nNo one's since come close to that, says Oches.

That's an enormous jump and the longest average time logged in the 17 years that QSR has overseen the study. To be fair, in 2013, the survey was focused on seven fast-food chains, but the 2014 study greatly expanded to 17 fast-food brands.\n\n\"Things are definitely slowing down,\" says Sam Oches, editor of QSR. \"That's the new normal.\"\n\nThe importance of rapid service can't be overstressed in a $200 billion-plus industry whose very name is fast food. The major fast-food chains do at least 60% of their business in the drive-thru, and some do closer to 70%. Getting the food out quickly has been the industry's competitive edge for decades. Oches says the latest study results are not all bad news.\n\nFor one thing, the food is getting healthier. Healthier premium items, such as Cantina bowls at Taco Bell or fruit smoothies at McDonald's, require extra time to make. At the same time, fast-food chains are working harder to keep order accuracy near the 87% range — about the highest the industry has posted, he says.\n\nThe industry change — away from breakneck drive-thru speed — began last year, Oches says. \"The chains are more focused on serving fresh food and providing a good drive-thru experience with accurate orders,\" he says.\n\nThe best time of day to avoid the fast-food line is fast-changing. Lunch used to be the single busiest time. This year, the busiest time of day at the drive-thru was the \"snack\" part of the day — usually 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., the study found. The second-busiest time was at breakfast. These are two areas the industry has recently invested in heavily for growth. Taco Bell rolled out out its breakfast program this year, and McDonald's has greatly expanded its snack offerings over the past several years.\n\nTo broaden its scope, QSR expanded its annual study from seven to 17 fast-food chains this year. The national study of 2,188 separate drive-thru trips was conducted in June, July and August.\n\nEven as the drive-thru lane slows down, the study found that slightly fewer cars are going that route. This year's study found an average 1.7 cars waiting in the drive-thru lane vs. 2.8 cars last year.\n\nAs more fast-food chains update their images and add Wi-Fi and more quality products, Oches says, \"people may be slightly more interested in going into a dining room.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/us/five-things-october-14-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for October 14: January 6, Parkland, Raleigh ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

The committee argued in its final hearing before the midterm elections that Trump was directly involved in the bid to overturn the 2020 election, with the panel presenting new evidence that Trump knew he had lost but had a plan to declare victory no matter the election result. The panel also showed previously unseen footage of congressional leaders taking refuge amid the violence as the panel detailed Trump’s inaction during the attack.

The jury’s recommendation Thursday came after a monthslong trial to decide the gunman’s punishment. A judge is expected to issue the gunman’s formal sentence on November 1. Victims and family members are expected to speak before the sentence is delivered that day.\n\n3.

The shooting unfolded around 5 p.m. in the neighborhood of Hedingham and an hourslong ordeal ensued as authorities worked to apprehend the suspect. The suspected shooter, a minor, was taken into custody four and a half hours later, police said. “Tonight, terror has reached our doorstep. The nightmare of every community has come to Raleigh,” Gov.

SeeLevel HX found that the time between ordering the food to getting it was actually 17 seconds faster this year than last, meaning all the extra wait is before ordering.\n\n\"The pandemic is continuing to have a massive impact on QSRs (quick-service restaurants) from a spike in traffic and stricter safety standards and protocols to a substantial increase in staffing turnover and training, so I'm not surprised to see a dip in speed of service,\" van Kesteren said.\n\nBut, as the survey shows, speed comes at a price.\n\nWhile Chck-fil-A might take longer to get food into customers' hands, patrons were happiest with what they got. Chick-fil-A ranked the highest on the study's three other measurements: customer satisfaction, the accuracy of the order and – most important of all – taste.\n\nKFC, on the other hand, might get food to customers the fastest, but customers said the Colonel's restaurants had the worst customer service and were most likely to get the order wrong.\n\nWendy's didn't fare much better. Of the 10 restaurants studied by SeeLevel HX, Wendy's came in ninth in order accuracy, and seventh in customer service and taste.\n\nWendy's pointed to other surveys that showed a much higher customer satisfaction. In a study commissioned by QSR Magazine, Wendy's ranked sixth in overall customer satisfaction out of 17 restaurants examined. The chain fared well on most measurements, including speed of service, quality of food, order accuracy and availability of menu items.\n\nChick-fil-A again scored the highest on the QSR study, with Popeye's pulling up the rear.\n\nInformation from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is included in this report.\n\njweiker@dispatch.com\n\n@JimWeiker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/business/restaurants-pandemic-effects/index.html", "title": "The restaurant business will probably never recover from Covid ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe restaurant industry will likely never return to its pre-pandemic state, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nThe trade group says 2022 will be a “new normal,” for the sector as it struggles to rebound and as competition for workers remains intense, according to the association’s 2022 State of the Restaurant Industry report, which was released Tuesday.\n\n“Restaurants and their patrons have found themselves in a ‘new normal.’ Given emergent technology, changing consumer behavior and dining preferences, and the extraordinary challenges of the last two years, the industry is unlikely to ever completely return to its pre-pandemic state,” said Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of the Research and Knowledge Group at the National Restaurant Association.\n\nPent up demand from consumers will help in 2022 — the group predicts sales will continue to rise, forecasting sales this year of $898 billion, up from $864 billion in 2019. Yet just one in four restaurant operators believes their restaurant will be more profitable this year than last.\n\nRecruitment and retention are top issues. Seven in 10 restaurant operators say they don’t have enough employees, and about 50% note that will be a top challenge this year.\n\nA full return to employment is not expected in 2022 and competition for employees will remain “intense.” The group estimates total industry employment will reach 14.9 million jobs. That’s up just 400,000 from 2021 as job openings remain high — and still a million fewer jobs than pre-pandemic levels. Just five states — Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Arizona — have the same number of restaurant employees as they did pre-pandemic.\n\nIn December, quit rate in the accommodation and food services sector, which includes restaurants, was 10.2%, according to seasonally adjusted data released this week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It follows months of similarly high quit rates in the industry.\n\nSome restaurant operators are turning to technology to ease staffing shortages. Thirty-eight percent of adults say they would be okay with a robot delivering their meal at a restaurant this year. Ghost kitchens — offsite delivery-only kitchens for restaurants — remain a small part of the landscape, but 50% of quick service operators expect it to grow in 2022.\n\nEmployment is just one issue facing restaurants. Ninety percent of restaurant operators say rising costs will likely continue through 2022, and 96% of operators do not believe supply chain issues will be fixed this year.\n\nWorking from home changed the game for the restaurant industry. Fifty-four percent of work-from-home employees say they go out to dinner less frequently than they did before the pandemic, while 47% of WFH employees say the same thing about lunch, according to the report.", "authors": ["Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}]}

In response, geographer and earth scientist Dave Petley debunked the theory on his blog, \"The Landslide Blog.\"\n\nPetley, whose research at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom focuses on landslides , said no previous volcanic flank collapse in the world has led to a tsunami of the magnitude Day and Ward describe. Additionally, he wrote, submarine deposits from volcanic flank collapses suggest they don't happen as one big collapse, like Day and Ward hypothesize.\n\nRather, they happen in a series of slides, which would make the resulting tsunami \"much less significant.\"\n\n\"It really is time that this event was presented for what it is, which is an absolutely extreme scenario based on a very highly unlikely combination of events that is without precedent,\" Petley wrote.\n\nFact check: False claim that many California voters were told they already voted\n\nWhile the last volcanic eruption in La Palma happened 30 years before Ward and Day's study was published in 2001, the island is of volcanic nature, and seismic activity is often considered normal.\n\nIn the last two decades, there has been extensive seismic activity similar to the small earthquakes seen prior to the eruption, according to Spain's National Geographic Institute. This activity was within normal parameters for the area and didn't \"present any risks to the residents.\" Many of the earthquakes registered aren't even felt by residents, as they happen kilometers under the surface.\n\nFact check:Photo of HHS official Rachel Levine in a bathing suit is altered\n\nIn October 2017, after more than 100 seismic events were registered within one week in La Palma, the islands' volcanology institute debunked the theory – again.\n\n\"Although it's been more than 10 years since this theory, the hypothesis that gave way (to the idea) of a collapse of the Cumbre Vieja is still being considered,\" the institute said, according to the Spanish online newspaper El Diario.\n\nThe institute said the probability of a highly explosive eruption happening at the same time as a large earthquake – which is required for the theory to be true – is \"extremely remote, according to geological records of this type of event on the island.\"\n\n\"The Cumbre Vieja is stable even under the effects of eruptions similar to those that have occurred in the last tens of thousands of years,\" it said.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that experts have predicted the eruption in La Palma will cause a tsunami that would reach the U.S. Spanish and American officials have said the volcanic eruption doesn't present any risks to the United States.

One was bearing down on Todoque, where more than 1,000 people live, and where emergency services were preparing evacuations.\n\nSo far, the eruption has destroyed around 190 houses and forced the evacuation of 6,000 people.\n\n“The truth is that it’s a tragedy to see people losing their properties,” said municipal worker Fernando Díaz in the town of El Paso.\n\nThe lava’s advance has slowed to about 400 feet an hour, according to the head of the Canary Island Volcanic Emergency Plan, Miguel Ángel Morcuende, and wasn’t expected to reach the Atlantic Ocean before Wednesday.\n\nCanary Islands government chief Ángel Víctor Torres said “when (the lava) reaches the sea, it will be a critical moment.”\n\nThe meeting of the lava, whose temperature exceeds 1,800 F, with a body of water could cause explosions and produce clouds of toxic gas. Torres asked locals to remember the island’s last eruption in 1971, when one person died after inhaling the gas emitted as lava met the water.\n\nA change in the wind direction blew the ashes from the volcano across a vast area on the western side of the island, with the black particles blanketing everything.

This storm system, if you believe one model, will bring real snow to Atlanta, but also an icy mess to coastal towns like Savannah in Georgia and Charleston in South Carolina.\n\nBe sure to bookmark this link and check back later in the week to see how much the National Weather Service is forecasting.\n\nNot to mention, it could actually bring good accumulating snow to cities in the Northeast, like New York.\n\nThe problem is, there is less uncertainty in this storm system than this past weekend.\n\nLast week, both global weather models showed the same overall weather pattern but disagreed on the details.\n\nThis week we can’t even say we are sure something WILL happen.\n\n“Ample forecast spread and continuity issues limits predictability of particular system threats days 4-7,” the Weather Prediction Center said Monday morning in its forecast discussion.\n\nWhat is certain is that a cold front will push through the Central US Wednesday and across the East through Thursday, leaving an Arctic blast of frigid air behind it.\n\nFrigid below-average temperatures dive south and east Wednesday through Thursday. CNN Weather\n\nTemperatures from the Plains to the East Coast could drop 20 to 30 degrees below normal.\n\nTexas, for instance, will have many areas go from the 70s and 80s Tuesday to mid-30s and lower 40s on Thursday.\n\nAs frigid temperatures established across the East Thursday into Friday, a low pressure system is expected to form along the cold front and just off the Georgia coast. If it forms near the coast, it could filter in moisture from the Atlantic into the cold air, allowing for that winter precipitation to form in areas that you might not associate with ice or snow. Take Charleston, South Carolina, for instance.\n\n“The thermal profiles of all of the medium range models indicate the potential for wintry precipitation across all or part of the forecast area at some point from late Thursday night through Saturday morning,” the National Weather Service in Charleston said Monday morning.\n\nIt also adds a similar disclaimer: “There has been drastic run-to-run inconsistency between the global models which has resulted in a low confidence forecast.”\n\nThere it is, the “maybe.” Sound familiar? Here’s why.\n\nThe one model that shows the system close to the coast takes it up the coastline, bringing more winter precip for a longer period for Georgia, the Carolinas, and then into the mid-Atlantic and coastal New England.\n\nThe American weather model still shows some precip in the South but not the widespread European model. It forms a low, but the storm system quickly moves East away from the coast. This means there still is likely to be some winter precip in some areas, but less. Thus my son’s dreams to sled are likely to be dashed again. But this outcome will probably be better for those of you chipping away at ice today or digging out of the snow.\n\nAnother complex wrinkle is the latest American model shows another shot at snow in the South on Sunday.\n\nBut it is worth keeping an eye on this week.\n\n“This has the potential to be a big event, but without a convergence in model solutions and better run-to-run consistency, messaging timing, amounts, and impacts will be challenging,” the Atlanta National Weather Service said.\n\nAn unexpected cloud that the meteorological community did not expect to see Saturday\n\nNew images released Monday reveal what is left of the oceanic volcano. It is not much. The left image is data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite acquired on 2 January 2022 and the right is Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite imagery from 15 January 2022. European Union, Copernicus Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 imagery\n\nJust when you think you have it all figured out, Mother Nature loves to throw a curveball. Of course, while millions in the Southeast were gearing up for a huge winter storm – deciding if it was worth it to get a sled – a volcano eruption was the last thing we saw coming.\n\nWe were all so focused with a one-track mind on the winter weekend that lies ahead. Then suddenly – BOOM! It was an explosion that was felt and heard around the world, and one we never saw coming. A volcano erupted off the island of Tonga in the South Pacific, and it created literal shockwaves – and tsunami waves – around the world.\n\nSaturday morning’s eruption was likely the largest volcano eruption the planet has seen in more than 30 years. Gas, ash and steam shot up into the sky nearly 19 miles high, and a tsunami was triggered by the incredible water displacement from the blast. Waves began to travel across the Pacific in all directions, even impacting the US west coast and Hawaii.\n\nIf this is all news to you, catch up on all the details of what happened here.\n\nIf you want to geek out with me a little on what continues to blow my meteorological mind, let’s keep going. First, the fact the eruption was actually heard as far away as Alaska – nearly 6,000 miles away – is absolutely wild!\n\nThe first images of the eruption and shock wave could be seen from space.\n\nThere was a pressure drop that was felt around the world as well. Meteorologists took to Twitter to show the slow rise and then rapid pressure drop at stations across the world, including the US.\n\nAs far as impacting our weather around the world, experts say it’s a little too early to tell. Erik Klemetti, an associate professor of geosciences at Denison University in Ohio, tells CNN the Tonga eruption might have a regional impact on temperature, though scientists are still unsure of its significance. Klemetti noted it ultimately depends on how much sulfur dioxide made it into the atmosphere.\n\nInteresting note: most people think it’s the ash that affects global temperatures and weather after a volcanic eruption. It’s actually the sulfur dioxide, which reacts with water to form aerosols that reflect the sunlight back to space to absorb heat in the upper atmosphere.\n\nYou can read more about the volcano’s impacts to global temperature here.", "authors": ["Judson Jones Jennifer Gray", "Judson Jones", "Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/15/asia/tsunami-warning-tonga-volcano-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Tonga: Tsunami advisories lifted in US after waves hit Pacific island ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn underwater volcano in the South Pacific erupted violently on Saturday, causing tsunamis to hit Hawaii, Japan, and Tonga’s largest island, Tongatapu – sending waves flooding into the capital.\n\nThe Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Tonga’s Fonuafo’ou island, first erupted on Friday and a second time on Saturday around 5:26 p.m. local time, according to CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand (RNZ).\n\nThe eruptions sent a plume of ash, gas and steam 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) into the air, according to RNZ. Satellite imagery showed a massive ash cloud and shockwaves spreading from the eruption. Ash was falling from the sky in the Tonga capital, Nuku’alofa, Saturday evening and phone connections were down.\n\nThe eruption caused a severe tsunami on Tongatapu, where the capital is located, with waves flowing onto coastal roads and flooding properties on Saturday.\n\nSo far, New Zealand authorities have not received any reports of deaths or injuries in Tonga related to the eruption, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Expert explains what's happening in 'jaw-dropping' eruption video 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nThe tsunami had a “significant impact” on Nuku’alofa, with boats and large boulders washed ashore, and shops along the coast damaged, she added.\n\nRNZ reported that residents fled for higher ground as waves swept the waterfront, main street and grounds of Tonga’s Royal Palace. Though it was early evening, videos show the sky already dark from the ash cloud.\n\nTonga’s King Tupou VI was evacuated from the palace, RNZ said, citing local media reports of a convoy of police and troops rushing the monarch to a villa at Mata Ki Eua.\n\nTelecommunications were affected, though it’s not clear how widespread the damage is yet, Ardern said, adding that the main undersea cable has been impacted likely due to loss of power.\n\nThe New Zealand government has committed an initial $340,000 in relief supplies, technical support, and supporting local responses, with the country’s Defence Force sending assistance to Tonga, Ardern said.\n\nShe added that while conditions in the area seem stable, further eruption activity cannot be ruled out.\n\nImpact in Japan\n\nThe eruption also had effects across the Pacific, as tsunami warnings and advisories were issued from parts of New Zealand and Japan to the United States and Canada’s British Columbia.\n\nPer the National Weather Service, a tsunami warning means those nearby should get inland or seek higher ground immediately, while an advisory means they should stay away from the shore and out of the water.\n\nJapan’s Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami advisory for the country’s coastal areas early Sunday morning, with the northeastern prefecture of Iwate seeing waves as high as 2.7 meters (9 feet). Multiple smaller tsunamis were reported in numerous other locations, according to public broadcaster NHK.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, all tsunami advisories had been lifted, the meteorological agency said. Weather agency officials ruled out the possibility of further tsunamis across the country, but said there might be some tidal fluctuations.\n\nJapan’s coast guard was out assessing damage, but so far none had been reported, NHK said, noting it was still dark and more waves were expected. Officials continued to ask people to stay alert and away from beaches.\n\nFootage shared on NHK from a viewer in Setouchi town, on Amami Oshima Island, showed bumper-to-bumper traffic as cars evacuated to higher ground. Other footage showed people sleeping on floors in evacuation centers in Iwate.\n\nA tsunami has hit Tonga's largest island, Tongatapu. @sakakimoana/Twitter\n\nElsewhere, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said it recorded a tsunami wave of 1.2 meters (about 4 feet) near Nuku’alofa at 5:30 p.m. local time on Saturday. And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said tsunami waves of 2.7 feet (0.8 meters) were observed by gauges at Nuku’alofa and waves of 2 feet at Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, Reuters reported.\n\nThe nearby island of Fiji also issued a public advisory asking people living in low-lying coastal areas to “move to safety in anticipation of the strong currents and dangerous waves.” Footage from the ground shows people fleeing to higher ground in Suva, the capital of Fiji, as large waves hit the coast.\n\nIn Samoa, another Pacific island nation, a tsunami watch is in effect for all low-lying coastal areas, the Samoa Meteorological Service said, with residents and visitors advised to stay away from beach areas.\n\nAn earlier tsunami advisory for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu was discontinued, with the country’s National Disaster Management issuing an “all clear.” The office had earlier advised residents to move away from the coastline and seek higher ground.\n\nWaves seen in the US\n\nThe eruption also sent waves to the US West Coast, with some exceeding 3 and 4 feet in height, according to the National Weather Service office in San Diego.\n\nThe highest waves recorded were in Port San Luis, California (4.3 feet); King Cove, Alaska (3.3 feet); Area Cove, California (3.7 feet); Crescent City, California (3.7 feet); and Port Reyes, California (2.9 feet).\n\nThe first tsunami waves were felt on the West Coast early Saturday morning, according to Dave Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator at the National Weather Service’s National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska.\n\nA wave as high as 1.2 feet had been observed in Nikolski, Alaska, he told CNN via telephone, while waves as tall as 1 foot were observed in Atka, Adak and King Cove, Alaska.\n\n“This may not be the largest wave as this is coming in yet,” Snider told CNN, saying the event was not over.\n\nAsh rises into the air after a powerful underwater volcanic eruption in the South Pacific. Tonga Geological Services/EyePress/Reuters\n\nThe initial coastal tsunami advisory included the states of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. All of the advisories had been lifted by early Sunday morning, according the Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning tweeted no damage was reported thus far from the tsunami observed in the Hawaiian Islands. A tsunami advisory for Hawaii was canceled by the agency Saturday morning.\n\nAdam Weintraub, a spokesperson for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, told CNN there were “no reports of major damage so far,” though the effects had been felt across multiple islands. Officials were still assessing the damage.\n\nThe impacts were the equivalent of a “high King Tide,” Weintraub said earlier, telling CNN there had been flooding in parking lots and harbor areas he characterized as “nuisance flooding.”\n\nSpeaking by telephone, Snider said, “We don’t have a really good forecast because this event is based on a volcano rather than an earthquake.”\n\nNonetheless, the National Weather Service in Seattle urged caution along the US Pacific Coast on Saturday. “Move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas in these areas,” NWS Seattle tweeted.\n\nThe city of Laguna Beach, California, closed all beaches, boardwalks, harbors and piers until further notice in response to the tsunami advisory early Saturday morning, telling residents, “please stay out of the water and away from the shore.”\n\nSanta Cruz, California, also experienced some “minor flooding” at the harbor, city manager Elizabeth Smith told CNN.\n\nHigh tide comes into a harbor in Santa Cruz, California, seen in this still image from a video obtained by CNN. The water quickly drained out, Brad Anderson -- the person that provided the video -- said. Brad Anderson\n\nThe waves came right at high tide, Fire Chief Rob Young said. The initial wave occurred at approximately 7:40 a.m. local time, he said, bringing with it a 1 to 2-foot wave right at the peak of high tide. The largest wave came in at about 8:49 a.m. local time, prompting a surge of about 7 feet at the harbor. A subsequent surge just after 10 a.m. was “diminished.”\n\n“When it comes, it comes quickly,” he said. “Not just a 1-foot wave, but it comes in a surge because it draws all the water out first, and then it comes in.”\n\nThere was some damage in the harbor and to some docks, he said. There was also “light flooding” on the beaches and up to the city’s first surface street, Young said.\n\nAll beaches and the harbor will be closed until at least noon local time, Smith said, and people were evacuated from nearby stores and the area near the harbor, though no one has been evacuated from their homes. A surf contest has been postponed and is expected to resume later Saturday.\n\nNew Zealand on alert\n\nA tsunami advisory was also issued for coastal areas on the north and east coast of New Zealand’s North Island and the Chatham Islands, where “strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore” were expected, according to New Zealand’s National Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNew Zealand’s official weather service said its weather stations across the country had observed “a pressure surge” on Saturday evening from the eruption.\n\nA satellite image taken by Himawari-8, a Japanese weather satellite, and released by the agency, shows an undersea volcano eruption at the Pacific nation of Tonga Saturday, January 15, 2022. Japan Meteorology Agency/AP\n\nScientist Emily Lane, of New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, told the New Zealand Science Media Centre it was a “very significant” eruption.\n\n“The shock wave from it is clearly visible in satellite imagery and there are reports of the eruption being heard at least as far away as New Zealand,” she said. “The tsunami from the eruption has reached over 2,500 kilometers being recorded on gauges over all of Aotearoa.”\n\nTsunamis generated by volcanoes are much less common than tsunamis from underwater earthquakes, Lane said.\n\nA smaller eruption in late 2014 and early 2015 built up the crater of the volcano to above the surface of the water, Lane added, but it’s not yet clear exactly how Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai erupted on this occasion. “When we see what is left of the island after this eruption is over we can start to put together the pieces of what happened,” she said.\n\n1.14.2022: (correction on date) Large volcanic eruption near Tonga (Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano) today as seen from outer space.

People of Tonga must also remain vigilant for further eruptions and especially tsunami with short notice and should avoid low-lying areas.”\n\nAn earlier tsunami warning issued for American Samoa has since been canceled, according to the NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThere is no tsunami threat to Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands from a “distant eruption,” according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.\n\nThe volcano had been active from December 20, but was declared dormant on January 11, according to RNZ.", "authors": ["Alex Stambaugh Laura Smith-Spark Rhea Mogul Sophie Jeong Dakin Andone", "Alex Stambaugh", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Rhea Mogul", "Sophie Jeong", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2016/05/26/year-without-a-summer-1816-mount-tambora/84855694/", "title": "200 years ago, we endured a 'year without a summer'", "text": "Doyle Rice\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSnow in June, freezing temperatures in July, a killer frost in August: \"The most gloomy and extraordinary weather ever seen,\" according to one Vermont farmer.\n\nTwo centuries ago, 1816 became the year without a summer for millions of people in parts of North America and Europe, leading to failed crops and near-famine conditions.\n\nWhile they didn't know the chill's cause at the time, scientists and historians now know that the biggest volcanic eruption in human history, on the other side of the world — Mount Tambora in Indonesia in April 1815 — spewed millions of tons of dust, ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, temporarily changing the world's climate and dropping global temperatures by as much as 3 degrees.\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the natural climate change caused disease outbreaks, widespread migration of people looking for a better home and religious revivals as people tried to make sense of it all.\n\nThe gloom spread to the literary world, too: that foul, frigid year inspired the plot of Mary Shelly's epic horror novel Frankenstein.\n\nAnd it could happen again. Big volcanoes can erupt at anytime and with little warning, potentially changing the climate and giving a temporary reprieve to man-made global warming.\n\n\"We cannot reliably predict exactly when a volcano will erupt, or how powerful it will be, until the eruption is nearly upon us,\" said Nicholas P. Klingaman, co-author of the book The Year without Summer.\n\nA volcano erupts\n\nThe eruption of Tambora, on April 10, 1815, on the island of Sumbawa in what's now Indonesia, was 100 times more powerful than the 1980 Mount St. Helens blast, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which ranked the eruption as a seven on its eight-level volcanic explosivity index.\n\nThe volcano spewed out enough ash and pumice to cover a square area 100 miles on each side to a depth of almost 12 feet, according to the book, The Year without Summer, by Klingaman and his father, William K. Klingaman.\n\nIt was by far the deadliest volcanic eruption in human history, the Klingamans wrote, with a death toll of at least 71,000 people, up to 12,000 of whom killed directly by the eruption, according to the journal Progress in Physical Geography.\n\nWhen a volcano erupts, it does more than spew clouds of ash, which can cool a region for a few days and disrupt airline travel. It also spews sulfur dioxide, NASA reports.\n\nIf the eruption is strong enough, it shoots that sulfur dioxide high into the stratosphere, more than 10 miles above Earth's surface. Up there, sulfur dioxide reacts with water vapor to form sulfate aerosols.\n\nBecause these aerosols float above the altitude of rain, they don't get washed out. Instead they linger, reflecting sunlight and cooling the Earth's surface, which is what caused the weather and climate impacts of Tambora's eruption to occur more than a year later.\n\nMiserable summer\n\nHeavy snow fell in northern New England on June 7-8, with 18- to 20-inch high drifts. In Philadelphia, the ice was so bad \"every green herb was killed and vegetables of every description very much injured,\" according to the book American Weather Stories.\n\nFrozen birds dropped dead in the streets of Montreal, and lambs died from exposure in Vermont, the New England Historical Society said.\n\nOn July 4, one observer wrote that \"several men were pitching quoits (a game) in the middle of the day with heavy overcoats on.\" A frost in Maine that month killed beans, cucumbers and squash, according to meteorologist Keith Heidorn. Ice covered lakes and rivers as far south as Pennsylvania, according to the Weather Underground.\n\nBy the time August rolled around, more severe frosts further damaged or killed crops in New England. People reportedly ate raccoons and pigeons for food, the New England Historical Society said.\n\nEurope also suffered mightily: the cold and wet summer led to famine, food riots, the transformation of stable communities into wandering beggars and one of the worst typhus epidemics in history, according to The Year without Summer.\n\nScientists’ best estimate is that the global-average temperature cooled by almost 2 degrees in 1816 said Nicholas Klingaman, who is also a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. Land temperatures cooled by about 3 degrees, he added.\n\nHow soon could it happen again?\n\nEruptions on the scale of Tambora occur once every 1,000 years on average, but smaller events can still substantially impact the climate, Klingaman said. Krakatoa's 1883 eruption in Indonesia caused global cooling nearly five years later, even though it ejected less material into the atmosphere than Tambora.\n\nSimilarly, Pinatubo in 1991 in the Philippines caused global temperatures to cool by about 1 degree, Klingaman said. Eruptions of that magnitude — about one-sixth the size of the Tambora eruption — happen about once every 100 years.\n\n\"Any of those other volcanoes could erupt again, perhaps on a scale of Tambora or greater,\" said Mike Mills, an atmospheric chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.\n\nThe subject of how volcanoes affect climate is relatively new: Scientists didn't confirm the link between volcanic eruptions and global cooling until the 1960s and 1970s, Klingaman said.\n\nA new area of research delves into how volcanic eruptions could interact with global warming, Mills said. The chemist says his own investigation found the role of volcano eruption in global climate change could be underestimated. And it could help explain why global warming appeared to temporarily slow down early this century when volcanic activity increased.\n\nWith global temperatures at record highs, a massive eruption today could halt man-made climate change. But the effect would be only temporary: Warming would pick up where it left off once all the stratospheric dust settled out, a process that could a few years or up to a decade, Weather Underground reported.\n\nThe fallout on the people affected by the event, though, could last far longer. The colorful, dusty skies from Tambora's epic blast inspired some of British artist J. M. W. Turner's most spectacular sunset paintings — some of which were painted decades after the eruption.\n\nYou can listen to USA Today's Charlene Washington chat with author Doyle Rice about this story below:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/01/19/tonga-volcano-eruption-how-science-explains-tsunami-extreme-blast/6562388001/", "title": "Tonga volcano eruption: How science explains tsunami, extreme blast", "text": "The tremendous eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano was the blast heard and seen around the world.\n\nShock waves rippled at least twice around the globe, moving at the speed of sound as they radiated outward from the remote eruption about 40 miles north of the largest island in the Kingdom of Tonga.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}]}

It comes after Musk revealed last week he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to acquire the company, an apparent turning point that forced Twitter’s board to seriously consider the deal. The board met Sunday to evaluate Musk’s offer.\n\n“The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon’s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,” Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor said in a statement, calling the deal ” the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”\n\nTwitter stock was up nearly 6% following the announcement of the deal, hovering around $51.84, just shy of the offer price. The deal is pending approval from shareholders and regulators.\n\nIn an internal message to employees obtained by CNN, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said he would hold an all-hands meeting with Taylor on Monday afternoon to answer questions about the deal. “I know this is a significant change and you’re likely processing what this means for you and Twitter’s future,” he said.\n\nWhat Musk means for Twitter\n\nMusk is both a high-profile Twitter user and a controversial one. He has more than 83 million followers on the platform, which he has used over the years for everything from sharing memes and discussing his companies to insulting politicians, spreading misleading claims about Covid-19 and making offensive remarks about the transgender community.\n\nMusk has repeatedly stressed in recent days that his goal is to bolster free speech on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.”\n\nIn his statement Monday, Musk said he wants to “make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” Separately, he said in a tweet Monday that he hopes “even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”\n\nStill, some industry experts worry that Musk’s desire for free speech on Twitter could mean rolling back some of the platform’s work to curb hate speech, misinformation, harassment and other harmful content. Others questioned whether Musk might restore former President Donald Trump’s account, which was removed early last year for violating Twitter policies against inciting violence following the Capitol Riot. Such a move could have significant ramifications for the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.\n\nWhile Twitter is smaller than some social media rivals, it has an outsized influence in the online and offline worlds because it is used by many politicians, public figures and journalists, and has sometimes acted as a model for other platforms in how to handle harmful content.\n\n“Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, or falsehoods that subvert our democracy,” Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, said in a statement directed at Musk Monday following the deal.\n\nA new and uncertain era for Twitter\n\nIn the days since Musk’s initial bid, many following the company wondered whether Twitter would try to find another buyer, especially after the company put in place a poison pill to make it more difficult for Musk to acquire the company without its approval.\n\nBut CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino said Monday that Twitter’s board more seriously considering Musk’s offer may have come “from the Board’s realization that an alternative bid from a ‘white knight’ may be difficult to come by, especially following the decline in asset prices from social media companies in recent weeks/months.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether Agrawal — who took over the CEO role from founder Jack Dorsey in November — will remain in the top job following the takeover. Musk previously tweeted a meme comparing Agrawal to former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Musk also said in his offer letter to buy Twitter that he does not “have confidence in management.”\n\nThe deal could, however, put an end to nearly a decade of chaos at Twitter as a public company, during which it has cycled through CEOs, grappled with an activist investor and struggled to ignite growth and successfully monetize its influential user base.\n\nAgrawal said in Monday’s statement that “Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” He added: “Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.”\n\nCNN Business tech reporter Clare Duffy can be reached at clare.duffy@cnn.com.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2013/11/17/twitter-abuse-user-screencap/3536643/", "title": "How to report an abusive user on Twitter", "text": "Rob Pegoraro\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nSend screenshot of deleted tweets with abusive user form\n\nMore teens report being harassed in person or via text than online\n\nFacebook %22Trusted Friend%22 feature helps you recover a hacked account\n\nQ: A girl at my school has been harassing me on Twitter, but I can't report her as abusive because she has been deleting the tweets.\n\nA: Twitter spammers aren't the only people to display a malicious level of creativity as they try to circumvent that social network's rules. Here, somebody has apparently been erasing the evidence of her own hostile behavior, counting on enough people seeing each tweet before she deletes it.\n\nOne common way to deal with a jerk on Twitter — blocking the user — isn't perfect. Blocking a user will ensure that you no longer see the person's tweets unless they come up in a search, but it won't stop friends, family or co-workers from seeing them.\n\nTwitter's abusive-user form instructs victims that they have to document abuse with a link to an individual tweet: \"You'll need to provide at least one direct link to the content you're reporting.\"\n\nThat's not quite the case. Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler says that a screen capture of a deleted tweet can also suffice as evidence. \"When a user reports a tweet or account, it starts an e-mail chain that the user can then use to attach a screen shot via e-mail.\"\n\n(To take a screen capture in most versions of Windows, open the Snipping Tool app. In OS X, hold down the Command, Shift and 3 keys, and the image will be saved to your desktop.)\n\nThis kind of thing can happen on Facebook, too. A few weeks ago, a friend reported that somebody was impersonating his dad on that site — but since the impostor had blocked his dad from seeing the fake profile, he couldn't click the \"Report\" link there.\n\nFacebook's \"Report a Violation of the Facebook Terms\" page counsels that \"if you can't see the content you're trying to report, please ask a friend for help.\" That won't work in the case of most impostor accounts, because Facebook says it only acts on impersonation complaints from the victims of such activity or their legally authorized representatives, such as parents or guardians.\n\nBut if you use that form's obvious \"Someone is pretending to be me\" option, you get sent to a dead end from which you can only escape by using an abuse-reporting form intended for people who don't have Facebook accounts to send in a link to the offending profile.\n\nIf, however, you ignore that option and instead select \"Other abuse or harrassment,\" you'll then see a follow-up question \"Are you blocked from seeing the content you want to report?\"; responding affirmatively will allow you to submit the offending profile address.\n\nNeither Facebook nor Twitter has rewritten help pages to reflect these workarounds, but that would be a good idea. I can't imagine that many users will guess that the way to report somebody else breaking a social network's rules is to get a little creative with the instructions.\n\nMeanwhile, it's important to remember that for all of the coverage of cyberbullying and other forms online abuse — and the particularly horrible nature of some high-profile cases — it remains relatively rare. At a panel discussion in Washington two weeks ago, Pew Internet & American Life Project researcher Amanda Lenhart said that only 8% of U.S. teens reported being bullied online; more said abuse came via text messages, and still more indicated that it came the old-fashioned way, in person.\n\nTip: \"Trusted Friends\" can help you recover a hacked Facebook account.\n\nFacebook accounts continue to make tempting targets for scammers hoping that a sleazy marketing pitch or please-send-money plea that would get deleted in e-mail from a stranger will get a more sympathetic reading when it seems to come from a trusted friend.\n\nFacebook has rolled out a variety of ways you can defend your account from hacking attempts. For instance, I strongly endorse its two-step verification, which watches for suspicious logins and asks you to confirm them by entering a simple numeric code generated on the spot and sent to your mobile device.\n\nBut this spring, it added a backup system that relies on your own, offline social network. Its \"Trusted Friends\" option lets you designate three to five close friends who can help you get back into your account if it ever gets compromised. Should that happen, they can ask Facebook for reset codes that they would then provide to you to recover your account.\n\n—\n\nRob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.

Texas Republicans are also pushing a proposal to ban CRT in schools.\n\nCritical race theory teaches that racism is ingrained in U.S. institutions and that people who are white benefit from it. The concept and whether schools, churches and other corporations should subscribe to it has been a source of controversy within institutions for several years, but has received heightened attention in recent months.\n\nSince the House and Senate versions had differences, the legislation went to a conference committee Wednesday. That's where Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, proposed multiple additions, including forbidding teaching students that \"the rule of law does not exist, but instead is a series of power relationships and struggles among racial or other groups.\"\n\n\"That is the very definition of critical race theory,\" Kelsey said after reading the line aloud. \"I was subject to this teaching 20 years ago in law school and know it very well, and that is the very definition of it.\"\n\nRELATED:Tennessee Republicans want to withhold funding from schools teaching critical race theory\n\nRELATED:Memphis lawmaker tells CNN that Tennessee legislature is trying to 'whitewash' history\n\nThe bill prompted a lengthy, spirited debate on the Senate floor, where the chamber's three Black women each spoke out against the legislation.\n\nSenate Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis, argued the bill promotes revisionist history, while Sen. Katrina Robinson, another Memphis Democrat, told her colleagues she was \"deeply and profoundly offended\" by it.\n\nRobinson noted how her legislation to require Black history instruction in fifth and eighth grades had been killed for the year.\n\n\"And now we see why,\" Robinson said.\n\nOne Republican member, Sen. Page Walley of Bolivar, voted against the measure. He spoke from the floor, acknowledging the large number of African American people in his district and the need to ensure everyone's stories are told.\n\nUnclear where CRT is being taught in Tennessee\n\nProponents of the legislation have not cited any examples from specific schools where critical race theory or similar instruction is being taught. They have cited an anecdote involving an anonymous 7-year-old whose mother said the child came home from school asking if she was a racist.\n\nA similar version of the story has circulated online among conservative social networks in Tennessee in recent weeks.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Education does not have a position on the legislation, a spokesperson said Tuesday. They're also unaware of any schools where the themes outlined in the bill are being taught, nor have they received complaints about it.\n\nRep. Yusuf Hakeem, D-Chattanooga, during the conference committee asked Kelsey \"exactly where\" it's being taught.\n\nKelsey did not cite any schools or districts providing critical race theory instruction, but instead pointed to The New York Times' 1619 Project — literature that CRT opponents across the country have cautioned against. The project's name comes from the year African slaves first arrived in what is now the United States.\n\nSen. Brenda Gilmore, D-Nashville, said she and Hakeem believe the provisions \"rob\" teachers of their ability to teach \"true history.\"\n\n\"Contrary to what some people may think, being an African American, I do not cast blame, but I think we do have to admit that slavery did occur,\" Gilmore said. \"It was a dark period in our history. We have to acknowledge the wrongs of our society even when it’s a difficult conversation to have.\n\n\"And as a result of slavery, in 2021, racism still does exist.\"\n\nGilmore and Hakeem were the sole Democrats and Black members on the conference committee.\n\nIn addition to instructing the state education commissioner to withhold funding from schools found to be teaching components of critical race theory, the legislation would likely prevent Tennessee schools from being able to accept new federal grants to teach on racism and inequality.\n\nRELATED:GOP lawmaker in Tennessee: Three-Fifths Compromise was to end slavery\n\nDuring a House floor debate on the bill Tuesday, Rep. Justin Lafferty, R-Knoxville, made remarks about how various aspects of history are currently being taught in schools, including the Three-Fifths Compromise, an early part of the U.S. Constitution that determined three-fifths of a state’s slave population could be counted toward its representation in Congress and in tax apportionment.\n\nLafferty seemed to defend the compromise, saying it was enacted \"for the purpose of ending slavery,\" and suggested people in the country should be less divisive. He drew applause from Republicans after his speech. The Black Caucus condemned his comments later in the day.\n\nThe 14th Amendment, adopted after the Civil War, abolished the Three-Fifths Compromise. After Tuesday's debate, Lafferty declined comment.\n\nThe rest of the amendment, filed as an amendment in the House earlier this week by Rep. John Ragan, R-Oak Ridge, prohibits public or charter schools from teaching that:\n\nOne race or sex is superior;\n\nAny individuals are \"inherently privileged, racist, sexist, or oppressive\" because of their race or sex;\n\nA person should receive adverse treatment due to their race or sex;\n\nTheir moral character is determined by race or sex;\n\nA person bears responsibility for past actions by other members of their race or sex;\n\nA person should feel discomfort or other psychological distress because of their race or sex;\n\nA meritocracy is racist or sexist or designed to oppress members of another race or sex;\n\nThe United States is fundamentally racist or sexist;\n\nPromoting the violent overthrow of the U.S. government;\n\nPromoting division or resentment between race, sex, religion, creed nonviolent political affiliation or class;\n\nAscribing character traits, values, moral codes, privileges or beliefs to a race;\n\nThe rule of law does not exist, but instead is a series of power relationships and struggles among racial or other groups;\n\nAmericans are not created equal and are not endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; or\n\nGovernments should deny to any person within the government's jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.\n\nReach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com.

Its elementary school and its high school adjoin one another. The West Washington Senators compete in Class A.\n\nIt is not traditionally the kind of place Big Ten football programs go looking for talent. But Caleb Murphy was determined to do anything he could to close those 51 miles and play bigtime college football for his state’s flagship school. So he started a wrestling program.\n\nIU vs. Nebraska:Trip to Lincoln a near-must win for bowl hopes\n\n“I was just looking for another avenue to compete in the offseason,\" Murphy said, \"a way I could improve on the football field in the offseason.”\n\nIt was one of the many ways Murphy made sure he fulfilled his FBS ambitions, but it might have been the most telling.\n\nAt the time, Murphy’s shop teacher, Dennis Tankersley, coached the sport at a regional rival, Salem. Murphy and a friend approached Tankersley with a proposal: If they could get enough signatures to get in front of the school board, and then get the board to agree to support a wrestling program at West Washington, would Tankersley consider coaching them instead.\n\n“Once he said yes, it just kind of rolled,” Murphy said, “and within a year we were a team and competing.”\n\nBy his own admission, Murphy struggled his first year. An older teammate actually wrestled ahead of him at Murphy’s original weight class, 220.\n\nBy the end of his wrestling career, cut short because of a collarbone injury, Murphy locked down that varsity 220 spot.\n\n“I have no doubt he would’ve been top 10 in the state his senior year if he would’ve wrestled,” Tankersley said. “For him to not get to be able to do that, it was tough for him, but that was his route he needed to take, and I encouraged him to.”\n\nMore Indiana football news:'Is there a bigger clown in college football?' Former Nebraska assistant rips Tom Allen, IU\n\nFor Murphy, football always came first\n\nA two-way lineman at West Washington, Murphy was an all-state selection as a junior, when he posted 84 tackles in 2018. That season, the Senators advanced to their sectional championship game, a successful season in a successful stretch that also saw West Washington reach a regional final in 2015 and semistate in 2019.\n\n“He was a man among boys,” said Tankersley, who runs chains for West Washington home games. “That’s a cliché thing to say about a kid that’s more physically mature and stuff like that, but he looked D-I compared to the people he was playing.”\n\nMurphy couldn’t play in that 2019 semistate game because of the collarbone injury he’d sustained earlier in the season. But when he signed his letter of intent in December of that year, he invited dozens of members of the community to stand behind him. He told IndyStar’s Kyle Neddenriep it was “a way for me to honor the people who have helped me along the way.”\n\nOne person missing that day, Murphy still carries with him now.\n\nBigtime college football was always Murphy’s aim. When he attended a camp at Indiana the summer before his senior year, he knew the opportunity to perform against other Division I prospects was one he needed to seize.\n\n“That was definitely something I understood, and when talking to a lot of different coaches, that’s what they said,” Murphy said. “They wanted to see me in front of competition similar to what other kids experience in the Indianapolis area and other big places. Going to camps in the summer and competing against other good athletes, and really proving I can play with (high)-caliber athletes was something I had to prove, coming from such a small community.”\n\nIndiana didn’t offer that day, but coach Tom Allen sat with Murphy and his family for a considerable amount of time.\n\n“It was just more of a gut feel that he's our kind of guy,” Allen said. “He got emotional in my office about how much he wanted to be here and play here.”\n\nAfter they left, Allen’s staff started doing its homework.\n\nIU football schedule:Here's the IU football schedule for 2022\n\nThey saw him at another camp, up in Chicago, where his performance would eventually convince them to extend the offer. And they talked to people who knew him well to get a sense for his character and work ethic.\n\nOne of the people Allen sought out was Phillip Bowsman, West Washington’s athletic director and Murphy’s high school coach.\n\nAllen connected with Bowsman when the Senators came to IU’s team camp. Indiana hadn’t yet decided to offer Murphy, and Allen figured Bowsman would know Murphy best.\n\n“He wasn’t trying to sell him. He was just being real about who he was,” Allen said. “He believed in Caleb. He loved him. That feeling was very mutual, and I know it was very tough to lose him like we did.”\n\nThe Senators’ head coach for 16 seasons, Bowsman suffered a stroke during West Washington’s semistate game against Lutheran on Nov. 22, 2019. He died three days later.\n\nMurphy still wears bracelets on his right wrist remembering his high school football coach. They’re faded now, the letters less traceable. One bears the name of the organization Donate Life, a nod to Bowsman’s decision to be an organ donor. The other reads “Bowsman Strong,” keeping close to him a man who meant so much to Murphy.\n\nA man heavy on Murphy’s mind two weeks ago.\n\nIndiana wasn’t sure where to put Murphy at first. They started him on defensive line, then moved him to tight end. This winter, Murphy came to Allen and asked if he could move to offensive line. In particular, he wanted to try center.\n\n“It was just a position I thought I could step in and help the team, with my communication and my leadership skills,” Murphy said.\n\nIU’s staff slowed him down. They supported the move to offensive line, but center is the most logistically demanding position in the group. It requires a player to make all manner of checks and calls pre-snap, execute the center-quarterback exchange and then block correctly, all in the space of a few seconds.\n\nOffensive line coach Darren Hiller suggested Murphy sit down with Mike Katic, Indiana’s starting left guard, who’d been recruited to play center before struggling with the demands of the position early in his career.\n\n“I was just like, ‘Listen dude, center is a tough position to kind of be thrown into like that. There’s a lot of things that go into it.’ …\n\n“He stuck with it though,\" Katic said.\n\nHiller started Murphy at guard during spring practice, but let him work at center during individual periods so Murphy could get a feel for snapping the ball.\n\nThen, he watched through the summer — coaches are limited in the time they can spend with players then — as Murphy put in more extra work than any of his position mates. He watched film with his coaches whenever they’d let him. He asked managers to help him set up individual drills.\n\n“You talk about a guy that was up here doing drill work probably every single day,” Hiller said, “more so than probably anybody on our team. We don’t keep track of that, but the dude was in the building — he’s in the weight room, he’s on the game field, he’s on the practice field, he’s getting managers to put pads on the sleds for him. He’s doing everything he can, because he knew he just needed banked reps.\n\n“We get into fall camp and you could see a marked improvement from spring ball to fall camp and again, just kept grinding, grinding, grinding.”\n\nMurphy started as the Hoosiers’ third-string center, before an injury to backup Cameron Knight moved him up to No. 2.\n\nThen, coming off the field during warmups against Western Kentucky on Sept. 17, starter Zach Carpenter notified the staff he’d injured his hand. Trainers confirmed he wouldn’t be available. Murphy’s number was up.\n\nHe stepped in and played 95 snaps. His effort earned him team offensive player of the week honors, and a start again last weekend at Cincinnati.\n\n“Just a great testament to him, how hard he's worked and how much he cares,” Allen said. “You can win a lot of games (with) guys that are smart, tough, dependable and have a high, high care factor, and it means something for him to put that jersey on and represent his whole community. And that's pretty awesome thing.”\n\nAfter the Western Kentucky win, Katic made a point of finding Murphy for a hug, and to tell him how proud he was of the way Murphy had played.\n\nThen, Katic gave Murphy space to celebrate. After that collarbone injury prematurely ended his senior high school season, Murphy hadn’t played an offensive snap in three years when he set foot on the Memorial Stadium field to face the Hilltoppers.\n\nBy the next midweek, Murphy’s mind had already turned to the future, to Cincinnati and the Big Ten schedule to come after that. But there was no denying the emotion pouring out of Murphy after the Western Kentucky win, when IU’s social media team posted footage of him tearing up coming off the field.\n\nHe carried with him years spent fighting for the chance to prove himself.\n\n“My whole life’s led up to this moment,” he said later.\n\nThe memory of the people who helped him reach his dream.\n\n“To know coach Bowsman was watching’s a really big deal,” Murphy said. “Coach Bowsman did a lot for me through high school, and impacted me in a lot of ways. To know he had the best seat in the house was really cool.”\n\nAnd he shared that moment with his family, all of them in the stands.\n\nNo one had driven to Bloomington that day expecting to see Murphy play so much, just to cheer for a kid whose ambition and dedication had brought him this far.\n\nInstead, they got to see that ambition realized in front of them, and then celebrate with a son who wanted to repay however he could the debt he’d incurred in all their years spent supporting his dream.\n\n“To get to look up in the crowd and see my dad emotional, see them happy that I’m playing, see my mom, that was really big for me,” Murphy said. “They’ve helped me get to where I am.”\n\nCarpenter missed the Cincinnati game but Allen has described his hand problem as potentially short-term, so Murphy might not be starting center all season. But he’s played himself into his coaches’ trust now, validating that hard offseason work.\n\nMeasure Murphy’s journey however you want — the hard yards of the past nine months, the three years spent making himself into a Big Ten football player or the 51 miles from Campbellsburg to where Murphy is right now. On the Memorial Stadium field, seizing his chance.\n\n“You don’t play favorites or anything like that,” Tankersley said. “But when you have a kid who’s just eager to learn and knows the things you’re gonna teach him are going to get him better and closer to his goal, kids like this don’t come around very often, and whenever they are there, it’s just infectious.”\n\nFollow IndyStar reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/04/24/facebook-while-black-zucked-users-say-they-get-blocked-racism-discussion/2859593002/", "title": "Facebook racism? Black users say racism convos blocked as hate ...", "text": "Black activists say hate speech policies and content moderation stifle marginalized groups.\n\nMark Zuckerberg says lawmakers tell him Facebook has too much power over speech. \"Frankly I agree.\"\n\nCivil rights groups say Facebook has not cut down on hate speech against African Americans.\n\nIt was spirit week, and Carolyn Wysinger, a high school teacher in Richmond, California, was cheerfully scrolling through Facebook on a break between classes. Her classroom, with its black-and-white images of Martin Luther King Jr. and Che Guevara and a \"Resist Patriarchy\" sign, was piled high with colorful rolls of poster paper, the whiteboard covered with plans for pep rallies.\n\nA post from poet Shawn William caught her eye. \"On the day that Trayvon would've turned 24, Liam Neeson is going on national talk shows trying to convince the world that he is not a racist.\" While promoting a revenge movie, the Hollywood actor confessed that decades earlier, after a female friend told him she'd been raped by a black man she could not identify, he'd roamed the streets hunting for black men to harm.\n\nFor Wysinger, an activist whose podcast The C-Dubb Show frequently explores anti-black racism, the troubling episode recalled the nation's dark history of lynching, when charges of sexual violence against a white woman were used to justify mob murders of black men.\n\n\"White men are so fragile,\" she fired off, sharing William's post with her friends, \"and the mere presence of a black person challenges every single thing in them.\"\n\nIt took just 15 minutes for Facebook to delete her post for violating its community standards for hate speech. And she was warned if she posted it again, she'd be banned for 72 hours.\n\nWysinger glared at her phone, but wasn't surprised. She says black people can't talk about racism on Facebook without risking having their posts removed and being locked out of their accounts in a punishment commonly referred to as \"Facebook jail.\" For Wysinger, the Neeson post was just another example of Facebook arbitrarily deciding that talking about racism is racist.\n\n\"It is exhausting,\" she says, \"and it drains you emotionally.\"\n\nBlack activists say hate speech policies and content moderation systems formulated by a company built by and dominated by white men fail the very people Facebook claims it's trying to protect. Not only are the voices of marginalized groups disproportionately stifled, Facebook rarely takes action on repeated reports of racial slurs, violent threats and harassment campaigns targeting black users, they say.\n\nMany of these users now think twice before posting updates on Facebook or they limit how widely their posts are shared. Yet few can afford to leave the single-largest and most powerful social media platform for sharing information and creating community.\n\nSo to avoid being flagged, they use digital slang such as \"wypipo,\" emojis or hashtags to elude Facebook's computer algorithms and content moderators. They operate under aliases and maintain back-up accounts to avoid losing content and access to their community. And they've developed a buddy system to alert friends and followers when a fellow black activist has been sent to Facebook jail, sharing the news of the suspension and the posts that put them there.\n\nThey call it getting \"Zucked\" and black activists say these bans have serious repercussions, not just cutting people off from their friends and family for hours, days or weeks at a time, but often from the Facebook pages they operate for their small businesses and nonprofits.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Black Lives Matter organizer Tanya Faison had one of her posts removed as hate speech. \"Dear white people,\" she wrote in the post, \"it is not my job to educate you or to donate my emotional labor to make sure you are informed. If you take advantage of that time and labor, you will definitely get the elbow when I see you.\" After being alerted by USA TODAY, Facebook apologized to Faison and reversed its decision.\n\nEven former employees are not immune. In November, former Facebook partnerships manager Mark Luckie called out Facebook for how it treats black users and black employees. \"One of the platform's most engaged demographics and an unmatched cultural trendsetter is having their community divided by the actions and inaction of the company,\" he wrote in a Facebook post. \"This loss is a direct reflection of the staffing and treatment of many of its black employees.\"\n\nFacebook deleted his post, then hours later said it “took another look” and restored it.\n\n'Black people are punished on Facebook'\n\n\"Black people are punished on Facebook for speaking directly to the racism we have experienced,\" says Seattle black anti-racism consultant and conceptual artist Natasha Marin.\n\nMarin says she's one of Facebook's biggest fans. She created a \"reparations\" fund that's aided a quarter million people with small donations to get elderly folks transportation to medical appointments or to pay for prescriptions, to help single moms afford groceries or the rent or to get supplies for struggling new parents. More recently, she started a social media project spreading \"black joy\" rather than black trauma.\n\nShe was also banned by Facebook for three days for posting a screenshot of a racist message she received.\n\n\"For me as a black woman, this platform has allowed me to say and do things I wouldn’t otherwise be able to do,\" she says. \"Facebook is also a place that has allowed things like death threats against me and my children. And Facebook is responsible for the fact that I am completely desensitized to the N-word.”\n\nSeven out of 10 black U.S. adults use Facebook and 43 percent use Instagram, according to the Pew Research Center. And black millennials are even more engaged on social media. More than half – 55 percent – of black millennials spend at least one hour a day on social media, 6 percent higher than all millennials, while 29 percent say they spend at least three hours a day, nine percent higher than millennials, Nielsen surveys found.\n\nThe rise of #BlackLivesMatter and other hashtag movements show how vital social media platforms have become for civil rights activists. About half of black users turn to social media to express their political views or to get involved in issues that are important to them, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nThese hashtag movements, coming against the backdrop of an upsurge in hate crimes, have helped put the deaths of unarmed African Americans by police officers on the public agenda, along with racial disparities in employment, health and other key areas.\n\n\"If I were to sit down with Mark Zuckerberg, the message I would want to get across to him is: You may not even realize how powerful a thing you have created. Entire revolutions could take place on this platform. Global change could happen. But that can’t happen if real people can’t take part,\" Marin says. \"The challenge for these companies is to see black women as valuable resources. This is the wealth on the platform, the people pushing the platform forward. If anything, they should be supported. \"There should be policies and community standards that overtly support that kind of work,\" Marin says. \"Maybe Mark Zuckerberg needs to sit down with a bunch of black women who use Facebook and just listen.\"\n\nHow Facebook judges what speech is hateful\n\nFor years, Facebook was widely celebrated as a platform that empowered people to bypass mainstream media or oppressive governments to directly tell their story. Now, in the eyes of some, it has assumed the role of censor.\n\nWith more than a quarter of the world's population on Facebook, the social media giant says it's wrestling with its unprecedented power to judge what speech is hateful.\n\nAll across the political spectrum, from the far right to the far left, Facebook gets flak for its judgment calls. To help sort what's allowed and what's not, it relies on a 40-page list of rules called \"Community Standards,\" which were made public for the first time last year. Facebook defines hate speech as an attack against a \"protected characteristic,\" such as race, gender, sexuality or religion. And each individual or group is treated equally. The rules are enforced by a combination of algorithms and human moderators trained to scrub hate speech from Facebook. From July to September 2018, Facebook removed 2.9 million pieces of content that it said violated its hate speech rules, more than half of which was flagged by its technology.\n\nThe tag team of algorithms and moderators frequently makes mistakes when flagging and removing content, Facebook acknowledges. And it has taken steps to try to make its system more accountable. Last year, Facebook began allowing users to file an appeal when their individual posts are removed. This year, the company plans to introduce an independent body of experts to review some of those appeals.\n\nThere are just too many sensitive decisions for Facebook to make them all on its own, Zuckerberg said last month. A string of violent attacks, including a mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand, recently forced Facebook to reckon with the scourge of white nationalist content on its platform. \"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"and frankly I agree.\"\n\nIn late 2017 and early 2018, Facebook explored whether certain groups should be afforded more protection than others. For now, the company has decided to maintain its policy of protecting all racial and ethnic groups equally, even if they do not face oppression or marginalization, says Neil Potts, public policy director at Facebook. Applying more \"nuanced\" rules to the daily tidal wave of content rushing through Facebook and its other apps would be very challenging, he says.\n\nPotts acknowledges that Facebook doesn't always read the room correctly, confusing advocacy and commentary on racism and white complicity in anti-blackness with attacks on a protected group of people. Facebook is looking into ways to identify when oppressed or marginalized users are \"speaking to power,\" Potts says. And it's conducting ongoing research into the experiences of the black community on its platform.\n\n\"That's, on its face, the type of speech we want to encourage, but words and people aren't perfect, so it doesn't always come across as that. We are exploring additional refinements to our hate speech policy that will perhaps help remedy some of these situations,\" he says.\n\nFacebook wants to make sure its policies \"reflect how people speak about these topics.\" \"That's the biggest thing,\" Potts says, \"making sure we are in tune with this community and the way they actually speak about these topics, and making sure our policies are in line and in touch.\"\n\n'Just another slap in the face'\n\nAyo Henry, a mother of four from Providence, Rhode Island, says Facebook's policies could not be more out of touch.\n\nLast year, Henry was cut off by a kid on a bike wearing a confederate sweatshirt when she pulled into the parking lot of a sandwich shop. She honked her horn. He responded twice with a racial slur.\n\nShe restrained herself in front of her children, but a few weeks later after leaving roller derby practice, Henry spotted the kid again, wearing the same sweatshirt. The boy tried to pedal away. She pulled out her phone. \"I don't know what came over me. It was an impulsive decision,\" she says. \"But I wanted to let him know that it wasn't OK.\"\n\nHe apologized, explaining he \"wasn't in a good mood that day.\" She realized how young he was as his body trembled and hands shook. She tried to offer him some motherly advice on why he should not use racial slurs.\n\nHenry's video of the exchange was viewed more than 2 million times on Facebook. Within 48 hours, Facebook took the footage down, saying it ran afoul of its hate speech rules. Henry appealed the decision but Facebook refused to reverse it.\n\nIn the meantime, her Messenger inbox filled with hundreds racial slurs, derogatory messages and threats that she would be raped or killed. Yet each time Henry tried to privately share the video with her friends on Messenger, Facebook blocked her.\n\nOffers of support that poured in from around the country helped Henry develop a network of black activists. Starting last summer, she says they all began noticing that just typing the phrase \"white people\" into a Facebook post could get their post flagged and their accounts suspended. Henry says Facebook has suspended her several times, once for calling on white women to get on board with a broader, more intersectional, form of feminism.\n\nIt wasn't a Facebook post, but a comment on that post that triggered her longest suspension from Facebook.\n\nHer Facebook post drew attention to an antique store in nearby Massachusetts that refused to remove racist memorabilia hanging on its walls, including a vintage advertisement for smoking tobacco with a caricature of two black men. \"Still perpetuating white supremacy through 'nostalgia,\" she wrote.\n\nOne person challenged whether the image was in fact racist so Henry replied with a similar image of a jigsaw puzzle box from the same era which was labeled \"Chopped Up N------.\"\n\nThat comment, which Facebook deleted, sent her to Facebook jail for a month. Henry appealed the suspension but Facebook would not relent. She says she knows of no one in the black community who has had a post reinstated by appealing.\n\n\"Black people in this country, and people of color in general, we endure a daily battle just to exist. Now we have to be careful not to complain too much about the various types of oppression publicly because, if you do, then you are going to be suppressed,\" she says. \"It's difficult to navigate the framework of social media as a black person, just because racism is systemic and, when you realize it's ingrained so deeply in a system that is so influential on our country, then it's almost like a whole second burden to bear.\"\n\n\"Social media is supposed to be a way that people can come together and be able to communicate relatively freely,\" she says. \"For us, it has become just another slap in the face.\"\n\nCivil rights groups push for audit, accountability\n\nEarly on, the Black Lives Matter social justice movement turned to Facebook as an organizing tool. Yet their organizers say they were soon set upon by bands of white supremacists who targeted them with racial slurs and violent threats. In 2015, Color Of Change, which was formed after Hurricane Katrina to organize racial justice campaigns on the internet, began pressuring Facebook to stop the harassment of black activists by hate groups.\n\nChanelle Helm, a Black Lives Matter organizer from Louisville, Kentucky, says the threats intensified in the form of doxxing – posting organizers' addresses, phone numbers and photos on the internet. Faison, founding member of the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter, was stalked. \"It got a lot more serious,\" Helm says. \"They were threatening folks with doxxing of family members.\"\n\nFacebook removed a group responsible for some of the harassment, but Color Of Change and other civil rights groups say they struggled to get the company to address other complaints. Late last year, The New York Times reported that Facebook had hired a Republican opposition research firm to discredit Color Of Change and other Facebook critics.\n\n\"What we continue to see time and time again is what's framed as race-neutral decision-making ends up being overtly hostile to the communities most in need of some of those free speech protections,\" says Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director at Color Of Change.\n\nThe Center for Media Justice began probing why content from people of color was being removed from Facebook in August 2016 when, at the request of law enforcement, Facebook shut down the video of a Baltimore woman, Korryn Gaines, who was live-streaming her standoff with police. Gaines was later shot and killed by a police officer in front of her 5-year-old son who was also struck twice by gunfire. At the same time, Black Lives Matter activists and Standing Rock pipeline protesters in North Dakota were reporting that their content was being removed, too.\n\nIn 2016 and again in 2017, civil rights and other groups wrote letters urging Facebook to conduct an independent civil rights audit of its content moderation system and to create a task force to institute the recommendations.\n\nLast May, Facebook agreed to an audit as it was trying to control the damage from revelations that a shadowy Russian organization posing as Americans had targeted unsuspecting users with divisive political messages to sow discord surrounding the 2016 presidential election. One of the main targets of the Internet Research Agency on Facebook were African Americans. The same day Facebook gave in to demands from civil rights groups, it announced a second audit into allegations of anti-conservative bias led by former Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican.\n\nThere are few signs of progress in how Facebook deals with racially motivated hate speech against the African American community or the erasure of black users' speech, says Steven Renderos, senior campaign manager at the Center for Media Justice.\n\nLast summer, after Nia Wilson, a black teenage girl, was stabbed to death by a white man wielding a knife at an Oakland, California, train station, black women gathered on Instagram to mourn.\n\n“As we see another one of us being murdered to bleed out in the streets we can’t help by think: that could be me, that could be my daughter, a sister, my best friend,” black activist Rachel Cargle wrote. “You okay sis? I get it if you’re not. At this moment I feel heavy and distant and numb. I feel angry and deflated and heartbroken.”\n\nCargle asked that only women of color respond. \"I needed to give us this space to check in on each other.\" Comments from black women poured in. “I’m scared. For my family, for my friends, for myself and for all the other black women out there,” one wrote.\n\nSome white women objected to being left out of the conversation. Soon Instagram removed Cargle’s post, saying it violated guidelines on hate speech.\n\n\"There were hundreds of comments of black women being seen and heard by their peers, being loved and cared for by their sisters, being consoled and loved exactly as they needed it,\" Cargle wrote at the time. \"DO YOU SEE THIS? DO YOU SEE HOW NOT ONLY ARE WE KILLED IN THE STREETS WE ARE ALSO PUNISHED FOR GRIEVING.\"\n\nInstagram later reversed the decision.\n\nCivil rights organizations say they've largely given up on Facebook voluntarily taking steps to protect black users, calling instead on Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the company. Color Of Change has asked Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg to take part in a civil rights summit this spring, but they have not agreed to take part. Color Of Change is also pushing a resolution at Facebook’s shareholder meeting in May to replace Zuckerberg as chairman of the board.\n\n\"At the end of the day, Facebook hasn't tackled one of the biggest issues of most interest to the civil rights community, which is how it deals with content moderation and how the platform will become a place that civil rights are protected,\" Renderos says. \"We, and a lot of organizations that we work with, are frankly tired of waiting for Facebook to decide what changes it's going to make for itself.\"\n\n'I don't think Facebook cares'\n\nShaun Saunders, who works in public relations, says he doesn't think Facebook cares. Saunders is someone tech companies seek out when they want to tell their story to the media. He uses Facebook to connect with journalists. He's also been suspended from Facebook three times for speaking his mind about racism.\n\n\"I am exhausted by the notion that a platform can arbitrarily cut you off. I am not only cut off from my family and friends, I am cut off from my job and my craft. That's the part that really gets me,\" Saunders says. \"It's not OK that black people are dying. Black people should not shut their mouths for identifying these things that are always happening.\"\n\n\"I would love to ask Mark Zuckerberg: 'What the hell are you guys doing? You guys are a hot mess.' I would say it to him just like that.\"\n\nIt's not just black people who have their posts removed. Andy Marra, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, says allies of black people run into trouble, too.\n\nMarra's Facebook post in late January calling on Asian Americans to protect \"black and brown who face the brunt of white supremacy\" was removed by Facebook.\n\nTwice Marra appealed the decision to take down her Facebook post, which shared an article from a popular blog showing an Asian man throwing up \"white power\" signs to antagonize Black Lives Matter protesters. \"This post is expressing condemnation to anti-black racism. The post also articulates critical feedback about how other people of color – specifically those in the Asian community, including myself as an Asian person – should oppose racism in all of its forms,\" she wrote in one appeal that Facebook denied.\n\nIt was only when friends reached out to Facebook to plead her case that Marra's Facebook post was reinstated. Critics say having those kinds of connections is the only way that Facebook corrects content moderation errors, but it's not a channel available to just anyone seeking redress.\n\nTake Samreen \"Sammie\" Lewis and Erica Morales, two activists of color, who say their Facebook page, Three Token Brown Girls, has been deleted three times, once just for the logo.\n\nThey say they each have been personally banned repeatedly, sometimes barely serving out one suspension before being hit with another. Lewis estimates she's been suspended from Facebook for half of the past year. Their protests go unheard, and, each time they have to rebuild their Facebook page from scratch, they lose followers.\n\n\"It basically says that we don't matter. The harm being caused to us perpetually, constantly is nothing to (Facebook),\" Lewis says. \"They'd much rather shut us up for their own comfort than acknowledge the harm they are causing.\"\n\nIn 2017, DiDi Delgado, a poet and black liberation organizer and activist, captured the growing anger in the black community with a Medium post provocatively titled: \"Mark Zuckerberg Hates Black People.\" At the time, Delgado was simultaneously serving two Facebook bans for alleged hate speech.\n\n\"That means bigoted trolls lurked my page reporting anything and everything, hoping I’d be in violation of the vague 'standards' imposed by Facebook,\" Delgado wrote. \"It’s kinda like how white people reflexively call the cops whenever they see a Black person outside. Except in this case it’s not my physical presence they find threatening, it’s my digital one.\"\n\nAsked what has changed since she published the viral post, Delgado says nothing. \"Black, LGBT, non-male and women identified users are still disproportionately banned for speaking out against oppression,\" she says.\n\nThese days, Delgado spends less time and energy on Facebook and, at times, refrains from speaking her mind there. \"Sometimes it’s more important to keep that direct line of communication open than to risk getting banned with a public post,\" she says.\n\nIn the end, Wysinger made that same calculation. In February, Wysinger decided not to risk being booted off Facebook by republishing her post about Neeson, the actor. Just days before her 40th birthday, she did not want to get thrown in Facebook jail and miss the chance to celebrate with family and friends. But, she says, she wants Facebook to know that, in silencing black people, the company is causing them harm.\n\n\"Facebook is not looking to protect me or any other person of color or any other marginalized citizen who are being attacked by hate speech,\" she says. \"We get trolls all the time. People who troll your page and say hateful things. But nobody is looking to protect us from it. They are just looking to protect their bottom line.\"\n\n\"Anything that I share, I'm sharing because it's something personal that happened to me. That's what Facebook has always built its platform on,\" she says. \"It used to ask: How are you feeling? Well, today, I am feeling targeted by CIS hetero white men.\"\n\nRead more:USA TODAY coverage of inclusion, diversity and equity in tech\n\nMore on Facebook and race:Facebook takes down ads mentioning African-Americans and Hispanics, calling them political\n\nRussians targeted Hispanics on Facebook:Russian Facebook ads inflamed Hispanic tensions over immigration after Trump election", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/02/28/fact-check-whats-true-and-whats-false-invasion-ukraine/6952717001/", "title": "Fact check: What's true and what's false about the invasion of Ukraine", "text": "False and misleading information about the Russian invasion of Ukraine has spread rapidly on social media since Russian forces launched a military assault in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 24.\n\nHere’s a roundup of claims related to the Ukraine-Russia conflict analyzed by the USA TODAY Fact Check team:\n\nFact check:Putin's claims justifying war in Ukraine are baseless, experts say\n\nU.S. and European relations with Russia, Ukraine\n\nClaim: There are U.S. biolabs in Ukraine funded by the U.S. government\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe labs in question are owned and funded by the Ukrainian government.

Not to mention the will to win.\n\nEven after the apparently stunning progress of Ukrainian forces in the east of their country – including the seizure of the strategic city of Izyum and the pullback of Russian forces – it is still clear, as Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov observed, that Ukraine is far from claiming any decisive triumph.\n\nDavid A. Andelman\n\nEnormous quantities of ammunition – and number of personnel – are still being expended on both sides in this effort by Ukraine for relatively small territorial advances, out of the vast territories Russia seized in the east and south in the earlier days of the conflict.\n\nIt’s not clear in the euphoria of Ukraine’s advances last week that the United States or the West fully appreciates the depth of the commitment that may be necessary if Russia’s ambitions are to be thwarted and the territory it has seized reclaimed.\n\n“What is apparent in Ukraine – on both sides – is not just an ability to continue to resist, but an astonishing ability to persist,” said David E. Johnson, a principal researcher at the Rand Corp. and an adjunct scholar at the Modern War Institute at West Point. “In what has become a grinding war of attrition with high numbers of casualties on both sides, neither combatant appears ready to throw in the towel.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Map shows how Ukraine pulled off counteroffensive 04:19 - Source: CNN\n\nIndeed, the BBC observed in a caveat Sunday, “Russians still hold around a fifth of the country and few imagine a swift end to the war.” Also on Sunday, Reznikov told the Financial Times, “A counter-offensive liberates territory and after that you have to control it and be ready to defend it. Of course, we have to be worried, this war has worried us for years.”\n\nIn July, even before the current Ukrainian offensive was launched, a senior American military official reportedly said the Russians had expended quite a lot of their smart munitions. At the same time, advanced High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, supplied by the US were enabling Ukraine to take out more than 100 strategic targets – ranging from Russian command posts to air-defense sites, radar and communications nodes, long-range artillery positions and ammunitions depots.\n\nBetween June, when the first HIMARS began deployment, and July, Reznikov said the rocket systems had been used to destroy 50 Russian ammunition depots.\n\nSince then, Ukraine’s pace of attacks and Western resupply efforts have grown only more intense. “Vladimir Putin seems to believe that Russia can win the long game, outlasting the Ukrainians in their will to fight and the international community’s will to continue to support Ukraine,” Colin Kahl, US undersecretary of defense for policy, said at a recent press briefing, adding that the latest Ukraine security assistance packages are “a tangible demonstration that this is yet another Russian miscalculation.”\n\nWithout question, Putin is now beginning to face some of the challenges that have been quite clear to Western leaders until now, with even more complications. Though he clearly controls the media and dissemination of information on the war, more social media are beginning to break through, and anti-war voices are being heard.\n\nThey are on the cusp of becoming as strident as some Western voices, especially in Europe where sanctions designed to thwart Russian efforts are beginning to bite even before a long cold winter without supplies of natural gas and oil that Putin is turning off in reprisal.\n\nThe winner will be the side that is best able to withstand these drumbeats of negativism.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the military had recaptured more than 30 settlements in the region of Kharkiv near the frontier with Russia. And Ukraine officials exulted in the recapture of the strategic rail hub of Izyum in the east on Sunday. The authoritative Institute for the Study of War reported, “Ukrainian forces are likely clearing pockets of disorganized Russian forces caught in the rapid Ukrainian advance to Kupyansk, Izyum, and the Oskil River.”\n\nBut so far, these have been simply pockets. Maps of currently held or even contested territory show Russia still holding vast chunks of territory in Ukraine’s east and south – though at growing costs.\n\nThe problems facing Russia are not simply the depletion of military stockpiles ranging from smart bombs and cruise missiles to basic ammunition.\n\nThe Pentagon reported two weeks ago that Russia was “desperately trying to fill its ranks depleted by its poor showing” in the Ukraine theater.\n\nA senior Pentagon official said Russia had begun “in part eliminating the upper age limits for new recruits and also by recruiting prisoners. Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained.”\n\nStill, there is substantial evidence that Russia is fighting a war in which it has shown extraordinary capacities, especially for endurance – one unlike anything the United States or its allies has fought since World War II.\n\n“My sense is that they realize this is going to be a long war, and they’re preparing for the next year,” Johnson of Rand told me in a telephone interview. “It’s been so long since the West has been engaged in a war of this sort that we just forgot how horrendous it is. Quite frankly, I’m stunned by the casualties, that they’re both able to sustain.”\n\n(Reliable casualty figures are difficult, with both sides limiting media access to battlefields and statistics.)\n\nIndeed, Russia seems to be planning for a war that could last years rather than months. “The center of gravity in this war is Western support for the Ukrainians,” Johnson observed. “If they don’t have that, it’s over.”\n\nThis is the reason Russia is seeking alternate sources of supply, especially artillery shells for the 152 mm Soviet-era howitzers that are still the staple of the Russian land army and widely used across Ukraine.\n\nSo, Putin has reached out to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in an exchange of letters last month. Russia is now in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to a US official.\n\nAnd later this week Putin will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, who still pulls many strings in Pyongyang, at a summit in Uzbekistan.\n\n“North Korea is more than happy to trade gas and oil for projectiles,” Johnson told me. Equally, the Kremlin has reportedly lined up large quantities of battlefield drones from Iran – the Mohajer-6 and Shahed series – under potential long-term contracts.\n\nOther industrial materials that no longer can be sourced from the West due to sanctions are being sourced from other producers, notably Turkey or illicitly from Western European producers via Turkish middlemen. “What they (Russia) cannot buy from Germany, Italy and France, they are buying from us,” said Cetin Tecdelioglu, head of the Istanbul Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metals Exporters’ Association, as quoted by Reuters. “Separately, a lot of EU companies are planning to sell their products to Russia via Turkey.”\n\nRussia’s institutional stamina is also a prime reason the United States and the West should continue to supply Ukraine as long as possible. “There is the ‘Arsenal of Democracy’ theory of give them (Ukraine) everything they need because every Russian tank you kill now, you won’t have to kill later,” Johnson observed, evoking a phrase coined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during a fireside chat in 1940 just before the US entered World War II but was already supplying Allied forces against Hitler’s Nazis.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nOne critical step in this direction is likely to be a September 28 meeting of national armaments directors from the Ukraine Defense Contact Group of 50 nations committed to supplying that nation’s war needs. High on the meeting’s agenda, according to Bill LaPlante, US undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, will be mobilizing “the global defense industrial base (to) continue to support Ukraine both now and into the future.”\n\nWith Russia scrambling desperately to replace much of this supply chain it can no longer source from the West, and with a potentially very long war ahead, stamina and persistence should be America’s highest priorities.", "authors": ["David A.

But the company that manages the ship denied Sechin was the owner. And the White House said German officials had seized another oligarch’s yacht in Hamburg, while local authorities denied any ships had been confiscated.\n\nThe French seizure shows that confiscating oligarchs’ yachts will require a concerted global effort – and it’s likely to mean protracted legal battles around the world, experts said.\n\nA CNN review of maritime location data from the website MarineTraffic found that more than a dozen yachts that have been reported to be owned by Russian oligarchs are spread out across the world, from the crystal waters of Antigua to ports in Barcelona and Hamburg to atolls in the Maldives and Seychelles.\n\nIn several cases, the billionaires’ yachts have been on the move in the days since the Russian offensive began.\n\nMeanwhile, officials around the world are also enforcing sanctions on a far less flashy but still important group of vessels: oil tankers and container ships the US Treasury Department says are owned by the subsidiary of a bank with close ties to Russia’s defense industry. French authorities intercepted one of the cargo ships last weekend, and a Malaysian port refused to let another dock.\n\nSanctions and asset seizures “make it more difficult for the Kremlin to persuade capable people of getting involved in its activities and thereby weaken the grip of the Kremlin over elites,” said William Courtney, a former US ambassador and current executive director of the RAND Business Leaders Forum, whose members include Russian and Western leaders.\n\nPresident Joe Biden put the Russian elite on notice in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night.\n\n“To the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: No more,” Biden declared. “We are joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'He has no idea what's coming': Biden sends message to Putin 02:36 - Source: CNN\n\nThe US Department of Justice launched a new task force – dubbed KleptoCapture – to help put Biden’s words into action. The effort includes prosecutors, federal agents and experts in money laundering, tax enforcement and national security investigations from the FBI, the IRS, the US Marshals Service, and the US Postal Inspection Service, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n“We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to investigate, arrest, and prosecute those whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue this unjust war,” Garland said.\n\nRussian-tied yachts docked around the world\n\nYacht ownership is extremely difficult to confirm, with the ships often registered to management companies or shell corporations in an apparent effort to disguise ownership, experts say.\n\nBut more than a dozen of the billionaires included in a list of Russian “oligarchs” the Treasury Department released in 2018 have been tied to yachts in media reports in recent years, according to a CNN review.\n\nMost of the oligarchs who reportedly own yachts are not yet facing US sanctions. However, some have been sanctioned by the European Union or the United Kingdom, and could be added to US sanctions lists as well.\n\nAmber Vitale, a former official with the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces sanctions, said that US sanctions generally only prevent Americans and American companies from interacting with sanctioned individuals. That means the oligarchs’ yachts could be safe from seizure if they stay in international waters or in countries that haven’t issued their own sanctions.\n\n“However, it would get very difficult to operate for long if many allied nations impose similar prohibitions,” Vitale said in an email. “Vessels need ports, fuel, operators/captains, repairs and supplies. Without access to these things they could be stuck floating at sea waiting for rescue or resolution.”\n\nThe seizures have already begun, with French officials taking the Amore Vero, the yacht they said is owned by Sechin, according to a statement from France’s Ministry of Economy and Finance. The yacht arrived at the French port of La Ciotat on January 3 for repairs, but was “making arrangements to sail urgently, without having completed the planned work” when it was seized on Wednesday, the ministry said. Sechin, the CEO of the Russian oil company Rosneft, was sanctioned by the EU earlier this week, and Rosneft itself was sanctioned by the US in 2014.\n\nThe Amore Vero yacht at a shipyard in La Ciotat, in southern France, on March 3, 2022. Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut a yacht management company associated with the ship denied Sechin owned it. “I can absolutely say that Igor Sechin is not the owner,” a spokesperson for Imperial Yachts, which manages the Amore Vero, told CNN. “The rightful owner is appealing the decision to seize the vessel.”\n\nLegal experts told CNN that oligarchs were likely to transfer assets such as yachts to friends or family who aren’t sanctioned to try to prevent them from being seized. Catherine Belton, the author of a book on Putin, said she expected oligarchs were “feverishly engineering deals where ownership changes could be triggered.”\n\n“It’s going to be a game of cat and mouse,” she said.\n\nThe French ministry said that the Amore Vero, which has an onboard gym and beauty salon and won an award for yacht design, is owned by a company whose “main shareholder” is Sechin. Sechin served as Russia’s deputy prime minister in Putin’s cabinet before becoming CEO of Rosneft, one of the country’s largest companies, in 2012.\n\nThe seizure may also scare other Russian oligarchs into getting their ships out of EU ports. The Dilbar, one of the largest yachts in the world, which is reportedly owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, arrived in Hamburg, Germany in late October, according to MarineTraffic data. There was confusion about the ship’s status on Thursday: Usmanov was sanctioned by the EU earlier this week, and Forbes reported that German authorities had seized the 156-meter ship, which can carry up to 96 crew members and 24 guests. The US Treasury Department also sanctioned Usmanov on Thursday, specifically calling out the Dilbar as evidence of his “luxurious lifestyle.”\n\nBut a spokesperson for the Hamburg economic authority told CNN Thursday that “no yacht has been seized by authorities or customs at the port in Hamburg at this moment in time.” German customs officials did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, and the shipbuilding company that reportedly had been refitting the yacht declined to comment.\n\nA file photo dated September 10, 2018 shows the yacht Dilbar. Sabri Kesen/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe Luna, a yacht reportedly owned by Farkhad Akhmedov, an Azerbaijani billionaire who previously led a Russian natural gas company, was also in Hamburg as of the latest MarineTraffic data from earlier this week. Akhmedov, who has not been sanctioned, kept the nine-deck, 115-meter Luna after an acrimonious divorce that was the largest divorce case heard in Britain’s legal history. The yacht features missile detection technology and bulletproof windows.\n\nSeveral yachts reportedly owned by Russian oligarchs have been docked at a port in Barcelona, including the Solaris, which has been tied to Roman Abramovich, the billionaire who announced Wednesday that he would sell the Chelsea Football Club and donate proceeds to a foundation for people impacted by the invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich hasn’t been sanctioned.\n\nThe Galactica Super Nova, reportedly owned by Russian oil company executive Vagit Alekperov, left Barcelona on Saturday and crossed the Mediterranean to Tivat, Montenegro, before sailing south into the Adriatic Sea. While Alekperov hasn’t been sanctioned, he is president of Lukoil, which has been hit by US sanctions in the past.\n\nOther Russian-linked yachts are in the Caribbean, including Eclipse, another yacht owned by Abramovich, which is among the world’s largest and includes a swimming pool that can be transformed into a dance floor, and the Anna, reportedly owned by oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, who once purchased a Florida mansion from former President Donald Trump. Rybolovlev hasn’t been sanctioned.\n\nCourtney, the former ambassador, said that he expected Russian oligarchs took most of their assets out of the US after two billionaires were sanctioned in 2018, and predicted that they would try to move their yachts out of Western European countries to avoid them being seized.\n\n“We are likely to see more of a redistribution geographically of some of those assets,” Courtney said, to countries “that are seen as less likely to sanction,” possibly in the Middle East.\n\nSeveral yachts connected to Russian oligarchs have arrived in recent weeks in the Maldives, an Indian Ocean archipelago nation. They include the Clio, reportedly owned by oligarch Oleg Deripaska, which left Sri Lanka in early February and has been sailing between various Maldives atolls since then, according to MarineTraffic. Deripaska was sanctioned by the US in 2018.\n\nNone of the oligarchs mentioned in this story responded to requests for comment from CNN sent to their spokespeople, businesses or lawyers.\n\nPerhaps the clearest example of a yacht with supposed ties to the Russian elite fleeing the West is a Russian-flagged ship named Graceful. Speculative news articles in the German media have reported that the ship belongs to Putin himself, although there’s no concrete evidence that that’s the case.\n\nGraceful departed Hamburg in early February – roughly two weeks before the invasion of Ukraine – and sped to Kaliningrad, Russia, the MarineTraffic data shows. No location data has been recorded since it arrived in the Russian city on February 9.\n\nHackers last week successfully altered maritime traffic data to make it appear that the yacht’s destination was “hell” and it had run aground on Snake Island in Ukraine – where Ukrainian soldiers’ profane response to a Russian warship went viral on social media.\n\nSanctions will likely spark legal battles over the yachts, and require government officials to prove ownership, experts said.\n\n“A sanctioned person may say to the government that the asset you have frozen is not one of my assets,” arguing that it is registered in a family member’s name or a shell corporation that has not specifically been sanctioned, said Raj Bhala, a professor at the University of Kansas Law School and a sanctions expert. “The oligarch could argue before the government that you don’t really have the legal authority to seize my asset.”\n\nBut there are new dangers for the oligarchs’ yachts beyond legal proceedings: A Ukrainian ship engineer was arrested in the Spanish island of Mallorca for trying to sink a yacht owned by a Russian military export company executive, local news outlets reported.\n\n“I don’t regret anything I’ve done and I would do it again,” the engineer declared in court on Sunday, according to the Majorca Daily Bulletin. “They were attacking innocents.”\n\nSanctioned shipping vessels seized, blocked from ports\n\nEven as Biden and other officials have focused their public comments on oligarchs’ yachts, the US is also going after other shipping vessels with ties to Russia.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced sanctions against five oil, cargo and container ships that the Treasury Department says are owned by a subsidiary of Promsvyazbank, a Russian bank that has given billions of dollars to support Russian defense companies. The sanctions block any Americans from doing business with Promsvyazbank.\n\nFrench authorities seized one of the cargo ships, the Baltic Leader, on Saturday as it was headed from France to Saint Petersburg, Russia, “as part of an operation carried out in cooperation with US authorities,” according to France’s finance ministry. The ship is now anchored at a port in northern France, MarineTraffic data shows.\n\nA port operator in Malaysia declined the request of one of the other vessels, an oil tanker named Linda, to dock there on March 5 “in order not to violate any sanctions,” Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport told CNN. The decision was first reported by Reuters.\n\nPromsvyazbank did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, but has publicly denied that its subsidiary owned the Linda, and said it no longer owns the Baltic Leader. Two of the other US-sanctioned ships are now in the process of having their leases withdrawn from Promsvyazbank’s subsidiary, according to a statement from Russian company FESCO Transportation Group.\n\nSome of the ships have been accused in recent years of violating past US sanctions by transporting Iranian oil.

Perhaps the mother had attributed her own views to her child as a manner of sanitizing them.\"\n\nStevens, who was appointed to the bench in 2009 and re-elected last year without opposition, did not mention the Grays or Wallace by name on Facebook. He noted in court and in his post that \"the statement played absolutely no role in the sentencing decision.\"\n\nAnd in an interview, he said he did nothing improper in court or on social media. \"I was cautioning the parents against allowing racial stereotypes to impact their behavior and that of their child,\" he said.\n\nBut leading experts on judicial ethics condemned his remarks, as did Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine and friends and family of the Grays, some of whom have started a Facebook page urging Stevens' removal from office.\n\n\"Judge Stevens blamed and shamed the victims,\" said the girl's paternal grandmother, Dawn Renee Bryant, who said her daughter-in-law cried when she read the judge's post. \"It is very disturbing to be called something you are not.\"\n\nWine said his office would disavow any racist victim impact statement but the statements made by the victims in this case \"were not intended to be and were not.\"\n\n\"The mother of a 3-year-old was describing how the home invaders, armed with guns, affected her family,\" Wine said. \"She differentiated how the adults and the child were affected.\"\n\nHe also said that \"had the assailants been old fat men with white beards, I believe the child would have the same reaction to similarly described persons.\"\n\nIn an email, Ronald Rotunda, a law professor at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., and the author of a widely used course book on legal ethics, said Stevens violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, both by using the prestige of his office to further his personal interests and by commenting on a pending case on Facebook.\n\n\"The judge, acting like a pop psychologist, decides to attack the little girl and her parents,\" Rotunda said. \"Then, after the judge … has a chance to cool down … he goes on Facebook and does it all over again. The judge should be a little more judicious.\"\n\nJeffrey Shaman, who teaches at Chicago's DePaul University law school and once ran the Center for Judicial Conduct Organizations, said judicial criticism of victim impact statements could discourage victims from \"participating in the criminal justice system and ensuring that their voices will be heard.\"\n\nIndiana University law professor Charles Geyh said that while it is not intrinsically wrong for a judge to criticize a victim — such as the instigator of a bar fight — given Stevens' emotional reaction in court and on Facebook, he arguably should have disqualified himself because his impartiality might be questioned.\n\n\"While the judge insisted that his judgment was unaffected by the victim statement, the issue is whether a reasonable observer would think likewise. Maybe not,\" Geyh said.\n\nStill, Geyh said matters of race can be complex.\n\n\"An observer disconnected from issues of race and racial politics might regard the victim statement as innocuous,\" he said. \"For an observer sensitive to race, however, the implication that black defendants should be held accountable for traumatizing their victims because they are black … is troubling.\"\n\nIn an interview, Stevens, who says in his Twitter profile that he prides himself on showing \"respect for all those who come before the court,\" denied that he demeaned Wallace's victims.\n\n\"I wasn't criticizing the victims, I was criticizing a statement that I thought was a generalization against an entire race of people,\" he said.\n\nStevens, a former Louisville Bar Association president, said his Facebook post was \"very well-received by many people\" and that he took it down after about a week because \"a small group of individuals began promoting their agenda on my page.\" The Courier-Journal obtained a copy this month.\n\nThe Kentucky Judicial Ethics Committee has said judges may post on Facebook and other social media sites but noted that they are \"fraught with peril for judges,\" who must \"avoid the appearance of impropriety\" and thus accept restrictions that \"might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen.\"\n\nWallace and his accomplice, Marquis McAfee, both 27, were arrested about three weeks after the robbery. Both pleaded guilty and McAfee, who was on probation for a prior crime, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which he is serving.\n\nAssistant Commonwealth's Attorney Richard Elder objected to probation for Wallace, who pleaded guilty to a 20-year sentence, saying he was \"guilty as hell\" and \"put a gun in that little girl's father's face.\"\n\nBut Stevens said in court that Wallace had no prior convictions for violent crimes and strong support from his family and friends, who wrote letters to the judge noting that he had won the \"Johnny Unitas Scholar Athlete Award\" at Iroquois High School and stayed out of trouble during 17 months in jail awaiting trial.\n\nStevens said in court that \"more times than not\" he sends offenders who use firearms during their offenses to prison, but in this case \"I think the equities weigh in favor of you having the opportunity to redeem yourself.\"\n\nOf the victim statement, he said to Elder, \"I wonder if the perpetrator had been white would they be in fear of white men. The answer would probably be no.\n\n\"I am offended by that,\" Stevens continued. \"Perhaps you can pass this on that I find this very offensive. You don't need to answer for it.\"\n\n\"Certainly I can understand the court's outrage there,\" Elder said before changing his mind. \"I guess I really don't.\"\n\nIn his Facebook post, Stevens said he would continue to speak out.\n\n\"It is incumbent on me to confront and dispose of language based on racism and stereotypes,\" he wrote. \"We should all do our part to eradicate such nonsense. And let me be clear, silence does nothing to contribute. It simply sends a message that such views are acceptable and fear somehow excuses wrong.\"\n\nReporter Andrew Wolfson can be reached at (502) 582-7189\n\nFACEBOOK POST\n\nCommenting on a photo showing young black and white children playing together, Judge Olu Stevens said:\n\nCourt brought it front and center this week. The case involved a burglary and the victims were a young couple and their three year-old child. The written victim impact statement on behalf of the child read that as a result of the offense committed against her parents in her presence, the child is in \"constant fear of black men.\" The statement, written by her mother, continues that the child clings to her parent when in the presence of any black man. The incident, the mother concluded, \"has even affected our relationship with our African-American friends.\"\n\nI read this statement aloud in open court. For a reason. It was of little surprise to me that neither parent nor the child was present in court for the sentencing. After all, the defendant and the judge are amongst the individuals the three year old has fear of as a result of the crime. Do three year olds form such generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions of others? I think not. Perhaps the mother had attributed her own views to her child as a manner of sanitizing them.\n\nLet me be clear. The statement played absolutely no role in the sentencing decision and the commonwealth disavowed the statement. Needless to say, I was deeply offended, however, that this statement was put forth for the purpose of persuading me to impose a lengthy prison sentence. Had the perpetrator been white, I doubt it would have resulted in such gross generalizations. The race of a perpetrator of a crime is not a reason or an excuse to fear an entire race of people.\n\nWe must stand against it in whatever form. As a judge I do my work without regard to race. It is incumbent on me to confront and dispose of language based on racism and stereotypes. We should all do our part to eradicate such nonsense. And let me be clear, silence does nothing to contribute. It simply sends a message that such views are acceptable and fear somehow excuses wrong.\"\n\nVICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT\n\n(Jordan Gray, mother)\n\nHas the crime had a psychological impact on you?\n\nMy husband works nights and there are many nights I still can't sleep. Even with a security system I don't feel safe in my own home. I'm nervous about when random people walk down the street and constantly have our doors locked.\n\nHas this crime effected the lifestyle of you or your family?\n\nDue to the impact it has had on my 5-year-old daughter we have to consider the area in which we go.

When we are running errands, if we come across a black male, she holds me tight and begs me to leave. If (she) is playing in a room and I walk into another, she freaks out. It has affected her friendships at school and our relationship with African American friends.\n\n(Tommy Gray, father)\n\nHas the crime had a psychological impact on you?\n\nFor months after this crime I couldn't sleep. I would relive this incident every night before bed. I would constantly see their faces every time I closed my eyes.\n\nHas this crime effected the lifestyle of you or your family?\n\nSince the crime occurred my daughter is terrified of black males. Where ever we go, we are constantly reminded of her fears. She brings up the crime and can't be left alone in our own home because she is afraid someone will bust in the door.\"\n\nHas this crime resulted in any damages or loss of property?\n\nMy wife's cell phone and vacation fund of about $1000.\n\nIf you have any additional information, please feel free to attach it to this form. (i.e, recommended sentence).\n\nI don't have a recommended sentence but I feel like probation is not enough.

Multiple explosions shook the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv following weeks of relative calm, prompting widespread condemnation from global leaders. “They are trying to annihilate us and wipe us off the face of the earth,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today. The mayor of Kyiv has urged residents to remain in shelters after a children’s playground was among the sites hit by the apparent Russian strikes. Several blasts also rocked the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk. This comes just two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin was humiliated following a massive explosion on a key strategic bridge linking Crimea and Russia.\n\n2. Hurricane Ian\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Ian, the lack of flood insurance in Central Florida has left many families struggling to rebuild amid the devastation. Homeowners’ insurance policies typically don’t cover flood damage and most people living in Ian’s path across Florida didn’t have a separate flood insurance policy. Inland areas that experienced historic rainfall and catastrophic floodwaters were especially unprepared, according to a CNN analysis of FEMA flood insurance data. While people without flood insurance will still be eligible for assistance payments from FEMA and potentially other aid approved by Congress, experts say many homeowners will likely only receive a tiny fraction of the cost of the damage they suffered.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Immigrant workers head to Florida to help with hurricane relief 03:31 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

Richardson also said that he’s working with the families of both Americans and coordinating with the White House for their release. “All I can say is that the Biden administration is working hard on it,” Richardson told CNN, adding his meetings have been with “senior Russian officials, individuals close to President (Vladimir) Putin.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bill Richardson on what he saw inside Russia 01:41 - Source: CNN\n\n5. NFL\n\nThe National Football League and the NFL Players Association agreed to update the league’s concussion protocol over the weekend. The decision follows a review of the response to Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa’s injury on September 25 after he suffered an apparent head injury and was later allowed to reenter the game. He was later hospitalized for a concussion. Under the new protocols, players will be unable to compete if they are experiencing ataxia, which describes a lack of coordination caused by poor muscle control. The NFL’s chief medical officer said the NFL would take a “conservative” approach to ruling players out.

But a nun took the coat from her, she remembers.\n\n“That nun took it off of me and threw it at my mom,” she told CNN. Then the nun called her mother a ‘savage” – an incident she said foreshadowed years of abuse.\n\nMcIntosh was sexually assaulted by a priest at that school for years, she says. “He violated me in ways that no child should ever go through. And I would break down and I would cry. Thinking about it, what he’d done. And I wonder why. What did I do to you?”\n\nShe has identified the priest as the now-retired 92-year-old Arthur Masse, who spent more than a decade at residential schools in Manitoba. Masse was charged in June with indecent assault and has not yet entered a plea.\n\nMcIntosh’s mother never forgave herself for what her daughter went through. “I told her it’s not your fault, what choice did you have,” she says.\n\nBut McIntosh feels no such forgiveness towards the Catholic Church, despite efforts to atone at the highest levels.\n\nVictoria McIntosh, 63, said she was sexually assaulted by a priest at Fort Alexander residential school for years. Lindsay Isaac/CNN\n\nPope Francis himself arrived in Canada this week with a singular purpose — to apologize on Canadian soil directly and personally to indigenous peoples for the Catholic Church’s role in the government funded residential school system.\n\nIn particular, the trip – which the Pope himself has called penance – recognizes the damage done to indigenous children who were taken from their families, banned from using their language, forced to abandon their culture and in many cases abused physically, sexually, and emotionally.\n\n“Kneel down the way you made us. Kneel down as little kids and ask for that forgiveness,” McIntosh said of the Pope.\n\nAt least 150,000 Indigenous children were impacted across the country, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in September 2021, when Canada observed its first national holiday honoring victims and survivors.\n\nA dark history\n\nFor more than a century, beginning in 1831, indigenous children in Canada were separated from their families and forced by the government to attend residential institutions run by Christian churches.\n\nUntil the last one shut in 1998, roughly three quarters of those schools fell under the Catholic Church’s administration.\n\nIn 2015, a report by Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission detailed decades of physical, sexual and emotional abuse suffered by children in government and church-run institutions.\n\nMore than 4,000 children died while at residential schools over a period of several decades, it estimated. In June 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc community discovered the remains of 215 children who attended the former Kamloops Indian Residential School, sending shockwaves across the country.\n\nChildren as young as three were buried on the grounds of the formerly Catholic Church-run school – once one of the largest in Canada.\n\nThe Pope’s visit comes as dozens of indigenous communities across Canada search the grounds of former residential institutions looking for unmarked graves.\n\nSagkeeng First Nation in southeastern Manitoba is actively surveying their land, with searches underway on the site of the former Fort Alexander Residential School.\n\nOn the grounds of Fort Alexander, a drone operator flies a leading-edge commercial drone armed with ground-penetrating radar technology – part of a team carrying out a grisly operation to search deep below the earth for the bodies of missing Indigenous children.\n\nCanadian drone company AltoMaxx was hired by the Sakeeng to survey the land, and has expanded its search to several sites based on information gathered from survivors and elders.\n\nThe searches have so far found 190 anomalies in the ground which could indicate the presence of human remains, says First Nation Chief Derrick Henderson.\n\nChief Derrick Henderson said that Sagkeeng First Nation is actively surveying the site of Fort Alexander for human remains. Lindsay Isaac/CNN\n\nIt is a painstaking, heart-breaking process – but one that is essential for coming to terms with the intergenerational trauma entrenched in the Indigenous community, he says.\n\n“At least there’ll be some relief and some comfort, right, that we know we have to do what we have to do to bring those children, take them home. Right. And do the proper thing for the families. I think that’s the most important thing,” Henderson told CNN.\n\nThe process is finally reinforcing the accounts of the community’s elders, who have been saying for decades that there are thousands of unaccounted for children who disappeared while attending residential school. Until recently, those stories have fallen on deaf ears.\n\n“The truths are coming out now. So people will really believe what our people went through when they attended the residential school. So I think that was the biggest thing because people really didn’t understand or they didn’t believe. So now, now that this is coming out, people will start to realize this actually happened,” says Henderson.\n\nThe reservation plans to repatriate remains that are found to their home communities for proper burial. At least 31 communities from across Canada were forced to send children to Fort Alexander from 1905 until it closed in 1970.\n\nRefusing to forgive\n\n“I ask forgiveness, in particular, for the ways in which many members of the Church and of religious communities cooperated, not least through their indifference, in projects of cultural destruction and forced assimilation promoted by the governments of that time, which culminated in the system of residential schools,” the Pope said on Monday.\n\nBut while his trip was made at the request of Indigenous leaders, the pontiff’s apology will most likely be met with indifference and ambivalence by many, says Joe Daniels, another survivor of Fort Alexander, as he walks the grounds of his old school.\n\n“Someone had to go to Rome to go and practically beg this guy to come here and apologize, why couldn’t he have done it on his own from here?” says Daniels, gesturing to his heart.\n\nDaniels recognizes that some in his community have been waiting for an apology for years. After decades of refusing to admit responsibility, the Catholic Church officially apologized to Canadian Indigenous leaders who traveled to the Vatican in April.\n\nAnother residential school survivor, 80-year-old Henry Boubard, says it is too late to make amends.\n\n“You took away my education, you took away my life, you took away my marriage, you took away my identity, you took away everything I wanted to be. Now it’s nothing, and you say I’m sorry,” he says of the Pope’s apology, shaking his head.\n\nPope Francis delivered an apology in Alberta on Monday for the Catholic Church's role in the \"devastating\" abuse of Canadian Indigenous children in residential schools. Cole Burston/Getty Images\n\nBoubard says he was taken from his grandparents’ home at the age of seven. He lived in constant fear during the nine years he spent at Fort Alexander, he says, and suffered emotional, physical and sexual abuse that ultimately erased his sense of identity.\n\n“After what the priest did to me sexually, it changed everything,” Boubard said. He says he started to hate himself as he grew up, and attributes his battle with alcoholism and struggle to properly love his wife and two children to the trauma he suffered.\n\n“I felt dirty inside here, from what that priest did to me. Even later on when I was growing up I just, I don’t know it seemed like I just lost my mind, to be a person, a human being. I lost that, it seems like, who I was. What I was.”\n\nBoubard says he was not allowed to visit his family home. Once, he ran away and managed to reach his grandmother’s house. The following day, a policeman and a priest arrived at the door to take him back.\n\n“I didn’t want to let them know I was crying, so I was crying inside, really crying, weeping because I didn’t want to go back. I went back and it started over again, all over again.”\n\nPatrick Bruyere, 75, said that he and his sister were both abused at Fort Alexander. Lindsay Isaac/CNN\n\nAt the same school, siblings grew up to be adult strangers after being isolated from each other and banned from communicating.\n\n“We didn’t have that bond of brother and sister,” Patrick Bruyere, 75, says of his sister Sarah Mazerolle, 76, despite their closeness in age. Now neighbors, both say they were abused at Fort Alexander.\n\n“You had to survive if you were going to live. You had to find ways to get over everything that was being done to you,” recounts Mazerolle. Neither of them plan to watch any of the events the Pope will be taking part in during his visit – especially not the apology – they told CNN.\n\n“I think they want to forget what they did. Same as us trying to forget what they did to us. I think it makes them feel better,” Mazerolle said.\n\nNot just the Catholic Church\n\nTeams investigating former residential schools that were run by other denominations have also been pushing ahead in the search for answers.\n\nIn the southwest of Manitoba, the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation (SVDN) has teamed up with researchers from Simon Fraser University, the University of Windsor, and Brandon University to conduct searches around the site of the former Brandon residential school which was run first by the Methodist Church, then by the United Church. Both churches have publicly recognized their roles in the administration of residential schools.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, under the management of the United Church, a number of students attempted to run away, complaining of harsh discipline and poor food, according to the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR).\n\nSarah Mazerolle, 76, said she won't be following the Pope's visit -- especially not the apology. Lindsay Isaac/CNN\n\nLorraine Pompana was just six years old when she was taken to Brandon, she told CNN.\n\n“I can vividly remember the day we were picked up from the reservation,” she said. “I remember crying and screaming and I was holding onto my dad’s legs, not wanting to go. But they wrenched me from his arms.”\n\nUpon arriving at the school, Pompana says she and the other children were stripped of their clothes, made to shower, had their hair cut, and made to wear clothes with numbers on them.\n\n“We were given this number and that’s what we were identified as, a number…when they called you, they called your number,” she said.\n\nStudents only went to school for half the day, Pompana. The rest of the day was spent cleaning areas including the staff dining room after the staff ate, and working in the kitchen, she said.\n\nThe children were given corporal punishment and never had enough to eat, she said. They were also forbidden from speaking their native language.\n\n“To this day I cannot speak my language because of being scared – when I remember how we were treated when we spoke our language. If we cried, if we spoke our language, we got slapped on the hand or got our nose pulled, our ears pulled,” Pompana said.\n\nOne day, a friend at the school disappeared, she said.\n\n“I don’t know what happened. We asked about her, but they didn’t tell us. I still wonder to this day, what did happen to her?”\n\nIn June 2021, the Chief of Sioux Valley Dakota Nation Jennifer Bone announced that 104 potential graves had been found at the school.\n\nInvestigators say that 99 names of those who died in association with the Brandon residential school and are possibly buried in known cemeteries have been identified.\n\nOne of the researchers is Eldon Yellowhorn, a professor of Indigenous Studies at Simon Fraser University, on the Peigan Indian Reserve, and whose mother was a residential school survivor.\n\nYellowhorn told CNN that researchers look through national archives, church records, coroners’ records and police records when trying to identify buried bodies.\n\nWhether to exhume gravesites for DNA samples to match with living individuals is a complicated question. Culturally, some communities say remains should be left where they are buried.\n\n“We have to negotiate with the survivors and families and communities,” Yellowhorn says. SVDN is among the communities that have not conducted exhumations.\n\n“People are finally getting answers, in some cases where their relatives are buried. Because oftentimes when people died at these schools their parents might have just gotten a note that ‘your child has died’ but no other information about how they died or where they were buried,” he explained.\n\nDrone searches neaar Fort Alexander have found anomalies in the ground that could indicate the presence of human remains. Lindsay Isaac/CNN\n\nChallenges in the search\n\nFour different areas have been surveyed so far and two school cemeteries have been identified, and two additional areas with potential unmarked graves have also been identified, according to Katherine Nichols, whose research launched investigations into the unmarked graves associated with the Brandon residential school site.\n\nIn June, the Manitoba provincial government allocated $1.94 million USD to indigenous governments and organizations for the identification, commemoration and protection of burial sites of children who attended residential schools.\n\nElder councils and survivors are key in the investigation, giving researchers and scientists guidance on how to proceed and where to search.

Then he went to the bank this week to cash his settlement checks, but the Livonia bank refused to cash or deposit his checks. Instead, they called the police and initiated a fraud investigation — actions that dumbfounded Thomas and his lawyer, triggering another lawsuit.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thomas sued TCF Bank, alleging race discrimination, saying the Livonia branch mistreated and humiliated him by calling four police officers when all he was trying to do was deposit legitimate checks. According to police, the bank's computer system read the checks as fraudulent.\n\nTCF Bank spokesman Tom Wennerberg said Thursday that TCF abhors racism and that it was not a factor in how the bank handled Thomas' requests. He said the checks Thomas presented displayed a watermark that read VOID when they were scanned in a web viewer.\n\nThomas isn't buying it, noting the checks cleared 12 hours later. He's upset that two officers questioned him inside the bank, while two others stood guard outside, he said, adding he was an account holder for nearly two years at that TCF branch.\n\n\"I didn't deserve treatment like that when I knew that the check was not fraudulent,\" Thomas told the Free Press. \"I'm a United States veteran. I have an honorable discharge from the Air Force. They discriminated against me because I'm black. None of this would have happened if I were white.\"\n\nThursday afternoon, TCF issued an apology:\n\n\"We apologize for the experience Mr. Thomas had at our banker center. Local police should not have been involved. We strongly condemn racism and discrimination of any kind. We take extra precautions involving large deposits and requests for cash and in this case, we were unable to validate the checks presented by Mr. Thomas and regret we could not meet his needs.\"\n\nThomas could not disclose the amount of the settlement due to it being part of a confidential agreement stemming from a federal lawsuit against his former employer, Enterprise Leasing Co. of Detroit. He said he ended up going to a Chase bank in Detroit that day, opened an account and successfully deposited the checks there. The money was made available within 12 hours.\n\n'OK, boomer':Chief Justice John Roberts asks if phrase counts as age discrimination\n\nIn the boardroom:California gender diversity law could lead to more women quotas nationally\n\nThomas said that while he was at the Livonia bank, he called his lawyer — prominent employment law attorney Deborah Gordon — for help in explaining that his checks were a legitimate, civil suit settlement. But the bank wouldn't take her word for it, either.\n\n\"I got on the phone with the bank. I sent them my federal court complaint, to see that it matched. I did everything,\" said Gordon, who believes her client was scrutinized because of the color of his skin.\n\n\"Obviously, assumptions were made the minute he walked in based on his race. It's unbelievable that this guy got done with a race discrimination case and he’s not allowed to deposit the checks based on his case? It's absolutely outrageous,\" said Gordon, stressing that all of this could have been avoided.\n\n\"They could have just called the bank that issued the checks, and they apparently didn't do anything because it would have all been verified immediately.\"\n\nAccording to TCF's Wennerberg, Thomas presented three checks written from Enterprise that day: One for $59,000. One for $27,000. And one for $13,000.\n\n\"They couldn't verify that those checks were due to a settlement,\" said Wennerberg, adding that the bank contacted Enterprise to verify that the checks were part of a lawsuit, but were unable to do so.\n\nWennerberg said the assistant manager who waited on Thomas was African American, and felt that something didn't \"look right,\" so she called police.\n\n\"Obviously, the customer got upset at that point,\" Wennerberg said, adding Thomas had made a \"highly, highly unusual request.\"\n\nAccording to Wennerberg, Thomas wanted to deposit the two larger checks in his bank account, which, Wennerberg said, had only 52 cents in it. And he wanted to cash the $13,000 check, he said, adding the bank told him that those funds would be on hold for two business days, and that Thomas said \"fine.\" Thomas also wanted a new debit card because, he told the bank, his old one wasn't working, he said, adding that that request sounded unusual as well.\n\nWennerberg said he had not yet seen the race discrimination lawsuit that Gordon filed against TCF on Wednesday, but denied that the bank engaged in discriminatory behavior.\n\n\"We disagree with that,\" Wennerberg said. \"We were looking at the behavior, the asks that he was making.\"\n\nThe bank also issued a statement Thursday: \"TCF Bank is a diverse business serving a diverse community and we abhor racism in all forms. Mr. Thomas’ transaction was handled like any other transactions involving requests for large amounts of cash. We regret any inconvenience to Mr. Thomas.\"\n\nThe Livonia Police officer assigned to the case did not return requests for comment, though she explained some of the bank's concerns in an email she sent on Wednesday to Gordon, in which she asked for help in establishing the checks' authenticity.\n\n\"Do you have a contact person that you were dealing with at Enterprise that would be able to confirm for me that these checks are in fact legitimate,\" read the email from Lora Claypool, of the Livonia Police Department's Detective Bureau.\n\n\"The problem that the bank is having is that these check(s) appear different than (the company's) payroll checks so their computer system is telling them that they are fraud. If I can confirm that they are not fraudulent, by getting a hold of Enterprise Leasing Company then I can give that information to the bank, and we can resolve this situation.\"\n\nAccording to the email, the officers at the bank did receive copies of the lawsuit from Gordon, but \"they wanted to make contact with Enterprise to confirm.\"\n\nThomas was not arrested. No charges were filed.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas, 44, is demanding answers from the bank. He is suing for unspecified damages, and wants an apology from the bank for putting him through what he describes as a hellish experience. According to Thomas, this is what happened at the TCF bank that day.\n\nAbout 3 p.m. Tuesday, Thomas entered the bank and filled out a sign-in sheet to meet with a banking specialist to open an additional savings account and deposit his checks. He eventually met with assistant branch manager Erika Mack, gave her his checks and explained that he would like to open a savings account, deposit the checks and withdraw some cash.\n\nMack immediately because suspicious, explained the checks would need to be “verified” but that the bank's computerized “verification system” was not working that day. Because of this malfunction, Mack said she would have to call in the checks to complete the transaction. She then walked away to a back area to \"call in the checks,\" but before leaving, she asked Thomas: \"How did you get this money?\"\n\n'On the inside, we are sad':Black Facebook employees complain racism, discrimination have gotten worse\n\nThomas answered that the money was from a lawsuit settlement.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Mack returned and said that the person who verifies checks “was not around.” Thomas said he'd wait until that person showed up.\n\nTurned out, the assistant bank manager was not going to-and-from a back area to complete Thomas' transaction, but rather had called the Livonia Police and reported that Thomas was trying to deposit fraudulent checks.\n\nWithin 10 minutes, two Livonia Police officers arrived inside the lobby; two others remained outside the doors.\n\nOne of the officers told Thomas that the bank had reported \"a problem\" with his checks, and wanted to know where he got them.\n\nThomas explained the lawsuit, gave the officer his lawyer's business card, and then called his lawyer himself for help.\n\nTwo officers spoke with Gordon, who also explained to the officers and an assistant bank manager that Thomas had settled a federal lawsuit involving race discrimination, and that he was trying to deposit his settlement checks.\n\nThe bank still refused to deposit them, the lawsuit says, and then filed a police report against Thomas for check fraud.\n\nThomas closed his TCF account that day and left the premises. Within an hour, he deposited the checks into a new account at a Chase bank in Detroit. They cleared within 12 hours. Thomas, who had no car and walked to work, used the money to buy a 2004 Dodge Durango.\n\n\"I had a very long journey and I feel like I have to go through the same thing again,\" Thomas said. \"It's frustrating, but I do know God is in control. I will be vindicated because I didn't do anything wrong.\"\n\nGordon, meanwhile, scoffed at the bank's claims that her client's checks appeared to be fraudulent, adding that she picked the checks up from the Butzel Long law firm that day, and had a courier deliver them to her client.\n\n\"T checks have never been considered fraudulent; they are proceeds against a settlement written on a check from a large, United States corporation that I received from a major law firm. No one is issuing fraudulent checks,\" Gordon said. \"This whole thing is insane.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/americas/pope-francis-canada-speech-intl/index.html", "title": "Edmonton speech: Pope apologizes for 'deplorable evil' of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPope Francis has spoken of his “sorrow, indignation and shame” over the Catholic Church’s role in the abuse of Canadian Indigenous children in residential schools, as he kicked off a weeklong “penitential pilgrimage” to the country.\n\nThe Pope apologized and promised a “serious investigation” into what happened in a speech at a meeting with Indigenous peoples in Edmonton, Alberta, on Monday.\n\nIndigenous leaders have long called for a papal apology for the harm inflicted for decades on Indigenous children, who suffered abuse and the erasure of Indigenous culture in the country’s residential schools.\n\nPope Francis dons a headdress during a visit with Indigenous peoples at Maskwacis in Edmonton, Alberta, on Monday.

Anthem has not created its own network of facilities.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross, the country’s second-biggest health insurance company, is behind on billions of dollars in payments owed to hospitals and doctors because of onerous new reimbursement rules, computer problems and mishandled claims, say hospital officials in multiple states.\n\nAnthem, like other big insurers, is using the COVID-19 crisis as cover to institute “egregious” policies that harm patients and pinch hospital finances, said Molly Smith, group vice president at the American Hospital Association.\n\n“There’s this sense of, ‘Everyone’s distracted. We can get this through,’” she said.\n\nHospitals are also dealing with a spike in retroactive claims denials by UnitedHealthcare, the biggest health insurer, for emergency department care, AHA says.\n\nDisputes between insurers and hospitals are nothing new. But this fight sticks more patients in the middle, worried they’ll have to pay unresolved claims. Hospitals say it is hurting their finances as many cope with COVID-19 surges – even after the industry has received tens of billions of dollars in emergency assistance from the federal government.\n\nMapping coronavirus:All of the COVID-19 cases in the U.S.\n\n“We recognize there have been some challenges” to prompt payments caused by claims-processing changes and “a new set of dynamics” amid the pandemic, Anthem spokesperson Colin Manning said in an email. “We apologize for any delays or inconvenience this may have caused.”\n\nVirginia law requires insurers to pay claims within 40 days. In a Sept. 24 letter to state insurance regulators, VCU Health, a system that operates a large teaching hospital in Richmond associated with Virginia Commonwealth University, said Anthem owes it $385 million. More than 40% of the claims are more than 90 days old, VCU said.\n\nFor all Virginia hospitals, Anthem’s late, unpaid claims amount to “hundreds of millions of dollars,” the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association said in a June 23 letter to state regulators.\n\nNationwide, the payment delays “are creating an untenable situation,” the American Hospital Association said in a Sept. 9 letter to Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux. “Patients are facing greater hurdles to accessing care; clinicians are burning out on unnecessary administrative tasks; and the system is straining to finance the personnel and supplies” needed to fight covid.\n\nComplaints about Anthem extend “from sea to shining sea, from New Hampshire to California,” AHA CEO Rick Pollack told KHN.\n\nSubstantial payment delays can be seen on Anthem’s books. On June 30, 2019, before the pandemic, 43% of the insurer’s medical bills for that quarter were unpaid, according to regulatory filings. Two years later that figure had risen to 53% – a difference of $2.5 billion.\n\nAnthem profits were $4.6 billion in 2020 and $3.5 billion in the first half of 2021.\n\n'It's a game they're playing'\n\nAlexis Thurber, who lives near Seattle, was insured by Anthem when she got an $18,192 hospital bill in May for radiation therapy that doctors said was essential to treat her breast cancer.\n\nThe treatments were “experimental” and “not medically necessary,” Anthem said, according to Thurber. She spent much of the summer trying to get the insurer to pay up — placing two dozen phone calls, spending hours on hold, sending multiple emails and enduring unmeasurable stress and worry. It finally covered the claim months later.\n\n“It’s so egregious. It’s a game they’re playing,” said Thurber, 51, whose cancer was diagnosed in November. “Trying to get true help was impossible.”\n\nPrivacy rules prevent Anthem from commenting on Thurber’s case, said Anthem spokesperson Colin Manning.\n\nTracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution by state:How many people have been vaccinated in the US?\n\nWhen insurers fail to promptly pay medical bills, patients are left in the lurch. They might first get a notice saying payment is pending or denied. A hospital might bill them for treatment they thought would be covered. Hospitals and doctors often sue patients whose insurance didn’t pay up.\n\nHospitals point to a variety of Anthem practices contributing to payment delays or denials, including new layers of document requirements, prior-authorization hurdles for routine procedures and requirements that doctors themselves – not support staffers – speak to insurance gatekeepers.\n\n“This requires providers to literally leave the patient[’s] bedside to get on the phone with Anthem,” AHA said in its letter.\n\nAnthem often hinders coverage for outpatient surgery, specialty pharmacy and other services in health systems listed as in-network, amounting to a “bait and switch” on Anthem members, AHA officials said.\n\n“Demanding that patients be treated outside of the hospital setting, against the advice of the patient’s in-network treating physician, appears to be motivated by a desire to drive up Empire’s profits,” the Greater New York Hospital Association wrote in an April letter to Empire Blue Cross, which is owned by Anthem.\n\nAnthem officials pushed back in a recent letter to the AHA, saying the insurer’s changing rules are intended partly to control excessive prices charged by hospitals for specialty drugs and nonemergency surgery, screening and diagnostic procedures.\n\nWhen will everyone be vaccinated for COVID-19? Here's how the vaccine rollout is going\n\nSevere problems with Anthem’s new claims management system surfaced months ago and “persist without meaningful improvement,” AHA said in its letter.\n\nClaims have gotten lost in Anthem’s computers, and in some cases VCU Health has had to print medical records and mail them to get paid, VCU said in its letter. The cash slowdown imposes “an unmanageable disruption that threatens to undermine our financial footing,” VCU said.\n\nAn 'incredibly aggravating' response\n\nUnited denied $31,557 in claims for Emily Long’s care after she was struck in June by a motorcycle in New York City. She needed surgery to repair a fractured cheekbone. United said there was a lack of documentation for “medical necessity” – an “incredibly aggravating” response on top of the distress of the accident, Long said.\n\nThe Brooklyn hospital that treated Long was “paid appropriately under her plan and within the required time frame,” said United spokesperson Maria Gordon Shydlo. “The facility has the right to appeal the decision.”\n\nUnited’s unpaid claims came to 54% as of June 30, about the same level as two years previously.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson:Comparing the COVID-19 vaccines\n\nWhen Erin Conlisk initially had trouble gaining approval for a piece of medical equipment for her elderly father this summer, United employees told her the insurer’s entire prior-authorization database had gone down for weeks, said Conlisk, who lives in California.\n\n“There was a brief issue with our prior-authorization process in mid-July, which was resolved quickly,” Gordon Shydlo said.\n\nWhen asked by Wall Street analysts about the payment backups, Anthem executives said it partly reflects their decision to increase financial reserves amid the health crisis.\n\n“Really a ton of uncertainty associated with this environment,” John Gallina, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call in July. “We’ve tried to be extremely prudent and conservative in our approach.”\n\n'A deep fear of talking on the record'\n\nDuring the pandemic, hospitals have benefited from two extraordinary cash infusions. They and other medical providers have received more than $100 billion through the CARES Act of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan of 2021. Last year United, Anthem and other insurers accelerated billions in hospital reimbursements.\n\nThe federal payments enriched many of the biggest, wealthiest systems while poorer hospitals serving low-income patients and rural areas struggled.\n\nThose are the systems most hurt now by insurer payment delays, hospital officials said. Federal relief funds “have been a lifeline, but they don’t make people whole in terms of the losses from increased expenses and lost revenue as a result of the COVID experience,” Pollack said.\n\nStay connected: Subscribe to Coronavirus Watch, your daily update on all things COVID-19 in the USA\n\nSeveral health systems declined to comment about claims-payment delays or didn’t respond to a reporter’s queries. Among individual hospitals “there is a deep fear of talking on the record about your largest business partner,” AHA’s Smith said.\n\nAlexis Thurber worried she might have to pay her $18,192 radiation bill herself, and she’s not confident her Anthem policy will do a better job next time of covering the cost of her care.\n\n“It makes me not want to go to the doctor anymore,” she said. “I’m scared to get another mammogram because you can’t rely on it.”\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

Eramo is suing the magazine for almost $8 million, saying A Rape on Campus cast her as the \"chief villain.\"\n\nLawyers for Eramo have included Jackie on their witness list.\n\nThe gripping article detailed Jackie's claim that she was at a fraternity party on Sept. 28, 2012, when she was lured upstairs, raped and beaten by several men over a three-hour period. The fraternity immediately challenged the article's claims, which quickly drew intense media scrutiny followed by skepticism.\n\nCharlottesville police investigated and found no evidence of rape. The magazine commissioned the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to study the way the article was handled. That 13,000-word report — 4,000 words longer than the article itself — found a systematic failure by the magazine, starting with relying too heavily on a single source: Jackie. The report also said the magazine, not Jackie, was to blame for the botched piece.\n\nThe magazine issued an apology in December 2014 for its failures in reporting and editing. The story was fully retracted four months later.\n\nAccuser must testify about 'Rolling Stone' rape story\n\nEramo's lawsuit claims writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely and the magazine sought \"to weave a narrative that depicted the University of Virginia as an institution that is indifferent to rape on campus, and more concerned with protecting its reputation than with assisting victims of sexual assault.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says Rolling Stone falsely accused Eramo of being instrumental in persuading Jackie not to report the rape and discouraging Jackie from sharing her story with others or telling police.\n\nEramo still works for the university, but no longer as a dean of students. She spoke with ABC News last week, saying Rolling Stone depicted her as insensitive to students who were sexual assault victims.\n\n“They made it look like I used the trust of, yeah, women to cover up rapes,” Eramo said. “And that was so far from anything I would ever do. It was just unbelievable to me.”\n\nThe magazine issued a statement accusing Eramo's lawyers of \"attempting to shift the focus of her lawsuit in the media to Rolling Stone’s reporting errors.\" The statement pointed to a U.S. Education Department investigation of the university's practices — an investigation that found a \"mixed record of responding to reports of sexual harassment and sexual violence.\"\n\nRolling Stone said the depiction of Eramo in its ill-fated article \"was balanced and described the challenges of her role.”\n\nEramo's lawsuit also has drawn the ire of the National Organization for Women. In an open letter to university President Teresa Sullivan in January, NOW said demands made by Eramo's lawyers for detailed information from Jackie amounted to \"re-victimization.\"\n\n\"It is exactly this kind of victim blaming and shaming that fosters rape culture, re-victimizes those brave enough to have come forward, and silences countless other victims,\" the letter said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/28/commissioner-black-kids-target-practice-armed-white-teachers-superintendent-furious/381734002/", "title": "Commissioner: Black kids 'target practice' if white teachers are armed", "text": "Ryan Dailey\n\nTallahassee Democrat\n\nLeon County Commissioner Bill Proctor warned lawmakers their proposed school marshal program will turn black students into nothing more than \"target practice\" for \"trigger happy teachers.\"\n\n\"Arming scary and fearful teachers who are afraid of black boys and who dislike black boys is a formula for disaster that tragically will disproportionately see countless numbers of black children fall victim to potential trigger happy school teachers,\" Proctor wrote in a Monday letter to legislative leaders.\n\nIn his letter, Proctor appeared to highlight an issue touched on by some black legislators during Tuesday's House committee debate.

Eventually, local police also failed to find any evidence supporting the claims made by a student identified as \"Jackie.\"\n\nThe magazine issued an apology in December for its failures in reporting and editing. the magazine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit says that the author, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, and the magazine claimed in a \"slew of media appearances\" that Eramo tried to \"coddle\" Jackie to persuade her not to report the rape and discouraged Jackie from sharing her story with others or telling police.\n\n\"These statements, and the portrayal of Dean Eramo, in A Rape on Campus and in Erdely and Rolling Stone's subsequent public statements, are categorically false,\" the suit says.\n\nThe article made national headlines and rocked the picturesque Charlottesville campus community. Within days, University President Teresa Sullivan suspended all fraternity activities on campus.\n\nBut the fraternity quickly challenged key facts in the article, and Rolling Stone later admitted that, at the request of the alleged victim, it never tried to interview the seven accused men.\n\nIn January, the university reinstated the fraternity. In March, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said his detectives found many inconsistencies in the story and no evidence the rape occurred. Longo said although more than 70 interviews were conducted, the investigation was suspended but not closed.\n\n\"I can't prove that something didn't happen,\" he said. \"It's a disservice to Jackie and the university to just close this case\" because more information could become available.\n\nThe magazine commissioned the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to study the way the article was handled. The 13,000-word report — 4,000 words longer than the article itself — released in April found a systematic failure by the magazine, starting with relying too heavily on a single source Jackie.

This comes after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks across Ukraine on Monday, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 100 others, according to Ukrainian officials. Critical infrastructure was hit in several regions and in the capital Kyiv, where dozens of fires broke out, Ukraine’s emergency services said. Numerous areas in the region are still without power today following the barrage of Russian strikes that were partly targeted at energy facilities to leave Ukrainians without electricity. President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday, condemning the strikes and pledging continued US security assistance “including advanced air defense systems.”\n\n2. Rail Strike\n\nThe threat of a freight rail strike is back after a major union of railroad workers rejected a tentative agreement Monday with the nation’s freight carriers. More than half of the 23,000 members in one of the largest rail unions opposed the agreement, meaning the two parties will now enter negotiations in hopes of reaching a deal. Without a new deal, there could be a strike that significantly impacts the nation’s already struggling supply chains. But such a strike would not occur until at least November 19, according to the union. The Biden administration has been desperate to avoid a strike because major railroads carry 30% of the nation’s freight and a strike could cause shortages and higher prices for essentials like food and gasoline. A strike could also force factories without parts to close and leave store shelves empty during the holiday shopping season.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Romans: There is a move afoot here for better quality of living 01:59 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Trump\n\nNew emails released by the General Services Administration debunk claims made by former President Donald Trump and his allies that the government agency is to blame for packing boxes from the White House that ended up at his Mar-a-Lago residence after his presidency. Former presidents are allowed to take certain government materials and office equipment to set up a permanent office away from the White House. But that does not include the sort of classified documents Trump took to Mar-a-Lago – which are at the center of an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation. Trump and his allies have said GSA was responsible for classified documents being at his Florida home. The newly released emails, however, make clear that the boxes had already been packed and sat shrink-wrapped in an empty office space.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's why Trump-appointed judge Aileen Cannon's decisions are under scrutiny 03:54 - Source: CNN\n\n4.

Speed limits\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has recommended a new vehicle system that could stop drivers from speeding. The technology essentially recognizes speed limits and either issues visual or audible alerts when a driver is speeding or prevents vehicles from going above those limits. New York City has become the first city in the US to test the speed-limiting technology in 50 of its fleet vehicles. “There’s no reason today, with so much technology and so much awareness, that anybody should die at the hands of an automobile,” said Meera Joshi, New York City’s Deputy Mayor for Operations. After more than 20,000 deaths on US roads this year alone, the NTSB has called on the federal government to start incentivizing car makers to put speed-limiting systems in new cars, according to a report.

While Biden has expanded some existing national monuments since becoming president, Wednesday marks the first time the President has used the 1906 Antiquities Act to create a national monument since taking office.\n\nAt the camp in Vail, Colorado, Biden called national monuments “treasures and wonders that define the identity of us as a nation.”\n\n“They’re a birthright that we pass down from generation to generation. And they unite us – and that’s what today is all about. We’re doing it not just for today but for all the ages,” he said. “And it’s for the people of Colorado, but it’s also goes well beyond the people of Colorado. It’s for all the people across America and the world. It’s a permanent, permanent decision, an action that no future president can overturn.”\n\nBiden said the Colorado lands “tell a story of America,” acknowledging that tribal nations have, for thousands of years, “been stewards of this sacred land, hunting game, foraging for medicinal plants and maintaining a deep spiritual bond with the land itself.”\n\nMaking Camp Hale a national monument will protect the site from development. The designation, the official said, will also “support jobs and America’s outdoor recreation economy.”\n\nCamp Hale, which is located in part of the ancestral homelands of the Ute Tribes, served as a training site for the US Army’s 10th Mountain Division before their deployment to the Italian Alps in World War II. Soldiers trained in rugged terrain, learning how to ski, climb and snowshoe in the Rocky Mountains before traveling to fight in the war. Many soldiers returned to the area after the war to help develop the local ski industry.\n\nAdditionally, the President announced that the administration is tapping into funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to mitigate the impacts of drought in the Colorado River Basin. And the US Department of the Interior is announcing it is moving to pause new mineral leasing or oil and gas leasing in the newly protected area.\n\nColorado’s Thompson Divide hasn’t been available to oil and gas leasing for several years and there’s no current or planned future oil exploration in the area, the department said in a news release. Natural gas leases already established in the area would be unaffected by the move, but they make up less than 1% of Colorado’s overall federal oil and gas leases.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland will also move to block new mining leases in the nearly 225,000-acre area. That step will need to go through a public comment period before it is finalized.\n\nSpeaking about the leases, Biden said on Wednesday “that there’s no current or planned oil exploration production in the area. We’re just keeping things as they’ve been for a long time … while we study whether we can get this done.”\n\nColorado Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis joined the President at the event along with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory, and additional local and tribal leaders.\n\nOne year ago, Biden announced the expansion of three existing national monuments – Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine – in a move that restored protections that had been undone by then-President Donald Trump. At the time, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said his state’s national monuments were being used as a “political football.”\n\nSome Coloradans have opposed Biden’s executive moves to expand federal protections, saying it could prevent future energy exploration. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, whose district includes the Thompson Divide, and other GOP members of Congress sent a letter to Biden opposing the President’s actions.\n\nColorado Democrats have pressed the White House to take the step in order to preserve an area of environmental and historical significance. Designating Camp Hale has been a key priority for Bennet, who faces a competitive race for reelection next month.\n\nAfter visiting Vail, Biden is slated to make stops in Los Angeles and Orange County in California, as well as Portland, Oregon.

The U.S. Department of Justice, in a news release, said the state’s foster care program has illegally placed hundreds of students with disabilities into “segregated and inferior educational programs,” a direct violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. “Students with disabilities in Alabama’s foster care system are among the most vulnerable in the state’s care, and they deserve better than placement in segregated and inferior schools,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. “The Civil Rights Division will defend every child’s right to equal educational opportunities in schools where they can be supported and challenged.” The department’s findings follow an investigation into allegations that the state denies children in foster care equal opportunity to basic educational services on the basis of disability. Gina Maiola, communications director for Gov. Kay Ivey, said in a statement that the Alabama State Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources have been “working proactively since 2018 to address the needs of our specialized treatment centers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has indicated he will vote in favor of calling a convention to consider amending the state’s constitution. Candidates for governor at an Alaska Resource Development Council forum Tuesday were asked during a “lightning round” if they would be voting for a constitutional convention in next month’s general election. Candidates responded by raising “yes” or “no” signs, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Dunleavy and Republican Charlie Pierce raised “yes” signs. Former Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Les Gara, a Democrat, raised “no” signs. Voters are asked every 10 years if there should be a constitutional convention. While the question has in the past been soundly defeated, both sides of the debate have been preparing for a fight this year. Some convention supporters see an opening to push for one amid public frustration with years of political fighting over what size check should be paid to residents from Alaska’s oil-wealth fund. During a convention, delegates typically have free reign to propose revisions – or even entirely new constitutions – that would then go back to voters for ratification. Some of those pursuing a convention would like to restrict abortion or alter the process for selecting judges in a way that critics say could make the process more partisan.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state can move forward with the execution of death row inmate Murray Hooper next month, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court granted the motion for a warrant of execution of the 76-year-old. He will die by lethal injection or gas in an execution scheduled for Nov. 16, according to the warrant signed by four justices. The other three recused themselves. Kelly Culshaw, an assistant federal public defender representing Hooper, reiterated that he has maintained his innocence in the double slayings on New Year’s Eve in 1980. Hooper was convicted and sentenced “based on corrupt police practices and unreliable witness testimony,” Culshaw said in a statement. “No physical evidence links him to the crime and Mr. Hooper’s execution should not be carried out until an analysis of key fingerprint and DNA evidence, which was scientifically unavailable at the time of his trial, has been completed,” she wrote. Hooper’s defense team filed a petition in September in Maricopa County Superior Court requesting post-conviction DNA and other forensic testing. Defense attorneys say a witness’s description of the assailants changed several times before she identified Hooper, who claimed not to be in Arizona at the time. They also allege criminal informants who helped implicate Hooper were influenced by incentives from the police.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The sounds of the DC and Marvel cinematic universes will be on display this weekend as the Fort Smith Symphony offers its “Symphonic Superheroes” concert. “It’s an exciting weekend because we have so much going on,” said John Jeter, symphony conductor. The concert is slated to begin at 7 p.m. Saturday at the ArcBest Performing Arts Center. Music from the movies “Robin Hood,” “X-Men,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “Wonder Woman,” “Mission Impossible III,” “Captain America,” “Batman/The Dark Knight,” “Transformers,” “Black Panther” and “Iron Man” will be featured. “It’s all very, very exciting stuff,” Jeter said. “The kids will really love it.” There is prominent brass and percussion parts in the symphony, adding drama to the sound, with African and Japanese percussion instruments in the mix too. The symphony will be followed by an after-party for audience members at the Bakery District with live music by the Kool Cats Jazz Quartet. And on Monday, fifth graders may get to see their first symphony with “Earquake” concerts for schoolchildren at the ArcBest PAC. It will be a busy day for the orchestra Monday, with the Indigenous composer chamber music concert at Propak on Garrison at 7 p.m.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state again pushed back its decision on whether to list the western Joshua tree as threatened after a unanimous vote Wednesday by the Fish and Game Commission. The decision to move back the vote until at least February comes months after the commission deadlocked on whether the native desert plant should be protected under the California Endangered Species Act. Since the tree is still under consideration to be listed as threatened, no one can remove it without authorization from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Before the commission’s split vote in June, the Department of Fish and Wildlife sent letters to Indigenous tribes with traditional ties to the area where the western Joshua trees live. That outreach resulted in six responses from tribal nations, said Director Chuck Bonham. In August, tribal members talked about the cultural and ecological significance of the tree on a Zoom call with Bonham and others. “I actually would love more time to keep the conversation alive with the nations themselves,” Bonham said. In 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned for the tree to be listed as threatened in order to protect it from hotter temperatures, intensifying drought and development threats. Commissioners said they need more time to hear from tribal leaders and to allow tribal governments to consult again before the commission can make a final decision.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: A Utah-based Native American tribe that frequently has sparred with President Joe Biden criticized the White House again for not adequately consulting its leaders ahead of this week’s creation of a national monument on ancestral lands in Colorado. The Ute Indian Tribe is one of three Ute tribes in the West that share ancestral ties but operate independently. Representatives from the other two in Colorado – the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute – were on board with the plan and attended Wednesday’s ceremony with Biden but didn’t speak on stage. Biden and others addressed the significance of the land to tribes at length, and the White House’s official proclamation included a mention of Ute burial sites in the area. But the Ute Indian Tribe, which has nearly 3,000 members on lands in an area known for oil and gas operations in eastern Utah, claimed in a news release late Wednesday that it wasn’t on board with the plan. The tribe’s Business Committee, which serves as its governing body, said in the statement it was made aware of the new monument only a few days ago in a phone call with the White House, given scant details and little time to provide feedback. Melvin J. Baker, chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council, noted that for centuries, the Camp Hale area was home to Ute people, and it remains culturally important to the Utes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: Two police officers shot dead Wednesday night were apparently drawn into an ambush by an emergency call about possible domestic violence, authorities said Thursday. A third officer was wounded in the gunfire. State police said in a release that the 911 call the night prior about a dispute between two siblings appears to have been “a deliberate act to lure law enforcement to the scene” in Bristol. Bristol Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy were killed. Officer Alec Iurato was injured. Police said suspect Nicholas Brutcher, 35, was shot dead, and brother Nathan Brutcher was wounded. The surviving brother, 32, was hospitalized, and it wasn’t immediately clear whether he or his family had an attorney or someone else who can speak for them. The deadly encounter came during a week when at least 11 police officers have been shot around the country. Connecticut State Police said they were still working to answer many questions that remained about the confrontation. Neighbors said they heard two or three sets of gunshots, about 30 in all. “I heard a whole war going on behind me,” said Danny Rodriguez, who said he was outside his home across the street when the gunfire rang out. It was so intense that he could smell gunpowder in the air, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Anyone planning to drive through the city on Interstate 95 south this weekend will need to find a different route starting Friday morning, the Delaware Department of Transportation said. As part of the ongoing “Restore the Corridor” project, the highway will be closed between the U.S. Route 202 and the Second Street on-ramp from 9 a.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Tuesday. Drivers coming from Pennsylvania should use I-495 south to bypass Wilmington. All local traffic will be directed to exit I-95 onto U.S. Route 202 and then to take Delaware Route 141 south back onto I-95. Delays and heavier traffic are expected around all detours. By closing part of the highway, construction workers can pave and strip the road, install lighting and build guardrails more safely and quickly. And while it may inconvenience drivers, Department of Transportation spokesperson C.R. McLeod said the road closure represents the “final stretch of major work.” Construction on I-95 in Wilmington, which has been ongoing since early 2021, is slated to wrap up by the end of this year, which is earlier than expected. “The end is within sight,” McLeod said. A similar closure of I-95 north is slated for the last weekend of October.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday against chemical manufacturer Velsicol Chemical LLC, claiming it violated city environmental laws by polluting a major waterway, the Anacostia River and the surrounding area for decades. In a complaint filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, the city alleges that Velsicol produced a pesticide that contained chlordane and marketed it to low-income homeowners in the city from 1945 to 1988. That was the year the chemical was banned for sale in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency over health effects in humans, including tremors, convulsions and cancer. But Racine claimed at a press conference that Velsicol knew long before that that chlordane could cause cancer, as far back as 1959, yet still sold products that contained the chemical. Velsicol did not immediately return calls for comment. As recently as the 1960s, D.C. residents used the Anacostia River for recreation and food, but years of pollution from a variety of sources – sewage, chemical runoff and litter – made the river unusable. The lawsuit developed out of a decades­long effort to clean up the river, Racine said. Local environmentalists, like Matt Gravatt, chair of the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club, said the river is almost back to being safe for public use, but not yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order expanding voting access for the midterm elections in three counties where Hurricane Ian destroyed polling places and displaced thousands of people. The move, which followed requests from Lee, Charlotte and Sarasota counties and voting rights groups, comes as Florida begins to undertake a massive recovery from the Category 4 hurricane that hit Sept. 28 and leveled parts of the state’s southwest. The order extends the number of early voting days in the three counties and authorizes election supervisors to designate additional early voting locations, steps that allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their registered county from Oct. 24 through Nov. 8. Election supervisors can relocate or consolidate polling places if necessary. The order also waives training requirements for poll workers and suspends a signature requirement for voters requesting to have a mail ballot sent to an address different from the one election officials have on file. DeSantis has faced questions over what steps he would take to ensure voting access in the heavily damaged southwest part of the state, which has leaned conservative in recent elections. The Republican governor, who is up for reelection, has made tightening election laws a top priority over the past two years as he and others in the GOP reacted to ex-President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An Atlanta-area sheriff stands accused of punishing detainees by having them strapped into a restraint chair for hours even though they posed no threat and obeyed instructions. Now a jury must decide whether he violated the men’s civil rights. A federal grand jury in April 2021 indicted Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill, saying he violated the civil rights of four people in his custody. Three more alleged victims were added in subsequent indictments. Prosecutors say placing the seven men in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment, and caused pain and bodily injury. Jury selection was set to begin Wednesday, and the trial is expected to last at least two weeks. Hill calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery on social media and in campaign ads. He has been a divisive figure – attracting both fans and critics – since he first became sheriff in 2005. This will be his second trial on criminal charges. The voters of Clayton County returned him to office in 2012 while he was under indictment, accused of using his office for personal gain – charges he ultimately beat. Hill and his lawyers have said his prosecution is baseless and politically motivated.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An Oahu project aimed at at-risk youth has won a $20 million grant in a global challenge from the Kellogg Foundation, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Multiple nonprofit agencies running out of the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center will receive the money over the next eight years, providing services surrounding a juvenile correctional site, according to the outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant designed to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste that has had numerous setbacks will likely start operating in early December, a U.S. Department of Energy official said Wednesday. Connie Flohr, manager of the Idaho Cleanup Project for the Energy Department’s Office of Environmental Management, told state officials the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory has successfully completed test runs with a simulant material. “We have every confidence that we will be operating in December,” she told members of the Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission during an online meeting. The commission makes recommendations to the governor regarding policies to support the viability and mission of the Idaho National Laboratory and other nuclear industries in the state. Commission members, appointed by the governor, include state lawmakers, local government elected officials, university officials and others. The lab, one of 17 Energy Department national labs, is the nation’s top advanced nuclear energy research lab and one of the state’s largest employers with about 5,000 workers. It’s a huge economic driver in the state, especially in eastern Idaho, bringing in millions of federal research dollars.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Seven months after it purchased a former Pillsbury Mills plant, the nonprofit group responsible for clearing the property provided a first look at progress made on the site Wednesday prior to a public meeting. Chris Richmond, president of Moving Pillsbury Forward and a former Springfield fire marshal, hosted the tour of the vacant site, showing off a series of buildings deemed safe for showcasing to small groups. Richmond displayed several artifacts found during cleanup of the property conducted over the summer, including tools, a map of the property from 1966, handmade grain scoops and chairs, and an old Pillsbury’s Best flour sack. “The wrenches are the kind you would have seen pre-World War II,” Richmond said. “I’m sure these are 75 years or older.” Richmond and his organization completed their purchase of the property in March, with environmental testing and cleanup of the site being conducted throughout the summer. The property was home to a thriving grain and flour plant that had thousands of employees at its peak in the 1950s before a significant decline. When Pillsbury sold the plant to Cargill in 1991, about 350 workers were there, with 200 of them being transferred to Tennessee as part of a company restructuring.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday that prevents the state from enforcing a Republican-backed abortion ban while it considers whether the ban violates the state constitution. The court said in the order that it was taking over appeals of a judge’s decision last month that blocked the law a week after it took effect. It denied a request from the state attorney general’s office to set aside the preliminary injunction and scheduled a hearing on the lawsuit filed by abortion clinic operators for Jan. 12. Owen County Judge Kelsey Hanlon blocked the law from being enforced, writing that “there is reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution” and that the clinics will prevail in the lawsuit. The ban was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug. 5 and signed by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb. That made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June. The five-member Indiana Supreme Court – all the justices were appointed by Republican governors – did not explain its decision. The order, signed by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, said “a majority” of the court agreed with its provisions but gave no further details.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Domestic violence deaths in the state are on the decline this year after spikes in 2020 and 2021. Between January and August, 12 people were killed in domestic violence incidents, the Iowa Attorney General’s Office announced. That compares to 17 deaths over the same period in 2021. Iowa had seen a spike in domestic violence fatalities over the prior two years, according to figures collected by the attorney general’s office. There were 17 deaths in all of 2020 – at that time the most Iowa had seen in a decade. More violent still was 2021, with 20 deaths in total. The deadliest year on record since 1995 was 2006, with 22 killings. State officials have attributed the 2020 and 2021 increases to the stresses on families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the Attorney General’s Crime Victim Assistance Division, noted that people in unsafe relationships had fewer options to cope with them under lockdown conditions. “Some victims can’t leave their homes, and services haven’t been as accessible,” Tibbetts Murphy said in a news release. “These issues have limited the ability to serve victims. And sadly, research has shown when services are limited, we see a rise in domestic violence homicides.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Alex Red Corn was dining out with his children one day in Salina when a bus full of student-athletes from Liberal High School pulled up and showed his children the kind of discrimination that still exists in dozens of Kansas high schools. “I was sitting at an Applebee’s, and the Liberal Redskins came into town,” he said. “A whole bus full of Liberal Redskins-themed stuff was surrounding us at the restaurant, and my kids were there, and there was a level of discomfort there.” But that’s a daily reality for the estimated 10,000 Kansas students who are Native American and either attend or are in the same athletic leagues of schools with disparaging, racist Native American imagery, said Red Corn, an assistant professor of educational leadership at Kansas State University and a member of the Osage Nation. Months after the Kansas State Board of Education helped organize a committee to address severe deficiencies in the education of and for Native American people, the group returned Tuesday with an initial proposal to have the state board formally recommend all Kansas high schools remove any Native American-themed mascot and imagery. The board had helped create the group after Education Commissioner Randy Watson made disparaging comments toward Native Americans in February.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Startup bourbon producer Jackson Purchase Distillery is boosting its investment. The company will increase its distilling operation investment in Fulton County in western Kentucky to nearly $26 million and create 54 full-time jobs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Jackson Purchase’s project has grown from an initially planned investment of $8.76 million and 30 jobs. Last year, the company’s management group acquired an unused distilling facility, the governor’s office said in a news release. To bolster the nearly complete distillery, company leaders began an expansion that will involve purchasing additional land, constructing barrel storage and making upgrades throughout the facility. “Kentucky’s bourbon and spirits industry continues to see tremendous growth,” Beshear said. “This is not possible without the support of companies like Jackson Purchase Distillery, which is tripling its original investment in this project and creating nearly double the number of quality jobs.” The distillery will produce in excess of 60,000 barrels annually once fully operational.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Transparency in reporting incidents of violence and other problems at the city’s long-troubled jail has improved recently, but only slightly, a federal judge told sheriff’s office officials Wednesday. U.S. District Magistrate Judge Michael North held a status conference on efforts to bring the Orleans Justice Center into compliance with mandated reforms. Those measures are required under a 2013 court-backed agreement involving the U.S. Justice Department, inmate advocates and the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. North applauded the improvements, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports, but he warned Sheriff Susan Hutson that her administration still has a way to go in terms of transparency. North said the sheriff’s office has started sending the court weekly reports about jail incidents, including acts of violence, overdoses and suicide attempts. But he said more needs to be done. “We still have no information as to what’s being done to investigate these problems and why they continue to happen,” North said shortly before ordering the sheriff’s office to submit a proposal to the court for how it will share information about its investigations and prevention plans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A former Navy SEAL who’s seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree apologized for comparing federal fisheries regulators to rapists, saying the statement was “over the top.” Republican Ed Thelander was called out during a debate Wednesday evening for remarks he made earlier in the day attacking the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during a rally for Maine’s lobster industry. “NOAA wants to rape you and your family, and they are saying pick a child,” he said. “You don’t negotiate with a rapist, and that’s what’s happening.” Pingree said during the debate that Thelander’s comments were not productive and dragged the discussion “down into the gutter.” “My comments were over the top, and I apologize for that,” Thelander said. “I’m very passionate about it. I love those families. I’m seeing the struggles they have, and nothing has been done about it.” Pingree, who lives in an island community on North Haven, disputed Thelander’s claim that nothing was being done as Maine officials fight regulations aimed at protecting right whales that could harm lobstermen. “Don’t say I’m not passionate about it,” she said. The debate in Maine’s 1st Congressional District touched on immigration, the economy, energy, abortion, education and other topics.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An appeals court refused Wednesday to intervene in a lower court’s decision to free a man who served more than 20 years in prison for the killing of a high school student, a case chronicled by the groundbreaking “Serial” podcast. The state Court of Special Appeals issued its order a day after prosecutors dropped charges against Adnan Syed in the 1999 killing of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee, saying DNA evidence excluded him as a suspect. Circuit Court Judge Melissa Phinn ruled last month that the state had violated its legal obligation to share evidence that could have bolstered Syed’s defense. Phinn ordered Syed’s release from prison and gave prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to retry him or drop the charges. Lee’s family asked the Court of Special Appeals – Maryland’s intermediate appellate court – to halt the case and suspend the deadline that Phinn set for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges. They argued they didn’t get adequate notice of the hearing at which Phinn ruled. A lawyer for Lee’s family said they wanted the judge to hold another hearing they could attend and address the court. But a three-judge panel from the appeals court rejected the family’s request in a two-page order. The panel gave Lee’s family 15 days to argue why their appeal isn’t moot given that the case against Syed has been dropped.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston Common, America’s oldest public park, is getting a multimillion-dollar makeover that includes an expanded visitors’ center, more restrooms, additional sports facilities, and even a sit-down restaurant at the famed Frog Pond, city officials announced Wednesday. The goal is to make the 50-acre swath of green space in the heart of the city more welcoming, convenient, fun and accessible for both city residents and tourists. “Boston Common’s gorgeous tree-lined paths and open spaces have hosted so many moments marked in history, from shaping our collective conscience to celebrating our communities,” Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. “We’re excited to be sharing a plan that honors the Common’s history, reflects the community’s vision, and creates a space that will be more accessible, more resilient, and more inclusive for generations to come.” The Common was founded in 1634 and draws millions of people per year. It has been used as a place for public executions, as a pasture, and as a military training field, according to the nonprofit group Friends of the Public Garden, which helped develop the Boston Common Master Plan. More recently it has hosted civil rights marches, Vietnam War protests and a 1979 Catholic Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II and attended by an estimated 400,000 people during a soaking rainstorm. It was also the site of huge protests in 2020 against police brutality.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors raised concerns Wednesday about a female juror who apparently has been smiling at one of three men on trial in connection with a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. Judge Thomas Wilson said he, too, noticed it and pledged to pay “close attention” to the juror. He said the expressions didn’t appear to be a reaction to testimony. “She is in my direct view,” Wilson said. “So I am often looking right at her while I’m listening to the witness testify. … I’ve seen smiles come out of her face. Not great big smiles but more of a small smirk.” The juror has been looking at Paul Bellar, 24, who was a member of a paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen. Bellar, Joe Morrison and Pete Musico are charged in state court with providing material support for a terrorist act. The trial has lasted eight days so far. “Since the start of the trial – and we’re prepared to offer sworn testimony on this from two different witnesses – there’s been nonverbal communication” between a juror and Bellar, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Rollstin. He suggested that Bellar sent a signal Wednesday by clenching his fists and shaking them in an “affirmative way.” But Bellar’s attorney, Andrew Kirkpatrick, said that was a misinterpretation: Bellar was excited because the lawyer offered him Skittles candy for his birthday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing fraudulent insurance claims for a staged arson he attempted to portray as a politically motivated attack. Federal officials said Denis Molla, 30, of Brooklyn Center, falsely reported to law enforcement in September 2020 that someone had lit his camper on fire and that three unknown males were near his home when he heard an explosion. Molla told officials his garage door was vandalized with a spray-painted Antifa symbol and the words “Biden 2020” and “BLM.” He claimed his camper was targeted because it displayed a Trump 2020 flag. Police discovered that Molla started his own property on fire and spray-painted the graffiti on his own garage. He then submitted multiple insurance claims seeking coverage for the damage to his garage, camper, vehicles and residence caused by the fire, court documents show. Molla also created and allowed others to start two GoFundMe accounts to benefit Molla and his family. In total, he submitted more than $300,000 in fraudulent insurance claims, of which he received approximately $61,000 from his insurance company. Molla also received more than $17,000 from individual donors via GoFundMe. He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Some legislators say they will renew efforts to clarify that people in Mississippi may possess chemical strips to detect traces of the deadly drug fentanyl. A bill to decriminalize the test strips died early this year. But the state House Drug Policy Committee chairman, Rep. Lee Yancy, R-Brandon, now supports the effort, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, said he’ll introduce a bill during the legislative session that begins in January. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more lethal than heroin, has pushed drug overdoses to new highs across America. Delivering test strips to people is part of a strategy known as “harm reduction” that gives appropriate products to drug users to prevent accidental overdoses. If someone is about to take an illicit drug, they brush part of the substance against a test strip to see if it contains trace amounts of fentanyl. Opponents say the strategy encourages drug users to continue an addiction, but health professionals who testified at a legislative committee meeting Monday said it’s a useful mitigation strategy that can save lives. Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said he wants people who use drugs to seek professional help to end their addiction, but they need “harm reduction” tools in the short term. “The test strips are not going to encourage people to use drugs,” Edney said. “Those who are going to use drugs are going to continue to use drugs, anyway.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri is offering free vasectomies to uninsured patients in Springfield on Nov. 4 and in Joplin on Nov. 5. Vasectomy appointments will be offered from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. To be eligible, patients must complete a pre-screening exam by Nov. 3. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, leading Missouri to ban abortions, PPSLR saw demand for male sterilization procedures increase. “Since the Dobbs decision, we have seen an increasing number of male-bodied people coming and requesting this service,” Dr. Margaret Baum said. “We performed 142 vasectomies in 2021; already this year we’ve done close to 200 in 2022, and the year’s not out yet.” Baum said patients from across the state have been traveling to the clinic in St. Louis. In May, she began to provide vasectomies at the Springfield Planned Parenthood health center. Baum performs female sterilization procedures as well. “It’s just really important that these services are offered without judgement, without stigma, so that people who are informed about the procedure can make a good decision and decide if it’s the right thing for them, their relationship and their family,” Baum said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The commission that oversees the Montana State Library voted Wednesday to accept a new logo with colors pulled from the state flag after one commissioner criticized an earlier color scheme as reminding her of a rainbow LGBTQ pride flag. Commissioners voted 4-2 to approve the new logo but also decided to pause spending any additional money on the rebranding rollout until December, when they can consider additional information about how that money would be spent. The commission had voted 4-3 in early July to reject the initial logo after the library paid a company $130,000 in donated library foundation funds to create it as part of a rebranding effort to educate residents about the services the state library provides. Commissioner Tammy Hall said in June that the original colors brought to mind a pride flag, something she argued could set up an unnecessary political battle as the library seeks funding from the likely Republican-controlled Legislature next year. Commissioners agreed last month to consider a new color scheme. The predominantly blue logo is shaped like a hexagon and is meant to look like information is coming in through a prism and being reflected out as knowledge in four colored triangles. The rejected logo had triangles colored an orange-red, yellow, medium green and bright blue. The new logo has triangles colored red, bright yellow, yellow-green and a more muted blue – all pulled from the state seal on the Montana flag.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Average ACT scores for this year’s high school graduates across the state hit their lowest point in decades, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The mean composite score on the college entrance exam for seniors in the class of 2022 was just 19.8, dropping below 20 – the maximum score is 36 – for the first time since 1991, according to the newspaper. Nebraska education officials said a downward trend in scores began five years ago, meaning it can’t be chalked up solely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Less than a month before Election Day, 14 members of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt’s family sent a letter endorsing his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. “We staunchly believe that Catherine is well equipped with her own ‘Nevada grit’ – a quality that she will take forward in representation of our home state for six more years across the halls of Congress,” the letter said. First obtained by The Nevada Independent, the letter does not mention Laxalt by name. Instead, it talks of Cortez Masto’s understanding of “the daily realities of dogged hard work” and mentions her experience in public education as well as her commitment to law enforcement. The family members also wrote that Cortez Masto’s career demonstrates she is “an authentic advocate of Nevada.” It marks the second time that some of Laxalt’s family has endorsed his opponent. During his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2018, a dozen family members endorsed Democrat Steve Sisolak in an op-ed to the Reno Gazette-Journal. That letter more explicitly criticized Laxalt, saying he “leveraged and exploited” the family name throughout his campaign.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: The state Department of Environmental Services issued an immediate boil-water order Wednesday for customers of the Rye Water District after samples detected E. coli bacteria. The department wrote in its advisory Wednesday: “All consumers are being notified by the system and DES staff is working with the system to resolve the situation.” The Rye Water District was beginning the process of notifying district customers Wednesday afternoon. District superintendent Arik Jones noted that the district had yet to determine ways to assist affected users, such as by providing them with bottled water. Rye residents are distributed water by three purveyors, according to Jones: the Rye Water District, the city of Portsmouth and the Aquarion Water Company. The Department of Environmental Services’ boil order affects Rye Water District customers living in town only, he said. “This does not affect Aquarion customers,” Jones said. “It does not affect anybody served by Portsmouth.” The Rye Water District services roughly 1,600 connections and about 4,000 total customers. Jones said the boil-water advisory does not include Greenland residents, whom the district serves using Portsmouth water.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Lawmakers unveiled new legislation Thursday to rewrite the state’s firearm carry laws after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights. Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Senate President Nicholas Scutari, surrounded by other lawmakers and red T-shirt-clad Moms Demand Action supporters, said the new measure will bar permit holders from carrying in schools, polling places, bars, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, airports, casinos and child care facilities. It also sets up a new requirement that permit holders carry insurance to protect against accidental discharge, coverage that Scutari said is already available in insurance marketplaces. The bill increases permitting, though the exact amount wasn’t immediately clear. The funds will be put toward compensation for crime victims under the legislation. The measure also calls for permit holders to undergo gun safety training and would set up a vetting process that requires non-family references to vouch for applicants. It would disqualify applicants with past violations of restraining orders and other “character of temperament” concerns, though just how those issues would be defined wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expert in the field of Indigenous art has been named as the executive director of the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture. Pollyanna “Polly” Nordstrand, who is Hopi, will take on her new role next month. She will oversee a team of curators, anthropologists and archaeologists who are responsible for the preservation and interpretation of objects and works of art that represent Native people from the American Southwest and northern Mexico. “It is an exciting time to step into this leadership position as MIAC envisions its place as a 21st century museum with new exhibitions and expanded partnerships with tribal communities,” she said in a statement. Nordstrand, selected following a national search, is coming from Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, where she was its first curator of Native American art. In New Mexico, she’ll manage an anthropology library and archives as well as the Center for New Mexico Archaeology, the state’s archaeological repository. Nordstrand began working in the museum world around 1990 as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act came into effect. She said her approach to museums has been shaped by the increasing collaboration between tribes and institutions, and she has advocated for more equity and inclusion in museums.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the state to continue enforcing its new gun law as it considers a lower court ruling that would block key provisions. The decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came six days after a federal district judge in Syracuse declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional and placed a temporary hold on them. The state promptly appealed the order. The decision puts a hold on U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby’s order until a three-judge appeals panel can make a decision on the state’s motion. Suddaby on Thursday put a hold on several of the state’s new licensing rules for carrying handguns in public, including one that made applicants turn over information about their social media accounts. The judge also chipped away at the list of “sensitive” locations where people cannot carry guns. He said the state couldn’t ban people from carrying guns in New York City’s subway system or Times Square. Attorney General Letitia James said she was pleased the law would stay in effect. “My office will continue our efforts to protect the safety of everyday New Yorkers and defend our common-sense gun laws,” she said in a release.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Two history-making Black politicians and country music star Eric Church were among the six latest recipients of the state’s highest civilian honor announced Thursday. On Nov. 15, Gov. Roy Cooper will present the North Carolina Awards, which were created over 60 years ago to recognize significant contributions to the state and the country in several fields. Church, a native of Granite Falls, has received many Grammy nominations, among other industry awards. Other new recipients include U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton, of Warren County, who was the first African American woman to represent North Carolina in Congress when she took office in 1992. She was also the state’s first Black representative since 1901. Former lawmaker Mickey Michaux of Durham served in the Legislature for more than 45 years, almost all of that time in the House, where he served as the chief budget writer in the late 2000s. He was appointed a U.S. attorney in 1977, becoming the first African American in such a role in the South since Reconstruction, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Other recipients are Dr. Priya S. Kishnani, a professor and researcher at the Duke University School of Medicine; Stanley Riggs, a longtime East Carolina University marine geologist and expert on the coast and climate change; and journalist David Zucchino, a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill who received a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for his book on the 1898 overthrow of Wilmington’s government by white supremacists.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: More than 1,000 pounds of homemade explosive materials have been recovered in a residence in northwestern North Dakota, authorities said Wednesday. Police said multiple chemicals and powders were also found in the apartment in Williston, located in the North Dakota oil patch near the Montana border. No arrests have been made, although police say they have identified a person of interest. Bomb squads from Williston, Minot and Bismarck were disposing of the explosive materials at the Williston landfill. The process was suspended Wednesday afternoon due to high winds and fire danger. Police said explosions could be heard in some parts of the city as the devices were detonated.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which a probate judge rejected a transgender woman’s request to correct her birth certificate, leading to a split in court rulings and guidance on the issue. Attorneys for the Clark County woman argue the judge’s ruling, upheld by the 2nd Ohio District Court of Appeals, runs counter to a federal court decision, an Ohio Department of Health certificate change process, a Supreme Court probate form allowing for gender corrections, and procedures in more than a dozen other Ohio probate courts. The Clark County judge improperly ruled that nothing in state law gives probate judges authority to correct gender on a birth certificate unless it was originally made in error, according to an Aug. 1 court filing by the woman’s attorneys asking the high court to hear the case. The attorneys also noted that the state Health Department updated its process to allow for birth certificate corrections after a federal court in 2020 found unconstitutional Ohio’s rule prohibiting changes to gender on birth certificates. In addition, the state Supreme Court issued a form in August 2021 allowing probate courts to correct gender under state law, the attorneys said. The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 Tuesday to accept the Clark County case.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A district attorney debate took a bizarre turn Tuesday when the Republican candidate accused his Democratic opponent of being complicit in the disappearance and possible murder of two people. Kevin Calvey, an Oklahoma County commissioner, made the accusation toward the end of the hourlong livestreamed event. “Two Oklahomans are missing and may have been murdered because Vicki Behenna was willing to submit fake documents to a federal court to get her crooked client out of prison,” Calvey said to audible gasps in the auditorium. Behenna, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, denied the accusation. “It doesn’t surprise me that Mr. Calvey would make these statements,” Behenna said. “He is a career politician who has created a false narrative for his own political gain. This is something politicians do. This is not something a district attorney does.” Earlier in the debate, the two clashed over who is to blame for the problems at the aging Oklahoma County jail and the prosecution of police officers for fatal shootings. Both questioned each other’s integrity and fitness for the job throughout what was their only scheduled debate. They agreed that the death penalty should be rarely sought and that possession of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Voters in at least four counties – Douglas, Klamath, Lane and Columbia – have complained to local election officials about people knocking on their doors, questioning residents and looking for evidence of 2020 voter fraud. Klamath County Clerk Rochelle Long issued a statement last month after residents called her office asking if the group was from the elections office, KGW reports. “I wanted to make it clear they were not from our office,” Long said. “We don’t go door to door. We don’t ask you how you voted.” Long warned that people may seem official and identify as from an integrity group. Long couldn’t point to any one person or group responsible for the effort. Election officials across the country have received similar complaints about people going door to door hunting for proof the 2020 election was fraudulent. While ex-President Donald Trump continues to argue the election was stolen, a mountain of evidence shows otherwise. “What these folks are doing is simply out trying to gather data in an unofficial way, and then unfortunately we’re seeing people misusing that data to try and spread the big lie,” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said. “The election in 2020 was safe and secure in all 50 states.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Two supporters of then-President Donald Trump arrested after driving a Hummer with guns and ammunition to a site where votes were being counted in November 2020 were convicted of weapons charges Wednesday but acquitted of election interference. Prosecutors argued that Vets for Trump co-founder Joshua Macias and co-defendant Antonio LaMotta, both of Virginia, planned a mass shooting in Philadelphia as the outcome of the presidential election remained uncertain. However, Common Pleas Court Judge Lucretia Clemons rejected that theory, finding the men guilty only of bringing weapons to the city without a permit Nov. 5, 2020. LaMotta is separately charged with federal misdemeanor offenses stemming from his alleged illegal entry of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Both men remain free on bail pending a scheduled sentencing in December, when they face a possible sentence of probation to 18 months in jail, defense lawyer William J. Brennan said. “The commonwealth has presented no evidence to show that they came here to interfere with an election,” Brennan, who represents Macias, said after the one-day nonjury trial. “They came, they stared at a building, they talked to some police officers, and they didn’t bother anybody.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island police departments are poised to spend $16million in state and federal grants to equip police officers with body cameras and cover the costs of managing and operating the equipment. The architects of the Statewide Body-Worn Camera Program announced the grant awards to 42 police organizations Wednesday as Rhode Island moved closer to a deployment of 1,773 cameras – roughly a camera for every front-line police officer, according to Attorney General Peter Neronha. “That is a lot of law-enforcement officers (who) will now have the tools to bring us into the century in which we are operating,” Neronha said. State police Col. Darnell Weaver described the grant announcements as a culminating moment after months of coordination and planning work by police leaders and their agencies. “Cameras will add transparency, provide accountability and give a point of view, of perspective, to every police contact,” he said. The grant money was apportioned to finance the program for five years. The awarding of the money carries significance beyond finances. Police organizations that receive the money must comply with a detailed set of regulations on the use and operation of body cameras.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison over comments she made to police during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020 will not receive a lesser sentence, a judge has ruled. A jury this spring found Brittany Martin, 34, of Sumter, guilty of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner. Martin’s attorneys pushed for the sentence to be reconsidered and expressed concern about her pregnancy and health. Racial justice groups also got involved. In an Oct. 5 order, Judge R. Kirk Griffin pointed to Martin’s prior criminal convictions that he said contributed to her original sentence. In November 2020, an Iowa judge sentenced Martin to probation for leaving the scene of an injury and willfully causing bodily harm after her teenage son accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away. Griffin also noted previous convictions across multiple states for shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Sumter County Assistant Solicitor Bronwyn McElveen said in a September filing that Martin has been on probation at least six times. “Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,” Griffin wrote in his order. “An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday authorized its staff to begin reviewing an application for a pipeline designed to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol refineries to an underground site in Illinois, assessing a filing fee of up to $400,000. The pipeline is the second proposed in the state. Both projects would pump carbon dioxide to sequestration sites where it would be buried thousands of feet underground. The one before the Public Utilities Commission – proposed by Navigator CO2 – would connect ethanol refineries across the Great Plains to a site in Illinois. The commission’s staff found that it could cost over $270,000 to review Navigator CO2’s application, which was submitted last month. Navigator CO2 agreed to covering a filing fee of up to $400,000. “It needs to be a quality evaluation and not have that cost fall back on the taxpayers,” said Kristen Edwards, a staff attorney for the commission. The pipeline projects, spurred by federal tax credits, promise to help in the fight against climate change by storing carbon dioxide rather than letting it be emitted into the atmosphere. But environmental activists have also pointed out the technology has struggled to get off the ground and allows emission-heavy industries to avoid taking drastic steps to cut greenhouse gases.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett has taken a plea deal after he was charged with driving under the influence after leaving a bar in June. In a statement, Hargett said he offered a best interest plea in the case Thursday, which amounts to pleading guilty while maintaining innocence. The Republican said his attorney believes he had a “strong case” to argue, but Hargett said he wanted to “accept responsibility for my actions and move forward and to focus on how God can use me to make something positive from this difficult time.” “It is wrong to drive any vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and rest assured this is a mistake I will never make again,” he said. The plea deal includes a $350 fine, a DUI school requirement, and having his driver’s license restricted for a year, news outlets reports. According to a report by a Tullahoma Police Department officer, an officer on June 18 pulled over the car Hargett was driving after watching it leave a bar and swerve over lane markings several times. The officer wrote that Hargett smelled like an “intoxicant,” had glassy eyes and kept saying, “Yes, sir,” at inappropriate times when he had not been asked a question. Hargett performed poorly on a field sobriety test, and a passenger in the car – who was not named – said the two had been drinking four hours earlier, the report said. Hargett agreed to a blood sample. Hargett has said he had been at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: Prosecutors asked a jury Wednesday to sentence a woman to death for killing a pregnant woman and stealing her unborn daughter from her womb. The appeal came as the penalty phase of Taylor Parker’s capital murder trial began for the October 2020 murder of Reagan Simmons-Hancock and theft of her unborn baby. The Bowie County jury previously found Parker guilty of capital murder. Prosecutor Kelley Crisp told jurors that the evidence would show Parker, 29, faked a pregnancy and repeatedly lied before killing Simmons-Hancock, 21, at the woman’s New Boston home Oct. 9, 2020, to get the infant she claimed to have been carrying. The baby also died. Parker’s attorneys hope to persuade the jury to spare Parker’s life and let her serve life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defense attorney Jeff Harrelson said they would show that Parker was mentally ill.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The two candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens in a suburban congressional race laid into the first-term Republican on Wednesday evening for announcing at the eleventh hour that he wouldn’t participate in the sole general election debate. Democrat Darlene McDonald and United Utah Party’s January Walker both accused Owens of being a coward for skipping it and cast doubt on his reasoning – that he took issue with the moderator. Owens’ absence reflects a trend emerging in politics nationwide: While running attack ads and speaking to friendly media outlets, candidates and their consultants are deciding to minimize debate appearances or shirk them altogether. Owens said Wednesday afternoon that he wouldn’t participate because the commission had chosen Salt Lake Tribune editor Lauren Gustus as moderator. He was outraged in April 2021 when the newspaper published an editorial cartoon satirizing remarks he made about immigration and people crossing the border illegally. The sketch likened his remarks about immigrants entering people’s neighborhoods after crossing the border to Ku Klux Klan rhetoric. The cartoon garnered pushback from Utah’s entire congressional delegation. “I will not, in good conscience, have anything to do with the racist Salt Lake Tribune,” he said in a statement published on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: A drop of blood that was subjected to modern DNA testing enabled Vermont State Police detectives to make an arrest in the 1989 murder of a Danby couple found stabbed to death in their home, police said. Michael Anthony Louise, 79, was arrested Thursday in Syracuse, New York, on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73, police said. The Peacocks were found dead Sept. 17, 1989. There were no signs of forced entry or items of significance having been removed from the house. Louise, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, police said. Detectives were unable to establish a conclusive link until forensic testing in May 2020 confirmed a DNA match to George Peacock in a spot of blood found inside Louise’s car in October 1989. The blood sample had been tested previously, but earlier tests were inconclusive. Authorities did not say why it took two years to make the arrest following the DNA match but said more information would be released when Louise is arraigned.\n\nVirginia\n\nDinwiddie: Three students and a teacher were taken to hospitals Wednesday after a fire broke out during a demonstration in a high school chemistry classroom, officials said. When the fire broke out in the classroom at Dinwiddie High School, the fire alarm was pulled, and all students were evacuated from the building, Dinwiddie County Public Schools officials said in a statement. A teacher was taken to a local hospital, and three students were taken to VCU Medical Center, officials said. Officials didn’t release details of their conditions. One student was treated at the scene and released. The cause of the fire is under investigation, officials said. Students were dismissed early, and Thursday was designated an asynchronous learning day, officials said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Poor communication, deception, bad judgment and a lack of leadership contributed to tension, violence and killings in Seattle in 2020, according to a review of the city’s response to racial injustice demonstrations that year. Seattle’s inspector general, Lisa Judge, released the 81-page review Tuesday. It focuses on 23 days in June, shortly after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to protests across the U.S., The Seattle Times reports. Earlier reports by her office looked at the Seattle Police Department’s crowd control policies and on rebuilding community trust. On June 8, 2020, police abandoned the East Precinct building in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood in an attempt to defuse tension with protesters. The demonstrators used the opportunity to declare an eight-block “cop-free” zone known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The inspector general’s office concluded the occupation revealed a dysfunctional relationship between the city administration, led by then-Mayor Jenny Durkan, and police department, led by then-Police Chief Carmen Best. It also found police brass misled the public, exaggerated dangers posed by protesters to justify leaving the precinct, and employed a racist ruse in an apparent attempt to frighten and intimidate thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Students in kindergarten through 12th grade across the state have been invited to enter the First Lady Student Ornament Competition this fall. First lady Cathy Justice is asking all students to participate in the 18th annual event. It is open to students in public and private schools as well as those who are home-schooled. Students are asked to create a “Nutcracker”-themed ornament for a tree to be displayed at the Culture Center in Charleston during the holidays, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice’s office. There will be four divisions according to grade, and a winning class will be chosen from each division. The winning ornaments will be donated in January to the West Virginia State Museum. The four winning classes will receive a gift card to help buy supplies for their class. The ornaments and Christmas tree will be unveiled in early December in conjunction with Joyful Night. Entries may be mailed to Elizabeth Yeager, Department of Arts, Culture and History, The Culture Center, 1900 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305. Include phone number, email, mailing address, teacher name, school and class. The ornaments must be received by Nov. 18.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials estimate the state’s wolf population currently stands at about 970 animals, demonstrating that a much-maligned February 2021 hunting season had little impact on the population as a whole. Wisconsin Public Radio reports Department of Natural Resources officials released their latest population estimates at a board meeting last month and said they estimate between 812 and 1,193 wolves currently roam the state, with 972 likely the best estimate. Conservationists feared that a February 2021 hunting season would devastate the population after hunters killed 218 wolves in just three days, about 100 more wolves than the DNR allowed. Conservationists and wolf lovers called the hunt a slaughter. But the new numbers indicate the season had little effect on the population, which stood at roughly 1,100 wolves before the hunt began. The DNR planned to hold another hunt in November 2021, but a Dane County judge placed that season on hold in October 2021. A federal judge this past February restored protections for gray wolves across most of the country, preventing states from holding wolf hunts. Wisconsin’s current wolf management plan, which dates back to 1999, calls for capping the population at 350 wolves. The DNR is working to update the plan but hasn’t released anything yet.\n\nWyoming\n\nGreen River: A new soda ash mining operation is planned near an existing site outside the city, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. A subsidiary of the Ciner Group, based in Turkey, plans its new Project West development not far from the Pacific Soda mine and said it expected to bring in up to 2,000 temporary jobs during construction, with 300 permanent positions once the mine is operational, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nNASA has set a date for another attempt at launching its Artemis I mission, after Hurricane Ian forced the space agency to roll back its massive rocket into its hangar at Kennedy Space Center in Florida late last month.\n\nThe 69-minute launch window for the Space Launch System or SLS, will open at 12.07 a.m. ET on Monday, November 14, NASA said Wednesday.\n\nIf the launch is successful, the 322-feet tall rocket will send the uncrewed Orion spacecraft around the moon and back to earth to test its systems. The mission is expected to last 25 days with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean Friday, December 9.\n\nThe space agency said “minimal work” was required to prepare the rocket and Orion spacecraft for roll out to the launch pad, a slow, 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) journey that could take place as early as Friday, November 4.\n\nThe overall goal of NASA’s Artemis program is to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century. And the Artemis I mission — which is expected to be the first of many — will lay the initial groundwork, testing the rocket and spacecraft and all its subsystems to ensure it’s safe enough for astronauts to fly.\n\nBut getting this first mission off the ground has proven to be a trying endeavor. Technical issues thwarted the first two attempts, while Hurricane Ian scuppered the third try.\n\nNASA said it had requested back-up two-hour launch windows for Wednesday, November 16, at 1:04 a.m. and Saturday, November 19, at 1:45 a.m.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/tech/nasa-artemis-launch-delay-recap-scn/index.html", "title": "Here's why it's taking NASA so long to attempt another Artemis I launch", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nNASA’s massive new moon rocket hit another snag during its latest attempt to launch an uncrewed test mission, and it will be at least a few weeks — rather than days — before the rocket can make its next attempt.\n\nThe longer delay can be attributed to several factors, including quirks of scheduling, possible traffic at the launch site, and NASA’s desire to make sure it’s solved the latest issues with leaky fuel.\n\nTo recap what went down on Saturday, September 3: Launch officials went confidently into this weekend’s attempt to launch the rocket, called the Space Launch System or SLS. But then, as the rocket was once again being loaded with super-cold liquid hydrogen propellant, it sprung a big leak. And NASA said Tuesday that it will begin to attempt to correct those issues while the rocket is still on the launch pad.\n\nBut, eventually, the space agency will still need to roll the rocket back to the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building, a 4.2-mile trip that takes roughly 10 hours, in order to “reset the system’s batteries,” according to a Tuesday blog post from NASA.\n\nAnd when it comes to setting a new launch date, timing will be complicated.\n\nTiming can be everything\n\nOn a given day, there are specific spans of time — or “launch windows” — set aside when the rocket is permitted to launch, and they can range from about a half hour to a few hours per day. But even those windows aren’t available every day. There are also “launch periods,” which are spans of days when the moon lines up with the Earth in a way that’s favorable for this mission.\n\nThe latest launch period ended on Tuesday, September 6, and NASA had said there was no way the SLS would be ready to fly during that time.\n\nThe next launch period runs from September 19 to October 4. But there’s another potential issue: NASA is planning to launch its Crew-5 mission, which will carry a fresh crew of astronauts to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX rocket, on October 3. And NASA will have to work to make sure that one launch won’t conflict with another.\n\nLater in October, yet another launch period will begin, running from October 17 to October 31. That period will offer up 11 possible launch windows for the SLS. (Note: there are no available launch times on October 24, 25, 26 and 28.)\n\nExactly which period and window NASA targets will depend on a variety of factors, including how well it can coordinate with SpaceX regarding the Crew-5 launch and how long the SLS rocket remains on the launch pad as engineers work through the leak issue, according to Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration systems development.\n\nSuper-cool fuel\n\nWhen the SLS rocket is fueled up, it requires massive amounts of super-chilled liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to be pumped into the rocket’s tanks. When loading the hydrogen, the fuel begins pumping in slowly but then ramps up its speed in what’s called a “fast fill.” And it was during that fast fill that a “large leak” occurred — bigger even than the leaks that NASA identified during the August 29 launch attempt.\n\nThat’s why launch officials want to make sure they pin down a fix and the root of the issue before making the next attempt. As of Saturday, one guess was that an issue with a valve may have caused the hydrogen to be overpressurized, putting it under 60 pounds per square inch of pressure rather than the 20 pounds per square inch they’d hoped, Michael Sarafin, Artemis Mission Manager, said Saturday.\n\nLeading up to Saturday, NASA had also tried to troubleshoot several issues it encountered during the first attempt to launch the SLS rocket on August 29. It addressed some leaks that occurred during fueling, and assessed the risks on an issue with an engine cooling system and a crack in some foam coating one of the rocket’s tanks.\n\nNASA may choose to take another peek at those issues as it works toward the next launch attempt as well.\n\nFurther complicating the selection of the next target launch date is the precarious Florida weather. For any rocket launch, rough winds, lightning or other unfavorable conditions can force more delays. Late summer and early autumn can also bring hurricanes to the Florida coastline where the SLS sits.\n\nNASA is working through the possibilities, and the public can expect more answers in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThis is rocket science\n\nAs NASA officials have said before, they’re hoping to convey that these delays and technical issues don’t necessarily point to a significant issue with the rocket.\n\nBefore the SLS, NASA’s Space Shuttle program, which flew for 20 years, endured frequent scrubbed launches. SpaceX’s Falcon rockets also have a history of scrubs for mechanical or technical issues.\n\nThis is, after all, rocket science.\n\n“I can tell you that these teams know exactly what they’re doing, and I’m very proud of them,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Saturday. “We tried to stress that this is a test and a test has certain risk, and we pounded that in every public comment that we had in order to get expectations in alignment with reality.”\n\nFree, the NASA associate administrator, added that his team will always go into a launch attempt optimistic that liftoff will occur.\n\n“I’m sure there’s going to be a question of, ‘Are we confident?’” he said. “I actually love that question because it’s like (asking), ‘Are you confident you were going to get out of bed this morning?”\n\nThis mission, called Artemis I, is expected to pave the way for numerous other missions to the moon. The Artemis II mission, slated for as early as next year, is expected to follow a similar flight path around the moon but will have crew on board. And later this decade, Artemis III is expected to land astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time since NASA’s mid-20th century Apollo program.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/world/nasa-artemis-1-saturday-launch-scn/index.html", "title": "Artemis I's next launch attempt may not happen until later this year ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nKennedy Space Center, Florida CNN —\n\nNASA will not pursue a launch of Artemis I for the remainder of the launch period, which ends on Tuesday, according to an update from the agency after a second scrubbed launch attempt Saturday.\n\nFuture launch periods, including those in September and October, depend on what the team decides early next week, but this results in a minimum of delays consisting of at least several weeks.\n\n“We will not be launching in this launch period,” said Jim Free, associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. “We are not where we wanted to be.”\n\nFree said the stack, including the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, has to roll back into the Vehicle Assembly Building, unless they get a waiver from the range, which is run by the US Space Force.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson reminded that the shuttle was sent back to the Vehicle Assembly Building 20 times before it launched – and noted that the cost of two scrubs is a lot less than a failure.\n\n“We do not launch until we think it’s right,” Nelson said. “These teams have labored over that and that is the conclusion they came to. I look at this as part of our space program, in which safety is the top of the list.”\n\nThe scrub was called at 11:17 a.m. ET, three hours before the beginning of the launch window.\n\nArtemis I had been slated to take off Saturday afternoon, but those plans were scrubbed after team members discovered a liquid hydrogen leak that they spent the better part of the morning trying to resolve. Liquid hydrogen is one of the propellants used in the rocket’s large core stage. The leak prevented the launch team from being able to fill the liquid hydrogen tank despite trying various troubleshooting procedures.\n\nPreviously, a small leak had been seen in this area, but it became a much larger leak on Saturday. The team believes an overpressurization event might have damaged the soft seal on the liquid hydrogen connection, but they will need to take a closer look.\n\n“This was not a manageable leak,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager.\n\nIt’s the second time in a week that the space agency has been forced to halt the launch countdown in the face of technical issues. The first launch attempt, on Monday, was called off after several issues arose, including with a system meant to cool the rocket’s engines ahead of liftoff and various leaks that sprung up as the rocket was being fueled.\n\nThe liquid hydrogen leak was detected Saturday at 7:15 a.m. ET in the quick disconnect cavity that feeds the rocket with hydrogen in the engine section of the core stage. It was a different leak than one that occurred ahead of the scrubbed launch on Monday.\n\nThe launch controllers warmed up the line in an attempt to get a tight seal and the flow of liquid hydrogen resumed before a leak reoccurred. They stopped the flow of liquid hydrogen and proceeded to “close the valve used to fill and drain it, then increase pressure on a ground transfer line using helium to try to reseal it,” according to NASA.\n\nThat troubleshooting plan was not successful. The team attempted the first plan again to warm up the line, but the leak reoccurred after they manually restarted the flow of liquid hydrogen.\n\nThere was a 60% chance of favorable weather conditions for the launch, according to weather officer Melody Lovin.\n\nThe Artemis I stack, which includes the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, continues to sit on Launchpad 39B at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is just the beginning of a program that will aim to return humans to the moon and eventually land crewed missions on Mars. Nelson said that the issues during the first two scrubs have not caused any delays to future Artemis program missions.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's how NASA wants to send humans back to the moon 04:10 - Source: CNN Business\n\nIn the last few days, the launch team has taken time to address issues, like hydrogen leaks, that cropped up ahead of Monday’s planned launch before it was scrubbed. The team has also completed a risk assessment of an engine conditioning issue and a foam crack that also cropped up, according to NASA officials.\n\nBoth were considered to be acceptable risks heading into the launch countdown, according to Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager.\n\nOn Monday, a sensor on one of the rocket’s four RS-25 engines, identified as engine #3, reflected that the engine could not reach the proper temperature range required for the engine to start at liftoff.\n\nThe engines need to be thermally conditioned before super-cold propellant flows through them prior to liftoff. To prevent the engines from experiencing any temperature shocks, launch controllers gradually increase the pressure of the core stage liquid hydrogen tank in the hours before launch to send a small amount of liquid hydrogen to the engines. This is known as a “bleed.”\n\nThe team has since determined it was a bad sensor providing the reading – they plan to ignore the faulty sensor moving forward, according to John Blevins, Space Launch Systems chief engineer.\n\nMission overview\n\nOnce Artemis I launches, Orion’s journey will last 37 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth – traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers).\n\nWhile the passenger list doesn’t include any humans, it does have passengers: three mannequins and a plush Snoopy toy will ride in Orion.\n\nThe crew aboard Artemis I may sound a little unusual, but they each serve a purpose. Snoopy will serve as the zero gravity indicator – meaning that he will begin to float inside the capsule once it reaches the space environment.\n\nThe mannequins, named Commander Moonikin Campos, Helga and Zohar, will measure the deep space radiation future crews could experience and test out new suit and shielding technology. A biology experiment carrying seeds, algae, fungi and yeast is also tucked inside Orion to measure how life reacts to this radiation as well.\n\nAdditional science experiments and technology demonstrations are also riding in a ring on the rocket. From there, 10 small satellites, called CubeSats, will detach and go their separate ways to collect information on the moon and the deep space environment.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment, which will capture a stream of Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander’s seat. And if you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission’s location each day.\n\nExpect to see views of Earthrise similar to what was shared for the first time during the Apollo 8 mission back in 1968, but with much better cameras and technology.\n\nThe inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of NASA space exploration that intends to land diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon – on the Artemis II and Artemis III missions, slated for 2024 and 2025 respectively – and eventually delivers crewed missions to Mars.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/03/artemis-1-launch-watch-nasa-stream/7959827001/", "title": "NASA's Artemis I: Technical issues scuttle Saturday's second launch ...", "text": "Saturday brought another launch scratch for the Artemis I mission.\n\nTechnical issues caused delays on Saturday and eventually robbed spectators in Cape Canaveral, Florida — and around the country — of something Americans haven't seen in more than 50 years: a launch to kick off a NASA program to send humans to the moon.

The dates also allow managers to ensure teams have enough rest and to replenish supplies of cryogenic propellants,” NASA shared in the blog post.\n\nNASA's Artemis I rocket sits on the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center on September 3 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Space correspondent Kristin Fisher will bring us moment-by-moment reporting from the launch, along with a team of experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Artemis I launch team is gearing up for another countdown that will begin early Saturday morning after a range of issues prevented liftoff on Monday.\n\nThe launch window opens at 2:17 p.m. ET and closes at 4:17 p.m. ET on Saturday. Currently, weather conditions are 60% favorable during the launch window, according to weather officer Melody Lovin. She doesn’t expect weather to be a “showstopper” for the launch.\n\nThe Artemis I stack, which includes the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, continues to sit on Launchpad 39B at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee of a launch on Saturday, “we’re going to try,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager, during a news conference Thursday evening. And while the launch team will assume a little more risk heading into the launch attempt, they are acceptable risks that the team is comfortable with, Sarafin said. The Artemis I mission is uncrewed.\n\nOne of the areas where the team is assuming more risk is with the conditioning of engine #3, which contributed to the scrub of Monday’s launch attempt. Another is a crack in the foam of the core stage intertank which could break apart and hit part of the solid rocket booster, but the team feels that the chances of that are very low, Sarafin said.\n\nIt’s “a marginal increase in risk,” Sarafin said, but “we are clearly ready to fly.”\n\n“We had a plan going into the August 29th launch attempt. It used the sensors to help confirm the proper thermal conditioning of the engines. We had trained that plan, and then we ran into other issues,” Sarafin said.\n\n“We were off the script in terms of the normal tanking operation, and the team did a fantastic job working through the managing of a hazardous condition. One of the worst things that you can do when you find yourself in a hazardous condition is just go even further off script.”\n\nAfter reviewing the data, the team has a plan for moving forward.\n\nWork has been completed at the launchpad to address two different hydrogen leaks that occurred Monday. The team has also completed a risk assessment of the engine conditioning issue and a foam crack that also cropped up, according to NASA officials.\n\nOn Monday, a sensor on one of the rocket’s four RS-25 engines, identified as engine #3, reflected that the engine could not reach the proper temperature range that is required for the engine to start at liftoff.\n\nThe engines need to be thermally conditioned before super-cold propellant flows through them before liftoff. To prevent the engines from experiencing any temperature shocks, the launch controllers increase the pressure of the core stage liquid hydrogen tank to send a little bit of the liquid hydrogen to the engines. This is known as a “bleed.”\n\nNow, the team has determined it was a bad sensor providing the reading.\n\n“We’ve had time to go back and look at look at the data and compare many sources of data and do some independent analysis that confirmed it’s a bad sensor,” said John Honeycutt, SLS program manager at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “We’re getting good quality propellant through the engine.”\n\nOn launch day, the team will ignore the bad sensor, said John Blevins, SLS chief engineer.\n\nThe automated launching sequencer on the rocket checks the temperature, pressure and other parameters. The bad sensor, which is not part of the sequencer, is not considered to be a flight instrument, Blevins said.\n\nThe team plans to begin the bleed earlier in the countdown than it occurred on Monday. The countdown for launch will pick up on Saturday at 4:37 a.m. ET during a planned hold. That’s when mission managers receive a weather briefing and decide if the team should proceed with loading propellant into the rocket. The bleed is expected to occur around 8 a.m. ET, said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, Artemis launch director for NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program.\n\nThere is no longer a need for a two-day countdown, like during the first launch attempt, “because many of the configurations needed for launch are already in place,” according to NASA.\n\nNASA’s live coverage will begin at 5:45 a.m. ET on their website and TV channel.\n\n“We’ve got to show up, we’ve got to be ready, and we’ve got to see what the day brings,” Sarafin said.\n\nIf the mission launches on Saturday, it wil go on a journey around the moon and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on October 11.\n\nThere is still a backup opportunity for the Artemis I mission to launch on September 5 as well.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is just the beginning of a program that will aim to return humans to the moon and eventually land crewed missions on Mars.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/tech/nasa-artemis-launch-date-update-scn/index.html", "title": "Artemis I: NASA is eyeing two dates in late September for launch ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nAstra, a startup building small rockets that launch out of rural Alaska, notched its first successful test flight on Friday night, putting a dummy satellite into orbit. The flight sent the company’s stock price on a tear — soaring more than 30% at one point after trading hours opened Monday morning.\n\nNASA is trying to work through a leaky fuel problem with the rocket, called the Space Launch System or SLS. During the last launch attempt at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, September 3, the rocket sprung a big leak as it was being fueled up with super-chilled liquid hydrogen.\n\nAnd while the rocket is still on the pad, NASA is looking to troubleshoot that issue by repairing and replacing some seals before running tests to make sure all the leaks are plugged, NASA officials said at a Thursday press conference.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how long that will take.\n\nThen, there’s the issue with certification. The US Space Force, an arm of the military, still oversees all rocket launches from the United States’ East Coast, including NASA’s Florida launch site, and that area is known as the “Eastern Range.”\n\nThe officials at the range are tasked with making sure there’s no risk to people or property with any launch attempt. And that means the Eastern Range also must give NASA the thumbs up that the rocket’s Flight Termination System — a system that will essentially destroy the rocket mid-air if it veers off course and starts heading in a populated direction — is ready to fly.\n\nThat system relies on batteries, however, that, under current rules, must be recharged at a nearby indoor facility before the newly proposed launch dates arrive.\n\nNASA is hoping to get a waiver on that rule. But it’s not yet clear when or if that request will be granted. If NASA does not get that waiver approval, the SLS rocket will have to be rolled off the pad and back into the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building, triggering more delays.\n\n“If they decide that is not the right thing to do, we obviously will support that and stand down and look for our next launch attempt,” Jim Free, associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, said at the Thursday press conference.\n\n“But we still will press with the tanking test,” he said, referring to the tests NASA plans to run to fix the hydrogen leaks while the rocket is still on the pad.\n\nThe Space Force’s Eastern Range said in a statement only that it “will review NASA’s request.” It declined to share details on timing.\n\nOn Thursday, NASA did give some insight into what it’s discovered about the leak issue, however. The space agency had already revealed that there was an “inadvertent pressurization of the hydrogen line,” putting it under 60 pounds per square inch of pressure rather than the 20 pounds per square inch they’d hoped, Michael Sarafin, Artemis Mission Manager, said Saturday.\n\nIt’s still not yet clear if that over-pressurization is what caused the leak, but NASA does know why the over-pressurization occurred in the first place — and human error was involved.\n\n“Our management team apologize to [the operator in charge of overseeing the process] because we had made some manual procedure changes between the attempt on Monday and attempt on Saturday,” Free said. “We practiced it during the week but they’d only had a couple of chances. So we didn’t as a leadership team, put our our operators in the best place we could have we rely really heavily on our credit team.”\n\nThat overpressurization is definitely something NASA wants to avoid, according to Free. NASA is looking for a “kinder and gentler, if you will, loading process.”\n\nFor now, there’s still a waiting game and a lot of “ifs” surrounding the timeline for the Artemis I launch. The ultimate goal of this project is to get the SLS rocket to orbit and deploy the Orion capsule, which is built for astronauts but will fly empty for this test mission. The capsule will go on to orbit the moon before making the 239,000 mile trek back home.\n\nThe Artemis I mission is just the beginning of a program that will aim to return humans to the moon and eventually land crewed missions on Mars.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA crucial fueling test for the Artemis I mega moon rocket has met all objectives, despite experiencing some challenges Wednesday, a NASA official said. The test results will determine when the mission launches on a journey around the moon and back.\n\n“All of the objectives that we set out to do we were able to accomplish today,” said Charlie-Blackwell Thompson, launch director for NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nThe Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft are in a safe configuration and continue to sit on the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nNASA engineers detected a liquid hydrogen leak during Wednesday’s test that had “the same signature” as a leak that prevented the September 3 launch attempt. However, their troubleshooting efforts appeared to allow the team to manage the leak. Afterward, they “did not see the same leak signature, which was wonderful,” Blackwell-Thompson said.\n\nThe team was able to completely fill the core stage with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. They also completed an engine bleed test, which conditions the four engines and brings their temperature down prior to launch. (The mission team scrubbed the first Artemis I launch attempt on August 29 largely due to an issue with a faulty sensor that occurred during the bleed.)\n\nThen, the Artemis team fueled the rocket’s upper stage and conducted a pre-pressurization test, which went “very well” according to the engineers. It was scheduled to last for an hour, but only took 15 minutes.\n\nThe test was intended to “bring the liquid hydrogen tank up to the pressure level it will experience just before launch while engineers calibrate the settings for conditioning the engines at a higher flow rate, as will be done during the terminal count,” according to a Monday update from NASA officials. It would “enable teams to dial-in the necessary settings and validate timelines before launch day, reducing schedule risk during the launch countdown.”\n\nA hydrogen leak detected on the 4-inch quick disconnect line for the engine bleed reached a little over 5%, which is above the 4% threshold, during the pressurization test. This quick disconnect line carries liquid hydrogen out of the engines after they have run through the engines and chilled them. But as the hydrogen continued to flow, the leak rate lowered on its own. The team will drain the tanks of all propellant and is looking forward to assessing the data from the test.\n\nRaising pressure caused the leak to go down, which was encouraging to Blackwell-Thompson and her team, she said. They will evaluate the lessons learned from the test to see if any changes need to be made to loading procedures or timelines.\n\n“I think we’ll take the data and we’ll go see what it tells us,” she said. “I am extremely encouraged by the test today. I couldn’t be more proud of the team today and the work that they did.”\n\nThe next launch attempt could take place on Tuesday, September 27, with a 70-minute window that opens at 11:37 a.m. ET. The mission managers will meet to discuss the test results on Sunday, September 25, to assess the potential launch date.\n\nManaging a hydrogen leak\n\nThe Artemis I cryogenic demonstration test began with fueling at 7:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nArtemis team members were slowly filling the core stage of the rocket with supercold liquid hydrogen, but they stopped shortly after 10 a.m. ET due to the detection of the hydrogen leak. The leak is in the same area as a recently repaired quick disconnect line, and it occurred at the same moment when the team encountered issues before – as the liquid hydrogen was transitioning from slowly filling the rocket to a faster fill.\n\nAs soon as the team stopped the flow of liquid hydrogen, the 7% leak rate came down. The launch team let the line warm up in the hopes that when they resumed the flow of liquid hydrogen, it would restore the connection and cure the leak.\n\nThe team reduced the pressure in the storage tank and as they began flowing liquid hydrogen again, they very slowly increased the pressure.\n\nEngineers resumed fast fill of liquid hydrogen into the rocket’s core stage. While a small hydrogen leak remained, it was below the threshold for concern. Engineers increased the pressure and monitored the rate of the leak. They wanted to gather data to see at which point the leak shifted in response to the pressure change.\n\nSince the second scrubbed launch attempt of the uncrewed Artemis I mission on September 3, engineers have replaced two seals on an interface for the liquid hydrogen fuel line between the rocket and mobile launcher, according to NASA officials. These seals were associated with a large hydrogen leak that led to the scrub of the launch attempt.\n\nEngineers found an indentation on the seal on an 8-inch (20-centimeter) quick disconnect line for hydrogen, said Mike Sarafin, Artemis mission manager, at a Monday NASA press conference.\n\nThe indentation on the seal was under 0.01 inch (0.3 millimeter), but it allowed pressurized gas to leak through, something that can be very dangerous given the flammability of hydrogen when it meets air. The team believes the dent was associated with the leak, but the results of the test could confirm it. They have since replaced the seal.\n\nThe purpose of the cryogenic demonstration is to test the seals and use updated, “kinder and gentler” loading procedures of the supercold propellant, which is what the rocket would experience on launch day.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft and rocket boosters remained unpowered during the test, and the team does not intend to go into terminal count, or the final 10 minutes that occur in the countdown before launch, said Jeremy Parsons, deputy manager for NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe kinder and gentler loading procedure is to minimize pressure spikes and thermal spikes witnessed during prior launch attempts.\n\nPreparing for launch\n\nThe Artemis team is receiving daily briefings about Hurricane Fiona in case it has any impact on whether or not the rocket stack needs to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center, a process that can take three days.\n\nIf Artemis I launches on September 27, it would go on a 39-day mission and return to Earth on November 5.

The team believes the dent was associated with the leak, but the results of the test could confirm it. They have since replaced the seal.\n\nOn September 3, the large hydrogen leak was between two and three times the accepted limit, Sarafin said.\n\nTesting ‘kinder’ procedures\n\nThe purpose of the cryogenic demonstration is to test the seals and use updated, “kinder and gentler” loading procedures of the supercold propellant, which is what the rocket would experience on launch day.\n\nUnlike the wet dress rehearsals, the previous tests of Artemis I that simulated every stage leading up to launch, the cryo test focuses on a very specific aspect in the countdown: loading supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the rocket’s core stage and upper stage.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft and rocket boosters remained unpowered during the test, and the team does not intend to go into terminal count, or the final 10 minutes that occur in the countdown before launch, said Jeremy Parsons, deputy manager for NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe kinder and gentler loading procedure is to minimize pressure spikes and thermal spikes witnessed during prior launch attempts.\n\n“It’s going to be a very slow, steady ramp,” Parsons said. “So (we’re) really just trying to slowly introduce some of those thermal differences and reduce thermal and pressure shock.”\n\nLiquid oxygen is relatively dense, about the density of water, and it is pumped into the rocket. Meanwhile, hydrogen is very light, so it is moved using pressure rather than being pumped, said Tom Whitmeyer, deputy associate administrator for NASA’s common exploration systems development.\n\nThe new loading operations will use a slower rate of pressure with more gradual temperature changes, Whitmeyer said.\n\nThe call to stations for the test, when all of the teams associated with the mission arrive at their consoles and report they’re ready, begins today at 3 p.m. ET. The mission team anticipates receiving a “go” to begin loading the rocket with propellant around 7 a.m. ET on Wednesday. If all goes well, the team expects the test to be completed by 3 p.m. ET that day, Parsons said.\n\nThe test will also include an engine bleed, which chills the engines for launch. The mission team scrubbed the first Artemis I launch attempt on August 29 largely due to an issue with a faulty sensor that occurred during this bleed.\n\nSo far, the forecast looks promising for the test. The Artemis team is receiving daily briefings about Hurricane Fiona in case it has any impact on whether or not the rocket stack needs to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that can take three days.\n\nPreparing for launch\n\nIf the cryo test goes well, the next launch attempt could take place on Tuesday, September 27, with a 70-minute window that opens at 11:37 a.m. ET.

We’re not ready to give up yet.”\n\nThe next opportunity to send the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on their journey is September 2, but whether or not another attempt is made that day depends on how testing goes.\n\nSarafin confirmed that “Friday is definitely in play” if the team can resolve the issue while the rocket sits on the pad within the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\nThe next launch window is September 2, opening at 12:48 p.m. ET and closing at 2:48 p.m. ET. The next window after that is September 5, opening at 5:12 p.m. ET and closing at 6:42 p.m. ET.\n\n“Launch controllers were continuing to evaluate why a bleed test to get the RS-25 engines on the bottom of the core stage to the proper temperature range for liftoff was not successful, and ran out of time in the two-hour launch window,” according to an update from NASA. “Engineers are continuing to gather additional data.”\n\nThe launch team knew that the bleed test was a risk because they weren’t able to include it in previous wet dress rehearsal tests simulating the launch, and Monday was the first time demonstrating that, Sarafin said.\n\nCurrently, the issue doesn’t suggest an engine problem, but rather an issue within the bleed system that is used to cool the engine, he said.\n\n“We need the engine to be at the cryogenically cool temperature such that when it starts, it’s not shocked with all the cold fuel that flows through it. So we needed a little extra time to assess that,” Sarafin said.\n\nThe team also saw an issue with the vent valve at the inner tank and the combination of issues convinced the team they needed more time, Sarafin said.\n\nIf a substantial fix is needed the team may require more time to address it and roll the rocket stack back into the Kennedy Space Center’s Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that takes 3 1/2 days.\n\nThe launch team still needs to troubleshoot the engine issue and will keep the rocket in its current configuration to gather data and assess what needs to be done. Both the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft remain stable, according to NASA officials.\n\nPrior to the scrub, the countdown was extended into an unplanned hold as the launch team worked on a troubleshooting plan for one of the rocket’s four engines.\n\nThat’s because the launch team discovered an issue with an engine bleed in engine #3. Attempts to reconfigure it were unsuccessful.\n\nDuring engine bleeds, hydrogen is cycled through the engine to condition it for launch. Three of the four engines are performing as expected, but engine #3 experienced an issue.\n\n“There were also a series of weather issues throughout the launch window. We would have been a no-go for weather at the beginning of the window due to precipitation. Later on in the window, we would have been no-go for lightning within the launchpad area,” Sarafin said.\n\nPreviously, 80% favorable weather conditions had been forecast for the beginning of the window, which opened at 8:33 a.m. ET, but the weather changed as that time inched closer.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who traveled to Kennedy Space Center in Florida with second gentleman Doug Emhoff to watch the launch, underscored the United States’ commitment to NASA’s Artemis program in comments made after the postponement.\n\n“While we hoped to see the launch of Artemis I today, the attempt provided valuable data as we test the most powerful rocket in history,” Harris said via Twitter. “Our commitment to the Artemis Program remains firm, and we will return to the moon.”\n\nThe 322-foot-tall (98-meter-tall) stack is sitting on Launchpad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson addressed the scrub shortly after it was announced, stressing that Artemis I is a test flight.\n\n“We don’t launch until it’s right,” Nelson said. “They’ve got a problem with the gases going on the engine bleed on one engine. It’s just illustrative that this is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work. You don’t light the candle until it’s ready to go.”\n\nIt’s something Nelson has personal experience with. As an astronaut, he was on the 24th flight of the Space Shuttle. It was scrubbed four times on the pad and the fifth try resulted in a flawless mission.\n\n“Had we launched on any one of those scrubs, it wouldn’t have been a good day,” he said.\n\nSeveral issues cropped up after the rocket began fueling after midnight.\n\nOffshore storms with the potential for lightning prevented the team from beginning the fueling process, due to start at midnight, for about an hour.\n\nThe hold was lifted at 1:13 a.m. ET, and the tanking process began to load the rocket’s core stage with supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.\n\nThe team stopped filling the tank with liquid hydrogen twice due to an initial leak as well as a pressure spike, but tanking resumed for the core stage and began for the upper stage, or the interim cryogenic propulsion stage.\n\nThe team also discovered a line of frost on the inner stage flange. At first, engineers thought the frost may indicate the presence of a crack in the tank, but it turned out to be a crack in the external foam. The team shared that the issue had been resolved since the foam crack did not indicate a leak.\n\nEngineers also experienced an 11-minute delay in communications between the Orion spacecraft and ground systems. The issue could have impacted the beginning of terminal count, or the countdown that begins when 10 minutes remain on the clock before liftoff. The team was able to work through the issue, which was the result of a simple misconfiguration.\n\nIn addition to the visit by Harris, appearances by celebrities like Jack Black, Chris Evans and Keke Palmer and performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” by Josh Groban and Herbie Hancock and “America the Beautiful” by The Philadelphia Orchestra and cellist Yo-Yo Ma were planned as part of the program.\n\nMission overview\n\nWhen Artemis I launches, Orion’s journey will last 42 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth – traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers). When it returns to Earth, the capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nWhile the passenger list doesn’t include any humans, it does have passengers: three mannequins and a plush Snoopy toy will ride in Orion.\n\nThe crew aboard Artemis I may sound a little unusual, but they each serve a purpose. Snoopy will serve as the zero gravity indicator – meaning that he will begin to float inside the capsule once it reaches the space environment.\n\nThe mannequins, named Commander Moonkin Campos, Helga and Zohar, will measure deep space radiation future crews could experience and test a new suit and shielding technology. A biology experiment carrying seeds, algae, fungi and yeast is tucked inside Orion to measure how life reacts to this radiation as well.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment, which will capture a stream of Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander’s seat. If you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission’s location each day.\n\nExpect to see views of Earthrise, similar to what was shared during Apollo 8 for the first time, but with much better cameras and technology.\n\nScience experiments and technology demonstrations are riding in a ring on the rocket. The 10 small satellites, called CubeSats, will detach and go their separate ways to collect information on the moon and the deep space environment.\n\nThe inaugural mission of the Artemis program will kick off a phase of space exploration that lands diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon and eventually delivers crewed missions to Mars.\n\nThe rocket and spacecraft will be tested and put through their paces for the very first time before they carry astronauts to the moon on Artemis II and Artemis III, slated for 2024 and 2025 respectively.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}]}

Trump is also expected in the coming months to announce he will launch another bid for the White House in 2024.\n\nSecret Service agents stand at the gate of Mar-a-Lago after the FBI executed a search warrant at the Palm Beach, Florida, estate, August 8, 2022. Damon Higgins/AP\n\nThe Justice Department has two known active investigations connected to the former President, one on the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and January 6, 2021, and the other involving the handling of classified documents.\n\nThe search began early Monday morning and law enforcement personnel appeared to be focused on the area of the club where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe FBI’s search included examining where documents were kept, according to another person familiar with the investigation, and boxes of items were taken. Following the National Archives’ recovering of White House records from Mar-a-Lago in recent months, the FBI on Monday had to verify that nothing was left behind.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Former FBI official shares what struck him about FBI search 02:03 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s son, Eric, told Fox host Sean Hannity that “the purpose of the raid, from what they said, was because the National Archives wanted to, you know, corroborate whether or not Donald Trump had any documents in his possession.”\n\nChristina Bobb, Trump’s attorney, said the FBI seized documents. “President Trump and his legal team have been cooperative with FBI and DOJ officials every step of the way. The FBI did conduct an unannounced raid and seized paper,” Bobb said\n\nThere was communication between the FBI and US Secret Service before the search warrant was executed Monday, a person familiar with the matter said, allowing for the FBI to access the estate without any complications. There is only a small Secret Service footprint at Mar-a-Lago when Trump is not there.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment to CNN.\n\nA White House official said it was not notified about the search. President Joe Biden, a senior administration official said, was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news.\n\nInvestigation into documents\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort – including some that were classified.\n\nIn early June, a handful of investigators made a rare visit to the property seeking more information about potentially classified material from Trump’s time in the White House that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators, including Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, sat down with two of Trump’s attorneys, Bobb and Evan Corcoran, according to a source present for the meeting.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Trump stopped by and greeted the investigators near a dining room. After he left, without answering any questions, the investigators asked the attorneys if they could see where Trump was storing the documents. The attorneys took the investigators to the basement room where the boxes of materials were being stored, and the investigators looked around the room before eventually leaving, according to the source.\n\nA second source said that Trump came in to say hi and made small talk but left while the attorneys spoke with investigators. The source said some of the documents shown to investigators had top secret markings.\n\nFive days later, on June 8, Trump’s attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to further secure the room where the documents were stored. Aides subsequently added a padlock to the room.\n\nIn April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n“It is a federal crime to remove classified documents wrongly. And so if you are filling out that affidavit and you have to list the crime, you can list that as the crime,” said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN senior legal analyst.\n\nHonig told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront” that the timing of the search held with the longstanding department rule not to execute politically sensitive moves within 90 days of an election.\n\n“Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out. That policy, that may be a reason why they did it today because they want to stay clear of that if they’re interpreting that as a 90 day rule,” he said.\n\nMembers of GOP back Trump\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel claimed in a statement that Democrats “continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans,” and a number of Republican lawmakers came to the former President’s defense on social media.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, wrote that he had “seen enough.”\n\n“Attorney General (Merrick) Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar. I’ve seen enough. The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” the Republican leader wrote. “When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned.”\n\nGOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that “we need answers NOW. The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.”\n\nBut the chair of the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating Trump’s handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to “fully investigate” the former President’s handling of information.\n\n“Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America’s national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,” Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said.\n\n“Although details of today’s actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump’s potentially grave mishandling of classified information.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins Kevin Liptak Katelyn Polantz Sara Murray Evan Perez Gaborr Dan Berman", "Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Katelyn Polantz", "Sara Murray", "Evan Perez", "Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/politics/mar-a-lago-justice-department-response/index.html", "title": "Mar-a-Lago search: Justice Department says documents were likely ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS government documents were “likely concealed and removed” from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago as part of an effort to “obstruct” the FBI’s investigation into former President Donald Trump’s potential mishandling of classified materials, the Justice Department said in a blockbuster court filing Tuesday night.\n\nMore than 320 classified documents have now been recovered from Mar-a-Lago, the Justice Department said, including more than 100 in the FBI search earlier this month.\n\nTuesday’s filing represents the Justice Department’s strongest case to date that Trump concealed classified material he was keeping at Mar-a-Lago in an attempt to obstruct the FBI’s investigation into the potential mishandling of classified material.\n\nThe Justice Department revealed the startling new details as part of its move to oppose Trump’s effort to intervene in the federal investigation that led to the search of his Florida resort and his desire for a “special master” to be appointed to the case.\n\nTrump has pushed an “incomplete and inaccurate narrative” in his recent court filings about the Mar-a-Lago search, the Justice Department said.\n\n“The government provides below a detailed recitation of the relevant facts, many of which are provided to correct the incomplete and inaccurate narrative set forth in Plaintiff’s filings,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nIt presents a strong rebuttal of the criticisms of the FBI’s unprecedented search of a former President’s residence, laying out clearly how Trump had failed to return dozens of classified documents even after his lawyer attested that he had provided all classified material in his possession.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Honig says DOJ filing shows FBI had no choice but to search Mar-a-Lago 02:29 - Source: CNN\n\nA picture on the final page of the filing showing classified documents arrayed on the floor of Trump’s office – full of highly classified markings like “HCS,” meaning human intelligence sources – hammered home how sensitive the material Trump had taken was.\n\nAt issue is Trump’s compliance with a grand jury subpoena, issued in May, demanding that he turn over classified documents from Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors said Tuesday that some documents were likely removed from a storage room before Trump’s lawyers examined the area, while they were trying to comply with the subpoena. The timeline is essential, because Trump’s lawyers later told investigators that they searched the storage area and that all classified documents were accounted for.\n\n“The government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government’s investigation,” prosecutors wrote. “This included evidence indicating that boxes formerly in the Storage Room were not returned prior to counsel’s review.”\n\nThe allegations came after the DOJ’s filing went into specific detail about actions from Trump’s team that the department implies were obstructive to its probe.\n\nIn the filing opposing Trump’s request, DOJ argues that the former president lacks standing over presidential records “because those records do not belong to him,” as presidential records are considered property of the government.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act makes clear that “[t]he United States” has “complete ownership, possession, and control of them,” the DOJ filing states.\n\nTrump has argued that his constitutional rights have been violated and that some of the documents seized earlier this month contain material covered by privilege – particularly executive privilege.\n\nThe Justice Department was ordered to submit the filing by Judge Aileen Cannon, who has already indicated she is inclined to grant Trump’s request for third party oversight of documents the FBI seized Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe role of a special master is to filter out any materials seized in a search that don’t belong in the hands of investigators because of a privilege. Special masters have been used in high-profile cases before, but usually in cases where the FBI has searched an attorney’s office or home and there is a need to filter out materials concerning attorney-client privilege. Trump’s request has centered on the need to protect documents concerning executive privilege from his conduct as president.\n\nSignals from Cannon, a Trump appointee, that she is leaning toward appointing a special master in the Mar-a-Lago search have raised eyebrows among legal observers. For one, Trump filed his request for the appointment two weeks after the search of his Florida home, risking the potential that the Justice Department is already done with the bulk of its review. Secondly, Trump and the judge alike have pointed to civil rules concerning special master appointments, when the search warrant is arising in a criminal context.\n\nSince the August 8 search, a number of previously secret court filings the DOJ submitted to obtain the warrant have been made partially public in part because of a bid for transparency filed in court by several media organizations, including CNN.\n\nThose redacted documents have revealed that the search was connected to a DOJ investigation into alleged violations of the Espionage Act, criminal mishandling of government documents and obstruction of justice. According to an FBI affidavit that was released last week, an FBI review of 15 boxes retrieved by the National Archives from Mar-a-Lago in January found 184 documents bearing classification markings – some of them identified as particularly sensitive government documents.\n\nTrump, in seeking the special master, has stressed in court filings the lack of criminal enforcement in the Presidential Records Act, a Watergate-era law laying out the process for preserving presidential records. He did not mention the three criminal statutes the DOJ cited in its warrant documents. Trump’s lawyers have also emphasized his supposedly unfettered ability when he was president to declassify documents, though the statutes in question don’t require that the materials be classified.\n\nWednesday morning, Trump posted on his social media platform on Truth Social for the first time since the Justice Department filing and once again claimed to have declassified documents that were found at his Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\nIn one of his most recent posts, Trump appeared to comment on the photo of top-secret documents laid out on the floor, saying, “Terrible the way the FBI… threw documents haphazardly all over the floor,” and, “Lucky I Declassified!”\n\nIn other posts, he attacked the FBI and DOJ generally and said, “This is the time, after many years of lawbreaking & unfairness, to clean things up. All things for a reason. DRAIN THE SWAMP!!!” He repeated his false claims of a stolen election and said, “Our Country is going to hell!” He also claimed crowds are “already forming” for his rally on Saturday.\n\nTrump’s attorney limited what DOJ could look at during June visit\n\nA top Justice Department official contends that federal investigators were limited in what they could look through when visiting the resort in June – contrary to the Trump team’s narrative of total cooperation.\n\nTrump’s lawyer requested that the FBI come to the resort to pick up the documents after the Trump team had received a grand jury subpoena in May seeking any materials marked classified, according to the Justice Department.\n\nDOJ’s account also undermined claims by Trump and his allies that the former President had declassified the materials in question.\n\n“When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege,” the filing said. “Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the document.”\n\nIn the DOJ’s account, Trump’s lawyer said that all the remaining documents from Trump’s White House were being kept in the storage at Mar-a-Lago. “Counsel further represented that there were no other records stored in any private office space or other location at the Premises and that all available boxes were searched,” the filing said.\n\nProsecutors confirmed Trump’s assertion that the visiting DOJ and FBI officials were then allowed to visit the storage area.\n\n“Critically, however, the former President’s counsel explicitly prohibited government personnel from opening or looking inside any of the boxes that remained in the storage room, giving no opportunity for the government to confirm that no documents with classification markings remained,” the DOJ said.\n\nDOJ reveals grand jury proceedings related to Mar-a-Lago search happening in DC\n\nThe Justice Department confirmed that grand jury subpoenas had been issued in its probe, and that the grand jury that issued them had been empaneled in DC. The department included a copy of a May 11 subpoena for government records at Mar-a-Lago marked as classified that indicated the existence of the DC federal grand jury. Before making the subpoena public, the department on Monday got permission to do so from Chief Judge Beryl Howell in the DC District Court, according to a footnote in its brief.\n\nThe reference to Howell suggests that in addition to Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart and Cannon in Florida, a third judge is now involved in the DOJ’s probe.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Jeremy Herb Tierney Sneed Marshall Cohen Evan Perez Sara Murray", "Jeremy Herb", "Tierney Sneed", "Marshall Cohen", "Evan Perez", "Sara Murray"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/12/maralago-search-warrant-live-updates/10306459002/", "title": "Trump Mar-a-Lago estate warrant unsealed by federal judge", "text": "The warrant authorizing federal agents to search former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was unsealed Friday by a federal judge, after the Justice Department requested that it be made public.\n\nFederal authorities sought a range of highly sensitive documents, including 11 caches of classified materials, indicating that the federal investigation was examining possible violations of the Espionage Act, according to documents unsealed Friday.\n\nThe action came shortly after the Department of Justice wrote in a new court filing Friday that, after conferring with Trump's attorneys, the former president does not object to making the search warrant of his Mar-a-Lago estate public.\n\nBefore the document was released, details of what the FBI was looking for in its Monday search started to be reported, including that FBI agents who searched Trump's home retrieved boxes that included 11 sets of classified documents, said a person who has reviewed the documents.\n\nRead the search warrant:Read the FBI's search warrant for Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property\n\n“Not only will I not oppose the release of the documents,” Trump said in a statement late Thursday, “I am going a step further by encouraging the immediate release of those documents.”\n\nDocument:Read the Justice Department's motion to unseal Trump Mar-a-Lago search warrant\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►FBI agents who searched Donald Trump's home this week retrieved boxes that included 11 sets of classified documents, said a person who has reviewed the documents.

Here's what it says\n\nWhat we know, don’t know about what was taken from Mar-a-Lago\n\nAbout half of the documents taken from Mar-a-Lago, former President Donald Trump’s Florida residence, had confidential, secret or top-secret classifications.\n\nOf the 39 items recovered by federal agents, many are listed with a box number, but no further details.\n\nSome items are labeled more specifically, such as an executive grant of clemency for Roger Stone and information regarding the president of France.\n\nBut many items are marked as miscellaneous secret documents, miscellaneous top-secret documents, confidential document, a potential presidential record, binders of photos and numbered boxes.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nPreviously:Merrick Garland files motion to unseal search warrant used on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home\n\nThe ’45 Office’\n\nAccording to the warrant agents searched locations, including a room designated as the \"45 Office, all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used” by the former president and his staff.\n\nOther items included on a receipt provided to Trump and his attorneys, listing the material removed, included tantalizing references to a document related to the 2020 clemency granted to longtime adviser Roger Stone, a line item referencing the “President of France” and other more innocuous seizures: two binders of undesignated photographs and a “handwritten note.”\n\n-- Kevin Johnson\n\nWho is Roger Stone?:What to know about the longtime Trump ally and Republican strategist\n\nExtraordinary risk’ – former Archives official\n\nTrump’s handling of classified documents, especially bringing them to Mar-a-Lago where potentially hundreds of “friends of club members” had access to them, represents an extraordinary risk to national security on a wide range of fronts, said J. William Leonard, the former head of the U.S. National Archives’ Information Security Oversight Office and the government's overseer of classification of records.\n\nThat is especially the case, he said, regarding nuclear weapons technology, covert operations, spying and military sources and methods and other government secrets that would be devastating if they fell into the wrong hands.\n\nGiven the freewheeling atmosphere and access to the public at Mar-a-Lago, a members only club, “If a foreign intelligence operatives haven't already attempted, if not succeeded in penetrating Mar Lago, I'd be very surprised, Leonard told USA TODAY. “It just boggles my mind in terms of how did we ever get to this point where, you know, we're concerned about the busboy catering wedding (at Mar-a-Lago) gaining access to nuclear secrets.”\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nWhat we know:What did the FBI look for – and find – when searching Trump's Mar-a-Lago home?\n\nFBI agents retrieved information classified top secret and sensitive\n\nAmong the trove of classified information retrieved was material designated at one of the highest levels of classification: Top Secret/SCI, or sensitive compartmented information.\n\nThe actual nature of the information was not detailed in the warrant, though the document indicated that FBI agents had recovered some 20 boxes of information.\n\nAccording to the warrant agents search a location known as the \"45 Office, all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used” by the president and his staff.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nDOJ warrant indicates Trump being investigated in with connection with statutes related to espionage, obstruction\n\nA search warrant reveals the Justice Department is investigating Donald Trump in with connection with statutes related to the Espionage Act and obstruction.\n\nAbout half the documents removed from Trump’s Florida estate were marked with the highest security classifications, and the warrant shows the former president is being investigated for possibly breaking three federal laws: removal or destruction of records, obstructing an investigation, and violating the Espionage Act.\n\nThe investigation stems from how Trump handled national security information and reached a fever pitch Monday when the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFBI agents found 11 sets of classified records, including some marked top secret.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nRead the search warrant on Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate\n\nDOJ says Trump does not object to making search warrant public\n\nThe Department of Justice wrote in a new court filing that, after conferring with former president Donald Trump's attorneys, he does not object to making the search warrant public.\n\nThe judge said Thursday that the government needed to serve Trump with its motion to unseal the search warrant and report back by 3 p.m. EDT. This document, filed in response to the judge, said Trump did not object and reiterated the motion to unseal the search warrant.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nDOJ due to update court by 3 p.m.\n\nThe Department of Justice is due to update the Southern District of Florida by 3 p.m. EDT as to whether former president Donald Trump opposes the government’s motion to unseal.\n\nBecause of lags in filing documents with the judiciary’s online records system, the update may not become public until after 3 p.m.\n\nTrump wrote on social media Thursday night that he supports releasing the search warrant, but so far no document saying so has been published in the public court records system.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nNational Archives responds to Trump claims about Obama files\n\nThe National Archives on Friday responded to misinformation former President Donald Trump has spread about how his predecessor handled government records as he exited office.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama left office in 2017, the National Archives and Records Administration moved about 30 million pages of unclassified records to a facility in Chicago where the federal agency continues to maintain them. It also oversees classified Obama Administration files at a Washington facility, according to a statement released Friday.\n\n“As required by the (Presidential Records Act), former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the presidential records of his administration,\" according to the statement.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that Obama kept millions of documents, including classified material.\n\n“How many of them pertained to nuclear? Word is, lots,” he said in a prepared statement earlier Friday.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that some of the documents FBI agents sought in a search of Trump’s estate related to nuclear weapons.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nRoger Stone’s clemency document seized from Mar-a-Lago, WSJ reports\n\nThe executive grant of clemency that former President Donald Trump issued for ally Roger Stone was among the documents the FBI seized at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nTrump commuted Stone’s sentence in July 2020, days before Stone was to begin serving a 40-month prison sentence.\n\nStone, whose charges came as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, was found guilty in 2019 of lying to Congress and obstructing the investigation.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nFBI agents retrieved 11 sets of classified documents from Mar-a-Lago search\n\nFBI agents who searched Donald Trump's home this week retrieved boxes that included 11 sets of classified documents, said a person who has reviewed the documents.\n\nThe person declined to discuss details of the documents\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that \"agents collected four sets of top secret documents, three sets of secret documents, and three sets of confidential documents. The list didn’t provide any more details about the substance of the documents.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWall Street Journal: FBI recovered classified documents marked top secret\n\nFederal agents who searched the Mar-a-Lago estate of former President Donald Trump removed 11 sets of classified documents, some marked as top secret, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nA list of items removed from the property, obtained by the Journal, included binders of photos, a handwritten note, information about the “President of France” and the executive grant of clemency for Trump ally Roger Stone. Some 20 boxes of items were taken by the FBI.\n\nThe list, which is contained in a seven-page document that also includes the property search warrant, includes references to one set of documents deemed “Various classified/TS/SCI documents,” which is an abbreviation for “top secret/sensitive compartmented information,” according to the Journal. Agents also collected four sets of top secret documents, three sets of secret documents and three sets of confidential documents, according to the list obtained by the Journal.\n\nThe FBI did not seek access to search private guest rooms, but did ask for access to “the 45 Office” and “all storage rooms and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used by [the former president] and his staff and in which boxes or documents could be stored, including all structures or buildings on the estate,” the Journal reported.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nTrump records investigation:From early red flags to the search at Mar-a-Lago\n\nFBI urges public to report suspicious activity following attempted Cincinnati breach\n\nAfter an armed man attempted to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office and a wave of anger directed against federal law enforcement following the search of Donald Trump’s Florida estate, the FBI urged the public Friday to report suspicious activity to authorities.\n\n“The FBI is always concerned about violence and threats of violence to law enforcement, including the men and women of the FBI,” the bureau said in a statement. “We work closely with our law enforcement partners to assess and respond to such threats, which are reprehensible and dangerous.\n\n“As always, we would like to remind members of the public that if they observe anything suspicious to report it to law enforcement immediately.\"\n\nThe suspect in the Ohio incident, who was later fatally shot in a standoff with police, may have been posting messages to the former president’s Truth Social site during the incident.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray defended the bureau Thursday against the increasing stream of threats, saying that “unfounded attacks on the integrity of the FBI erode respect for the rule of law and are a grave disservice to the men and women who sacrifice so much to protect others.”\n\n- Kevin Johnson\n\nTrump allies attack warrant - and Garland - before documents released\n\nThe paperwork isn't out yet, but Donald Trump supporters are already attacking the Mar-a-Lago search warrant as insufficient.\n\nTheir basic argument is \"nothing to see here\" – no matter what the documents say.\n\nTeam Trump also seems to be betting that the release will not include an affidavit that includes specific information about what the ex-president is accused of doing. They are also planning renewed attacks on Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n\"The expectations for the warrant should be tampered down,\" tweeted Rudy Giuliani, a former lawyer for Trump. \"To weigh the justification, if any, Garland must release the affidavit. Right now we are getting the 'run around.'\"\n\nTrump allies are likely seeking to take advantage of a familiar Catch-22: The government suspects someone of dealing in sensitive classified information, but don't want to detail it publicly because it could undercut national security.\n\nOther attorneys point out that, if the warrant is that meaningless, Trump could have released it days ago.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., another ally of Trump, tweeted: \"Attorney General Garland must release the information as to why a warrant was necessary, not what was taken ... They can redact the names and other sensitive information, but DOJ must lay their cards on the table.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPelosi concerned about sensitive info at Mar-a-Lago\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi in her weekly news conference offered few details and little reaction to the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPelosi, who said she has 30 years of experience with national intelligence, said she hasn’t been formally briefed on the situation and knows only what’s in the public domain.\n\nShe did express some concern, however, about reports that suggest Trump was storing sensitive information at Mar-a-Lago about nuclear weapons.\n\n“I think what is important to know now is the seriousness of what these documents were alleged to be about…Our concern is always to protect and defend,” Pelosi said.\n\nShe did not answer whether there will be a Congressional committee or investigation convened to look into the material Trump was storing.\n\n—Candy Woodall\n\nFBI searched Trump home for nuclear documents, ‘highly classified’ material: reports\n\nFBI agents who searched former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home Monday were looking for highly classified material, according to reports by the Washington Post and New York Times.\n\nCiting anonymous sources, the New York Times reported that investigators were concerned about Trump having material from “special access programs,” which the Times described as a designation saved for sensitive operations carried out by the United States abroad or closely held technologies and capabilities.\n\nTrump’s purported possession of such material has raised concern among government officials that the information could be vulnerable to acquisition efforts by foreign adversaries, the Times reported.\n\nAlso citing anonymous sources, The Washington Post reported that classified documents relating to nuclear weapons were among the items sought by federal agents.\n\n-- Ella Lee\n\nAfter the search:FBI's Christopher Wray denounces threats following search of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home\n\nHouse intelligence committee Republicans question Mar-a-Lago search\n\nIn a Friday press conference, Republican members of the House intelligence committee raised concerns over the Monday search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence by federal agents, calling on the Justice Department to release additional information about the reason it was executed.\n\n“We love our law enforcement officers. We would protect and defend them to thank them for their service, but when we have a brewing matter of distrust, we have to get to the bottom of it and fix it,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a former FBI agent, said of the search.\n\nThough the committee Republicans said they supported rank-and-file members of the FBI and Justice Department, several questioned whether the agencies’ leadership authorized the search for political reasons. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., the No. 3 House Republican, claimed without evidence that the raid was the Biden administration’s attempt to act against his political opponent.\n\nRep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, ranking member of the committee, said that he and other committee members are “certainly” concerned about unsecured classified information possibly being in a storage area, but added that the documents are just one piece of the puzzle.\n\n“Donald Trump has more classified information in his head than he does in his desk,\" Turner said.\n\n-- Candy Woodall, Ella Lee\n\nPreviously:GOP, long the law and order party, slams FBI, Justice Department over search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago\n\nMore:GOP Rep.

A USA TODAY review of online postings by an account in that name shows the account had recently posted angry reactions to news of the FBI raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida home. The same account posted during or just after the incursion at the FBI, appearing to describe the man's efforts.\n\n\"Well, I thought I had a way through bullet proof glass, and I didn't.

The request to unseal the warrant could keep key parts of it off-limits to the public, said attorney Martin Reeder, who is representing the Post.\n\n“The scope of all the warrant materials is broader than what the government is addressing,” Reeder said. “The government is only speaking to some of these documents.”\n\nThe Palm Beach Post is part of the USA TODAY network.\n\nRepublican response:GOP, long the law and order party, slams FBI, Justice Department over search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago\n\nMore:GOP Rep.

Earlier this year, officials from the National Archives and Records Administration, known as NARA, recovered 15 boxes of presidential documents from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump’s lawyers previously worked with NARA to voluntarily turn over some documents, but the Mar-a-Lago search clearly indicates a new phase of the probe. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and claims the investigation is a politically motivated sham, intended to derail his potential bid to return to the White House.\n\nHere’s a timeline of the key moments from the blockbuster investigation.\n\nMay 2021\n\nAn official from NARA contacts Trump’s team after realizing that several important documents weren’t handed over before Trump left the White House. In hopes of locating the missing items, NARA lawyer Gary Stern reaches out to someone who served in the White House counsel’s office under Trump, who was the point of contact for recordkeeping matters. The missing documents include some of Trump’s correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as the map of Hurricane Dorian that Trump infamously altered with a sharpie pen.\n\nFall 2021\n\nNARA grows frustrated with the slow pace of document turnover after several months of conversations with the Trump team. Stern reaches out to another Trump attorney to intervene. The archivist asks about several boxes of records that were apparently taken to Mar-a-Lago during Trump’s relocation to Florida. NARA still doesn’t receive the White House documents they are searching for.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nAfter months of discussions with Trump’s team, NARA retrieves 15 boxes of Trump White House records from Mar-a-Lago. The boxes contained some materials that were part of “special access programs,” known as SAP, which is a classification that includes protocols to significantly limit who would have access to the information. NARA says in a statement that some of the records it received at the end of Trump’s administration were “torn up by former President Trump,” and that White House officials had to tape them back together. Not all the torn-up documents were reconstructed, NARA says.\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nNews outlets, including CNN, report that NARA asked the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s handling of White House records and whether he violated the Presidential Records Act and other laws related to classified information. The Presidential Records Act requires all records created by a sitting president to be turned over to the National Archives at the end of their administration.\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nNARA informs the Justice Department that some of the documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago included classified material. NARA also tells the department that, despite being warned it was illegal, Trump tore up documents while he was president, and that senior officials in the Trump administration did not properly preserve their social media messages, draft tweets and deleted tweets.\n\nApril and May 2022\n\nOn April 7, NARA publicly acknowledges for the first time that the Justice Department is involved, and news outlets report that prosecutors have launched a criminal probe into Trump’s mishandling of classified documents. Around this time, FBI agents quietly interview Trump aides at Mar-a-Lago about the handling of presidential records as part of their widening investigation.\n\nApril 11, 2022\n\nThe FBI asks NARA for access to the 15 boxes it retrieved from Mar-a-Lago in January. The request was formally transmitted to NARA by President Joe Biden’s White House Counsel’s office, because the incumbent president controls presidential documents in NARA custody.\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department sends a letter to Trump’s lawyers as part of its effort to access the 15 boxes, notifying them that more than 100 classified documents, totaling more than 700 pages, were found in the boxes. The letter says the FBI and US intelligence agencies need “immediate access” to these materials because of “important national security interests.” Also on this day, Trump lawyers ask NARA to delay its plans to give the FBI access to these materials. Trump’s lawyers say they want time to examine the materials to see if anything is privileged, and that they are making a “protective assertion of executive privilege” over all the documents.\n\nMay 1, 2022\n\nTrump’s lawyers write again to NARA, and ask again that NARA postpone its plans to give the FBI access to the materials retrieved from Mar-a-Lago in January.\n\nMay 10, 2022\n\nDebra Steidel Wall, the acting Archivist of the United States, who runs NARA, informs Trump’s lawyers that she is rejecting their claims of “protective” executive privilege over all the materials taken from Mar-a-Lago, and will therefore turn over the materials to the FBI and US intelligence agencies. In a four-page letter, Wall says she reached this decision after consulting with top lawyers from the Justice Department and the White House Counsel’s office.\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department subpoenas Trump, seeking documents with classification markings that are still at Mar-a-Lago. Trump directs his staff to search for any remaining classified material, to comply with the subpoena, according to a lawsuit he later filed.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nNews outlets report that investigators subpoenaed NARA for access to the classified documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. The subpoena, which is part of the process to allow investigators to take possession of the documents from the NARA, is the first public indication of the Justice Department using a grand jury in its investigation.\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nAccording to a lawsuit the former President later filed, Trump invites FBI officials to come to Mar-a-Lago to retrieve the subpoenaed materials.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nFour investigators, including a top Justice Department counterintelligence official, visit Mar-a-Lago seeking more information about classified material that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators meet with Trump’s attorneys and look around the basement room where the documents are being stored. Trump briefly stops by the meeting to say hello to the officials, but he does not answer any questions. During the meeting, the federal officials deal with the grand jury subpoena for some of the sensitive national security documents on the premises, and they take away the subpoenaed documents. At some point later in June, a Trump lawyer sends a letter to the Justice Department inaccurately asserting that there aren’t any more classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJune 8, 2022\n\nTrump’s attorneys receive a letter from federal investigators, asking them to further secure the room where documents are being stored. In response, Trump aides add a padlock to the room in the basement of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nFederal investigators serve a subpoena to the Trump Organization, demanding surveillance video from Mar-a-Lago. Trump’s company complies with the subpoena and turns over the footage. CNN has reported that this was part of an effort to gather information about who had access to areas at the club where government documents were stored.\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\nThe FBI executes a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago – a major escalation of the classified documents investigation. The search focused on the area of the club where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are located. Federal agents remove boxes of material from the property. The search was the first time in American history that a former president’s home was searched as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nTrump sends a message through one his lawyers to Attorney General Merrick Garland, saying he has “been hearing from people all over the country about the raid” who are “angry,” and that “whatever I can do to take the heat down, to bring the pressure down, just let us know,” according to a lawsuit he later filed. Hours later, after three days of silence, Garland makes a brief public statement about the investigation. He reveals that he personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant, and that the Justice Department will continue to apply the law “without fear or favor.” Garland also pushes back against what he called “unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department.” Garland also announces that the Justice Department will ask a judge to unseal some of the search warrant documents, for the sake of transparency.\n\nAugust 12, 2022\n\nFederal Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart approves the unsealing of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant and its property receipt, at the Justice Department’s request and after Trump’s lawyers agree to the release. The warrant reveals the Justice Department is looking into possible violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records, as part of its investigation.\n\nAugust 22, 2022\n\nTrump files a federal lawsuit seeking the appointment of a third-party attorney known as a “special master” to independently review the materials that the FBI seized from Mar-a-Lago. In the lawsuit, Trump’s lawyers argue that the Justice Department can’t be trusted to do its own review for potentially privileged materials that should be siloed off from the criminal probe.\n\nAugust 27, 2022\n\nFederal District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who is presiding over Trump’s civil lawsuit, announces her “preliminary intent” to appoint a special master to examine the seized Mar-a-Lago materials.\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\nFederal prosecutors clash with Trump’s lawyers at a high-stakes court hearing in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of Trump’s lawsuit seeking the special master appointment.\n\nSeptember 5, 2022\n\nIn a major ruling, Cannon grants Trump’s request for a special master to review the seized materials from Mar-a-Lago. She says the special master will have the power to look for documents covered under attorney-client privilege and executive privilege. The outcome is a major victory for Trump.\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nThe Justice Department appeals Cannon’s decision in the special master case. Prosecutors also ask Cannon to temporarily block two key parts of her ruling while their appeal plays out: First, the part where she blocked the Justice Department from using any of the seized materials in their criminal probe while the materials were being reviewed by the special master, and second, the part of her ruling that required the Justice Department to hand over classified documents to the special master.\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nCannon appoints senior Judge Raymond Dearie to serve as the special master and sets a November 30 deadline for the Brooklyn-based federal judge to finish his review of the seized materials. Cannon also rejects the Justice Department’s request to temporarily pause two key portions of her earlier ruling, which prosecutors claimed were hampering their ongoing criminal probe.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen Holmes Lybrand Hannah Rabinowitz", "Marshall Cohen", "Holmes Lybrand", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-investigation/index.html", "title": "FBI took 11 sets of classified material from Trump's Mar-a-Lago ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Justice Department removed 11 sets of classified documents from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence while executing a search warrant this week for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other crimes, according to court documents unsealed and released on Friday.\n\nThe property receipt, which was also released on Friday, for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home shows that some of the materials recovered were marked as “top secret/SCI” – one of the highest levels of classification.\n\nThe search warrant identifies three federal crimes that the Justice Department is looking at as part of its investigation: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records.

The moment marks an unprecedented week that began with the search – an evidence-gathering step in a national security investigation.\n\nSearch warrant reveals new details about scope of FBI probe\n\nWhile details about the documents themselves remain scarce, the laws cited in the warrant offer new insight into what the FBI was looking for when it searched Trump’s home, an unprecedented step that has prompted a firestorm of criticism from the former President’s closest allies.\n\nThe laws cover “destroying or concealing documents to obstruct government investigations” and the unlawful removal of government records, according to the search warrant released Friday.\n\nAlso among the laws listed is one known as the Espionage Act, which relates to the “retrieval, storage, or transmission of national defense information or classified material.”\n\nAll three criminal laws cited in the warrant are from Title 18 of the United States Code. None of them solely hinge on whether information was deemed to be unclassified.\n\nOne of the less-sensitive items taken from Trump’s resort, according to a the property receipt, was a document about pardoning Roger Stone, a staunch Trump ally who was convicted in 2019 of lying to Congress during its probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Trump pardoned Stone before leaving office, shielding Stone from a three-year prison term.)\n\nIt’s unclear how the Stone-related document seized during the search is tied to the broader criminal probe into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified materials.\n\nDuring the search, FBI agents also recovered material about the “President of France,” according to the warrant receipt. The French embassy in Washington declined to respond Friday to the development.\n\nFBI agents searched ’45 Office’ at Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe court documents released Friday also offer new details about the search itself and revealed that FBI agents were only allowed access to specific locations within Mar-a-Lago as they combed Trump’s resort residence for potential evidence of crimes.\n\nThe judge authorized the FBI to search what the bureau called the “45 Office,” an apparent reference to Trump’s place in history as the 45th President. Agents were also permitted to search “all other rooms or areas” at Mar-a-Lago that were available to Trump and his staff for storing boxes and documents.\n\n“The locations to be searched include the ’45 Office,’ all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used by FPOTUS and his staff and in which boxes or documents could be stored, including all structures or buildings on the estate,” the warrant says, using the acronym “FPOTUS” to refer to the Former President of the United States.\n\nThe FBI’s warrant application to the judge specifically said that federal agents would avoid areas being rented or used by third parties, “such as Mar-a-Lago members” and “private guest suites.” Trump owns the sprawling estate, and it is his primary residence as well as a members-only club and resort.\n\n“It is described as a mansion with approximately 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, on a 17-acre estate,” FBI agents told the judge in their application, describing the Mar-a-Lago property.\n\nTrump did not oppose release of search warrant\n\nThe FBI search at the resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday was followed by days of silence from the Justice Department, as is the department’s normal practice for ongoing investigations.\n\nThen on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the department had moved to unseal the search warrant and two attachments, including an inventory list, but also stressed that some of the department’s work must happen outside of public view.\n\n“We do that to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans and to protect the integrity of our investigations,” Garland said, while explaining that he would not provide more detail about the basis of the search.\n\nTrump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform Thursday that he would “not oppose the release of documents” and that he was “going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents.”\n\nThe court had instructed the Justice Department to confer with Trump about its request to unseal the warrant documents and set a Friday deadline to report back on whether he opposed their release.\n\nTrump’s team had contacted outside attorneys about how to proceed, and the former President’s orbit was caught off guard by Garland’s announcement.\n\nIn a pair of posts to Truth Social following Garland’s statement, Trump continued to claim that his attorneys were “cooperating fully” and had developed “very good relationships” with federal investigators prior to Monday’s search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“The government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it,” Trump said. “Everything was fine, better than most previous Presidents, and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided, at 6:30 in the morning, by VERY large numbers of agents, and even ‘safecrackers.’”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz Zachary Cohen Sara Murray Marshall Cohen", "Katelyn Polantz", "Zachary Cohen", "Sara Murray", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/26/trump-mar-a-lago-search-affidavit/7897551001/", "title": "Trump estate search: DOJ to release redacted affidavit - recap", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Justice Department on Friday released a redacted version of the affidavit justifying the unprecedented search of Donald Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSome associated documents have also been made public.

Here's what was taken out.\n\nTrump has said he had a standing order that automatically declassified any documents he took from the Oval Office into the private residence of the White House. In fact, the long, detailed and precise process for declassifying information includes consulting with any agency with a stake in the information and documenting what has been changed.\n\nAfter taking that jab, Biden said he couldn’t comment further on the situation because he doesn’t know the details.\n\n“I don’t even want to know,” he said.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nSenate Intelligence chairman calls for DOJ investigation to proceed\n\nFollowing the release of the affidavit and accompanying documents, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said in a statement Friday that the Department of Justice’s investigation into papers found at Mar-a-Lago “must be allowed to proceed without interference.”\n\nWarner issued the statement based on the release of the probable cause affidavit, saying that some of the documents that were improperly handled included “some of our most sensitive intelligence.”\n\nOn a bipartisan basis, the committee has requested “a damage assessment of any national security threat posed by the mishandling of this information,” Warner said.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is an affidavit?\n\nAn affidavit is a sworn statement asserting that certain facts are true to the best of one’s knowledge, made before an officer of the court or a notary – a third party authorized by state law to perform various legal tasks, according to Cornell University’s Legal Information Institute.\n\nIn the affidavit supporting the search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, the name of the affiant, or person who signed the document, is redacted.\n\n“Information in the affidavit that would identify the affiant, such as by name or through biographical information, should remain under seal,” reads a document released Friday explaining the affidavit’s redactions.\n\nThe Justice Department cited “agent safety” as its reasoning for keeping the affiant’s name sealed.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nFeds asked Trump's attorneys to secure Mar-a-Lago storage room holding sensitive docs\n\nOn June 8, DOJ lawyers sent Trump's legal team a letter warning that the storage room at Mar-a-Lago holding sensitive material was not secure and should be more impenetrable.\n\n\"As I previously indicated to you, Mar-a-Lago does not include a secure location\n\nauthorized for the storage of classified information,\" the DOJ letter reads. \"As such, it appears that since the time classified documents were removed from the secure facilities at the White House and moved to Mar-a-Lago on or around January 20, 2021, they have not been handled in an appropriate manner or stored in an appropriate location.\"\n\n\"Accordingly, we ask that the room at Mar-a-Lago where the documents had been stored be secured and that all of the boxes that were moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago (along with any other items in that room) be preserved in that room in their current condition until farther notice.\"\n\n- Kevin McCoy\n\nWhat is the meaning of 'redacted'?\n\n“Redaction” is the retroactive editing of a document to remove information that is confidential, according to Cornell University’s Legal information Institute.\n\nThough most of the Justice Department's reasons for redacting the affidavit are themselves redacted, the Justice Department cited the danger of revealing the identities of witnesses, law enforcement agents and uncharged parties; the investigation’s strategy and scope; and grand jury information as reasons to keep the affidavit at least partially sealed.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nTrump lawyer says Trump could declassify documents, not subject to criminal liability\n\nTrump as president had “absolute authority to declassify documents,” Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran wrote May 25 to Jay Bratt, the head of the counterintelligence section at the Justice Department.\n\nTrump and his aides have said he could declassified documents before moving them to Mar-a-Lago. But authorities have found no documentation of the alleged declassification.\n\nBecause of a president’s ultimate legal authority under the Constitution, Corcoran argued his actions dealing with classified documents “are not subject to criminal sanction.” Any imposition of criminal liability on a president or former president over classified documents “would implicate grave constitutional separation-of-powers issues.”\n\n“Beyond that, the primary criminal statute that governs the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material does not apply to the president,” Corcoran wrote.\n\nLegal experts rejected arguments about separation of powers because the National Archives and Records Administration, the Justice Department and the White House are all part of the executive branch.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nConfidential human sources among trove of Trump documents, plus Trump's 'handwritten notes'\n\nThe FBI’s initial examination of 15 boxes retrieved from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this year revealed a trove of 184 “unique documents bearing classified markings,” including highly guarded records relating to human sources marked as “HCS.”\n\n“Based on my training and experience, I know that documents classified at these levels typically contain (National Defense Information),” the affidavit stated. “Several of the documents also contained what appears to be FPOTUS 's handwritten notes.”\n\n- Kevin Johnson\n\nWhat was in the boxes Trump returned to the National Archives?\n\nThe redacted Department of Justice affidavit for the search warrant says “a preliminary triage of the documents with classification markings revealed the following approximate numbers: 184 unique documents bearing classification markings, including 67 documents marked as CONFIDENTIAL, 92 documents marked as SECRET, and 25 documents marked as TOP SECRET.”\n\nAdditionally, FBI agents found markings that reflected some of the documents contained national defense information. Several of the documents also contained what appeared to be Trump’s “handwritten notes,” the affidavit said.\n\n- Kevin McCoy\n\n‘Evidence of obstruction: National defense information among initial documents found at Mar-a-Lago\n\nHighly classified national defense information was included in 15 boxes of documents initially recovered from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in January, launching federal investigators on a criminal investigation into handling of classified information, according to a newly-unsealed government affidavit supporting the unprecedented search of Trump’s property.\n\n“There is probable cause to believe that additional documents that contain classified (National Defense Information) or that are Presidential records subject to record retention requirements currently remain at the PREMISES,” the heavily redacted document states. “There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found at the PREMISES.”\n\n- Kevin Johnson\n\nAffidavit: Trump storage rooms not considered secure for classified documents\n\nAfter pages of blacked-out passages, the affidavit said the storage room at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s residential suite Pine Hall and his office called the “45 Office” were “not currently authorized locations for the storage of classified information or” national defense information.\n\nDocuments were stored in multiple locations on the premises.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nJustice Department releases affidavit\n\nThe Justice Department on Friday made public a redacted version of the affidavit that justified the search of Donald Trump’s home, a day after a magistrate ordered its release because of high public interest in the case.\n\nThe department had opposed the affidavit’s release, arguing it could hurt the investigation into why government documents, including hundreds of pages of classified records, were stored at Mar-a-Lago. The department argued the affidavit would disclose the identity of witnesses and the strategy behind the investigation.\n\nBut U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ordered the release Thursday, ruling that redactions could be narrowly tailored to prevent hurting the inquiry.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nRead the (redacted) affidavit that supported the search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate\n\nAssociated documents also unsealed\n\nBesides the affidavit, the flurry of documents U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart unsealed included:\n\n– A memo from the government explaining reasons for the redactions in the affidavit and an exhibit itemizing the reasons for redactions.\n\n– The order that had sealed the redacted memo.\n\n– The government motion to initially seal the memo.\n\n– An order initially sealing a government memo about the redactions, along with two exhibits.\n\n– A supplemental memo about the redactions.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nAffidavit is roadmap to DOJ investigation\n\nJustice Department officials described the affidavit supporting the Mar-a-Lago search as extremely detailed, warning that if released in full could lead to possible obstruction of its ongoing inquiry.\n\n“Although the public is now aware that the government executed a search warrant at the premises owned by the former President and seized documents marked as classified, the affidavit is replete with further details that would provide a roadmap for anyone intent on obstructing the investigation,” according to newly unsealed documents.\n\nJustice officials not only expressed concern for witnesses and the course of the investigation, but also for the safety of federal law enforcement agents.\n\n“Meanwhile, FBI agents who have been publicly identified in connection with this investigation have received repeated threats of violence from members of the public,” the Justice document said. “Exposure of witnesses' identities would likely erode their trust in the government's investigation, and it would almost certainly chill other potential witnesses from coming forward in this investigation and others.”\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nDOJ cites concerns for witness safety\n\nJustice Department officials expressed deep concern for the safety of witnesses in its continuing investigation into former President Donald Trump’s handling of classified documents, according to a newly unsealed memorandum arguing for redactions of key information from the affidavit authorizing the Mar-a-Lago search.\n\n“First and foremost, the government must protect the identity of witnesses at this stage of the investigation to ensure their safety,” Justice officials wrote. “As this Court noted, if information relating to witnesses were disclosed, \"it is likely that even witnesses who are not expressly named in the Affidavit would be quickly and broadly identified over social media and other communication channels, which could lead to them being harassed and intimidated.\"\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nBiden defers to Justice Department on national security implications\n\nPresident Joe Biden declined to say Friday whether U.S. national security was threatened by his predecessor’s storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“We’ll let the Justice Department determine that,” Biden said at a White House event marking Women’s Equality Day.\n\nBiden was responding to a shouted question from a reporter.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly declined to answer questions about the FBI’s retrieval of the documents and its potential implications.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump blasts search as partisan witch hunt\n\nEx-President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the FBI search on social media and in other statements, but many of his complaints are unfounded, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\n\nTrump said there was “no way” to justify the search of Mar-a-Lago, even though FBI agents seized boxes of government documents – including 11 sets of classified records. U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart authorized the search for evidence of potential mishandling defense documents and obstruction of justice.\n\nTrump asserted executive privilege over the documents. But as government officials review what was recovered, legal experts say the former president has no claims of executive privilege to keep one portion of the executive branch from getting documents from another part.\n\nTrump also complained about the FBI taking three of his passports. The Justice Department returned them – two were expired and one was an active diplomatic passport – after a review found they were unrelated to the search.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland defended the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors in the search he approved.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat led to the FBI search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home?\n\nThough watchdogs raised red flags over former President Donald Trump’s record management as early as 2018, it came under greater scrutiny in February, after the National Archives obtained 15 boxes of presidential records that Trump had stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence — some of which the agency later confirmed were classified.\n\nThe Justice Department in April moved to investigate the handling of White House documents sent to Mar-a-Lago. Months later, in June, the former president was served with a subpoena seeking other sensitive government documents that investigators believed he’d stored there after he left the White House.\n\nFederal agents searched Trump's Florida property on Aug. 8, leaving with some 20 boxes of items that included 11 sets of classified documents. A warrant authorizing the search showed Trump is under investigation for possibly breaking three federal laws: removal or destruction of records, obstructing an investigation and violating the Espionage Act.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nBiden not expected to comment\n\nDon’t expect President Joe Biden to weigh in on whatever is released in the redacted version of the affidavit justifying the FBI’s retrieval of materials from Mar-a-Lago, including 11 sets of classified documents.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not answer questions Wednesday about whether the administration has assessed the national security risk of the documents being moved and stored at Trump's private Florida residence.\n\n“We just are not going to comment on the contents of this ongoing, independent investigation that the Department of Justice is doing,” Jean-Pierre said. “We're not going to comment on the underlying materials at this time. We're just not going to do that.”\n\nNBC News reported this week that the intelligence community does not appear to have launched a formal damage assessment, which is required “when there is an actual or suspected unauthorized disclosure or compromise of classified national intelligence that may cause damage to U.S. national security.” Assessments may also be conducted “when there is an actual or suspected loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of classified national intelligence that could adversely affect national security,” according to the 2104 policy.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nFrom Florida to Georgia, Trump-related legal action churns on\n\nIn addition to the highly anticipated release of the redacted affidavit supporting the Mar-a-Lago search, legal action involving former President Donald Trump is playing out Friday in multiple other venues.\n\nTrump’s legal team is due to file an amended request in a separate Florida federal court calling for the appointment of a special master or third party to review the classified documents seized from Trump’s Florida estate during the FBI’s Aug. 8 search to ensure that possibly privileged material is shielded from scrutiny.\n\nThe initial request, cast in starkly political terms, was filed earlier this week, but a federal judge asked that Trump’s lawyers more clearly state their case for making such a request.\n\nTrump’s lawyers described the government’s search, which resulted in the seizure of 11 sets of classified documents, as overly broad because it authorized FBI agents to seize \"boxes of documents merely because they are physically found together with other items purportedly within the scope of the warrant.\"\n\nIn Georgia, meanwhile, the Atlanta-area district attorney leading a separate criminal inquiry into interference in the 2020 election has summoned Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows to appear before a special grand jury.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis described Meadows as a “material witness” to possible election-related fraud. Prosecutors referred to Meadows’ alleged role in arranging a Jan. 2, 2021 telephone call in which Trump pressured Georgia Secretary State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to tilt the Georgia election in his favor.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nBiden said he had ‘zero’ advance notice of the Mar-a-Lago search\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday that he had “zero” advance notice before federal agents executed a search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence earlier this month.\n\n“I didn’t have any advanced notice – none, zero, not one single bit,” Biden said Wednesday, his first public comments on the search.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has said that no one at the White House was given a heads-up about the unprecedented search and that Justice Department investigations should be “free from political influence.”\n\n\"The Justice Department conducts investigations independently, and we leave any law enforcement matters to them,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Aug. 9. She said Biden \"was not briefed, was not aware of it.\"\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nTrump lawyers stumble in lawsuit over search\n\nDonald Trump's lawyers continued to stumble in their lawsuit to halt the review of classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon scolded lawyers James Trusty of Washington, D.C., and Evan Corcoran of Baltimore for not following local rules when they filed their lawsuit Monday. The two lawyers were not licensed to practice in Florida, where the case is being heard. They refiled the necessary paperwork Tuesday and were approved Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, lawyer Lindsey Halligan filed to change her local address in the case, but it was rejected because she hadn’t followed the required procedures.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Trump seeks to halt the government’s review of documents seized during the search on Aug. 8. The filing accused Attorney General Merrick Garland of using the search to play politics with the November elections.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat classified documents have been found at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate?\n\nFBI agents seized 11 sets of classified documents among other records while searching Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8. Trump blasted the search as a partisan witch hunt and said he was cooperating with authorities. He sought the return of the documents.\n\nThe search came after the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of documents in January, including 100 classified records totaling 700 pages. Federal authorities also recovered classified documents under subpoena on June 3.\n\nMedia companies including The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Network, argued for release of the affidavit to learn more about what provoked the unprecedented search of a former president’s home.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump aides unlikely to face charges on their own in Mar-a-Lago probe, ex prosecutors say\n\nDonald Trump’s aides are unlikely to be charged with mishandling government documents recovered in the unprecedented search of his Florida estate unless the former president is charged too, according to legal experts.\n\nPotential criminal charges including the Espionage Act cited in the search warrant require willful criminal intent, a legal standard that might not apply to aides who simply packed or moved boxes without knowing what they contained, according to former prosecutors. The Espionage Act doesn't necessarily allege spying, but mishandling documents about national defense.\n\nAides who knowingly moved or hid classified records could face potential charges.

In some instances, these folders have a tracking number, two of the sources said, although such cases are rare.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ex-prosecutor identifies a big concern after learning what FBI found in Trump's home 01:28 - Source: CNN\n\nFor some current and former intelligence officials, the empty folders were an alarming signal that unknown classified information may go unaccounted for by federal investigators, who may have a difficult time piecing together what information those folders previously contained – much less what happened to it.\n\nBut because those folders are often reused, one source familiar with these kinds of documents cautioned that merely finding an empty folder is not necessarily an indication that any of the information it previously contained has been mishandled.\n\n“Empty folders raise questions, but were they empty and without descriptive info?” this person said. “Putting a cover sheet on a folder and carrying it with multiple docs inside is often done. Akin to finding cover sheets, which are often laying around in classified environments and in and of themselves not an issue.”\n\nIn other words, without more information about how these folders were marked – including whether they included any kind of tracking or control number – it’s unclear how easy it would be to determine their past contents.\n\nStill, investigators may be able to piece together some contextual clues, according to the same sources. There are supposed to be records kept of what classified information goes to the president. And one of the sources noted that the National Archives this spring informed the Justice Department that the records it recovered from Mar-a-Lago in January included classified material that was “unfoldered, intermixed with other records and otherwise unproperly identified.”\n\nThe inventory also references dozens of folders that are marked as “Return to Staff Secretary/Military Aide.” Typically, when the president needs to access materials for a briefing, a military aide or other staff member assigned to the White House is responsible for safeguarding those materials.

She did so after giving both the prosecutors and Trump’s lawyers the opportunity to lodge any objections to the documents’ release. They did not.\n\nProsecutors wrote in the investigative team status report that was unsealed that “all evidence pertaining to the seized items – including, but not limited to, the nature and manner in which they were stored, as well as any evidence with respect to particular documents or items of interest – will inform the government’s investigation.”\n\n“The investigative team has reviewed the seized materials in furtherance of its ongoing investigation, evaluating the relevance and character of each item seized, and making preliminary determinations about investigative avenues suggested or warranted by the character and nature of the seized items,” the status report said.\n\n“The seized materials will continue to be used to further the government’s investigation, and the investigation will continue to use and evaluate the seized materials as it takes further investigative steps, such as through additional witness interviews and grand jury practice,” the Justice Department added.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Katie Bo Lillis", "Tierney Sneed", "Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/takeaways-mar-a-lago-documents/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from the historic Justice Department court filing on the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has pushed an “incomplete and inaccurate narrative” in his recent court filings about the Mar-a-Lago search, the Justice Department said in a historic court filing late Tuesday night.\n\nProsecutors fleshed out new details about the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump’s potential mishandling of classified documents, which he took from the White House to his resort and home in Florida. Trump and his allies have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn total, the US government has recovered more than 320 classified documents from Mar-a-Lago since January, including more than 100 seized in the August search, DOJ says.\n\nThe filing is in response to Trump’s bid for a “special master” in a civil lawsuit against the Justice Department, weeks after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago. The judge handling the case, a Trump appointee, has said her “preliminary intent” is to bring in a special master. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the filing, what we learned and where we go from here.\n\nDocs were moved and possibly hidden from investigators\n\nDocuments were “likely concealed and removed” from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago as part of an effort to “obstruct” the FBI’s investigation, the Justice Department said in its filing Tuesday.\n\nWhat’s more, the DOJ said that the search “cast serious doubt” on his lawyers’ claims that there had been a “diligent search” to return classified material in response to a grand jury subpoena.\n\nA Trump lawyer signed a statement to the Justice Department in June attesting that all of the classified material at Mar-a-Lago had been returned.\n\n“That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the ‘diligent search’ that the former President’s counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,” DOJ wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department filing gave federal investigators the chance to rebut – on the record – many of the claims that Trump, his lawyers and his political allies have been making as they’ve harshly attacked the FBI’s unprecedented search of his residence.\n\nDOJ rejects Trump criticisms and falsehoods about FBI search\n\nDOJ wrote that the filing included a “detailed recitation of the relevant facts, many of which are provided to correct the incomplete and inaccurate narrative set forth in Plaintiff’s filings.”\n\nThe filing cited numerous examples refuting claims that have come from Trump’s team about the search and what happened in the lead-up to it.\n\nFor instance, a top DOJ official contends that federal investigators were limited in what they could look through when visiting the Mar-a-Lago resort in June – contrary to the Trump team’s narrative of total cooperation.\n\nTrump lawyers didn’t claim docs were declassified\n\nDOJ’s account also undermined claims by Trump and his allies that the former President had declassified the materials in question.\n\n“When producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege,” the filing said.\n\n“Instead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the document,” prosecutors added.\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words\n\nThe final page of the 54-page court filing was a photo showing classified document cover sheets arrayed on the floor of Trump’s office at Mar-a-Lago, including documents with highly sensitive material like human sources.\n\nThe photo drove home the message that the Justice Department appeared to be making Tuesday laying out its most robust defense yet of the search.\n\nThe government took custody of documents from Mar-a-Lago three times this year: Trump voluntarily turned over 15 boxes to the National Archives in January, Trump’s team turned over some materials under subpoena in June, and FBI agents seized another 33 boxes during the search of Mar-a-Lago earlier this month.\n\nProsecutors said that FBI agents recovered over 100 unique classified documents during the search of Mar-a-Lago on August 8. (Investigators didn’t disclose how many of these were “top secret.”)\n\nAbout the passport\n\nTrump has attacked the FBI for taking his passports, though they were later returned, claiming they were outside the scope of the warrant and improperly seized.\n\nBut the government asserted that the passports were found in a desk draw that contained classified documents, with government records “comingled with other documents.”\n\n“The location of the passports is relevant evidence in an investigation of unauthorized retention and mishandling of national defense information; nonetheless, the government decided to return those passports in its discretion,” DOJ wrote.\n\nA special master would impede review of national security risks, DOJ says\n\nThe Justice Department argued in its court filing Tuesday that appointing a special master to review the materials taken from Trump’s residence would harm national security, arguing it would delay the intelligence community’s ongoing review of documents that were kept at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“Appointment of a special master would impede the government’s ongoing criminal investigation and – if the special master were tasked with reviewing classified documents – would impede the Intelligence Community from conducting its ongoing review of the national security risk that improper storage of these highly sensitive materials may have caused and from identifying measures to rectify or mitigate any damage that improper storage caused,” Justice Department lawyers wrote.\n\nThe department highlighted those risks as it argued that the special master would be “unnecessary,” given that the DOJ’s internal filter team had already finished its work segregating potentially privileged documents from the seized materials for privileged documents, and “the government’s investigative team has already reviewed all of the remaining materials, including any that are potentially subject to claims of executive privilege.”\n\n“Furthermore, appointment of a special master would impede the government’s ongoing criminal investigation,” DOJ argued.\n\nDOJ’s filing sets the stage for Trump’s reply and Thursday’s hearing\n\nWith the revelations from the new filing, the clock is ticking for Trump to reply in another court submission due Wednesday and then in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe deadline for Trump to file a written response to the department’s brief is 8 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nThen on Thursday, both sides will argue before US District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, in the federal courthouse in West Palm Beach. On Saturday, Cannon signaled she was inclined to grant Trump’s request for a special master in the order she handed down Saturday laying out the briefing schedule. But she said that she had not yet made a final determination on the matter.", "authors": ["Jeremy Herb Marshall Cohen Tierney Sneed", "Jeremy Herb", "Marshall Cohen", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/trump-maralago-documents-private-concerns-legal-tom-fitton/index.html", "title": "Inside Trump's public bravado and private resistance over Mar-a ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nNot long after the National Archives acknowledged in February that it had retrieved 15 boxes of presidential records from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump began fielding calls from Tom Fitton, a prominent conservative activist.\n\nFitton, the longtime head of the legal activist group Judicial Watch, had a simple message for Trump — it was a mistake to give the records to the Archives, and his team should never have let the Archives “strong-arm” him into returning them, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThose records belonged to Trump, Fitton argued, citing a 2012 court case involving his organization that he said gave the former President authority to do what he wanted with records from his own term in office.\n\nThe Judicial Watch president suggested to Trump that if the Archives came back, he should not give up any additional records, according to sources with knowledge of their conversations, which have not been previously reported.\n\nWhile Trump continued to publicly tout his cooperation with the Archives, privately the former President began obsessing over Fitton’s arguments, complaining to aides about the 15 boxes that were handed over and becoming increasingly convinced that he should have full control over records that remained at Mar-a-Lago, according to people with knowledge of his behavior at the time.\n\nTrump even asked Fitton at one point to brief his attorneys, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\n“The moment Tom got in the boss’ ear, it was downhill from there,” said a person close to the former President, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nTom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2021 in Orlando. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIn a phone interview with CNN, Fitton would neither confirm nor deny conversations he’s had with Trump, but noted that he has been vocal on social media and television that Trump had the right to keep the documents he took with him at the end of his presidency because they inherently were personal.\n\nTrump’s interactions with Fitton shed new light on his evolving— and often conflicting— posture toward the Archives dating back to before he even left office and his recent reluctance to hand over more documents after initially giving up the 15 boxes in January. While he was in contact with Fitton behind the scenes, Trump continued to claim publicly that he was cooperating with government officials.\n\nTrump didn’t completely stonewall the government as Fitton had advised, turning over some material in June following a meeting between his lawyers and federal investigators at Mar-a-Lago. But after a Trump lawyer claimed all classified material had been provided, investigators developed evidence suggesting that was not the case, leading to the August 8 search.\n\nA similar dissonance has emerged between Trump’s private and public response to the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nPublicly, Trump and his allies have celebrated the surge in enthusiasm and fundraising among Republicans — with the former President painting himself as a victim of the “deep state.” Some in Trump’s orbit have even gone so far as to indicate that a potential indictment would give Trump a political boost as he mulls another presidential run.\n\nBut privately, the former President and his allies have become increasingly concerned. One source close to the former President told CNN that Trump has posed questions about a potential indictment to members of his inner circle. Another adviser acknowledged that while Trump has certainly been in legal peril before, including while he was president, this seems different and potentially more dangerous, particularly because the former President no longer has the legal protections afforded to the executive office.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe actions of Trump’s legal team since the FBI’s search – including a legal filing seeking a “special master” that a judge found problematic and told the team to clarify by Friday – have only fueled questions about Trump’s strategy as his legal woes have multiplied.\n\nTrump’s team seems to be primarily concerned with the public relations fight – and Trump’s political prospects. While Trump has publicly called for the release of the affidavit justifying the search of his residence, his lawyers have yet to take any legal action to seek its disclosure.\n\nMeanwhile, Fitton’s conservative Judicial Watch, which frequently uses litigation to try to pry loose government activity and records, has filed to unseal the affidavit. So has CNN, along with other news outlets, including The Washington Post, NBC News, and Scripps.\n\nFedExing Kim Jong Un’s letters\n\nWhen federal agents arrived at Trump’s oceanfront estate on August 8, more than a year had passed since Archives officials first began asking representatives of the former President to return various materials that were removed from the White House and taken to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAmong them had been Trump’s correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in June 2019, in Panmunjom, Korea. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt one point during the protracted negotiations, a senior Archives official instructed Scott Gast, a former lawyer in Trump’s White House counsel’s office who had been appointed to coordinate with the National Archives, to send the letters using FedEx’s overnight service.\n\n“Please let me know before you mail it and then pass along the tracking code once it has been sent. I need to make sure I have staff on this end to receive the package,” the official wrote to Gast and others in a June 2021 email obtained by CNN.\n\nIn the end, it took seven months for the Archives to finally receive the Kim letters. They were contained in the 15 boxes that Trump aides allowed Archives officials to arrange for pick up from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, which contained 700 pages of classified documents, according to the Archives.\n\nSources close to the former President said his willingness to cooperate with Archives and, eventually, federal investigators broke down further once Fitton became a familiar voice inside his orbit.\n\nFitton told Trump that he had case law on his side due to Fitton’s own failed effort a decade ago to gain access to certain records from former President Bill Clinton’s time in office. In 2012, Judicial Watch sued to require the Archives to designate as presidential records audio recordings then-President Clinton made with a historian named Taylor Branch. Doing so would make them subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nThe suit was eventually dismissed by a judge, who wrote that NARA “does not have the authority to designate materials as ‘presidential records’” and “lacks any right, duty or means to seize control of them.”\n\nEven though the Clinton case did not involve classified records, Fitton, nevertheless, believes his case proves Trump has the right to keep his records.\n\n“I have been quite clear that President Trump is being abused here and the Justice Department has changed its position that they had in the Clinton case,” Fitton told CNN. After the 15 boxes were returned, “I noted at the time that it was at odds with the position of the Justice Department in the Clinton-Taylor Branch case.”\n\nLegal concerns\n\nEven people close to the former President have begun to privately question the competence of the legal team around him, particularly Christina Bobb, the former One America News Network TV host who has become one of the faces of Trump’s legal team in the aftermath of the Mar-a-Lago search.\n\nIn her recent appearances across conservative media, Bobb has propagated a litany of conspiracy theories about the Mar-a-Lago search, including the baseless allegation that the FBI planted evidence while on Trump’s property.\n\nThe One America News Network Weekly Briefing with Christina Bobb Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBobb previously assisted Rudy Giuliani’s behind-the-scenes efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. She signed the warrant receipts after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago.\n\nBobb did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast week, Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump on her program, pushed back on Bobb over the decision by Trump’s legal team not to file or join any motions related to the release of the federal affidavit filed to justify the search warrant.\n\n“Are you not concerned that because you didn’t join any of these motions for the full release of this affidavit that you are then waiving possible objections to the way redactions are being done by the Justice Department later on?” Ingraham asked Bobb.\n\nBobb replied that the team was going to wait and see what happened with the unsealing of the affidavit.\n\nIt took two weeks before Trump’s lawyers formally waded into the legal fight over the search warrant. And when they finally did on Monday, their motion had numerous legal flaws and drew criticism from legal experts on both sides of the aisle. The motion was filed in a separate case, putting it before a different judge than Florida Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who approved the search warrant. That judge, District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, gave Trump’s legal team until Friday to refine its legal arguments as part of its request for a “special master” — a third party attorney — to oversee the review of evidence obtained during the search.\n\nWhile Trump’s legal team has not filed any motions to unseal the affidavit, Trump and his legal team have argued publicly that it should be released.\n\nOn Thursday, Reinhart ruled that the Justice Department must release a redacted version of the affidavit by noon on Friday.\n\nAnother lawyer representing Trump, Alina Habba, suggested in a TV appearance Tuesday that the former President wants the DOJ to release the names of the witnesses who helped secure the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago, which would be contained in the affidavit and which government attorneys have argued could chill future witness cooperation.\n\n“The president’s position is the same as what I would advise him, which is to ask (the DOJ) to uncover everything so we can see what’s going on. I understand the witness protection issue, but at the same time, these witnesses are truly not going to be concealed for very long,” Habba said on conservative network Newsmax. “That’s just not the nature of the DOJ and the FBI, and unfortunately in our country there’s always leaks.”\n\nIn addition to Bobb and Habba, Trump is being represented by Evan Corcoran, an attorney who has also represented former Trump aide Steven Bannon, and Florida-based attorney Lindsey Halligan, whose background is in insurance litigation. Trump has also retained Jim Trusty, a former assistant US attorney and Justice Department prosecutor, who is widely seen in his orbit as the most capable among his team.\n\nAs they’ve sought to undercut the federal probe, Trump’s team and his allies have put forward additional theories that quickly wilted under scrutiny.\n\nJohn Solomon, a conservative writer and one of Trump’s designees to the Archives, read a statement from Trump’s team claiming Trump had a “standing order” to declassify documents he took from the Oval Office to the White House residence – something 18 former administration officials told CNN was patently untrue. Others have suggested the General Services Administration, a small government agency that helps with the presidential transition, was responsible for the documents that were sent to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe GSA said the responsibility for what is moved when a president leaves office rests entirely with the outgoing president and staff.\n\nTrump wants political fight not a legal one\n\nTrump’s advisers have made it clear they want this fight to be a political not legal battle.\n\nOn Monday night, Solomon published a letter sent by the National Archives to Trump’s legal team in May.\n\nThe letter stated clearly that the Archives had retrieved more than 100 classified documents totaling more than 700 pages, including some with the highest levels of classification.\n\n“It shows that Donald Trump and his team knew…they were in possession of large amounts of highly classified information,” said Elie Honig, a former Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and a CNN legal analyst. “This letter makes clear [Trump’s team] was delaying.”\n\nWhile many legal experts shared this sentiment and said the letter was damning to Trump, the former President seemed to believe the letter showcased a political win — claiming it proved that he was the victim of a “witch hunt.” Trump has pointed to the letter’s mention of the communications the Archives had with the Biden White House over privilege issues, after the White House counsel’s office was consulted over granting the FBI access to the boxes the Archives took from Mar-a-Lago. That was unrelated to the search warrant, however.\n\nTrump’s allies in conservative media have picked up on the narrative and amplified it. “The letter revealed that Joe Biden empowered the National Archives to waive any claims to executive privilege Trump might assert to block the DOJ from gaining access to the documents,” conservative personality Dan Bongino said on his program.\n\nTrump and his allies, however, have conflated the executive privilege questions over the documents Trump had handed over to the Archives with the FBI’s search warrant, which the Biden White House says it had no knowledge of.\n\nThe White House’s counsel’s office deferred the decision to the archivist, declining to weigh-in on whether the FBI should have been allowed to access the documents the Archives retrieved from Mar-a-Lago “given the political implications and optics,” said Bradley Moss, a Washington-based national security lawyer.\n\n“If anything, the Biden White House went out of its way to not get involved in whether or not this became a truly criminal matter,” Moss said.\n\nSome of Trump’s allies believe the former President is more secure than ever, at least politically speaking. In the days following the FBI search, Trump raised millions of dollars and saw an outpouring of support – including from his potential GOP rivals in a 2024 presidential primary.\n\n“Republican voters are looking at this [search] and saying if they can do this to him, they can do this to anyone,” one source close to Trump said. “It’s exactly where we want them to be.”", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes Evan Perez Jeremy Herb", "Kristen Holmes", "Evan Perez", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}]}

And a virtual version of the band will begin a series of concerts in London on May 27.\n\n“We took a break in the spring of 1982 and now we’ve decided it’s time to end it,” ABBA said in a statement Thursday. “They say it’s foolhardy to wait more than 40 years between albums, so we’ve recorded a follow-up to ‘The Visitors.’”\n\nThe group has been creating the holographic live show, using motion capture and other techniques, with George Lucas’ special-effects company, Industrial Light & Magic.\n\nThey call it “the strangest and most spectacular concert you could ever dream of.”\n\n“We’re going to be able to sit back in an audience and watch our digital selves perform our songs,” the group’s statement said. “Weird and wonderful!”\n\nThe planned show spurred the making of the album, which features the new songs “I Still Have Faith In You” and “Don’t Shut Me Down.” It began with sessions in 2018 and was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, published Thursday, Ulvaeus spoke about the group's reunion, insisting the group never broke up permanently but took a break for \"creative reasons.\"\n\n\"We ended because we felt the energy was running out in the studio, because we didn't have as much fun in the studio as we did this time,\" he said, according to a press release. \"We never said, 'This is it. We've split, and we'll never reunite again.' We never said that. We just said back then that we'd go on a break. And this break has now ended.\"\n\nBut, this concert and album will for sure the the last you hear of the band, Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson confirmed in an interview with the Guardian.\n\n\"This is it ... It’s got to be, you know,” Andersson said in the interview published Wednesday.\n\nWhile the band took a 40-year pause Andersson added: \"I didn’t actually say that ‘this is it’ in 1982 … I never said myself that Abba was never going to happen again. But I can tell you now: this is it.”\n\nABBA says it has recorded 2 new songs, marking first new material in 35 years\n\nEven though ABBA took 40 years off from making new music, Ulvaeus added that the bonds formed among his fellow bandmates are as strong as ever.\n\n\"Everything came rushing back like it was yesterday,\" he said. \"I looked around and I looked into Agnetha (Fältskog)'s eyes and Frida (Lyngstad)'s eyes, and there was this same kind of feeling — the warmth and the friendship and the bonds between us.\"\n\nThe show will come 50 years after the founding of the group that consisted of two married couples for most of its existence, and whose name is an acronym of the first names of its members, Fältskog, 71, Ulvaeus, 76, Andersson, 74, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, 75.\n\nTheir music has remained ubiquitous in the decades since their breakup, in part because of the stage musical “Mamma Mia!” and the two films that followed it.\n\nThey were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nLast week the group launched a website with the title “ ABBA Voyage,” teasing the new announcement.

A COVID-19 test will also continue to be required within three days of departure and proof of negative results must be shown. Enhanced contact tracing and masking will also be required, but there will be no quarantine mandate.\n\n►What travelers need to know:The new COVID rules for international flights to US don't just impact foreign tourists\n\nThe new policy also adds more stringent testing requirements for unvaccinated U.S. travelers, who will need to test within one day of departure and once again after arrival.\n\nZients said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will release a list of accepted vaccinations before the new policy goes into effect, as well as a contact tracing order that requires airlines to collect information such as phone numbers and email addresses of all U.S.-bound travelers.\n\n\"This will enable CDC and state and local public health officials to follow up with inbound travelers and those around them as someone has potentially been exposed to COVID-19 or other pathogens,\" Zients said. \"(It) will also strengthen our public health surveillance system against any future public health threats.\"\n\nVaccinated Americans are still subject to the CDC's requirement, put in place in January, to test negative for COVID-19 no more than three days before an international flight to the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. ban on nonessential travel has been in place since early 2020, starting with China and expanding to visitors from the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the 29 regions in the European Schengen region, Iran, Brazil, South Africa and India.\n\nEuropean Union Ambassador to the U.S. Stavros Lambrinidis hinted at the decision on Twitter earlier Monday, before sharing the news: \"Travel ban lifted! Vaccinated, pre-flight tested Europeans will again be able to travel to the US from November, just as vaccinated Americans are today allowed to travel to the EU.\"\n\nSlow to open the US\n\nThe U.S. has been among the slowest countries to lift its travel restrictions. While Canada reopened its land borders to U.S. travelers in early August, the U.S. has yet to announce when it will ease its land border restrictions. And even as European countries eased travel restrictions on U.S. travelers in the early summer months, the United States' travel ban held fast.\n\nIn mid-July, as the country was under mounting pressure from European capitals and travel industry leaders to lift the travel ban, President Joe Biden said his response team was reviewing the travel restrictions and suggested changes would be announced in the coming days. White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted later that month that there were \"ongoing working groups\" focused on how to reopen international travel into the U.S.\n\n► International travel bans:How COVID-19 travel restrictions have impacted families and couples\n\nBut as COVID-19 cases began to spike once again, the administration pivoted and announced that travel restrictions would remain in place.\n\n\"Given where we are today … with the delta variant, we will maintain existing travel restrictions at this point for a few reasons,\" Psaki said at a press briefing in late July.\n\nThe U.S. has already reported more COVID-19 deaths in September than in all of August, with deaths now averaging nearly 2,000 per day, according to USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data.\n\n'Travel bans are really kind of silly'\n\nIn recent months, countries in the U.S. travel ban – including Italy, France, Spain and Sweden – have tightened entry requirements for travelers from the U.S. due to rising COVID-19 cases. Quarantine mandates, vaccine requirements and outright bans are some of the restrictions international U.S. travelers now face.\n\nCritics and health experts have also questioned the effectiveness of the travel bans, especially after the U.S. took on its fourth surge of COVID-19 with the mandates in place.\n\n►Which EU countries are open to US tourists: A breakdown of EU travel restrictions by country\n\n►From Belize to Brazil: Here are the travel restrictions across Central and South America due to COVID-19\n\nWhen COVID-19 case counts are high, \"travel bans are really kind of silly,\" Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, told USA TODAY. \"We've already got more than enough virus circulating.\"\n\nHassig said the new travel policy \"makes a lot of sense\" and is a \"substantial and relevant step forward\" but could be strengthened with a quarantine mandate.\n\n\"I would have liked to have seen a three-day quarantine upon arrival, whether you're returning American or foreign national ... especially with delta still circulating as much as it is,\" she said. Hassig noted that it's possible for travelers to get infected the day before travel, which could be too soon to appear on a post-arrival test.\n\nTravel industry, other countries 'delighted' over announcement\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday on Twitter that he was \"delighted\" to hear that the travel ban would drop on vaccinated U.K. residents, and called the new travel policy a \"fantastic boost for business and trade.\"\n\nU.S. Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow said the new policy should help revive the American economy.\n\n\"This is a major turning point in the management of the virus and will accelerate the recovery of the millions of travel-related jobs that have been lost due to international travel restrictions,\" Dow said in a Monday statement.\n\nThe Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, said the new policy \"only increases (the) health and safety\" in air travel.\n\n\"We applaud the Biden Administration for announcing plans to reunite families and open travel with strict procedures to ensure transportation doesn't aid in the spread of the virus,\" AFA President Sara Nelson said in a Monday statement. \"International travel is essential to the stability of our jobs and the full recovery of the U.S. airline industry, but recovery is only possible if we remain focused first on safety and health.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/09/30/ac-dc-announces-reunion-pwrup-40-years-after-back-black/3589424001/", "title": "AC/DC announces reunion with 'PWRUP,' 40 years after 'Back in ...", "text": "AC/DC is officially back.\n\nIn a cryptic message posted to the group's social media accounts on Wednesday, the hard rock band announced that five of its longtime members will be reuniting for something called \"PWRUP.\"\n\n\"ARE YOU READY?\" the caption reads, along with a photo of Angus Young, Phil Rudd, Stevie Young, Brian Johnson and Cliff Williams.

The decision has been the subject of endless speculation by entertainment media and fans ever since August, when the British boy band announced that \"we are not splitting up, but we will be taking a well-earned break\" after releasing new album Made in the A.M., out Friday.\n\nBut in the wake of member Zayn Malik's highly publicized departure this spring, what will become of 1D's last men standing (Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Niall Horan)? After all, everyone knows what happened when *NSYNC announced a \"temporary hiatus\" in 2002, only to see it cemented when Justin Timberlake's solo career exploded. And even if they do reunite like the Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block before them, the pop-rock heartthrobs may never reclaim their former glory.\n\nReview: One Direction are defiantly mature on 'Made in the A.M.'\n\n\"I don't think anyone really knows the likelihood of One Direction getting back together, not even them,\" says Billboard senior editor Alex Gale. \"If one or two or three decide to go solo and are successful, then there's less and less incentive for them to bring back One Direction. At the same time, they have promised they will be back, and people usually don't do that\" without some reason to return.\n\n\"There's just so much money — it'd be hard for them to walk away from millions of dollars,\" Gale adds. A.M. is projected to have strong first week sales, despite the fact that Justin Bieber's Purpose also hits shelves Friday. \"Their fan bases obviously overlap, but it's expected to be really, really close,\" Gale says. (For comparison, 1D's Four debuted at No. 1 with 387,000 copies last year, according to Nielsen Music, while Bieber's last album, Believe, started with 374,000 sold in 2012.)\n\nAlthough they understand skepticism about their future, the band is sticking to its comeback narrative. \"Whatever you say at any point, people are going to read it in different ways,\" Styles, 21, says. \"All we said is that we've been touring and making an album every year for five years, and that we're just not going to do that next year. It'd be naive to expect people to not read into it, but we're really focused on the album coming out.\n\n\"We haven't really thought too much past that right now.\"\n\nThe A.M. era\n\nMade in the A.M. is named, quite simply, for the early-morning sessions that the band spent writing the album, which includes a cheeky bonus track called A.M. on the deluxe edition. \"It's basically about all the late-night conversations and laughs you have sitting around at 5 a.m. talking crap,\" Horan, 22, says. \"They're your favorite times. It's quite relatable.\"\n\nStarting with 2013's Midnight Memories, the guys have taken more active roles in co-writing their songs (primarily with producers Julian Bunetta, Jamie Scott and John Ryan), which allows for steady growth between albums without ever doing \"something crazily outside the box,\" Styles says. But unlike previous efforts, A.M. was written primarily in a couple-month break between touring, which made it less stressful when they got back on the road, \"because you weren't stressing about trying to find time to write. It was more about experimenting and finishing things off.\"\n\nMalik hadn't started working on A.M. before he quit, Styles adds, although they were forced to alter vocal arrangements in his absence.\n\nThe band's first single of the post-Malik era was Drag Me Down, a pop-rock anthem whose staunch chorus proclaims: \"All these lights / They can't blind me / With your love, nobody can drag me down.\" The song, which made its debut at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in August, was written as \"a pledge to the fans, really,\" Tomlinson, 23, says. \"We're in a very lucky position where we have a very loyal fan base and that was evident with the change.\"\n\nAM's latest single, Perfect, was co-written by Styles and Tomlinson, who explains its meaning as \"not taking (relationships) too serious and just enjoying what you have on that night.\" Of course, sharp-eyed fans and writers were quick to dissect similarities between the song and another Top 10 hit, Style, by Styles' ex-girlfriend, Taylor Swift (who many believe wrote Style and Out of the Woods about their relationship). Viewed as a response of sorts, Perfect's chorus sneers, \"If you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about / baby I'm perfect.\" Similar lyrics about midnight drives and \"good girls\" gone bad appear to hat-tip Style directly.\n\nAsked what he makes of the speculation, Styles says, \"I don't really read it.\" In general, \"I'm never going to tell someone what it means to them, because there's a lot of songs where I feel something completely different from what the writer intended me to feel. It's obviously funny to see, but it's up to everybody's individual interpretation.\"\n\nWhile such blunt lyrical hints may seem to suggest that he is calling out an ex, Styles insists that he only writes \"from personal experience. It doesn't always have to be so literal, in that you say, 'This is a love song about a girl I used to see.' ... Not every love song is necessarily about a person. It could be about a place or time or something where it touched you and you feel you can personify that in a song. Obviously, if you're pointing at things that have happened to you and people look into that, that's fine, but I personally don't write to go, 'Oh, people are going to have a fuss about this.' \"\n\nOf A.M.'s still-unheard songs, History is sure to be the one that gets most fans talking. Despite the rumors, fights and trappings of fame, \"we always find a way to make it out alive,\" the stomping singalong cheers, before declaring that \"this is not the end\" and \"we can live forever.\" Written for themselves, as well as the fans, \"it's about how we've all been through so much together,\" Styles says. \"It's kind of saying, 'No matter what happens, we're always going to have this.' We felt like it was the right way to end the album.\"\n\nMalik's 'traumatic' exit\n\nAt the very least, History should be a reassuring antidote for 1D fans, who have been put through the wringer this year starting with the departure of Malik, 22. Seemingly out of nowhere, Malik announced on the band's Facebook page in late March that \"it is the right time for me to leave,\" citing his desire to be a \"normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight.\" Many of the band's Twitter followers posted pictures and videos of them in tears, some even threatening suicide.\n\nFor the band, \"it was obviously a shock,\" Horan says. At the time, there were \"no disagreements, he wasn't making any music. We had a few conversations and then he made his decision.\"\n\n\"It was kind of a decision made there and then,\" Tomlinson adds. \"I'm sure he had been thinking about it for a while, but in reality, he wasn't happy and that's fine. It was actually a really strong time for all of us, as crazy as that sounds. Of course, it's a very traumatic time, in any field of work, when someone loses a member of the team. But it was important that we banded together and actually, we came out better for that. Our relationship as a four has been so strong since.\"\n\nGetting to make a new album, \"that's something you can never really wish for or hope for at that stage,\" says Payne, 22. \"You kind of think it's going to end there when somebody leaves. But we've definitely grown closer.\"\n\nIn the days and weeks to follow, much was made in the press about Twitter interactions between the remaining members and Malik, who signed a new deal with RCA Records this summer. One of the most notable spats happened in May, after U.K. producer Naughty Boy leaked a Malik collaboration and Tomlinson accused him of \"riding on the back of someone else's career.\" Malik hit back at Tomlinson, tweeting, \"Remember when you had a life and stopped making (expletive) comments about mine?\"\n\nMonths later, the guys insist there are no hard feelings. \"We know what happened,\" Horan says. \"I don't think it should be read into too much. Everyone's moved on.\"\n\nAs for whether any of the remaining members ever considered leaving, Tomlinson shrugs. \"No, not really. In reality, there's dark days for everyone, where everyone kind of contemplates everything. There's a lot of times where you'll feel a little down, and you're not seeing your friends and family for so long. Then you go on stage at night and that's what motivates you. You know all those people are so supportive and so behind you, and obviously, you want to impress them and make them proud.\"\n\nIt's a break, but 'not goodbye'\n\nAlthough fans were shocked and saddened when 1D announced its hiatus this summer, taking time off really should come as no surprise. After all, since coming together on the U.K.'s The X Factor in 2010, the boy band has released five albums including A.M. — a prolific, almost unheard of tally for most pop stars, who generally take one to three years (if not more) between releases.\n\n\"Obviously, we're not digging trenches or anything, but in comparison to a lot of artists in terms of how many albums and touring they're doing, it's been quite a lot,\" Styles says. For his part, Styles says he just wants to spend time with family and friends and catch up on some sleep. It's a sentiment echoed by his bandmates including Tomlinson, who is expecting a baby with American stylist Briana Jungwirth.\n\nDuring the break, he and Payne \"will definitely put some time aside to write together,\" Tomlinson says. The guys have also bandied about the idea of \"a little holiday — where that's to, we don't know yet. Any time (we've taken) a little break, even if it's just two weeks, by the end of that two weeks, you're looking forward to seeing everyone again. That's going to be pretty apparent after a couple of months, so of course we'll meet up.\"\n\nHaving just played the last show of their world tour on Halloween at England's Sheffield Arena, the hiatus is \"starting to hit home a little bit,\" Payne says. \"It is definitely really sad for us. But obviously, we're going back into it. So it's not goodbye, it's just, 'See you later.'\n\n\"It's like what Tigger used to say: 'Ta-ta for now.' \"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainment/music/coachella/2022/04/14/coachella-2022-updates-set-times-lineups-traffic-latest-photos/7318022001/", "title": "Coachella live updates: Run the Jewels gets political, checks on crowd", "text": "It's been nearly three years since music lovers gathered in Indio, Calif., for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, a hiatus that ends this weekend when nearly 100,000 people from all over the world reunite on the iconic Empire Polo Club fields ready to shed the burdens of pandemic-related restrictions.\n\nCheck back here for the sights, sounds, special guests and magic moments that make Coachella one of the most-anticipated music festivals in the world.\n\nIngenious style trend of the day: All ears\n\nWhat do you do when Easter falls during Coachella?

Resident hip-hop enthusiast Tom Coulter caught rapper J.I.D's Coachella debut, which included special guests EarthGang and Kenny Mason, before heading out to watch R&B artist Steve Lacy, who kept things simple without any guests (instead opting for a small band). Reporter Ani Gasparyan fought the urge to head bang along with punk fans at Mannequin Pussy's adrenaline-inducing performance, and reporter Ema Sasic enjoyed girl in red's down-to-earth performance despite the insane amount of sand swirling around. Sasic also enjoyed dancing along at Disclosure's high-energy set featuring Khalid, before learning what \"real hot girl s***\" is all about at Megan Thee Stallion's Coachella debut. Brian Blueskye appreciated Japanese Breakfast's fashion choices for their fun set, and finally Shad Powers ended the night on a high note with the youngest headliner in Coachella history, Billie Eilish, who was joined onstage by her brother FINNEAS and collaborator Khalid.\n\nSaturday's Passover Seder brings Jewish and non-religious festivalgoers together\n\nRapper Kosha Dillz (Rami Matan) was likely the only festivalgoer packing horseradish at the Coachella campgrounds Saturday. Dressed in full Moses attire — beard and all — as well as an MTV \"Wild 'N Out\" hat, Matan manned the Shabbat Tent to serve Passover Seder, a tradition that started in 1999 at Phish's Millennial shows.\n\nBut the Shabbat Tent is not just a place to celebrate Passover, it's also what Matan refered to as a \"hospitality tent\" where people come to rest, charge their phone or enjoy some food.\n\n\"We try to help everybody,\" Matan said. \"By the end of the festival, I want to make sure we help somebody. That's a priority.\"\n\nMore:Coachella 2022: Shabbat Tent offers Passover Seder for festivalgoers\n\nBillie Eilish shares the stage with Khalid\n\nKhalid was a busy guy on Coachella Weekend 1, Day 2. After appearing as a special guest to sing \"Talk\" during Disclosure's set at the Outdoor Theatre, he stuck around to make an appearance on the Coachella Stage with headliner Billie Eilish to sing their song \"lovely.\"\n\nReview:Billie Eilish delivers powerful, polished headliner set three years after prophetic debut\n\nMegan Thee Stallion rolls solo Saturday\n\nI'm sure we weren't the only ones predicting a big special guest moment on Saturday when Megan Thee Stallion took to the Coachella stage. We were wrong, but her set still impressed.\n\nReview:Megan Thee Stallion keeps the energy high for her 'hot girls,' 'big ole freaks'\n\nKhalid joins Disclosure as special guest to sing 'Talk'\n\nDuring an already chaotic Disclosure set Saturday night, the crowd went berserk when singer-songwriter Khalid joined the electronic duo for their hit song \"Talk.\" Khalid left after the one song, but for Disclosure's finale, the pair brought out a marching band to finish on an equally high note.\n\nPersistent fan gets Disclosure set off to raucous start\n\nAs the (very large) crowd gathered around golden hour for the Disclosure set at the Outdoor Theatre, some drama played out front row in the secured photo pit. A very persistent fan literally wormed his way past security guards ... twice. Shad Powers saw the whole thing unfold and reports on the audacious gate crash.\n\nFront row:Persistent fan at Disclosure set successfully worms past security guards — twice\n\nAnd check out reporter Ema Sasic's review of the boisterous set:\n\nReview:Disclosure gets Saturday night crowd on their feet with Khalid as guest\n\nBROCKHAMPTON to deliver finale at Coachella\n\nCoachella 2022 will be the last performances from the American boy band BROCKHAMPTON. The band canceled upcoming tour dates after announcing in January that it's breaking up. Kevin Abstract, the lead vocalist, posted on Twitter on Saturday that the group's 8:25 p.m. set at the Sahara tent Weekend 1 will be its second to last, and that its Weekend 2 set will be its last. — Laine Henry\n\nAnitta tabs Snoop Dogg, Saweetie and Diplo to be part of her set\n\nBrazilian singer Anitta put on a show-stopping performance in the late afternoon Friday at Coachella and she had some help along the way. She was introduced to the roaring crowd by Snoop Dogg who did not perform, but just sort of hung out in the background as part of the neighborhood of dancers that were on stage to mimic a Brazilian neighborhood. She was later joined on stage by Saweetie who helped her continue the steamy show by partnering on their song \"Faking Love.\" The set ended with a bit of a dance party with ever-present DJ Diplo running the show. — Shad Powers\n\nProducer Madlib won't perform with Freddie Gibbs on Saturday\n\nMadlib, the popular hip-hop DJ and producer, won't perform with rapper Freddie Gibbs on Saturday night \"due to personal reasons,\" the festival announced on Twitter.\n\nMadlib, a native of Oxnard, is well-known for his collaborations with rappers such as MF DOOM and J Dilla. Madlib and Gibbs are long-time collaborators, teaming up for several projects, including the hit album \"Piñata\" in 2014.\n\nGibbs remains on the schedule to perform at 9:35 p.m. Saturday at the Gobi stage. It's unclear whether Madlib still plans to perform with Gibbs on Weekend 2.\n\nWe found Diet Coke at Coachella\n\nYeah, lemonade is great. So is coffee, but not really at the top of the list for things I crave at a concert or festival. You know what I do crave (non-alcoholic)? Diet Coke. And there's nothing like a mid-afternoon Diet Coke craving at a festival to remind you that you are not part of the festival's target demographic. Dozens upon dozens of food vendors all pushing the limits of what I would call food, but nary a soda fountain in sight. And while it was not easy to find a Diet Coke, my co-worker who also shares my generational love of the brown stuff had a hunch he knew where to score. And score he did at the General Store. We did the leg work so you don't have to.\n\nThe food at Coachella 2022 is wild\n\nCoachella 2022 Day 2 is officially underway and at 1:30 p.m. crowds are very light — offering a prime opportunity to grab a bite to eat with little to no wait. Check out our roundup of some of the most interesting offerings throughout the grounds:\n\nFestival treats: Fun and unique things to eat while at the music festival\n\nAlso, Harry's House has transformed to a Billie Eilish-themed merch tent — Happier Than Ever — and the crowd at the general merch tent is much thinner than Friday.\n\nCoachella 2022 Day 1 in reviews\n\nCoachella 2022 Day 1 is in the books, and before we turn our attention to Day 2, let's take a few minutes to ~ review ~ our reviews. Spoiler alert, not a bad set to be found. From The Desert Sun staff, and please enjoy this amazing capture of Carly Rae Jepson from Desert Sun photographer Andy Abeyta.\n\nReview:Harry Styles dazzles in festival debut, Shania Twain joins on stage\n\nReview:Phoebe Bridgers connects with audience with moody vibes, stunning visuals\n\nReview:Arcade Fire, 'grown up' and reflective, returns to Coachella with emotional set\n\nReview:IDLES follows Arcade Fire on Mojave stage with a rambunctious set\n\nReview:Dream come true for Giselle Woo as she and Night Owls finally play Coachella\n\nReview:Carly Rae Jepsen energizes crowd with high-energy set, 'Call Me Maybe' singalong\n\nShania Twain joins Harry Styles during headlining set\n\nCounty queen Shania Twain has joined Harry Styles during his Friday night headlining set for a duet of \"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\" Twain has previously expressed her desire to perform with the heartthrob. Desert Sun reporter Ema Sasic has a full review of the high-energy show.\n\nJustin Bieber surprises fans watching Daniel Caesar\n\nNo stranger to the desert, singer Justin Bieber joined performer Daniel Caesar on the Coachella stage for a performance of \"Peaches.\"\n\nThe two, along with Giveon, joined forces on Bieber's hit that debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nBieber came out shirtless during his appearance with a backwards baseball cap on.\n\nArcade Fire brings Coachella back to a place in time\n\nArcade Fire needed its fans Friday night. And the crowd seemed to need Arcade Fire just as badly. Desert Sun reporter Paul Albani-Burgio reviewed the set in the context of how far the festival has evolved (strayed?) from its roots. Is the indie spirit still alive? The answer was a resounding yes after a highly energetic and cathartic set. Now the only question is will the band provide an encore Weekend 2?\n\nSeveral vendors lose power\n\nA small power outage outside the Craft Beer Area of the festival caused food vendors Prince St., Umami and Sumo Dog to lose power Friday night. Workers inside the booths continue to serve hungry patrons, however, using flashlights and \"making it work,\" as one employee told Desert Sun reporters.\n\nMedics called during Arcade Fire set\n\nArcade Fire stopped early during the first song of its set so medics and security could respond to a man in distress in the front row, according to a Desert Sun photographer at the scene. The man's injury or medical condition was unclear. The crowd yelled \"thank you for doing that,\" in response to the band stopping its set for a fan's well-being — seemingly a nod to how the band responded to the medical emergency differently than Travis Scott during the 2021 Astroworld tragedy.\n\nTribute to Ukraine high above the desert\n\nGolden hour is the most magical time on the field in Indio, and one of the first indications that it's approaching (other than the mellowing of the afternoon heat) is the release of the Balloon Chain. On Day 1 of Weekend 1, this annual art installation was even more special as it sent the colors of the Ukraine flag — blue and yellow — high above the desert.\n\nWhat would Coachella be without Vanessa Hudgens, Paris Hilton?\n\nDesert Sun reporter Ema Sasic is on the scene and will be tracking celebrity sightings for us throughout Weekend 1. So far we can report that many of the usual suspects — Vanessa Hudgens, Paris Hilton, Jaden Smith — are on the ground of headed this way.\n\nMeute marches to an unusual beat at Coachella\n\nWe've heard almost all music types wafting over the polo grounds through the years, but Meute, one of the first bands to hits the stage Friday, brought something new. They are a techno marching band from Germany. And whatever you're imagining that might sound like, you're probably right. The nine-man band came out with red marching band tops and featured a xylophone, trombone, tuba, sax, all the marching band staples. Yet like a true techno band, they sort of played what seemed like one continuous song and had the crowd pulsating and bouncing and anxiously waiting for the beat to finally drop so they could roar with delight. I had a smile on my face and so did the fans around me, except for one woman who put on a serious focused face as she mimicked one of the band members, doing what may be the first-ever recorded air trombone as she watched. — Shad Powers\n\nHot take on Coachella 2022 art: Underwhelming\n\nThe art installations are a huge part of the festivalgoers experience and can be more than a backdrop to priceless memories. They also challenge the viewer, offer shade, and serve as meeting spots throughout the day. The standout for 2022 so far is \"Circular Dimensions x Microscape\" by Cristopher Cichocki, where the artist was spinning in the early hours of the day. Check out Desert Sun Arts and Entertainment reporter Brian Blueskye's piece on the artists. But sorely missing are the interactive pieces ... think the Coachella Astronaut (“Escape Velocity”), the H.i.P.O. factory and “Caterpillar’s Longing,\" which evolved into a butterfly. Maybe some surprises are in store after dark.\n\nGates are now open, let the festival begin\n\nGates for Weekend 1 of Coachella opened at 12:22 p.m., eliciting the requisite cheer from the crowd. It's been a long wait for many, and the smiles are plenty from both staff and festivalgoers. We're checking out the grounds, but early thoughts are that the layout is similar to 2019. Those wanting Harry Styles merch will want to check out Harry's House in the lobby. Stay tuned for a first look at the art exhibits.\n\nCoachella venue map released\n\nSet times + venue map = go time. Reminder that gates open at noon.\n\nUltimate guide to Coachella\n\nIt's Coachella Day 1, and Desert Sun Features Editor Niki Kottmann has compiled a must-read Coachella 2022 guide to everything you need to know about this year's festival, including how to get there to what you absolutely need to bring (or you'll be kicking yourself).\n\nWhat you need to know about traffic\n\nThe Coachella campgrounds opened at 9 a.m. on Thursday, meaning traffic is going to be a real concern for festivalgoers and locals alike, in Indio and throughout the Coachella Valley. The Desert Sun's east valley reporter, Eliana Perez, has the scoop on road closures.\n\nCoachella weather forecast: Mild temps ... but wind for Weekend 1\n\nLongtime festivalgoers have seen it all when it comes to weather in Indio, Calif., during April. Think scorching temperatures, wind, rain ... sometimes all in one day. So there's good news and bad news in the forecast for the coming weekend. The good news? Relatively mild temperatures with highs mostly below 90. The bad? There's a lot of wind in the forecast, especially Saturday night. That means warm and sunny days will give way to bluster, chilly nights. Plan your wardrobe accordingly.\n\nCoachella cough: Here's how to protect yourself against the 'festival flu'\n\nCoachella Weekend 1 set times released, finally\n\nOK, now it's official. Weekend 1 set times were just released and after three years, reality is fully setting in that this festival is going to happen. Goldenvoice kept fans waiting longer than usual for this key piece of information. But now we have full confirmation of Arcade Fire's set at 6:45 p.m. Friday in the Mojave Tent.\n\nFestival darling Arcade Fire in the house\n\nUpdate: Arcade Fire is listed on the official set times list at 6:45 p.m. Friday in the Mojave Tent.\n\nCome music festival season, fans and journalists love to spend hours anticipating special musical guests who might make a surprise appearance on stage, and celebrity spotting. On Thursday, festival darling Arcade Fire fueled a lot of dreams with a cryptic post on Twitter hinting at ... something.\n\nArcade Fire is aware of the power of a surprise guest performance. In 2014, during the group's headlining set, the band announced a surprise guest of their own ... maybe. What looked to be two members of Daft Punk came on stage and performed a version of \"Get Lucky.\"\n\nWhile we didn't have Arcade Fire on our surprise guest bingo card, we are predicting Dua Lipa, SZA, J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar will pop up on stages throughout the weekend.\n\nThings to do at the Coachella campgrounds\n\nWell, it's nearly noon the day before the festival begins and set times still haven't dropped (see previous post). While we collectively hold our breath, here's a great guide from Desert Sun features reporter Ema Sasic about planned activities on the Coachella festival grounds and in the campgrounds, which opened at 9 a.m. Thursday.\n\nIn the campground, you can make some art, get your hair done and participate in a silent disco.\n\nFans anxiously await set times\n\nWith stages and tents scattered across the Empire Polo Club field, experienced festivalgoers know that the highly anticipated set times release is key to planning your weekend.\n\nWhile festival promoter Goldenvoice usually releases set times for each act scheduled to perform during Weekend 1 — which runs Friday, April 15 through Sunday, April 17 — about two days before the festival, fans on Thursday were still left twisting in the wind.\n\nAnd their impatience made for some priceless comments on official Coachella posts that were not the set times:\n\nOn an @coachella post promoting the HP Antarctic tent:\n\n@blakekloster makes a good point: \"well if the set times were out I would know when to see this\"\n\n@wolf6_actual quipped: \"Can HP collaborate with the time slots?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}]}

The monument will not affect any permits held by the area’s ski resorts, according to the administration.\n\nThomson Divide protection\n\nThe administration is proposing blocking for 20 years the development of mineral and energy resources from a natural gas-rich chunk in western Colorado.

Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, Gov. Jared Polis and Rep. Joe Neguse wrote in their letter to Biden.\n\nThe request comes as a massive conservation bill including Camp Hale has stalled in Congress. The CORE Act was introduced by Bennet, Hickenlooper and Neguse and Democrats contend the act would grow the state's outdoor recreation economy and protect public lands\n\nBut Colorado Republicans have called it a federal land grab that would restrict development of critical mineral and energy resources.\n\n\"I don't support the efforts of extremist environmentalists who are seeking to hijack this historic place to create a new land designation,\" Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe history of U.S. national monuments dates to the early 1900s, and protected areas are now located in 32 states, the District of Columbia and four American territories.\n\nDevils Tower, the almost otherworldly rock formation that juts nearly 900 feet skyward from the ground in Wyoming, was the first national monument. It was declared in September 1906 by then-President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nCalifornia and Arizona have the most national monuments, with 18, according to the National Park Service.\n\nThe last national monument declared in Colorado was Browns Canyon in 2015, by then-President Barack Obama. It was one of 26 created by Obama during his two terms, the most of any president.\n\nThe Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in Hawaii, the world's largest marine conservation area, is the country's largest national monument, encompassing 583,000 square miles of ocean.\n\nAmong the smallest national monuments are the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality in Washington, D.C., the African Burial Ground in New York, and Pullman in Illinois.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/politics/joe-biden-western-states-campaign-2022-midterms/index.html", "title": "Biden goes where he's wanted on Western swing ahead of critical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs President Joe Biden headed West this week, Air Force One flew over a string of states where marquee Senate and House races will determine which party controls Congress next year.\n\nIt didn’t land in any of them.\n\nThe President’s rare, four-day visit is unfolding with a careful measure of policy and politics, including multiple stops in Colorado, California and Oregon. But he bypassed some of the most critical Western terrain for Democrats in November: Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn both states, contests for governor and Senate, along with a handful of House races, could well tip the political dynamic for the second half of Biden’s first term – and determine which party controls the levers of government in two key presidential battlegrounds for 2024.\n\nThe calibrated approach reflects an election year reality: Biden remains an unpopular leader for Democrats, even as many of his policies – like infrastructure investments and new climate and health care legislation – prove broadly popular. Instead of stumping alongside some of this year’s most vulnerable candidates, Biden is using events in Democratic strongholds to highlight his achievements, make the case for his party and raise millions of dollars from donors.\n\n“President Biden knows where he’s wanted and where he’s not wanted,” a top Democratic official who works closely with the White House told CNN. “This isn’t his first midterm campaign.”\n\nThe President – who regularly talks to Democratic candidates and carefully tracks races for House, Senate and governor – has told advisers that he believes his best contribution to the midterm election campaign is using his megaphone to draw a sharp contrast with rivals whom he frequently derides as extreme “MAGA Republicans.”\n\nSince the start of September, Biden has appeared with a smattering of Democratic candidates, including during a Labor Day swing through Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and last week in upstate New York. But he’s held only a handful of large rallies and has twice been forced to postpone plans for a major political event in Florida – once because he contracted Covid and again for Hurricane Ian – but he is set to return before Election Day, party aides said.\n\nCandidates often seem more eager to appear with Biden when he is making an official appearance, like he did in Colorado on Wednesday with Sen. Michael Bennet – a loud advocate for designating Camp Hale, a high-altitude former training ground for the revered 10th Mountain Division, a national monument.\n\n“He came to the White House, and he said, ‘I told you what I need,’” Biden said during the event after bringing Bennet on stage. “And I said I’ll do it. You know why? I was worried he’d never leave the damn White House.”\n\nIn his bid for reelection, Bennet is encountering a far more competitive contest than he once imagined, facing Republican newcomer Joe O’Dea, who owns a Denver construction company and his making his first run for office. But Biden won Colorado by 13 percentage points, which makes it a far more hospitable environment for a presidential visit.\n\nAvoiding nationalizing critical races\n\nIt’s a much different story in neighboring Arizona or Nevada, where Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Catherine Cortez Masto are locked in two of the most difficult races of the year – in part because Republicans are seeking to link them to Biden and his administration’s policies.\n\nAt a debate last week, Kelly pushed back on the hot-button topic of immigration and sought to separate himself from his party and the White House.\n\n“I’ve stood up to Democrats when they’re wrong on this issue – including the President,” Kelly said. “When the President decided he was going to do something dumb on this and change the rules that would create a bigger crisis, I told him he was wrong.”\n\nThe White House is working closely with the Senate and House campaign committees and will send the President where he could be helpful, aides said, and will avoid traveling to areas where nationalizing the race would be seen as a detriment to candidates. The logistics of presidential travel also complicate some travel, aides said, because campaigns must help foot the expensive costs of Air Force One.\n\nHe has been deployed multiple times per week to raise money with donors: In ritzy New York or Boston apartments, Los Angeles backyards and even during virtual events. Biden was expected to appear alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday evening for an event in Los Angeles, raising millions of dollars for House Democrats.\n\nHe is set to headline a fundraiser October 20 in Philadelphia for John Fetterman, the Democratic Senate nominee, and is also scheduled to stop earlier in the day in western Pennsylvania. The commonwealth is not only the home of Biden’s birth, but also the site of one of the most competitive Senate contests in the country and has drawn frequent visits from Biden.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for sitting presidents to be more of a draw for donors than voters. In the lead-up to the 2014 midterms, then-President Barack Obama attended fundraisers multiple days a week, but wasn’t a frequent presence with Democratic candidates on the campaign trail.\n\nA pragmatic view of the campaign trail\n\nFor Biden, this election marks the 50th anniversary of winning his first Senate race in Delaware. Since 1972, he has had a front-row seat to the highs and lows of Election Day, which history shows is almost always unkind to the President’s party.\n\nBiden has always been pragmatic about his campaign trail draw: “I’ll come campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most,” he occasionally says in his speeches, a mantra he’s employed for decades.\n\nComing out of the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden’s aides said the President was eager to begin a more intensive travel schedule, including to tout his accomplishments and boost Democrats. After a winning streak over the summer, which included passage of key Democratic priorities in Congress and a decline in gas prices, Biden was particularly keen on speaking with Americans about what he’d achieved.\n\nViews of the President have slowly inched upward from a summertime slump, with 44% of American adults now approving of his of performance, according to the latest CNN poll, which is up from 38% in June and July polling.\n\nHis ratings have climbed 9 percentage points among Democrats and 8 points among independents since that previous poll, with the President’s image also seeing a 17-point improvement among Black Americans and an 11-point increase among adults younger than 45.\n\nThe White House is taking a measure of solace in those findings, advisers say, even as concern over inflation and the broader economy remain a significant challenge for the President.\n\nThe President’s aides are also closely monitoring an uptick in gas prices, spurred partly by certain refineries going offline for maintenance. For some of Biden’s senior team, no metric is more important ahead of November.\n\nDespite the uptick in Biden’s approval, the latest CNN poll found that 47% of voters say Biden will not be a factor in their midterm election vote. But among those who say they are sending a message through their November vote, 28% say it’s a vote in opposition to Biden, with only 23% saying it’s a vote to support his policies.\n\nA late push ahead of November 8\n\nIn the final stretch of the midterm election campaign, the President is scheduled to be on the road several days a week, aides said, promoting the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction Act and other achievements of the administration. Advisers say his schedule includes ribbon-cutting ceremonies and groundbreaking events – all of which are designed to generate local news coverage.\n\nIn some cases, Biden has appeared in states that neighbor critical battlegrounds, allowing him to promote his agenda without directly inserting himself into individual races. In September, Biden promoted the infrastructure law and his cancer moonshot initiative in Boston, where local coverage crossed the border into New Hampshire.\n\nAnd last week, Biden promoted manufacturing investments at a Volvo facility in Hagerstown, Maryland, just across the state line from Pennsylvania.\n\n“We’ve been very clear that the President is going to go out, the vice president is going to go out, the Cabinet Secretaries. And you’ll see Democrats in Congress – they’re going to talk about the success that we have seen in this administration the last 19 months,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week.\n\n“I don’t have any specific locations to share in the next four weeks,” she went on. “But, of course, the President loves being out there. And you will see – you’ll continue to see the President traveling.”\n\nIn addition to travel, the White House is making plans for the President to conduct more television interviews in the coming weeks, hoping to amplify his achievements. He is expected to do more interviews in the two months leading up to the midterm elections than during his entire time in office, aides said.\n\nAs he arrived in California on Wednesday night, Biden extended a long hug to Rep. Karen Bass, the Democratic nominee for Los Angeles mayor, who was once on his short list to be his running mate. And she hugged him back, a sign that being in Biden’s embrace is seen as good politics in her race.\n\nThe President will close out his Western swing with a visit to Oregon, which Biden carried by 17 percentage points just two years ago. But now, Democrats are deeply concerned about a remarkably competitive three-way contest for governor, along with two congressional seats that are in danger of slipping into Republican hands.\n\nHe is set to appear with Tina Kotek, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, and other local officials.\n\nWith a voter registration deadline looming October 18, the President’s stops in Portland are designed to excite Democrats and motivate independents as he lays out the stakes of potential Republican control of Congress and governor, which can help determine implementation of key parts of his agenda.\n\nWith only 25 days remaining until the November 8 election, aides said they are already planning for a low-key election night at the White House.

Brennand was responding to an unrelated call and saw Erik Cantu sitting in his car eating a hamburger.

Teach a rat that it can get water from a spigot only when its human cells are activated, and it will learn how in about two weeks. Pașca believes his work will eventually help scientists better understand psychiatric conditions – like autism and schizophrenia – and by using cells from typical brains in some rats and cells from people with brain conditions in others, he can see what's different.

We'll never fully recover, but we'll remember,\" Biden said before signing the law designating the memorial. Pulse survivors stood around the president as pictures of the 49 killed displayed on video screens.\n\n\"May no president ever have to sign another monument like this,\" Biden said.\n\nAt a separate White House event, Biden commemorated Pride month by appointing advocate Jessica Stern as a special envoy to advance the human rights of LGBTQ people around the world. Stern is executive director of OutRight Action International, a New York-based group that works to address human rights violations and abuses against LGBTQ people.\n\nThe special envoy position was created in the State Department in 2015 but has been vacant since Stern's predecessor, Randy Berry, left the job in 2017. Then-President Donald Trump chose not to replace Berry.\n\nMore:How Joe Biden became the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history\n\nAt the bill signing, Biden said the Pulse memorial represents a \"monument to the loss that occurred\" and \"an absolute determination that we're going to deal with this every single solitary day, and make sure that we're not in a position to see this happen again.\"\n\nThe president said those killed were \"family members, parents, friends, veterans, students, young, Black, Asian, Latino – all fellow Americans.\"\n\n\"And in their memory, and for the countless others forever scarred, is why I sign this today.\"\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and Congressional Equality Caucus members, including Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc. and Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., also attended the signing. They were joined by Lt. Col. Bree Fram, one of the highest-ranking openly transgender members of the military, and youth transgender advocates Stella Keating and Ashton Mota of the GenderCool Project.\n\nThe onePulse Foundation, the nonprofit group behind the push for a memorial, said in a statement the national designation means “that our federal government recognizes the depth of the tragedy of Pulse” and sends a message that “we will always outlove hate.”\n\nBiden, whom many advocates regard as the most LGBTQ-friendly president ever, has taken several steps to protect the rights of gay and transgender people since taking office in January.\n\nOn his first day in office, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to make sure that statutes covering sex discrimination also bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. He also rescinded the Trump administration's ban on openly transgender servicemembers from serving in the military.\n\nThe Pulse nightclub law is part of an effort to build a permanent memorial at the site in honor of the 49 people gunned down five years ago by a man armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle. Plans call for a reflecting pool, an open-air museum and an education center with gardens and a public plaza.\n\nThe project is estimated to cost $45 million. The new law dictates that no federal funds can be used to establish the memorial, but county and state governments, as well as various corporations, have donated millions of dollars to the project. The memorial won’t be a unit of the National Park System.\n\nMore:'Keep dancing Orlando': Five years later, Pulse nightclub shooting survivors seek to embody strength of LGBTQ community\n\nThe attack on the club in the early morning hours of June 12, 2016, was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting until a gunman killed 60 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas a year later.\n\nThe Pulse gunman, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at the club before he was killed in a shootout with police. Patrons at the nightclub said Mateen had hung out at the bar for years.\n\nLegislation to establish the memorial passed the Senate on June 9, three days before the fifth anniversary of the attack. The House approved its own version of the bill on May 12.\n\nAt the Pride event in the White House East Room, Biden celebrated the progress that has been made on LGBTQ rights but warned that the fight is far from over.\n\nHe was joined by other LGBTQ members of his administration, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who warned of \"an especially dangerous political strategy\" arising in some states that are pushing a series of new laws to restrict transgender rights.\n\nButtigieg, the first openly gay cabinet secretary confirmed by the Senate, accused politicians behind those laws of trying to gain a political advantage \"by picking on transgender kids.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Biden called on Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would expand protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to bar discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity. He also denounced state statutes targeting transgender rights as \"some of the ugliest, most un-American laws I've seen.\"\n\nOverall, though, the mood was festive, with Biden declaring, \"Pride is back at the White House.\"\n\n\"This afternoon, we celebrate,\" he said. \"Tomorrow we go back to work.

While Biden has expanded some existing national monuments since becoming president, Wednesday marks the first time the President has used the 1906 Antiquities Act to create a national monument since taking office.\n\nAt the camp in Vail, Colorado, Biden called national monuments “treasures and wonders that define the identity of us as a nation.”\n\n“They’re a birthright that we pass down from generation to generation. And they unite us – and that’s what today is all about. We’re doing it not just for today but for all the ages,” he said. “And it’s for the people of Colorado, but it’s also goes well beyond the people of Colorado. It’s for all the people across America and the world. It’s a permanent, permanent decision, an action that no future president can overturn.”\n\nBiden said the Colorado lands “tell a story of America,” acknowledging that tribal nations have, for thousands of years, “been stewards of this sacred land, hunting game, foraging for medicinal plants and maintaining a deep spiritual bond with the land itself.”\n\nMaking Camp Hale a national monument will protect the site from development. The designation, the official said, will also “support jobs and America’s outdoor recreation economy.”\n\nCamp Hale, which is located in part of the ancestral homelands of the Ute Tribes, served as a training site for the US Army’s 10th Mountain Division before their deployment to the Italian Alps in World War II. Soldiers trained in rugged terrain, learning how to ski, climb and snowshoe in the Rocky Mountains before traveling to fight in the war. Many soldiers returned to the area after the war to help develop the local ski industry.\n\nAdditionally, the President announced that the administration is tapping into funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to mitigate the impacts of drought in the Colorado River Basin. And the US Department of the Interior is announcing it is moving to pause new mineral leasing or oil and gas leasing in the newly protected area.\n\nColorado’s Thompson Divide hasn’t been available to oil and gas leasing for several years and there’s no current or planned future oil exploration in the area, the department said in a news release. Natural gas leases already established in the area would be unaffected by the move, but they make up less than 1% of Colorado’s overall federal oil and gas leases.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland will also move to block new mining leases in the nearly 225,000-acre area. That step will need to go through a public comment period before it is finalized.\n\nSpeaking about the leases, Biden said on Wednesday “that there’s no current or planned oil exploration production in the area. We’re just keeping things as they’ve been for a long time … while we study whether we can get this done.”\n\nColorado Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis joined the President at the event along with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory, and additional local and tribal leaders.\n\nOne year ago, Biden announced the expansion of three existing national monuments – Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine – in a move that restored protections that had been undone by then-President Donald Trump. At the time, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said his state’s national monuments were being used as a “political football.”\n\nSome Coloradans have opposed Biden’s executive moves to expand federal protections, saying it could prevent future energy exploration. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, whose district includes the Thompson Divide, and other GOP members of Congress sent a letter to Biden opposing the President’s actions.\n\nColorado Democrats have pressed the White House to take the step in order to preserve an area of environmental and historical significance. Designating Camp Hale has been a key priority for Bennet, who faces a competitive race for reelection next month.\n\nAfter visiting Vail, Biden is slated to make stops in Los Angeles and Orange County in California, as well as Portland, Oregon.

Federal land management decisions often become politically charged throughout the rural West, where Republican-leaning ranching communities skeptical of federal overreach are often pitted against conservationists and tribes who argue robust federal protections are needed as a bulwark against development or industries like mining or logging.\n\n'Missing from our history books':National parks director wants to increase tribal nations' role in managing public lands\n\nNative America:Indigenous travel across the country\n\nThe new lawsuit is the latest twist in a yearslong debate spanning three presidential administrations. Its arguments revisit familiar legal and political debates and touch on points Republicans have for years repeated in court and in campaign speeches about federal land grabs and advantages of local land management.\n\nThe challenge from Utah and two right-leaning rural jurisdictions, Kane and Garfield counties, had been expected since Biden restored the lands in October 2021. At that time, Biden called Bears Ears “a place of reverence and a sacred homeland to hundreds of generations of native peoples.”\n\nThe monuments, which together are nearly the size of Connecticut, contain canyons surrounded by pink ribbons of limestone, dramatic red rock mesas and buttes, juniper forests and Native American artifacts including ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs.\n\n’It's like a healing for our ancestors’:Native tribal group reclaims California redwood forest\n\nIn a Wednesday joint statement in support of the lawsuit, Gov. Spencer Cox and Utah's entire congressional delegation accused the federal government of not properly managing the land and blamed the expanded monuments for “unmanageable visitation levels.”\n\n“We now challenge this repeated, abusive federal overreach to ensure that our public lands are adequately protected and that smart stewardship remains with the people closest to the land,\" said the group, whose signatories included U.S. Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration had no comment about the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit brings the battle over these lands back to the courtroom, similar to what happened in 2017 after Trump made his move to shrink the monuments. At that time, lawsuits were filed by outdoor company Patagonia and a coalition of tribes including the Hopi, Ute Indian, Ute Mountain Ute, Zuni tribes and Navajo Nation to restore the monuments.\n\n'A defender of this place we call our home':Q&A with the National Park Service's first Native American director\n\n“The tribes have been fighting for decades, and really centuries, to protect these lands,\" Matthew Campbell, deputy director of the Native American Rights Fund, said Wednesday. “It looks like they will have to continue that fight.”\n\nThe part of southeastern Utah where the two monuments are located has been at the center of some of the country’s most heated land management debates since President Bill Clinton designated Grand Staircase a national monument in 1996.\n\nBears Ears, which was designated a National Monument by President Barack Obama, is unique because land management decisions are made by a commission jointly governed by federal agency officials and representatives from five tribal nations. The commission was reestablished this past June, five years after it and an Obama-era joint governance plan was scrapped when the Trump administration downsized the monuments in 2017.\n\n'They're finally listening':Indigenous peoples play major role in climate report\n\nThat decision opened parts of the monuments up for mining, drilling and other development. Low demand and high production costs led to minimal interest from energy companies in the lands that became unprotected when Trump downsized the monuments, including a large coal reserve found in the lands cut from Grand Staircase or uranium on lands cut from Bears Ears.\n\nUtah's lawsuit argues the Biden administration interpreted the 1906 Antiquities Act in an overly broad manner and disregarded its original intent: protecting particular historical or archaeological sites. It cites provisions of the act that say designations should encompass “the smallest area compatible” with preservation goals.\n\nDemocratic presidents have argued designating large swaths of land is needed to protect certain areas and in his October 2021 proclamation, Biden called the Bears Ears designation “the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic and scientific interest.\"\n\nContributing: Aamer Madhani, AP", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/12/la-city-council-recession-railroad-strike-ukraine-prime-day/10464664002/", "title": "LA City Council, Ukraine, recession, railroad strikes, Amazon Prime ...", "text": "A leaked recording that revealed racist comments by Los Angeles City Council members came to a head during a rowdy – and at times chaotic – city council meeting.

Even as Biden climbed to the dais in the House of Representatives, Kyiv was bracing for an all-out Russian assault that could lead to the occupation of the capital and the overthrow of the nation's democratically elected government.\n\nRead the whole story here:A world of change: Biden seeks his footing as his agenda and the landscape are transformed\n\nWho heckled Biden?\n\nA notable moment in the State of the Union came when Biden talked about talked about the flag-draped coffins of fallen service members, including his son, Beau, who died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46.\n\nAs Biden spoke about Beau, people inside the House chambers reported someone shouting, “You put them in there, 13 of them.\" After the comment was made, attendees in the chambers began to boo and groan at the comment, as Biden paused for a brief moment and continued his address.\n\nBoebert later confirmed on Twitter she in fact made the comment, in reference to the 13 U.S. soldiers who were killed in a suicide bombing attack at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport in August as the Taliban took over Afghanistan and Afghans attempted to flee the country.\n\n--Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden touts Justice Breyer, Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nIn one of the more touching moments of Biden’s remarks Tuesday, the president briefly recognized Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced he will step down from the Supreme Court after nearly three decades.\n\nBreyer, holding his hands over his heart and, at one point, his face, appeared to be embarrassed by the attention. Breyer, who will retire in June, approached Biden after the address and the two spoke for several minutes and shared a laugh.\n\n“Thank you for your service,” Biden said to Breyer during the speech. “Thank you. Thank you.”\n\nBiden nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for Breyer’s seat on Friday, and the Miami native, who has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit since June, has started to meet with members of the Senate who will vote on her confirmation later spring.\n\nThe president described Jackson as a “consensus builder” but made no mention, as he has in other venues, of what makes Jackson a historic candidate: She would be the first Black woman ever to serve on the nation’s highest court.\n\nAt 51, Jackson could serve on the Supreme Court for decades. Democrats are seeking to confirm Jackson by early April.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nWho is Joshua Davis? Here's more about the 13-year-old who stole the show at State of the Union\n\nOf all the guests invited to President Joe Biden's first State of the Union address, one of the few mentioned was 13-year-old Joshua Davis. Davis, who is from Midlothian, Virginia, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was just 11 months old, according to the White House.\n\nAt the age of four, Davis began advocating for the Virginia General Assembly to make \"school safer for kids with Type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the seventh-grader at Swift Creek Middle School introduced President Biden at an event on prescription drug costs at a community college in Virginia.\n\n--Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden's report on the State of the Union: Strong\n\nThe president struck an optimistic tone in his concluding remarks, praising American values and calling the moment a \"test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\"\n\n\"It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged,\" he said. \"We will meet this test.\"\n\nBiden acknowledged while the country has faced a challenging period, he is \"more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.\"\n\nThe president waited until the end of his speech, which lasted more than an hour, to deliver his report on the state of the union: \"strong.\"\n\n\"Because you, the American people, are strong,\" he said as the crowd erupted in cheers. \"We are stronger today than we were a year ago. And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.\"\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden says Americans can order more COVID tests from the government starting next week\n\nAmericans will be able to order more free coronavirus tests from the government starting next week, President Joe Biden announced during Tuesday's State of the Union address.\n\n\"Even if you already ordered free tests, tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week,\" Biden said, adding the government has made hundreds of millions of tests available for free.\n\nAmericans were able to start ordering the free tests from the Covidtests.gov website on Jan. 18.\n\n-- Kelly Tyko\n\nRead the rest here:Biden says Americans can order more COVID tests from the government starting next week\n\nBiden vows to address soldiers’ exposure to ‘burn pits’\n\nBiden announced that his administration is expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from respiratory cancers and promised to examine the issue of troops’ exposure to “burn pits.”\n\nBurn pits are used to incinerate jet fuel, medical materials and other wastes of war. Many soldiers who breathe smoke from them develop headaches, numbness, dizziness and even cancer, Biden said.\n\n“I know,” he said. “One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.”\n\nBeau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46.\n\n“We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer or the diseases of so many of our troops,” Biden said. “But I’m committed to finding out everything we can.”\n\n-– Michael Collins\n\nBiden: ‘Let's end cancer as we know it’\n\nBiden highlighted his announcement last month to relaunch the Cancer Moonshot, an issue close to the president’s heart after his son, Beau, died of brain cancer.\n\n“Let's end cancer as we know it,” he said.\n\nBiden noted that the fight to end cancer is personal for him and First Lady Jill Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother died of colon cancer.\n\n“So many of you lost someone you love: Husband wife, son, daughter, mom, dad,” Biden added.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nLawmakers react in the chamber following speech\n\nFollowing the speech, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., walked towards the front of the chamber to take a photo of Vice President Harris and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"Most powerful ladies in the world,\" Gillibrand shouted as she took the picture.\n\nBiden was swarmed by lawmakers as he exited the chamber. Rep. Adam Schiff shook his hand, and Biden placed his hand on Schiff's shoulder. Others took selfies and photos with the president in the background as he spoke to members on his way to the exit.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nMaking history:For first time, two women sat behind president at State of the Union\n\nBiden slams social media for effects on children\n\nBiden connected young people’s mental health to social media platforms, saying they must be held accountable for what he called a “national experiment” being conducted on children for profit.\n\nUnder the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration funneled millions into schools to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Children were also struggling before the pandemic,” he said “Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.”\n\n“It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children,” he said.\n\nProposals mentioned by the president include strengthening privacy protections, banning targeted advertising to children and stopping the collection of personal data on children.\n\nBiden also acknowledged Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen in the chamber and thanked her for her courage.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey, Chelsey Cox\n\nBig tech:Did Facebook ignore warnings that Instagram is unhealthy for kids? States are investigating\n\nBiden: We can secure the border and fix the immigration system\n\nBiden renewed calls for immigration reform while also bolstering security at the U.S. southern border, remarks that drew chants of \"build the wall,\" from Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.\n\n\"And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system,\" Biden said. \"We can do both.\"\n\nThe president said the U.S. implemented new technology to better detect drug smuggling, set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch human traffickers and is supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nBiden also called for obtaining legal status for so-called Dreamers, or undocumented immigrations who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, as well as those who have temporary status, farm workers and essential workers.\n\n\"It’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do,\" he added.\n\n-- Courtney Subramnaian\n\nBiden calls for ‘proven measures’ to reduce gun violence\n\nBiden vowed to cut down on gun trafficking and called on Congress to pass what he called “proven measures” to reduce gun violence.\n\nSpecifically, he urged lawmakers to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and repeal liability shield that mean gun makers can’t be sued.\n\n“These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment,” he said. “They save lives.”\n\n–- Michael Collins\n\nBiden: Nominee Jackson a ‘consensus builder’\n\nBetween the crisis in Ukraine, soaring inflation and a stalled domestic agenda, Biden doesn’t have a lot of good news to tout at his State of the Union address this year.\n\nOne exception: His recently announced historic nominee to the Supreme Court, U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nBiden called Jackson “one of our nation’s top legal minds” and a “consensus builder.” Jackson would be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president tried to signal bipartisan support for Jackson as she begins meeting with senators ahead of a confirmation hearing this spring.\n\n“Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support -- from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said.\n\nSenate Democrats hope to confirm Jackson to the high court by early April.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nBiden: Right to vote ‘under assault’\n\nBiden called on Congress to pass voting rights legislation, saying that the right to vote is “under assault.”\n\n\"The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted,” Biden said. “And it’s under assault.”\n\nHe added that he would like to see Congress pass the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Act.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nAmerican Rescue Plan essential to keep neighborhoods safe, Biden says\n\nPresident Biden touted his American Rescue Plan as an asset to community safety.\n\nThe plan, which was approved by Democrats in Congress last March, provides $350 billion in direct aid to cities, states and counties that can be used to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption.\n\n“We should all agree, the answer is not to defund the police, it’s to fund the police,” Biden said to cheers and applause.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nMore:President Joe Biden's COVID stimulus bill explained in 6 charts\n\nCOVID-19 reset\n\nBiden reflected on how COVID-19 has challenged the country since 2020, but that with roughly three-fourths of Americans fully vaccinated, and hospitalizations down by 77%, “most Americans can removed their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom and move forward safely.”\n\nThe president touched on how that has been the result of free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks. But Biden noted how this is a pivotal moment for Americans to stay focused in the face of the contagion’s possible resurgence.\n\n“Let’s use this moment to reset,” he said. “Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.”\n\nBiden noted how many lives have been lost, and that Americans cannot let the contagion divide them further.\n\n“We can’t change how divided we’ve been,” he said. “But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.”\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution by state:How many people have been vaccinated in the US?\n\nBiden: End the 'partisan dividing line'\n\nIn his speech, Biden asked Republicans to stop using the COVID pandemic as a \"partisan dividing line\" – and to lower the temperature on a whole host of important issues.\n\n\"Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies,\" the president said, \"and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nBiden: Bring an end to shutdowns of schools and businesses\n\nThe president called for bringing COVID-19-related shutdowns of schools and businesses to an end as the country moves into a new phase of living with the pandemic.\n\n\"It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office,\" he said. \"Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\"\n\nBiden also noted that with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their mask as they return to classrooms and offices.\n\nHe told the mostly maskless crowd that continuing his administration COVID-19 response efforts would cost more money and he intended to send Congress a request for more funds.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden outlines plans to lower deficit\n\nThe president urged lawmakers to confirm his nominees to head the Federal Reserve, calling it crucial to his plan to fight inflation.\n\nBiden said his plan is designed to “monitor and lower costs” and “give families a fair shot” while also lowering the deficit.\n\n“The previous administration not only ballooned the deficit, it undermined the watchdogs of those pandemic relief funds,” Biden said, and added that his administration reprioritized going after criminals who commit pandemic relief-related fraud.\n\nBiden also stated that he is the only president to have cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion dollars in a single year and vowed to even the economic playing field for Americans.\n\n“Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation,” Biden said.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden on COVID: ‘We’re moving forward’\n\nBiden said the United States has made progress to move past COVID-19, noting the updated mask guidelines issued by the CDC last week.\n\n“Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines,” he said. “We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19.\"\n\n“COVID-19 need no longer control our lives,” he added.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden vows to crack down on price gouging\n\nBiden announced a crackdown on companies that practice price gouging.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits, he said.\n\n\"I’m a capitalist,” he said. “But capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation – and it drives up prices.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n‘Secret ballot’ on taxes?\n\nBiden challenged Congress to adopt his plan at reforming the tax code, promising that under his plan no one earning less than $400,000 a year would “pay an additional penny in new taxes.”\n\n“I may be wrong but my guess is if we took a secret ballot on this floor that we’d all agree that the president tax system ain’t fair,” Biden said. “We have to fix it.”\n\nThe president’s remarks received a more lukewarm response, especially from congressional Republicans, who have resisted his idea.\n\nBut Biden’s pitch to the American people argued that his tax plan would grow the economy and doesn’t “punish anyone” but rather seeks to even the playing field by ensuring U.S. companies and its wealthiest individuals to “start paying their fair share.”\n\n“Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax,” Biden said. “That’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.”\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSome Republicans take notes, joke to colleagues during Biden's speech\n\nSome Republican Senators appear to be taking notes on Biden's remarks, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., turned to Scott and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., and moved his hand up and down, appearing to point out Democrats standing up and down in applause, garnering laughter from his colleagues.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nBiden calls for reviving plan for child care and universal pre-kindergarten\n\nThe president reiterated his longstanding call to cut the cost of child care for parents, pointing out that most American families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. A recent report by Child Care Aware of America found the price of child care has exceeded the annual inflation rate by 4 percent in 2020.\n\n\"Middle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children,\" he said.\n\nBiden's child care plan is part of his Build Back Better bill that was effectively killed after Sen. Joe Manchin announced late last year he wouldn't vote to pass it. The president also called for reviving plans to cut the cost of home and long-term care and creating a plan for universal pre-kindergarten for every 3- and 4-year-old.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden pushes for climate investments as part of his inflation pitch\n\nBiden called for several climate investments that he said will save families money as part of his efforts aimed at tackling rising inflation.\n\nThat included investment tax credits for Americans to weatherize their homes, doubling clean energy production and lowering the price of electric vehicles.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nMore:UN panel's grim climate change report: 'Parts of the planet will become uninhabitable'\n\nBiden touts ‘revitalization’ of American manufacturing\n\nBiden praised what he said is the revitalization of the American manufacturing and said he agreed with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown that it’s time to bury the “Rust Belt” label.\n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories in the United States when just a few years ago they would have built them overseas, he said.\n\nFord is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country, he said. GM is making the largest investment in its history – $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nBiden said the revitalization is being driven by people like Joseph “JoJo” Burgess, a Pennsylvania steelworker who was seated in the first lady’s viewing box.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden called on lowering the cost of drug prices, such as insulin.\n\nThe president shouted out Joshua Davis, a 13-year-old with diabetes, who attended the address.\n\n“For Joshua & the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it,” Biden said.\n\nHe added that he spoke with Joshua’s mom about how hard it's been to afford the drug.\n\n“Imagine what it's like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God's name you're going to be able to pay for it,” Biden said.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\n'It is legal extortion':Diabetics pay steep price for insulin as rebates drive up costs\n\nBiden aims for investment in Intel, competitiveness with China\n\nIntel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, recently unveiled plans to build a $20 billion complex outside of Columbus, Ohio, a move Biden hailed as a major sign of progress in his administration's work to boost U.S. production of the critical microchips at a time of rising competition with China.\n\n“That's why it's so important to pass the bipartisan (Innovation and Competition Act) in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing,” Biden said. The president also acknowledged Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was invited to the speech.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden: We can cut inflation by making more things in the U.S.\n\nBiden said one way to reduce inflation – one of his biggest political problems – is to make more products in the United States, reducing rely on blocked supply chains.\n\n\"Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America,\": he said.\n\nThe president was not very specific about how to do that; Republicans say his proposed environment regulations will choke industry.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden touts ‘infrastructure decade’\n\nShifting from Ukraine, Biden touted his American Rescue Plan legislation and infrastructure law, the latter of which he got support from Republicans to pass in the evenly divided Senate.\n\n“I want to thank members of both parties who helped make it happen,” Biden said. “We’re done talking about infrastructure week. We’re talking about the infrastructure decade.”\n\nHe pointed to broadband expansion, roadway and bridge repairs and lead pipe replacement among the projects that will be funded.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nBiden says Putin ‘will never gain the hearts’ of Ukrainians\n\nBiden said that Democracies are “rising to the moment” as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin may be able to circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people,” he said. \"He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.\"\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden: U.S. to release 30 million barrels from Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nBiden said the U.S. is working with 30 countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around world to ease the impact of the war in Ukraine on energy markets.\n\nThe U.S. is leading the effort by releasing 30 million barrels from its own Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he said.\n\n“These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home,” he said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nStanding ovation for Biden’s vow to defend NATO countries\n\nDespite Russia’s devastating attack on Ukraine, President Biden reiterated support in the form of economic sanctions, not the deployment of U.S. troops, to the vulnerable area.\n\n“We have mobilized American ground forces, air squadron, ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

He pledged that the U.S., along with European allies, will look seize Russian yachts, luxury apartments and private jets.\n\n“We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” Biden said.\n\nAmerica has seen immediate dividends with its economic sanctions and $1 billion in aid to Ukraine, according to the president, who said that along with closing U.S. air space to all Russian flights the Ruble has lost 30% of its value; its stock has dipped by 40% and trading with the foreign country has been halted.\n\n-- Phillip M.

He’s also expected to urge Congress to pass his $300 million budget request to more than double the size of the Department of Justice’s COPS community policing grant program.\n\nRepublicans have sought to tie Biden and other Democrats to the “defund the police” mantra on the left, even though Biden has repeatedly rejected that phrase.\n\n“He'll make clear that the answer is not to defund the police, it’s to put more police – with better training and more accountability – out to take back our streets and make our neighborhoods safer,” a White House official said.\n\nAlthough Republicans in the Senate have refused to pass sweeping gun reform measures, Biden will point to his administration's unilateral efforts. That includes creating five new Justice Department gun trafficking strike forces to target the illegal; an executive order aimed at “ghost guns,” and new ATF rules.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nU.S. to close airspace to Russian planes\n\nBiden will announce in his State of the Union address that the U.S. is closing its airspace to Russian planes in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, three sources told USA TODAY.\n\nThe U.S. joins a growing list of countries that have announced plans to close their airspace to Russian aircraft in response to the invasion.\n\nThe E.U. banned all Russian aircraft from its airspace after several European countries including France, Italy and Denmark as well as Canada announced the move Sunday.

Victoria Spartz, of Indiana, who was born in Ukraine, will wear a blue suit and yellow blazer to draw attention to the crisis. She took to Twitter ahead of the president’s remarks calling on the Biden administration to do more.\n\n“Putin’s war is not a war but a genocide of the Ukrainian people who wanted to be free and with us,” Spartz said. “We cannot let him embarrass our great nation and slaughter these brave people under our watch.\"\n\nRep. Brett Guthrie, of Kentucky, showed off how dozens of members from both parties had gathered on the Capitol steps before the address with a flag merging the U.S. and Ukrainian colors.\n\n“Today I joined my colleagues to show solidarity for the Ukrainian people,” Guthrie, a Republican, said. “Their bravery in the fight against Putin's unlawful and unprovoked invasion is inspiring. I support sending more aid to Ukraine and crushing Putin and his associates with a powerful arsenal of sanctions.”\n\nThe Democratic Women’s Caucus earlier Tuesday announced its members plan to “wear bright and colorful attire” in support Ukraine.\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSOTU comes as inflation soars\n\nBiden delivers his State of the Union address at a time when inflation has soared to its highest level in four decades.\n\nConsumer prices jumped 7.5% last month compared with 12 months earlier, the steepest year-over-year increase since February 1982, the Labor Department reported last month. The increase was driven by shortages of supplies and workers, heavy doses of federal aid, low interest rates and robust consumer spending, the department said.\n\nThe steady surge in prices has left many Americans less able to afford food, gas, rent, child care and other necessities.\n\n-- Michael Collins, Associated Press\n\nExplained:What is inflation and how does it affect you? Increase in prices for gas, food, energy raise concern\n\nCongresswoman to pass out ribbons to show Ukraine solidarity\n\nRep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, will pass out blue and yellow ribbons to members of congress at Biden’s State of the Union to “wear tonight in solidarity with the people of Ukraine,” the Democratic Women’s Caucus said.\n\nKaptur is leader of the Ukraine Caucus.\n\nIn addition, some congresswomen were seen wearing blue and yellow, the color of Ukraine’s flag, in a photo posted by Michelle Moreno-Silva, communications director of the Democratic Women’s Caucus.\n\nMoreno-Silva said members of the Democratic Women’s Caucus are planning to “wear bright and colorful attire to the State of the Union in celebration of the strength and diversity of the Caucus.”\n\nThe caucus first asked members to don white at the 2019 State of the Union in honor of the Women's Suffrage Movement that led to the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920. The lawmakers wanted to acknowledge voters who gave Democrats a majority in the House that year.\n\nThe tradition continued in 2020 in protest \"against President Trump's backwards agenda.\"\n\n-- Rebecca Morin and Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden to deliver speech as Russian convoy inches toward Kyiv\n\nBiden's State of the Union speech comes on day six of Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the international crisis is expected to be a focal point of his speech.\n\nA 40-mile convoy of Russian tanks and vehicles appeared to stall about 15 miles outside of Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv. Troops appeared to run out of gas and food, but it's also possible the Russians are pausing to regroup and reassess their attack, a senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Tuesday.\n\nUkrainians are bracing for continued attacks after at least 11 people were killed and 35 others wounded in an apparent rocket strike in Kharkiv. Earlier, Russian strikes hit Kyiv's main broadcasting tower and the nearby Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial site, where Nazis killed thousands of Jews during World War II. Ukraine's foreign minister confirmed the attack.\n\nAhead of his remarks, Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more than 30 minutes. The president said he discussed continued U.S. support, including security assistance and humanitarian aid, and vowed to hold Russia accountable.\n\nFor more updates on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, follow USA TODAY's live coverage here.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nMore:Satellite images show huge Russian convoys in Ukraine\n\nWhat will Biden talk about?\n\nBiden’s remarks to a joint session of Congress will give him a chance to trumpet his administration’s accomplishments during his first year in office and lay out policy goals for the coming year.\n\nA prominent Democratic strategist urged Biden to use the opportunity to offer Americans hope for better days.\n\n“What Americans want to hear is genuine understanding of what we have been through together and a clear path forward – less about Mr. Biden’s accomplishments than about the heroic, unsung sacrifices so many have made to see their families and communities through,” David Axelrod, who helped shape many of President Barack Obama’s addresses to Congress, wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times.\n\nWhat else is bound to come up? Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will cast a long shadow over Biden’s State of the Union address. Biden will seek to reassure the country that it's entering a new phase in the fight against COVID-19. And the president wants Americans to know that he feels their pain when it comes to rising prices.\n\nRead more here on expectations for the address.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to address Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nBiden will address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine during his address, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks released by the White House.\n\n“Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising,” he is expected to say.\n\n“That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.\n\n“It matters. American diplomacy matters.\n\n“Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And, he thought he could divide us here at home.\n\n“Putin was wrong. We were ready,” he will say.\n\nMore:Russia has been accused of using 'vacuum bombs' in Ukraine. What are those?\n\nBiden to talk about inflation and the US economy\n\nBiden will also address inflation — an issue that is a top concern for the American people -- according to prepared remarks released by the White House.\n\n“We have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I have a better plan to fight inflation,” he is expected to say.\n\n“Lower your costs, not your wages. Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And, instead of relying on foreign supply chains – let’s make it in America.\n\n“Economists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” I call it building a better America,” he will say.\n\n“My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit,” he is expected to say.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden speech focus: The U.S. and Europe must be united against Russia\n\nPreviewing his State of the Union speech to a group of journalists, President Joe Biden said he will stress the importance of unity between the United States and Europe in confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a lunch with television anchors and others, Biden said he would re-emphasize \"my determination to see to it that the EU, NATO, all of our allies are on the same exact page in terms of sanctions against Russia and how we deal with the invasion – and it is an invasion – of Ukraine.\"\n\nThis from a tweet by CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who also reported that Biden declared global unity \"the one thing that gives us power to impose severe consequences on Putin for what he’s done.\"\n\nPresidents host these kinds of lunches with television anchors before every State of the Union address. The sessions are off the record, but White Houses often put a few comments on the record.\n\nIn this case, Biden wanted to make clear his message on Ukraine.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nMore:Americans are at higher risk of Russian cyberattacks after Ukraine invasion: What you should do right now\n\nBiden will roll out mental health crisis strategies\n\nBiden will outline his plan for tackling the mental health crisis during his first State of the Union.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that Biden will call on Congress to pass legislation to support those policies that increase the capacity of the mental health system to provide care, make it easier for those who need care to get it and address the determinants of health.\n\nAmong the policies he will pitch, according to the White House:\n\nA plan to spend $700 million on training, scholarship and loan repayment for those who pursue careers in mental health and substance abuse treatment in rural communities and other underserved areas.\n\nA proposal that health plans cover \"robust behavioral health services with an adequate network of providers, including three behavioral health visits each year without cost-sharing.\"\n\nTo address concerns about digital technology and social media damage to the mental health of young people, Biden wants to ban targeted advertising for children online and stop online algorithms from returning results that damage their mental well-being.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nPelosi won’t be wearing a mask during State of the Union\n\nAs she sits behind President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be mask-less.\n\n“I’m not going to be wearing a mask tonight,” Pelosi told MSNBC Tuesday. “If I had little children, or if I were around little grandchildren I would because some of them would not be vaccinated.”\n\nDemocratic House leadership lifted its mask mandate in the House in time for the president’s first State of the Union. It comes as the rate of positive COVID-19 test results dropped to 2.7% at the Capitol’s testing site, according to Politico, and as the District of Columbia dropped its indoor mask mandate as COVID-19 cases have plummeted in Washington.\n\nThe White House on Tuesday ended its mask requirement for vaccinated staff members. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday said she hadn’t spoken to Biden on whether he will wear a mask when he walks into the House Chamber.\n\n“He will certainly not be wearing a mask when he's speaking,” Psaki said.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat was the shortest State of the Union? the longest?\n\nWhich presidents delivered the longest and the shortest State of the Unions? It depends on your measuring stick.\n\nBased on word count, President George Washington’s delivered the shortest speech on record in 1790, before the annual message was even dubbed the State of the Union. Washington’s speech to a joint session of Congress measured in at 1,089 words, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nNot every president has delivered an oral message, however. After President Thomas Jefferson eschewed a speech in favor of a written message to Congress in 1801, it took more than a century before President Woodrow Wilson revived the tradition of an in-person speech in 1913.\n\nDating back to 1964, the shortest oral delivery of a State of the Union was President Ronald Reagan’s 31-minute speech in 1986, according to The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Congressional Research Service noted that speech still had a word count about three times as long as Washington’s inaugural annual message.\n\nThe longest written message to date belongs to President Jimmy Carter, who delivered a 33,667-word written State of the Union in 1981. In his final State of the Union in 2000, President Bill Clinton set the high watermark for an in-person speech at just under 90 minutes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s 80-minute average is the longest of all presidents dating to 1964, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nWhy is this Biden’s first State of the Union?\n\nThe concept of an annual update from the president to members of Congress has existed as long as the presidency. President George Washington delivered the first of what was then called the “Annual Message” in 1790.\n\nThat is rooted in the constitutional requirement to provide an update “from time to time.” The speech was not formally named the State of the Union until 1947, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nBut recent tradition has been for presidents to not deliver a formal State of the Union in the year they were inaugurated but instead to simply speak before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did that in 2021, as the six presidents before him had done in their inauguration years. That means Biden’s 2022 address will be his first formal State of the Union.\n\n– Rick Rouan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/07/bob-dole-funeral-services-kansas-statehouse-memorial-russell/6424142001/", "title": "Memorial events for former Sen.

It is a rare act for a manager – rarer still in an era umpires check pitchers’ hands regularly after innings – and took on an air of desperation with the Mets trailing by four runs and their season on life support.\n\nBefore the bottom of the sixth could begin, the umpiring crew scoured Musgrove’s face, ears and equipment for sticky substances and found nothing.\n\nWhich is exactly what the Mets got off Musgrove.\n\nMusgrove took a perfect game into the fifth inning and pitched seven shutout innings, quieting a Citi Field crowd and sending the faithful home for the winter as San Diego eliminated the Mets, 6-0, on Sunday night.\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nThe Padres will advance to the NL Division Series against the Dodgers, as they did in 2020 before succumbing to L.A. in the bubble-contested playoffs that year. The Mets, who won 101 games but lost the NL East title in the season’s waning days, will go home pondering how to improve on a club that sported a franchise-record payroll that approached $290 million.\n\nThey didn’t go down swinging but rather by commissioning a search party to undress Musgrove, Showalter either believing Musgrove’s elevated spin rate and dominance resulted from foreign substance use – or at least wanting to plant that thought in the Padre’s head.\n\nEither way, he was wrong on both fronts. Umpiring crew chief Alfonso Marquez conducted a relatively intimate check of Musgrove’s face and ears as the pitcher maintained a poker face.\n\nAll clean.\n\n\"I’ve seen him do it before,\" Musgrove said of Showalter in a postgame TV interview. \"I get it; they’re on their last leg, they’re desperate and it is what it is.\n\n\"It motivated me a bit. It fired me up. An opportunity to stick it to them, a little bit.\"\n\nMusgrove then returned to the business of dominating the Mets, granting them just one harmless single and a walk in his seven innings. After pitching a scoreless sixth, he couldn’t resist wiping sweat/something from under his nose while glancing at the Mets’ dugout. He later tugged on his ear, driving the point home further.\n\nNIGHTENGALE'S NOTEBOOK: Judge is the AL MVP. Who else deserves 2022 MLB awards?\n\nNEWSLETTER: Get the latest sports news straight to your inbox\n\nMusgrove made history himself, becoming the first pitcher in playoff history to complete seven shutout innings with less than two hits in a winner-take-all game. His resentment toward Showalter is rooted in decades of baseball protocol, in which demanding a substance check is considered questionable gamesmanship, unless a team has been tipped to a player’s abuse. The practice did not gain steam even as the use of so-called “sticky stuff” grew in prevalence and aided in pitchers’ spin rate, velocity and movement.\n\nWhen Major League Baseball announced that in June 2021 it would begin checking pitchers after at least their first inning of work, spin rates declined across the game. And just one manager – then-Phillies skipper Joe Girardi – demanded an extra on-field check when he asked umps to check then-Nationals starter Max Scherzer, who grew indignant at Girardi after umps ran their hands through his thinning mane.\n\nShowalter seemed to telegraph his intentions, noting in a pregame production meeting with ESPN’s broadcast crew that Musgrove’s spin rates had increased. His numbers in Sunday’s Game 3 were elevated, as well, although possibly not beyond what the adrenaline of a high-stakes game might produce.\n\nShowalter said he felt \"kind of bad about\" casting aspersions on Musgrove, but that the club was \"privy\" to spiking spin rate averages and that he's \"charged with doing what's best for the New York Mets. If it makes me look however it makes me look, I'm going to do it every time and live with the consequences.\"\n\nSaid Padres manager Bob Melvin: \"Joe Musgrove is a man of character. Questioning his character is what bothers me. The reception he got after that was not warranted. I just want everybody to know he’s a high-character individual.\"\n\nShowalter should have known he wasn’t checking a young buck; Musgrove pitched the lone no-hitter in Padres history and appeared in far higher-stakes games, most notably earning the win in relief in Game 5 of the 2017 World Series, a 13-12 thriller that keyed the Houston Astros’ seven-game conquest of the Dodgers.\n\nSunday night, Musgrove came up even cleaner and now, the San Diego native will be slated to start a Game 4 at Petco Park against the Dodgers.\n\nAnd Showalter’s tactics will be remembered ignominiously – not the sheen around Musgrove’s ears.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}]}

A recent study showed Chick-fil-A had the slowest one — but only because it’s so popular and there are so many cars in line.\n\nTaco Bell led the pack in speed of service, with an average time of about 221 seconds, followed by Dunkin’ Donuts, KFC and Arby’s. But this metric doesn’t factor the number of cars in line. In that category, Chick-fil-A is the clear leader, with 16% of its lines surveyed counting ten or more cars. McDonald’s, which was in second place, only had 2% with that many customers.\n\nBased on the total time cars spent in line, Chick-fil-A came out on top, with an average of about 107 seconds. McDonald’s came in second at 118 seconds, followed by Taco Bell and Arby’s.\n\nQSR and Intouch Insight published its annual Drive-Thru Report, surveying more than 1,000 consumers who ranked ten industry leaders: Wendy’s, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Dunkin’, McDonald’s, Arby’s, Carl’s Jr., Hardee’s, Taco Bell, and KFC.\n\nDrive-thrus got bogged down last year mostly because of a shortage of restaurant workers, as thousands left the industry. The pandemic surge of drive-thru and pickup and delivery orders only exacerbated the issue\n\nBut luckily for customers, drive-thrus have gotten nearly 10 seconds faster compared to last year — and that can be a big advantage in this highly competitive industry.\n\n“Mere seconds can be a make-it or break-it in terms of where a consumer decides to order,” Amanda Topper, a research director at Mintel, said to CNN Business last year.\n\nHowever, the current average is still about 45 seconds slower than the 2019 pace. The study said pre-sell menu boards, order accuracy and friendliness helped decrease the wait times at drive-thrus this year.\n\nService and speed\n\nDuring peak Covid, Chick-fil-A was one of the first brands to close its dining rooms, focusing its attention on bringing hospitality to the drive-thru outside.\n\n“We believe that looking eye-to-eye with the customer allows for a connection that happens at the beginning of the drive-thru,” Matt Abercrombie, Chick-fil-A’s senior director of service and hospitality, said in the study.\n\nThe researchers found that Chick-fil-A had fine tuned the “check-point system,” which keeps customers engaged through different interactions with employees.\n\nAnd that’s clear in consumer sentiment too — 88% of respondents said Chick-fil-A had friendly service, placing it at the top of the industry.

That's an enormous jump and the longest average time logged in the 17 years that QSR has overseen the study. To be fair, in 2013, the survey was focused on seven fast-food chains, but the 2014 study greatly expanded to 17 fast-food brands.\n\n\"Things are definitely slowing down,\" says Sam Oches, editor of QSR. \"That's the new normal.\"\n\nThe importance of rapid service can't be overstressed in a $200 billion-plus industry whose very name is fast food. The major fast-food chains do at least 60% of their business in the drive-thru, and some do closer to 70%. Getting the food out quickly has been the industry's competitive edge for decades. Oches says the latest study results are not all bad news.\n\nFor one thing, the food is getting healthier. Healthier premium items, such as Cantina bowls at Taco Bell or fruit smoothies at McDonald's, require extra time to make. At the same time, fast-food chains are working harder to keep order accuracy near the 87% range — about the highest the industry has posted, he says.\n\nThe industry change — away from breakneck drive-thru speed — began last year, Oches says. \"The chains are more focused on serving fresh food and providing a good drive-thru experience with accurate orders,\" he says.\n\nThe best time of day to avoid the fast-food line is fast-changing. Lunch used to be the single busiest time. This year, the busiest time of day at the drive-thru was the \"snack\" part of the day — usually 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., the study found. The second-busiest time was at breakfast. These are two areas the industry has recently invested in heavily for growth. Taco Bell rolled out out its breakfast program this year, and McDonald's has greatly expanded its snack offerings over the past several years.\n\nTo broaden its scope, QSR expanded its annual study from seven to 17 fast-food chains this year. The national study of 2,188 separate drive-thru trips was conducted in June, July and August.\n\nEven as the drive-thru lane slows down, the study found that slightly fewer cars are going that route. This year's study found an average 1.7 cars waiting in the drive-thru lane vs. 2.8 cars last year.\n\nAs more fast-food chains update their images and add Wi-Fi and more quality products, Oches says, \"people may be slightly more interested in going into a dining room.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/10/12/these-fast-food-drive-thrus-have-longest-waits-study-says/5968639002/", "title": "Pandemic prolongs wait at fast-food drive-ups", "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has led to longer waits at fast-food drive-thrus this summer.\n\nAccording to the 2020 SeeLevel HX Annual Drive-Thru Study, the average drive-thru wait at 10 top fast-food restaurants this summer was 5.95 minutes, about 30 seconds longer than a year ago.\n\nAt Wendy's, Baconator and Frosty fans waited 5.98 minutes on average, a minute longer than last summer, according to SeeLevel HX, an Atlanta-based consumer research firm that has been doing the review for 20 years.\n\nThe fastest chain was KFC, where diners got their orders in 4.72 minutes.\n\nOn the other end, by a wide margin, was Chick-fil-A, where drivers waited an average of 8.15 minutes, according to SeeLevel HX.\n\nOne simple reason: Chick-fil-A restaurants serve more customers, with testers counting nearly three times as many vehicles in the chain's lines than the industry average. Both Chick-fil-A and the other chains had more vehicles in line than a year ago, according to SeeLevel HX.\n\nChick-fil-A is less focused on timing than other attributes consumers value, said Lisa van Kesteren, SeeLevel HX's chief executive.\n\n\"It pays off because Chick-fil-A has a cultlike following,\" she said.\n\nWorking from your bed?:You're not alone.

Long lines have been a regular feature at drive-thrus since coronavirus has kept many customers out of restaurant interiors. SeeLevel HX found that the time between ordering the food to getting it was actually 17 seconds faster this year than last, meaning all the extra wait is before ordering.\n\n\"The pandemic is continuing to have a massive impact on QSRs (quick-service restaurants) from a spike in traffic and stricter safety standards and protocols to a substantial increase in staffing turnover and training, so I'm not surprised to see a dip in speed of service,\" van Kesteren said.\n\nBut, as the survey shows, speed comes at a price.\n\nWhile Chck-fil-A might take longer to get food into customers' hands, patrons were happiest with what they got. Chick-fil-A ranked the highest on the study's three other measurements: customer satisfaction, the accuracy of the order and – most important of all – taste.\n\nKFC, on the other hand, might get food to customers the fastest, but customers said the Colonel's restaurants had the worst customer service and were most likely to get the order wrong.\n\nWendy's didn't fare much better. Of the 10 restaurants studied by SeeLevel HX, Wendy's came in ninth in order accuracy, and seventh in customer service and taste.\n\nWendy's pointed to other surveys that showed a much higher customer satisfaction. In a study commissioned by QSR Magazine, Wendy's ranked sixth in overall customer satisfaction out of 17 restaurants examined.

Here's how companies are coping ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nRestaurants have a delivery problem.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, when eateries were forced to shut their doors, delivery became a lifeline. Restaurant operators scrambled to set up delivery channels from scratch or promote ones that previously existed.\n\nBut there was a reason that many restaurants hadn’t focused on delivery before the pandemic: Delivery is a pain. It’s expensive, since restaurants have to hire drivers or outsource to third-party providers like DoorDash (DASH) or Grubhub, which charge a fee that cuts into their already razor-thin margins. It’s also stressful for employees, who must balance taking care of in-store customers while filling increasing numbers of to-go orders. And when deliveries go wrong, the restaurants take the blame, whether or not it’s their fault.\n\nRestaurants aren't huge fans of delivery. Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nCustomers, on the other hand, don’t see it that way. Delivery is convenient. It’s usually pretty fast, and perhaps best of all, they can do it through an app — without ever having to talk to a person.\n\nAlthough dine-in restrictions in most places have eased, delivery rates remain higher now than they were pre-Covid. In 2019, delivery accounted for about 7% of total US restaurant sales, according to Euromonitor International. After a spike in 2020, it settled at nearly 9% in 2021, according to Euromonitor’s forecast for last year (The company’s 2021 foodservice data has not been published.)\n\nSo whether restaurant owners like it or not, delivery is here to stay.\n\n“Consumers have become accustomed to getting products delivered to their homes,” said Joe Pawlak, managing principal at Technomic, a food service consulting company. Now, restaurants “have to figure out what to do to make it profitable.”\n\nFor restaurants, fixing delivery means not only making it work better, but also finding ways to convince customers to choose carryout or drive-thru instead.\n\nThe problem with delivery\n\nDuring the pandemic, restaurants had to shift to a delivery or takeout model to survive, said Tom Bailey, senior consumer foods analyst at Rabobank.\n\n“They didn’t necessarily do the most efficient adjustment,” Bailey noted.\n\nFor some restaurants, the economics of delivery simply don’t add up. Third-party providers charge fees which can be as high as 30%. Restaurants, particularly independent ones, already have thin margins. For some, delivery fees can mean operating in the red.\n\nCertain measures have been put in place to help make delivery less expensive for restaurants. Cities have been capping fees at lower rates. Third-party providers have also started offering lower rates for limited services, allowing restaurants to opt into more affordable, if less extensive, services. Some restaurants are able to negotiate lower rates directly. Others pass costs onto consumers.\n\nAnother problem with outsourcing delivery is that when circumstances outside of a restaurant’s control go wrong, their own costs can spike. Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Kevin Johnson walked analysts through a recent scenario that increased costs for the coffee chain during a February call.\n\n“Our third-party delivery providers had Omicron-related staffing shortages, impacting their ability to fulfill a portion of our distribution needs,” he said. “This required us to greatly increase the use of much more expensive … alternative delivery solutions in order to meet strong customer demand,” he added. Ultimately, the disruptions meant “a rapid increase” in costs.\n\nVirtual brands\n\nCheeto-flavored wings are on the menu at Cosmic Wings. Cosmic Wings\n\nOne way to tackle the delivery challenge is to separate the service from regular restaurant operations, and use it mainly to attract new customers. That’s especially important for casual dining brands such as Applebee’s and Chili’s, which are designed to serve diners primarily in their restaurants.\n\nThe pandemic prompted these chains and others to set up online-only concepts designed specifically for delivery.\n\nApplebee’s launched Cosmic Wings, which serves Cheeto-flavored chicken wings. Brinker International (EAT), owner of Chili’s and Maggiano’s Little Italy, has two virtual brands so far: It’s Just Wings and Maggiano’s Italian Classics.\n\nOnline-only brands allow restaurants to promote products that travel well for delivery, such as sandwiches and wings, helping turn the service from a burden into an competitive advantage.\n\nThose virtual brands “offer some really unique opportunities to explore … urban and smaller take-out delivery-centric prototypes,” said Wyman Roberts, Brinker’s CEO, during a February analyst call.\n\nFor fast casual and fast food restaurants, which were already designed to get people out the door quickly, better drive-thrus and incentives for carry-out may be the way to go.\n\nBetter drive-thrus and easier pick up\n\nRestaurants like Burger King are investing in drive-thrus. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nAs customer habits change, restaurants are rethinking their layouts. For many, that means more drive-thrus.\n\nChains from Taco Bell to Burger King are adding drive-thru lanes to restaurants. More lanes can help speed pick ups — and faster drive-thrus could ultimately be a more attractive option to consumers than delivery.\n\nChipotle (CMG), for example, is planning to open about 4,000 more locations in North America. Most of them will have Chipotlanes, a dedicated drive-thru for customers who place orders digitally.\n\n“What we’ve seen with the Chipotlane [is], our digital business goes up, our delivery business goes down as a percentage and the order pickup percentage goes up,” the company’s CEO Brian Niccol told CNN Business in a recent interview ahead of the opening of the chain’s 3,000th location. “From an economic standpoint, the best margin transaction for us is in order ahead, and then the customer comes in,” he said.\n\nIf chains can’t convince customers to use speedier drive-thrus, they might try something else, like a small bonus for skipping delivery.\n\nLate last month, Domino’s (DPZ) offered a deal: Pick up your own pizza, the company said, and get a $3 credit toward your next order. Earlier this year, the chain also vowed to deliver a pizza to customers in under two minutes — but only if those customers drove themselves to a Domino’s (DPZ) location and parked in the right spot.\n\nIf all else fails, companies may see delivery fall off naturally as the service becomes pricier.\n\nHigher prices\n\nTo make delivery more profitable, companies have been making it more expensive.\n\nAt many restaurants, “menu prices are higher for delivery than they are .. when somebody goes to the restaurant,” said Pawlak.\n\nThat’s certainly the case at Chipotle (CMG). “The reality is that channel comes with additional cost,” Niccol said during a recent analyst call. “What we’ve seen is people recognize that and are willing to accept that for those occasions.”\n\nCompanies have been raising prices on everything from menu items to consumer goods and are saying that so far, customers are sticking around. But that won’t last forever.\n\n“It’s easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up,” Coca-Cola (KO)’s CEO James Quincey said during a recent analyst call. “It’s much harder when there’s a real squeeze on income.” Coca-Cola (KO) raised prices last year, and may do so again this year if needed.\n\nThe risk is that with inflation on the rise, customers might turn on higher prices, including for delivery. “Consumers are willing to pay for [delivery] now,” Pawlak said. “At a certain point, there’s going to be some pushback on that.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/business/restaurants-pandemic-effects/index.html", "title": "The restaurant business will probably never recover from Covid ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe restaurant industry will likely never return to its pre-pandemic state, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nThe trade group says 2022 will be a “new normal,” for the sector as it struggles to rebound and as competition for workers remains intense, according to the association’s 2022 State of the Restaurant Industry report, which was released Tuesday.\n\n“Restaurants and their patrons have found themselves in a ‘new normal.’ Given emergent technology, changing consumer behavior and dining preferences, and the extraordinary challenges of the last two years, the industry is unlikely to ever completely return to its pre-pandemic state,” said Hudson Riehle, senior vice president of the Research and Knowledge Group at the National Restaurant Association.\n\nPent up demand from consumers will help in 2022 — the group predicts sales will continue to rise, forecasting sales this year of $898 billion, up from $864 billion in 2019. Yet just one in four restaurant operators believes their restaurant will be more profitable this year than last.\n\nRecruitment and retention are top issues. Seven in 10 restaurant operators say they don’t have enough employees, and about 50% note that will be a top challenge this year.\n\nA full return to employment is not expected in 2022 and competition for employees will remain “intense.” The group estimates total industry employment will reach 14.9 million jobs. That’s up just 400,000 from 2021 as job openings remain high — and still a million fewer jobs than pre-pandemic levels. Just five states — Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Arizona — have the same number of restaurant employees as they did pre-pandemic.\n\nIn December, quit rate in the accommodation and food services sector, which includes restaurants, was 10.2%, according to seasonally adjusted data released this week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It follows months of similarly high quit rates in the industry.\n\nSome restaurant operators are turning to technology to ease staffing shortages. Thirty-eight percent of adults say they would be okay with a robot delivering their meal at a restaurant this year.

But Arby’s has never sold one — until now.\n\nBetter known for its roast beef, the chain is adding a hamburger to its menu for the first time in its nearly 60-year history. Arby’s announced Monday it’s adding the “Wagyu Steakhouse Burger,” which costs $5.99, as a limited-time offering beginning Monday through July 31.\n\nFast-food chains are constantly competing for customers’ dollars and attention, and specialty offerings are a way to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. That’s important for Arby’s, which has 3,400 US restaurants, according to industry research firm Technomic. That’s a substantially smaller footprint compared to other chains, like McDonald’s (roughly 14,000 locations).\n\nAs prices surge, fast-food customers are growing increasingly picky about where they go out to eat, McDonald’s noted on a recent call with analysts. More than ever, quick-serve restaurants are fighting for loyalty.\n\nA surprising but popular item might do the trick at Arby’s. Its new burger is blend of Wagyu beef and ground beef and will be “highest-quality burger the market has seen yet,” the company said. The company spent more than two years developing the burger.\n\nWagyu, which means “Japanese cow,” refers to specific breeds of cattle and is known for its rich flavor and buttery tenderness. Arby’s version weighs in at 6.4 ounces and is a 52% blend of American Wagyu and 48% ground beef that is cooked “sous vide style” to create a juicy and tender burger.\n\nArby's Wagyu Steakhouse Burger is the first burger Arby's is adding to its menu. Arby's\n\n“Instead of focusing on making billions of mediocre burgers, we’re taking a stance on high-quality meat that deserves to be cooked properly,” Patrick Schwing, Arby’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement.\n\nThe Wagyu Steakhouse Burger is served with American cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, pickles, red onion and a “special burger sauce” on a toasted brioche bun. Arby’s claims its 50% bigger than McDonald’s Quarter Pounder, which about four years ago switched from frozen beef to fresh beef.\n\nArby’s is owned by Inspire Brands, the country’s second largest restaurant company that comprises of 32,000 locations across its brands, including Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy John’s, Dunkin’ and Sonic.\n\nThe privately held company recently announced Arby’s sales at stores open at least a year grew more than 5% in the first quarter, closely mirroring its rivals like McDonald’s and Wendy’s. Inspire said it “achieved record performance results” last year, with global sales across all of its brands exceeding $30 billion.

Peter Shaw, her husband of 53 years, died in 2003.\n\nCelebs grieve:'A true giant': Kevin McKidd, Piper Perabo, more remember actress Angela Lansbury\n\nMost actors would be happy to have just one of Lansbury’s three careers, let alone all of them.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nAspiring stars need not panic. All they’ll they need to match her success is Lansbury’s talent, grace, class, craft, beauty, brains, dedication, perseverance and professionalism. So good luck with that.\n\nIt’s right to grieve over what our culture has lost with Lansbury’s death. She was a great actor and a class act, and that combination does not come along every day. But we should also celebrate what she accomplished while she was alive, over a remarkable career.\n\nLansbury became a movie star at 19, garnering an Oscar nomination in 1944 for her first film, \"Gaslight,\" and following that with nods for \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in 1946 and \"Manchurian\" in 1963 before finally being awarded an honorary Oscar in 2014 “for her extravagant achievements.” And so they were.\n\nThe actress reflected on \"Gaslight,\" which she said was one of her favorite roles of her long career.\n\n\"I was just young enough to be able to absorb so much from the actors I was working with,\" Lansbury said. \"I was only 17 when I started it. I became 18 on the set, and everybody gave me a cigarette. Those things you never forget.\"\n\nIn the ‘60s, when her film work became less satisfying, she reinvented herself as a Broadway musical star – moving from well-respected film actor to extravagantly praised stage icon in almost an instant. She won the Tony for best actress in a musical for \"Mame,\" \"Dear World,\" \"Gypsy\" and \"Sweeney\" before adding a late-in-life award for best featured actress in a play in 2009 for \"Blithe Spirit.\"\n\nThat’s five performance Tonys, one less than the record, plus two more nominations for Lansbury, who also hosted the Tonys five times.\n\nWere that not career enough, there’s the TV show she started when she was approaching 60: CBS’s \"Murder, She Wrote,\" one of the most popular and longest-running dramas in TV history. It never won her an Emmy, despite 12 straight nominations, but it gave her financial independence and made her a household name for the first time in her career. And not just a name — a beloved one, as everyone favorite, slightly nosy, electronic aunt.\n\nHas any actor had more, or a more diverse set, of great roles and iconic performances? With most stars, you can point to a particular play and movie and say “She’s playing against type in that one” — but what “type” could you choose for Lansbury? The snooty, dismissive maid in \"Gaslight?\" The manipulative, power-mad mother in \"Manchurian\"? The bon vivant bohemian in \"Mame\"? The happily murderous piemaker in \"Sweeney\"? The sweet but unrelenting crime-solver in \"Murder\"?\n\nThis is an actor whose talents knew no bounds. And a woman who, when one door closed on her, pushed through another one.\n\nOf course, she might not have had to push had Hollywood made better use of her gifts. She had those great, Oscar-nominated roles, but far too many times on screen, she was cast as the “other” sister or in some variation of “the brittle-girl-who-doesn’t-get-the-guy.” Even in those roles, she could shine: If you haven’t seen her hilarious turn as the self-absorbed princess in \"The Court Jester\" or her nuanced portrayal of a bitter, unhappy wife in \"The World of Henry Orient,\" you must do so. Then throw in some of the more popular performances she gave later in life, like the dotty charlatan in \"Death on a Nile\" or the voice of Mrs. Potts in the 1991 animated \"Beauty and the Beast.\"\n\nEven TV did not treat her as well as it might have. \"Murder\" was a great gift, to her and to viewers, but no one would say it exactly taxed her talents. It’s a shame that, when she was at the height of her popularity, CBS did not let her re-create any of her great Broadway triumphs in a TV movie – but she did, at least, get to shine in such TV work as \"The Blackwater Lightship,\" \"Little Gloria,\" \"Happy at Last,\" and \"Mrs. Santa Claus.\"\n\nStill, it’s Broadway that really made the best use of Lansbury, in a string of legendary star-turns capped, perhaps, by her work in \"Sweeney.\" If that was her peak, we can be thankful, because it’s the only one of her stage performances that was preserved on film, as a TV special.\n\nLansbury continued working into her 90s, playing the rich Aunt March in the 2017 PBS adaptation of \"Little Women\" and making a welcome cameo in 2018's \"Mary Poppins\" sequel, \"Mary Poppins Returns.\" Her unnamed balloon lady character barely graced the screen, but her presence instantly elevated the Disney musical.\n\nIn January 2019 she offered words of wisdom to a room of hopefuls at the annual AFI Awards, reflecting on her long career in Hollywood. \"I took my first steps in the business on Stage 25 at the MGM lot,\" she recalled. \"I remember the first day I arrived there … and I never felt so alone in my life.\"\n\nSpeaking to the likes of Bradley Cooper, Emily Blunt and Henry Winkler, she added: \"As you leave here today and are invited to endure a seemingly endless parade of programs that label you a 'winner' or a 'loser' – I've been there, I've done that,\" she said, to laughter. \"Remember this room, when we are all together as one.\"\n\nIn all, Lansbury's career is one to celebrate and remember. And how you remember her – whether as the Nazi-fighting witch in \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" or as the smiling, beautifully dressed grand dame hosting the Tonys – is up to you. Only one thing is certain: It will be hard not to miss her, and impossible to replace her.\n\nOdds are few actors would be foolish enough to try.\n\nContributing: Kelly Lawler", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/958167/angela-lansbury-5-things-you-might-not-know-about-murder-she-wrote-star", "title": "Angela Lansbury: five things you might not know about Murder, She ..."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/07/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-trailer-explained/82741784/", "title": "5 things to know about the 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' trailer", "text": "Kelly Lawler\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHoly Rebel Alliance, there's a new Star Wars trailer for us all!\n\nThe first trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hit the Internet on Thursday, and it's full of all the Stormtroopers, battle scenes and plucky heroes that we have come to know and love in our Star Wars movies. But if you're just a little confused about where exactly this movie falls in the greater world of Star Wars movies (and what exactly is going on in the trailer), never fear. Here are the five things you need to know before you start obsessively watching the trailer over and over again.\n\n1. It's different than all the other Star Wars movies you've seen\n\nRogue One is the first of a few planned \"anthology\" Star Wars movies that take place in the universe but aren't part of the central \"Episode\" story. So we're still in that galaxy far, far away, but we're not hanging with the Skywalker clan this time around. It's Guardians of the Galaxy to the Avengers movies. It's in the same world, but, it's not the same story, necessarily.\n\n2. It takes place right before 'Star Wars: A New Hope'\n\nSo where does it fit in the wider Star Wars universe? Just a second before we meet Luke, actually. Rogue One is about the Rebel Alliance team that stole the plans for the Death Star, that Luke later used to blow it up in A New Hope. So fans will recognize the original Stormtrooper uniforms, the original Rebels and Empire all back once again.\n\n3. It has an awesome new cast of characters\n\nLadies and gentlemen, meet your new obsession: Jyn Erso. That's the hero Oscar-nominee Felicity Jones will be playing in the movie. Joining Jones are Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Jiang Wen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, and Forest Whitaker, so suffice to say the cast is stacked. Although we don't know exactly who everyone's character is yet, from the trailer we can assume Mendelsohn is playing an Empire official of some kind (did you see his awesome cape, tho) and Luna appears to be the Han to Jones' Luke. But it's not just new characters to contend with, we've got one very exciting returning face...\n\n4. It's bringing Mon Mothma back!\n\nMany Bothans died to bring us this trailer, and, apparently, a reappearance of Mon Mothma. Who are we talking about? We're talking about the Rebel leader seen briefly in The Return of the Jedi, who holds the briefing about the assault on Endor and the re-built Death Star. And while she's in just the one scene, her memorable line \"Many Bothans died to bring us this information\" has kept her alive in the Star Wars fandom. She's back in a Rebel leadership position in Rogue One, although played by a new but very similar-looking actress, Genevieve O’Reilly.\n\n5. It's giving us another incredible female hero to root for\n\nRey was only the beginning, it seems. In just a short teaser trailer, Jones' Jyn has already become a Star Wars hero to hold on to. From what we can see of her in the teaser, she's young, scrappy and hungry, a great fighter with just a touch of an attitude. We are already rooting for her, and wherever her journey takes us. In a franchise that has offered us great, but few, female heroes over the years, getting two in a row is an incredible feeling for fans, especially ones who can only dress up like Princess Leia so many Halloweens in a row. Bonus: Fans won't have to look hard to see if the movie passes the Bechdel Test. The trailer does it in its first 30 seconds.\n\nWatch the trailer in all its glory.\n\nYou can also scroll through photos from the movie below.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/05/26/johnny-depp-amber-heard-libel-trial-actor-rebuttal-witnesses/9940040002/", "title": "Amber Heard tearfully says she's been 'humiliated,' received 'death ...", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nAmber Heard took the witness stand Thursday and detailed how her libel lawsuit with Johnny Depp has affected her personally and professionally, tearfully testifying about allegedly being \"harassed, humiliated, threatened every single day\" from Depp's fans since the trial began.\n\n\"People want to kill me and they tell me that every day,\" Heard said through tears. \"Johnny threatened … promised me that if I ever left him, he'd make me think of him every single day.\"\n\nThe \"Aquaman\" actress continued: \"Every single day I have to relive the trauma.\"\n\nHeard testified that her friends, family and colleagues know of \"unspoken rules\" when she's filming about how to touch her so that she does not have \"a panic attack.\"\n\nJohnny Depp, Amber Heard libel trial:Everything that's happened so far\n\nJohnny Depp, Amber Heard FAQs:Your lawsuit questions, answered\n\n\"I'm not sitting in this courtroom snickering,\" she said, seemingly in response to Depp's courtroom testimony. \"This is horrible and this is painful and this is humiliating for any human being.\"\n\nHeard said she is \"not a saint\" and \"not trying to present myself as one,\" but decided to go through the libel trial to give voice to those in similar situations.\n\n\"I receive hundreds of death threats … people mocking my testimony,\" she continued. \"It has been agonizing, painful and the most humiliating thing I've ever been through.\"\n\nThe actress pleaded, \"I just want Johnny to leave me alone.\"\n\n\"Johnny has taken enough of my voice,\" Heard said. \"I hope to get my voice back.\"\n\nHeard was then cross-examined by Depp's attorney Camille Vasquez. She refuted claims from Depp's witnesses including claims that she called paparazzi to photograph her with bruises on her face outside the courtroom when she filed a restraining order in May 2016 and sent TMZ a video of Depp slamming cabinets during an argument.\n\n\"I've heard a lot of people say a lot of things to be involved in the Johnny Depp Show,\" Heard said after Vasquez pressed that the actress was calling everyone who testified on behalf of Depp a \"liar\" including Kate Moss, former TMZ employee Morgan Tremaine and more.\n\nWho is Camille Vasquez?

A rebuttal witness is called to the stand to refute evidence and testimony already presented throughout a trial.\n\nGilbert made the assessment that Heard severed Depp's finger with a liquor bottle based on images, medical records and prior testimony.\n\nThe finger injury, which occurred in a March 2015 fight in Australia between Depp and Heard, has been one of several key points of dispute in the lawsuit. Depp says he was injured when Heard threw a vodka bottle at him. Heard has said she never saw specifically how it happened, but that it occurred on a night when an enraged Depp sexually assaulted her with a liquor bottle.\n\nDuring testimony from Gilbert, who did not treat Depp, the surgeon said the injury was likely caused by \"blunt force with a high mechanism\" and \"sharp laceration.\"\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with Heard's testimony that he injured his own finger, he testified, \"I think that's highly unlikely.\"\n\nAmber Heard's sister testifies:Whitney Heard testifies she got caught in physical fight between actress, Johnny Depp\n\nHeard rests case in defamation suit:Warner Bros. executive testifies on Amber Heard's role in 'Aquaman 2'\n\nRebuttal witness Dr. Richard Moore refutes Johnny Depp's account of his severed finger\n\nIn testimony Monday, orthopedic surgeon Richard Moore testified about the severed finger as jurors saw gruesome photos of the injury. He said that Depp described that his palm was down on a bar when it was struck by the bottle.\n\nMoore, who did not treat Depp, testified that Depp's description is unlikely, in large part because his fingernail remained intact. Moore said the fingernail was exposed, as Depp described the placement of his hand, and would have been damaged. Moore also said there would have been other cuts on the rest of his hand from the glass that shattered on impact.\n\nWhile Depp told the jury that Heard severed the finger by throwing a vodka bottle, at the time of the accident he told people and sent text messages saying he'd done it to himself.\n\n'I survived that man':Amber Heard ends testimony in Johnny Depp libel trial\n\nComputer forensic expert testifies about Amber Heard's injury photos\n\nJulian Ackert, a computer forensic expert, appeared as Heard's first rebuttal witness Thursday. Ackert was called on to assess photos of Heard, based on metadata, that were presented to the court including pictures of a bruise on her face alleged to be caused by Depp.\n\nDepp's team argued that Heard altered the photographs with an editing app to make her bruises appear more prominent. However, Ackert testified that based on the Apple software \"eco-system\" the pictures were authentic.\n\nJohnny Depp calls Amber Heard's testimony 'insane'\n\nDepp testified Wednesday as a rebuttal witness. He already testified for four consecutive days earlier in the six-week trial.\n\nDepp refuted many of Heard's claims throughout her testimony, calling them \"insane.\"\n\n\"It's insane to hear heinous accusations of violence, sexual violence … that she's accusing me of. (It's) horrible, ridiculous, humiliating, ludicrous, painful, savage, unimaginably brutal, cruel,\" he said on the witness stand.\n\nJohnny Depp takes stand again:'Pirates of the Caribbean' star says listening to Amber Heard's testimony was 'insane'\n\nDepp added that \"no human being is perfect\" and once again denied the allegations.\n\n\"I have never in my life committed sexual battery, physical abuse, all these outlandish, outrageous stories of me committing these things,\" he said. \"And living with it for six years, and waiting to be able to bring the truth out.\"\n\nHe said that “no matter what happens I did get here and I did tell the truth and I have spoken up for what I've been carrying on my back, reluctantly, for six years.\"\n\nEllen Barkin testifies:Actress claims ex Johnny Depp was a controlling partner, 'always drinking'\n\nDepp is suing Heard for libel in Fairfax County Circuit Court over a December 2018 op-ed she wrote in The Washington Post describing herself as \"a public figure representing domestic abuse.\" His lawyers say he was defamed by the article even though it never mentioned his name.\n\nDepp has denied he ever struck Heard and says she was the abuser in the relationship. Heard has testified about more than a dozen separate instances of physical abuse she says she suffered at Depp's hands.\n\nA verdict in the trial is expected to be determined on Tuesday.\n\nMore:Amber Heard, Johnny Depp and who we choose to believe\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Naledi Ushe, Amy Haneline, USA TODAY; Matthew Barakat, The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/04/08/annette-funicello-appreciation/2064097/", "title": "Annette Funicello was made for you and me", "text": "Susan Wloszczyna, USA TODAY\n\nFunicello dies from complications of multiple sclerosis\n\nShe was signed as the 24th and final Mouseketeer in 1955\n\nFunicello was the inspiration for the 1960 Paul Anka hit %27Puppy Love%27\n\nLong before Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera sported rodent ears, there was the original Disney girl — Annette — who won America's heart.\n\nAnnette Funicello, whose pubescent pulchritude made her a standout on TV's first Mickey Mouse Club in the '50s and an early crush for many a Baby Boomer boy, died Monday at age 70 in Bakersfield, Calif., from complications of multiple sclerosis. Her family confirmed she had been in a coma for years before being taken off life support.\n\nHer daughter, Gina Gilardi, said in a statement: \"She's on her toes dancing in heaven. ... No more MS. My brothers and I were there holding her sweet hands when she left us.\"\n\nFunicello was born in Utica, N.Y., and moved to Southern California at age 4. Trained as a singer and dancer, she would get her break in show business after Walt Disney was among those who saw her as the ballerina in Swan Lake during a recital held at the Burbank Starlight Bowl in 1955.\n\nSoon she was signed up as the 24th and final Mouseketeer on a popular variety show for kids, appearing in her own self-titled serial (where her signature tune, How Will I Know My Love, performed during a hayride scene, would lead to a singing career). With her innate wholesomeness and sweet disposition, the brunette beauty's pinup appeal was a major draw, generating more than 6,000 fan letters a week. She would go on to inspire one of her early beaus, Paul Anka, to write his 1960 hit Puppy Love about her.\n\nThe self-described \"queen of teen\" also became a recording sensation, releasing 15 albums for Disney that featured the top-10 hits Tall Paul and O Dio Mio. After the show ended in 1959, Funicello remained under contract with Disney, appearing in the Zorro TV series in the late 1950s and such family films as 1959'sThe Shaggy Dogand 1961'sBabes in Toyland. Once out of her teens, she traded in her mouse ears for a curve-revealing bathing suit for 1963's Beach Party, the kickoff title in a series of six youth-oriented romps that paired her with Frankie Avalon.\n\n\"Mr. Disney,\" whom Funicello considered a second father, made one request of his demure discovery: that she not reveal her navel on-screen and besmirch her pure image. She complied in the first movie but would wear a two-piece fishnet suit in 1964's Muscle Beach Party and a blue-and-white bikini in 1964's Bikini Beach.\n\nShe left show business — save for her Skippy peanut butter commercials — to become a homemaker after marrying her first husband, Jack Gilardi, in 1965. They had three children before divorcing in 1981. She then married horse breeder Glen Holt in 1986.\n\nWhen she and Avalon made a comeback as a team in the 1987 spoof Back to the Beach, she first noticed signs of multiple sclerosis. She kept the condition under wraps despite having obvious symptoms during a yearlong concert tour with her co-star. After news reports claimed her ailments were signs of alcohol abuse, she went public with news of her illness to USA TODAY reporter Tom Green in 1992. She would go on to raise awareness about MS and started a research fund in her name in 1993.\n\nShe said of her decision: \"Sometimes I can't help but ask, 'Why me?' But I believe everything happens for a reason, and I know now that my mission is to help others raise funds for MS.\"\n\nFunicello released an autobiography, A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: My Story in 1994, and the book would be turned into a made-for-TV movie in 1995.

They're not responsible for the nurse committing suicide,\" said Londoner Henry O'Brian, a restaurant manager. \"It's a joke that became a tragedy.\"\n\n\"It's just unfortunate,\" said teacher Samantha Windsor of Northamptonshire. \"You can't point a finger at the DJs. They couldn't imagine that would happen. There was no intention.\"\n\nHowever forgiving some members of the British public, the DJs' bosses appear to be taking no chances. Southern Cross Austereo, the Australian media company that owns the Sydney radio station that aired the hoax call, announced Monday that the two DJs will stay off the air \"until further notice.\" The company also canceled the DJs' Hot30 show and banned prank calls companywide.\n\nDJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian, after a weekend in seclusion, gave tearful apologies on Australian TV Monday for their Tuesday phone call to the King Edward VII Hospital. The duchess, still widely known here as Kate Middleton, was being treated at the private hospital in one of London's poshest neighborhoods for dehydration brought on by acute morning sickness.\n\nPutting on fake British accents, Greig pretended to be the queen and Christian pretended to be Prince Charles, father of Kate's husband Prince William, now known as the Duke of Cambridge. The DJs' phone call was apparently answered by nurse Jacintha Saldanha, 46, who transferred the pranksters to another nurse. The second nurse, seemingly in the belief that she was talking to the royal family, gave details on the duchess's condition to the DJs, who not only replayed the call but also boasted about it on Twitter.\n\nSaldanha's body was discovered Friday morning in the nurses' quarters around the corner from the hospital. A postmortem begins today and could yield results as early as Tuesday, Scotland Yard said. Police have characterized the death as \"unexplained.\"\n\n\" I have thought about this a million times in my head, that I just wanted to reach out to (Saldanha's family) and just give them a big hug and say sorry,\" Greig told Australia's Nine News on Monday. \"The thought we may have played a part in (Saldhana's death) is gut-wrenching.\"\n\nChristian said that he was \"shattered, heartbroken.\"\n\n\"The joke 100% was on us,\" he said. \"The idea was never, 'Let's call up and get through to Kate,' or 'Let's speak to a nurse.' The joke was our accents are horrible, they don't sound anything like who they're intended to be.\"\n\nAfter Saldanha's death was announced, 2Day FM, Greig and Christian's station, was inundated with angry phone calls and emails, and major companies yanked their ads from the station's lineup.\n\nOn Twitter, in newspapers columns, and in online forums, Britons poured vitriol on the pair, accusing them of having blood on their hands and calling for them to be fired, even prosecuted. The Daily Mail called them \"sick jokers,\" while another tabloid, The Daily Star, ran the headline, \"Make Them Pay for Nurse Death\" with an editorial calling for the two to be \"sacked.\"\n\nLondon student Hayley Allardyce agreed with the Star that the DJs should lose their jobs.\n\n\"It's horrible what they did. It's a serious matter,\" she said. \"I'm surprised they haven't quit.\"\n\nBut others did not share her outrage, and many felt that the hospital must have let Saldanha down in some way.\n\n\"I quite like prank calls, so I have no problem\" with the joke, said London engineer Matt Stockdale. Saldanha \"obviously felt quite guilty or bad about it, but it didn't seem cruel.\"\n\n\"I don't think it was their fault,\" said Londoner Stephen Doyle. \"There should've been more support from the hospital to the person concerned. … When you've got a high-profile patient like that, you should have procedures in place.\"\n\nBut even those who didn't hold the DJs accountable had limited sympathy for them, acknowledging that their prank, if not cruel, was at the least thoughtless and immature, and was likely to bring back terrible memories for the royal family of another media intrusion with deadly consequences — the 1997 death of Princess Diana in a car crash while being pursued by paparazzi.\n\nThe new tragedy \"will highlight\" to the royals once again the unrelenting pressures of their fame, said London artist Annabel Wightman. \"It's devastating at their happy time.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/04/20/elisabeth-moss-handmaids-tale-violence-tries-not-gratuitous/535229002/", "title": "Elisabeth Moss: 'Handmaid's Tale' abuse tries not to be 'gratuitous'", "text": "HOLLYWOOD — The women of Gilead are no strangers to abuse, rape and slavery. It’s an aspect of The Handmaid’s Tale that’s left critics, including USA TODAY’s Kelly Lawler, to wonder: Is Season 2 verging on misery porn?\n\nAt Thursday night’s massive Hollywood premiere for the new season of the Hulu drama, we posed the question to Handmaid's creative team: When do you know to pull the camera away, that the audience can’t take any more?\n\n“When we’ve told the story that we needed to tell,” star/executive producer Elisabeth Moss told USA TODAY on the red carpet at the TCL Chinese Theatre.\n\n“I was actually just talking about this with (showrunner) Bruce Miller today about a scene later in the show,\" said Moss, dressed in a Handmaid’s-red Dior gown. \"There’s a very dark scene later on in the season, and it was cut down a little bit because it didn’t need to be gratuitous. We’re not trying to pound anything down anyone’s throats.”\n\nMore:Yep, 'The Handmaid's Tale' cast needs a drink when they watch, too\n\nMiller said even he watches some scenes from behind his hands, but noted they make a point to “show just what we need to show to tell the story so you understand why the character is one way before the event, and (another) way after. And no more.”\n\nThe gruesome violence threaded through the show is always based on real-world examples, said Miller, from the Taliban-style public executions modeled in Season 2’s opener to the female genital mutilation Emily (Alexis Bledel) was subjected to in Season 1.\n\n“We don’t make up some kind of cruelty, I don’t want to do that. I hate that,” he says. “It’s hard because these are things that are happening in the real world. We’re not making them up. But showing them, you do carry some responsibility. The last thing you want to be making is torture porn.”\n\nIn Season 2, the show expands beyond its Margaret Atwood source material to include refugee stories across the border in Canada and scenes deep inside the treacherous Colonies, where exiled women are worked to death in toxic conditions.\n\nBledel’s handmaid is now one of them.\n\n“She was such a fighter through all the trauma she endured in Season 1, but in Season 2, the Colonies is uncharted territory,\" said Bledel on the red carpet. \"She’s not as clued-in as she was in Gilead as to what’s going to happen. It’s an absolute wasteland. She’s lost a lot of hope, she knows she’s going to die. So she takes a new tack: she decides she’s going to dole out a form of vigilante justice on her own.”\n\nAnn Dowd, who plays the handmaids’ ruthless headmistress Aunt Lydia, expanded on how she and a pregnant, willful Offred (Moss) go head to head in the upcoming season. “What she loves about Offred is that strength. (As Aunt Lydia), I try to beat it down because, girl, you’re not going to make it. Honey, that Commander and Serena Joy, don’t play around with them.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/17/primary-elections-rudy-giuliani-5-things-know-wednesday/10289590002/", "title": "Primary election takeaways, Rudy Giuliani: 5 things to know ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPrimary takeaways: Cheney loses to Hageman in Wyoming; Alaska's Murkowski and Palin advance\n\nPolitical observers waking up Wednesday will see primary races in Wyoming and Alaska Tuesday further revealing not only the strong grip former President Donald Trump has on the Republican Party but also the direction the country could take with the next Congress. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former president in January 2021 after the violent attack on the Capitol. She lost to Harriet Hageman — badly. The Trump-backed Hageman said Tuesday night the former president propelled her campaign to victory. Alaska's new nonpartisan ranked-choice primary likely helped help Sen. Lisa Murkowski advance in her primary, even though she also crossed Trump. Alaska voters also selected their top four candidates in the primary to take over the state's lone U.S. House seat held by GOP Rep. Don Young, who died in March, for a full term come January. Sarah Palin, Alaska's Republican former governor and vice-presidential candidate, Republican businessman Nick Begich, and Democratic tribal activist Mary Peltola advanced to the November general election.\n\nPrefer to listen?

What Giuliani might be willing to tell the grand jury – or whether he would testify at all – was unclear, after prosecutors notified Giuliani's lawyers this week that he is now a target of the investigation led by the Fulton County district attorney. The former New York mayor had made wide-ranging claims that voting systems altered Georgia ballots, while ignoring a hand-count audit that confirmed President Joe Biden's victory in the state. He also asserted that thousands of underage voters, felons and dead people voted – claims that were debunked by the Georgia secretary of state.\n\nRapper A$AP Rocky to be arraigned on assault with firearm charges\n\nA$AP Rocky's arraignment on two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for pulling a gun on a former friend and firing in Hollywood last year, is scheduled for Wednesday, Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said. Prosecutors allege that during an argument on Nov. 6, 2021, the 33-year-old rapper, whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, pointed the handgun at the victim, then in a subsequent confrontation, drew the gun again and fired twice in the direction of the man, who sustained a minor injury. His name has not been released. Police said Rocky and two other men fled the scene on foot. Rocky is in a relationship with superstar singer and businesswoman Rihanna, and the two had a son in May.\n\nWNBA playoffs begin with the top two seeds in action\n\nThe WNBA playoffs kick off Wednesday with the top two teams in the league – the No. 1 seeded Las Vegas Aces and the defending champs Chicago Sky – beginning their first-round series. First, the No. 2 seeded Sky, led by Kahleah Copper and Candace Parker, face Sabrina Ionescu and the seventh-seeded New York Liberty in Chicago (8 p.m. ET, ESPN2). Chicago won the season series 3-1 during the regular season. Later, the Aces, led by two of the WNBA's top 5 scorers in Kelsey Plum and A'ja Wilson, host the No. 8 seeded Phoenix Mercury (10 p.m. ET, ESPN). The Mercury will be without one of their stars as Diana Taurasi is out for the rest of the season due to a quad injury. Later this week, the two other playoff series will get underway as the No. 3 seeded Connecticut Sun host the Dallas Wings, the No. 6 seed, and the No. 5 seeded Washington Mystics head west to face the Seattle Storm, the fourth seed. This will be the final playoff run for Sue Bird as she plans to retire at the end of the Storm's season.\n\nLittle League World Series kicks off in Pennsylvania with an expanded field\n\nThe Little League World Series is back to its old self, and more. After no tournament in 2020 and no international clubs in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the youth baseball tournament has expanded to 20 teams for the first time from around the world - up from 16 - that will play in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, starting Wednesday. Two new U.S. regions and two international regions were introduced. Williamsport Mayor Derek Slaughter estimated the 2022 World Series, which marks the 75th anniversary of the first tournament, will bring in 85,000 people, adding the event could have a $40 million to $50 million impact on the community. The regional events have already provided memorable moments, including Oklahoma's Isaiah Jarvis consoling a shaken Kaiden Shelton of Texas after Shelton struck Jarvis in the head with an errant pitch.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2012/09/10/michael-clarke-duncan-funeral/1412335/", "title": "Friends honor Michael Clarke Duncan", "text": "USATODAY\n\nHollywood friends and loved ones gathered today to honor actor Michael Clarke Duncan at a private funeral in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles.\n\nThe actor, best known for his Oscar-nominated role in The Green Mile, died Sept. 3 at the age of 54.

You don't think you're creating a movement when you're doing something creative and unique. You just keep doing what you're doing. Then somebody else labels it.\"\n\n'Outside the realm of normal':How some punk kids helped define the fringe of Phoenix music\n\nHow Bikini Kill inspired Burning Bush reunion shows\n\nShe and her bandmates haven't played together regularly since the early '90s and they're currently spread out all over the country.\n\nRyther lives in Portland, Oregon, where she and Tanguay moved when they left Phoenix in the '90s. Tanguay, who returned to Phoenix in 2002, now lives in Twentynine Palms, California, her home since 2018, and Creed lives in Brooklyn.\n\nBut they're getting back together for their first shows since their 2015 reunion, playing Phoenix and Tucson with Fat Gray Cat and Tanguay's current band, Yvonne Champagne.\n\n\"One of the reasons I got inspired to put this show together was the Bikini Kill reunion tour,\" Tanguay says, noting that Burning Bush and Bikini Kill were once in the same issue of the legendary punk fanzine Maximum Rocknroll (February 1992).\n\n\"I saw them play an amazing show and it was packed. It made me realize that more people are ready to engage with female-fronted power music. Our time has come (again).\"\n\nShe and her bandmates are bringing their 7-Year Itch Reunion Shows to the Rhythm Room in Phoenix on Friday, Sept. 30, and Club Congress in Tucson on Saturday, Oct. 1.\n\nThey'll be joined in Phoenix by two often former members who were briefly in the band and now both play in TempeSour — drummer Leslie Massie and guitarist Lisa Pirro.\n\nIn addition to the timing feeling right on a cultural level, it also feels right on a personal level.\n\n\"Our kids are almost out of the house,\" Tanguay says with a laugh.\n\n\"We're all working moms. And we're getting to the point where our children are taking care of themselves. I think we have one left in high school, and that's about it. So we have a little more time to jam. And it's been seven years.\"\n\nRemembering Doug Clark: A mysterious icon of the Phoenix punk music underground\n\nEarly days of Burning Bush\n\nTanguay was a student at Arizona State University when they put the band together.\n\n\"I had a house across the street from the college,\" she says.\n\n\"We had house parties with people jamming, and Kevin Daly was there from Grave Danger. He introduced me to Thomascyne, who had come to my party and said, 'You guys should know each other.'\"\n\nRyther was already playing in bands and asked Tanguay if she wanted to help form the all-girl band she was planning on putting together.\n\nAs Tanguay recalls her reaction, \"I said, 'Well, I don't know what I would play. I'm interested in playing either drums or bass.' Because at the time I actually hadn't played either of those or anything — like, anything at all.\"\n\nShe decided on bass, she says, because \"I thought, 'Well, bass would be easier. It's less to carry.'\"\n\nThey started \"very rudimentary art-rock jamming jamming\" at Ryther's house in Phoenix with Mona Nigohossian on drums.\n\n\"We were just jamming and trying to think of songs, being very creative with our lyrics,\" Tanguay says.\n\n\"Thomascyne actually had a few songs written. She's an excellent songwriter. And then I had an instrumental I had worked out. And before you knew it, we had a set.\"\n\nTheir first gig was at AAA Gardeners Club in downtown Phoenix, near Mad Gardens, another popular punk club.\n\n\"And it just grew from there,\" she says.\n\n'The end of an era': How an art bar that holds 50 people came to mean so much to Phoenix\n\n'Tales from the Bush'\n\nBy the time they did \"Tales From the Bush,\" Nigohossian had been replaced by Creed.\n\nTanguay says that album is her favorite.\n\n\"When I listen back to it,\" she says, \"I think, 'Oh, that was pretty good for just barely getting together.'\"\n\nAs to how they arrived at their sound, incorporating elements of post-punk, art-rock, funk and psychedelic rock, often singing in unison, it's just the sound that came out when they tried to write.\n\n\"We never really looked to anybody else,\" she says. \"We just did our own thing.\n\n\"Thomascyne and I as songwriters were obviously influenced by tons of different bands in lots of different genres. But we never specifically said, 'Let's try to sound like that band' or 'Let's try to do this sound.' We just organically evolved into our own sound.\"\n\nSome local flavor was bound to seep into the mix.\n\n\"Obviously, we played with the Meat Puppets and a lot of local bands,\" Tanguay says.\n\n\"And there's some kind of organic influence that happens when you're jamming and playing shows with other musicians. So I'm sure that has come into play somehow.\"\n\nTheir first album features a cover of \"Is It My Body,\" a song by local legend Alice Cooper, retitled \"Is It My Alice.\"\n\n\"You've got to pay homage to the king of Phoenix rock,\" she says.\n\n\"We all grew up listening to Alice Cooper. He was a trendsetter in his sound and style. And I thought, wow, for how dark he appears to be, that song is kind of a sweet little pop song. Plus, it's really fun to play.\"\n\n'We're the kids in the back of the class': An oral history of Alice Cooper's 'School's Out'\n\nBeing an all-female band in '80s Phoenix\n\nBeing an all-female band in Phoenix in the '80s definitely made them stand out on the scene and led to Burning Bush being the go-to openers when female touring acts like Babes in Toyland or L7 came through town and played the Sun Club.\n\n\"We were really the only all-girl punk band for sure,\" Tanguay recalls. \"Or punk-influenced band. I wouldn't say we were a complete punk band. But we're kind of in that genre, because we're so DIY with everything.\"\n\nIt also meant they had to deal with more misogyny than Tanguay believes they'd encounter today.\n\n\"We did come across people who would say, 'You know, if you just dress sexy, you could be more popular,'\" she recalls with a laugh.\n\n\"And that wasn't our angle. Our angle was to just create the best music we could, to really go with our heart and soul and not conform to anything. Also, a lot of times people would say, 'You guys rock! For girls.' People weren't really ready for it yet.\"\n\nThey always felt supported in the Phoenix underground, though, she's quick to add, from venues like the Sun Club to the bands themselves.\n\n\"We really never had a bad experience with our peers,\" she says.\n\nBlatant localism:Arizona record label builds a living archive of the Phoenix punk scene\n\n'We just are obviously not Republicans'\n\nThere was a political side to Burning Bush. The cover of their second album, \"Lick Bush,\" included a photo of then-President George Bush engulfed in flames, and they played their share of protests.\n\n\"But I don't think we really meant to be too political,\" Tanguay says.\n\n\"We just are obviously not Republicans. We're open to people being supported in society. And when we see injustices, like anybody else, we speak out. But It's not 100% what this band is all about.\"\n\nIn 1991, they followed \"Lick Bush\" with a seven-inch EP called \"Revolution Without Guns.\"\n\nCreed moved Minnesota shortly after the recording of that EP. That's when Massie joined on drums.\n\nIn 1993 or so (she isn't sure), Tanguay and Ryther moved to Portland.\n\n\"I said, 'Thomascyne, you want to move to Portland? Let's do this there,''' she recalls.\n\n\"So we did. We moved to Portland and we kept the band together for a few years after that. We had another drummer, Dave, our first male drummer. Then life just got busy. We had kind of done everything we were gonna do with Burning Bush. And it was just getting too hectic.\"\n\nPlaylist: 30 best Alice Cooper songs by classic original lineup\n\nReuniting 'feels like family'\n\nShe and Ryther did get together over the years to write songs on acoustic guitar.\n\n\"We actually have some acoustic recordings we never released,\" Tanguay says.\n\nAll three members of the lineup reuniting for these shows are still active in music.\n\nIn addition to Yvonne Champagne, Tanguay is in Secret Delite, which played a few shows in Phoenix last year. Ryther has a band called Manx. And Creed's new band, the Sweet Talkers, will play their first gig in November.\n\nGetting back together \"feels like family,\" Tanguay says.\n\n\"We love it. We're really excited. We love playing Phoenix. And it's great to see our friends. We're pleased people still want to hear it.\"\n\nBurning Bush reunion shows\n\nPhoenix: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30.

After more than two years of trying, Tollett booked a reunion of Guns N’ Roses with frontman Axl Rose performing with original members Slash on lead guitar and Duff McKagan on bass for the first time at a major event since July 17, 1993.\n\nThey will play the festival on Saturday, April 16 and again on April 23.\n\nThe band warmed up for the Coachella gig with an intimate show at Los Angeles' Troubadour club on April 1.\n\nGuns N' Roses prep for tour with L.A. show\n\nThe festival, which has won the Pollstar award for Best Major Festival 10 of the past 11 years, also will include a reunion of LCD Soundsystem, which had announced their disbandment in 2011, and electronic artist Calvin Harris, who arguably drew Coachella’s biggest crowd in 2014 and who has received additional buzz recently as Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.\n\nBut the GNR reunion is one of those get-togethers few people could have imagined like The Eagles “Hell Freezes Over” Tour. In fact, after GNR announced their appearance at Coachella, they unveiled a “Not In This Life” tour.\n\nBillboard has reported GNR has asked for as much as $3 million per show on\n\nthat tour with “the Coachella payday likely significantly higher.” One site reported that GNR was getting $14 million for their two Coachella appearances, but Goldenvoice Vice President Skip Paige scoffed at that rumor, saying “Do the math.”\n\nWith 170 bands booked and the total gross from last year’s festival eclipsing $84 million, excluding sponsorship deals, it’s not inconceivable to think GNR might get $5 million from Goldenvoice.\n\nTollett doesn't talk numbers, but he did discuss the challenge of negotiating with all of the GNR parties, including the current GNR incarnation and Rose’s partners on the 1987 GNR album, Appetite For Destruction, which is still the best-selling U.S. debut album of all time.\n\n“I made a list of 10 people I needed to get on our side to make this happen and just worked through the list,” Tollett said in a rare look into his behind-the-scenes workings. “Some I’m really close to, some I’m not so close to and some I didn’t know, and then the band members. So I had to work through all of that.”\n\nThe original GNR lineup featured Rose, Slash and McKagan, plus rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin and drummer Steven Adler. Adler was fired after violating an agreement to refrain from recording while high on drugs, which even Slash, a recovering heroin addict, admitted in his eponymous autobiography was “kind of ridiculous and excessively harsh.” Adler sued the band for improper termination and won a settlement of $2.25 million plus 15 percent of the royalties for his GNR recordings.\n\nStradlin quit after a 1991 European tour, leaving Rose, Slash and McKagan as band partners and the others as band employees. But Rose owned a higher percentage of the band than his partners and apparently interpreted that to mean he had more creative control. He hired a keyboard player, Dizzy Reed, despite Slash’s desire to be solely guitar-driven. Reed is now being supplemented by Chris Pittman on keys and Melissa Reese on synthesizer.\n\nWhen Rose and a new GNR manager insisted on a new ownership agreement in 1995, Slash wrote that the inequity of the deal, combined with Rose’s habit of showing up late for gigs and rehearsals, or not showing up at all, prompted him to quit the band. McKagan quit the next year, leaving Rose with full ownership of the band’s name.\n\nStradlin, Adler and McKagan have performed with Rose’s GNR since 2006, but Rose refused to be inducted into the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame with them and Slash in 2012. He said in a letter to the Hall, “There’s a seemingly endless amount of revisionism and fantasies out there for the sake of self-promotion and business opportunities masking the actual realities.”\n\nTollett, who produces Coachella with his company, Goldenvoice, and its umbrella corporation, AEG Live!, said he heard rumblings around 2013 that the original GNR might consider reuniting.\n\nCoachella festival announces impressive chef lineup\n\n“It’s hard to say whose idea it was because I’ve been trying to get them for a long time,” he said. “A band’s got their own life. It’s got to be on their time schedule, not mine. And I’ve learned to really like that camp a lot. When I saw how many managers were involved and the potential soupy mess? But when I got in there, I saw it’s actually pretty well run. It’s been pretty mellow for me.”\n\nTollett shares a personal attorney with one of the GNR musicians and he’s worked with their booking agent for 25 years. So that, plus his professional relationship with them as a promoter, gave him an inside track to sign them for Coachella.\n\n“We had a little leg up in that 30 years ago and, one month, we (Goldenvoice) promoted Johnny Thunders and Guns N’ Roses at Fender’s Ballroom (in Long Beach) and then we did them with Cheap Trick,” Tollett said. “They were our go-to band anytime we had anything rock related because we were doing mostly punk rock at the time. So, we’ve had a relationship all these years. But we wanted to make sure everyone in their camp believed in Coachella because there’s a lot of opportunity if a band is going to get back together.”\n\nHe went to see their preview show for less than 300 people last weekend at the Troubadour in Hollywood and any doubts he might have had about the band dissipated.\n\n“It was phenomenal,” he said. “I forgot how great they were. It just seemed so right, maybe because we’ve seen them for so long. I remember the night they played ‘Welcome to the Jungle’ at Fender’s. I had actually seen them before that, opening for The Unforgiven at Stardust Ballroom. Everyone around us, it was like, ‘Wow, this is serious!’ Before they were signed, you could just see it. I saw it last (weekend). Slash plays guitar like a madman and Axl was hitting the button on the vocals. Together, they’re magic.”\n\nBruce Fessier covers music, film and the creative scene for The Desert Sun.

The Louder Than Life Festival is headed back to Louisville and will feature nearly 70 music acts over four days, with performances on three stages, along with award-winning bourbons, whiskey, spirits, craft beer and some of the best food in the city.\n\nThe sixth Louder Than Life music festival is set for Sept. 23-26, at Highland Festival Grounds at the Kentucky Exposition Center, 937 Phillips Lane in Louisville. The festival, which was canceled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, is making up for the lost year and has expanded from a three-day event to a four-day festival.\n\nThat means an entire day of added music. And it will be loud and rocking. The headliners for 2021 include Metallica, Disturbed and Korn, plus performances by Judas Priest, Jane's Addiction, Machine Gun Kelly, Staind, Breaking Benjamin, Rise Against, Cypress Hill, Gojira, Seether, Pennywise, Volbeat, Beartooth, Anthrax, Kentucky band Knocked Loose and more.\n\nLouder Than Life has also announced anyone attending the festival will need proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to enter the grounds. There will be other COVID-19 measures in place during the festival's four-day run from Sept. 23-26, including additional hand sanitizer stations. Masks are also encouraged.\n\nNumerous former headliners, including Nine Inch Nails, Snoop Dogg and Mudvayne, have dropped out of the festival over safety concerns.\n\nYou may like:Snoop Dogg drops out of the 2021 Louder Than Life music festival. Here's what to know\n\nNine Inch Nails made its announcement via its website, stating “It is with great regret that we are canceling all NIN appearances for the remainder of this year. When originally planned, these shows were intended to be a cathartic and celebratory return to live music. However, with each passing day it’s becoming more apparent we’re not at that place yet.\n\n\"We are sorry for any inconvenience or disappointment and look forward to seeing you again when the time is right.\"\n\nDisturbed, along with Volbeat and Atreyu, are replacing Nine Inch Nails.\n\nMudvayne dropped out mid-week after one of its band members tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n“After taking every precaution to follow CDC COVID protocols during rehearsals and recent performance, Chad Gray and a few staff members have unfortunately tested positive for COVID-19. The safety of our organization, fans and festival partners must come first. We are left no choice but to cancel our performance at Louder Than Life this weekend,\" the band said in a statement.\n\nPromoter Danny Wimmer Presents said \"the last few weeks have been a wild ride, but these bands made it clear how much they want to be out there playing for their fans and will be ready to take the stage. The road is going to be bumpy, but the team at DWP is undeterred and will continue to adapt to any roadblocks. We are committed to putting on the rock reunion(s) we’ve all been waiting for.\"\n\nThe annual show, which features food, bourbon and hard rock, has a notable impact on Louisville's bottom line. Louisville Tourism previously projected Louder Than Life to have an economic impact of nearly $5.8 million in 2021.\n\nYou may like:Louder Than Life requires COVID-19 vaccination, negative test results. What to know\n\n“To be able to bring America's biggest rock festival back in 2021 means everything to us. After a year filled with challenge after challenge, we worked incredibly hard to curate a lineup worth the wait for our fans,” Wimmer said previously. “The pandemic derailed our plans for two big Metallica sets in 2020 — so to have them back for 2021, along with KORN and the rest of this incredible lineup over four days, that’s the kind of ‘new normal’ that we’re all looking forward to.”\n\nSingle-day and weekend passes for Louder Than Life are still on sale at LouderThanLifeFestival.com starting at $99.50 for a single day and $249.50 for four days, plus fees.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the Louder Than Life 2021.\n\nDo I need to prove vaccination status to go to Louder Than Life?\n\nYes. Fans, artists, staff and crew and all other attendees will be required to show proof of either full COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.\n\nIf you are not fully vaccinated but wish to attend the festival, you will need a negative COVID-19 test result which must be obtained within 72-hours of the first day of coming into the campgrounds or festival grounds\n\nDo I need to wear a mask at Louder Than Life?\n\nYes. Louder Than Life will require masks in any indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status, and strongly requests that all fans wear a mask while in the camp or festival grounds.\n\nMore:Kentucky hardcore band Knocked Loose takes on Louder Than Life\n\nWhat do I need to know about entering the grounds for Louder Than Life?\n\nBefore entering the grounds, fans are encouraged to read through the health and safety section of the festival's website which states that if you attend the Louder Than Life Festival, you voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree to waive all claims and potential claims against the city of Louisville, Jefferson County, the Kentucky Venues, Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC and its affiliated companies relating to such risks.\n\nAt the entry gate, attendees must present a valid ID and proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test to receive your Fan Health Wristband, which will be valid for all camping and festival days.\n\nIn addition, festival organizations are asking fans to not to attend if any of the following are true:\n\nWithin 14-days before attending the festival you have tested positive, or been exposed to someone who has tested positive for, COVID-19;\n\nWithin 48-hours before attending the festival, you have experienced symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., a fever of 100.4F or higher, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, repeated shaking muscle pain/achiness, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, nasal congestion, runny nose, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue or any other symptoms associated with COVID-19 identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention);\n\nWithin 14-days before attending the festival, you have traveled to any international territory identified by federal or applicable state or local governments as being subject to travel or quarantine advisories due to COVID-19\n\nWhat other COVID-19 safety precautions are in place at Louder Than Life?\n\nThe festival will have increased hand sanitizer stations on-site, additional cleaning crews in high touch areas and will offer a cashless option for checkout at dedicated food, beverage and merchandise lines.\n\n2021 Louder Than Life lineup:\n\nThursday, Sept. 23\n\nKORN\n\nStaind\n\nCypress Hill\n\nAnthrax\n\nBeartooth\n\nSevendust\n\nKnocked Loose\n\nWage War\n\nMemphis May Fire\n\nEscape The Fate\n\nZero 9:36\n\nAvoid\n\nCurrents\n\nJeris Johnson\n\nAnother Day Dawns\n\nBlame My Youth\n\nFriday, Sept. 24\n\nMetallica\n\nJane’s Addiction\n\nRise Against\n\nGojira\n\nKillswitch Engage\n\nStarset\n\nAvatar\n\nFever 333\n\nTurnstile\n\nCleopatrick\n\nDead Sara\n\n’68\n\nThe Violent\n\nSouth Of Eden\n\nTallah\n\nJoyous Wolf\n\nContracult Collective\n\nYou may like:Another act drops out of Louder Than Life lineup.

What was the biggest?\n\nWas it a remarkable run of women performers for the second Reunion in a row? When this annual event at Willie Nelson's ranch west of Austin was last held in 2019 (the pandemic halted 2020 and 2021 versions), we marveled at the impressive slate of female artists who appeared.\n\nWas it the mid-afternoon set by the Lost Gonzo Band with guest Michael Martin Murphey, whose classics from Austin's 1970s cosmic-cowboy era infused the Reunion with the spirit of Willie's Armadillo World Headquarters heyday?\n\nWas it the lines-out-the-door crowds at the Saloon stage for beloved San Francisco rocker Chuck Prophet, who'd announced earlier this week that he'd been diagnosed with lymphoma but still made the trip to Luck?\n\nWas it the surprise appearance by Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Jason Isbell, who's playing his own show at this same venue Friday night but arrived early to get in on the good times?\n\nIt could have been any of those things in any other year. But a week after Willie lost his older sister and longtime piano player Bobbie Nelson, everyone's thoughts were first and foremost of her.\n\nMore:Bobbie Nelson, Willie Nelson's sister and longtime pianist, dies at 91\n\nWe were constantly reminded, as Bobbie's grand piano took up a good chunk of the event's main stage all day, wrapped in a black tarp. The question of who might play piano with Willie was answered the night before, when he performed at a private event with the piano bench empty. There could be no better tribute.\n\nAs Willie performed — his sons Lukas and Micah by his side, along with band members Mickey Raphael, Kevin Smith and Billy English — a subtle projection lingered on the backdrop of stars behind them. It read: \"In Loving Memory of Bobbie Nelson, 1931-2022.\"\n\nWillie's performances that Wednesday and Thursday were just the start of a residency-type stretch of Luck shows in the next few weeks, which is fitting since Luck is, well, his residency. The Old West movie set that was built there for his 1980s film \"Red Headed Stranger\" increasingly is being used as a concert venue. Isbell and Austin phenom Shakey Graves will perform there Friday and Saturday, respectively, with Willie taking the stage on Sunday and returning for two more shows March 26 and April 2.\n\nMore:Willie Nelson adds three shows at his Luck TX property near Austin\n\nBut let's get back to all those other highlights from a glorious afternoon in the Hill Country. First: the women. We arrived around noon, about an hour after gates opened, and right off the bat were impressed by a short acoustic duo set in the Saloon by Leslie Mendelson and Steve McEwan.\n\n\"It's all I want to hear, ringing in my ears,\" they sang in harmony on what appears to be a new song called \"Rock and Roll on the Radio,\" but it sounded like an instant classic. We caught Mendelson as a guest vocalist last fall at Jackson Browne's \"Austin City Limits\" taping; now we'd like to see Mendelson have her own slot on the show. (\"Austin City Limits\" executive producer Terry Lickona was making the rounds at Luck on Thursday, so who knows.) Mendelson performs at 3 p.m. Friday at the Continental Club, part of the Atomic Music Group day party.\n\nMore great sets by women artists followed, like a boxer unleashing a flurry of lefts and rights. Hey, check out Danielle Ponder in the Revival Tent. We remembered being bowled away by Yola in 2019, a few months before she earned a Grammy best new artist nomination and got a full hour on \"Austin City Limits\"; Ponder's set suggested similar highs to come from this extraordinary public defender turned musician. Check out this clip from \"Why Won't the Stars Align\":\n\nThen it was New Zealand's Tami Neilson, who brought the main stage crowd — and herself — nearly to tears with a beautiful ballad called \"Beyond the Stars\" that featured a duet vocal from none other than Willie himself. Neilson was glad it came at the end of her set: \"How the hell am I supposed to do anything after that? I'm retiring tomorrow,\" she joked — or at least we hope, as we'd like to hear a lot more from Neilson.\n\nAcross the way a few minutes later, Lukas Nelson popped on the beer garden stage for a song with Lily Meola, whose backing crew otherwise was all women. The cavalcade of female stars just kept on coming: Kentucky singer-songwriter S.G. Goodman rocked out with her band on the mainstage; Adia Victoria wowed the lucky few who crammed into the tiny chapel; and Allison Russell showed why she's currently up for three Grammys with a spellbinding set in the Revival Tent. (Lickona was in the crowd and mentioned she'll be taping \"Austin City Limits\" soon.)\n\nMore:Foo Fighters lead a stacked 'Austin City Limits' taping lineup this spring\n\nWe headed back into town at dusk, but there was more to come from the women, including Grammy best new artist nominee Michelle Zauner's band Japanese Breakfast and mesmerizing Sub Pop records artist Weyes Blood. Next time you see a festival lineup that's lacking in female performers, show them the Luck 2022 schedule.\n\nThe Lost Gonzos may have bucked that trend with its lineup of six men onstage (plus two more when Murphey and his guitarist son Ryan joined), but their presence was welcome, as it provided context for how Willie became an Austin legend in the first place.\n\nThe Gonzos — original members Gary P. Nunn, Bob Livingston and Jon Inmon anchored Thursday's lineup — were backing Murphey and Jerry Jeff Walker on classic rootsy material in Austin even before Willie arrived and kicked off the outlaw country craze. (Drummer Freddie Krc, pianist David Webb and guitarist Steve Lang rounded out the lineup.)\n\nWalker died in 2020, but the Gonzos paid tribute to him with a lovely rendition of \"Hill Country Rain,\" before Murphey joined for a medley of \"Geronimo's Cadillac\" and \"Cosmic Cowboy\" plus the obligatory but exquisite \"Wildfire.\" Nunn took the reins for the finale, his signature-song \"London Homesick Blues,\" with many in the crowd joining in for its \"home with the armadillo\" refrain. And they brought it all back to Bobbie, asking the crowd for a moment of silence in her memory near the end of the set.\n\nStrolling the spacious grounds at Luck, one is prone to pick up on a few rumors here and there, often centered on unannounced performers. The grapevine trotted out stars such as Dolly Parton, Bob Dylan and Tanya Tucker in guessing who might fill the 9 p.m. slot marked as \"special guest\" on the schedule, but Luck did quite well by booking Americana heavyweight Isbell and his 400 Unit band in that slot.\n\nOne Willie-related rumor we're hoping turns out to be true involved his annual Fourth of July Picnic potentially moving from Circuit of the Americas to the new Q2 Stadium, home of Austin's Major League Soccer team.\n\nTimeline:The definitive history of Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic\n\nAnd finally, there was uncertainty about whether Prophet would appear. He'd canceled shows last weekend at the Continental Club, and on March 15, we learned why. \"I've been diagnosed with lymphoma,\" he told fans via social media. \"I'm getting great care with Kaiser Permanente and met with my oncologist today and the prognosis is good. In fact, the Doctor says I can go out and play some shows.\"\n\nSo here he was, onstage with his wife, keyboardist Stephanie Finch, and the rest of his Mission Express band, rocking out on the Saloon stage like there was no tomorrow. And he brought the perfect tune for the location. \"Wish me Luck!\" he sang out on his song of that title, with its gentlemanly follow-up line: \"If it's not too much to ask.\"\n\nIt's not, Chuck. May the Luck be with you.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2015/03/25/one-direction-beach-boys-black-sabbath-alice-in-chains/70442856/", "title": "Bands tune up with new members", "text": "Donna Freydkin\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe sound! The fury! That screaming you hear? One Direction fans lamenting the loss of Zayn Malik. The group said it will continue as a foursome, reconfiguring itself much like these bands did as well -- for better or, often, worse.\n\nThe Doors: Moody, drug-using singer Jim Morrison died July 3, 1971, of an overdose and was found in a bathtub in Paris by his girlfriend, Pamela Courson. Morrison was a magnetic, electrifying stage presence and the remaining band members, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger decided to soldier on without him. Bad move.\n\nOutcome: There's a reason few, if any, have heard of or listened to Other Voices, released in 1971 sans Morrison. Some frontman are just irreplaceable.\n\nBlack Sabbath: Mercurial musician Ozzy Osbourne quit the band that made him a star in 1977 and rejoined it again in January 1978. But the group was about drugs, and not hugs, and Osbourne's last performance with his mates was in New Mexico in December 1978. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who delivered vocals markedly different from the frenetic, eery ones that made Osbourne famous.\n\nOutcome: Don't mess with magic. Sabbath never regained its Osbourne glory, and Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start his own band. Osbourne, meanwhile, went platinum with his solo album, Speak of the Devil, released in November 1982. But the band that plays together earns together, and Osbourne rejoined the group for a North American tour in 2013, following a 2001 outing, and hit Europe as well. The guys are recording yet another album this year, and will hit the road for a final tour.\n\nJourney: This group has had more changes than a Broadway show. Steve Perry, the lead vocalist, departed in 1998. He was replaced by Steve Augeri. Who was then replaced, in 2006, by Jeff Scott Soto. Who was replaced by Arnel Pineda in 2007.\n\nOutcome: Never, ever stop believin', folks. Journey's album Revelation, featuring Pineda, debuted at No.5 on the Billboard charts and the group's second album with Pineda, Eclipse, was released on May 24, 2011, and debuted at No.13. They're currently on tour (tickets still available) and their signature song was featured on Glee. Take that to the bank.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd: The current iteration of the group bears no resemblance to the guys who crooned Sweet Home Alabama, after three keys members -- including lead singer Ronnie Van Zant -- died in an airplane crash in 1977. The survivors banded back together in 1988 for a reunion tour.\n\nOutcome: Yes, the band is still viable. And it was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But it's a dull version of the original, recording music and touring. We defy you to name any permanent members.\n\nVan Halen:Jump if you can name the group's lead singer. The original foursome, who got together in 1972, were Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony. Shaggy-haired Roth departed in 1985 and was replaced by Sammy Hagar. Not a bad move, given that the group churned out four chart-topping albums. Hagar left in 1996 and was replaced by former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone. He exited in 1999.\n\nOutcome: Van Halen went on a break and reunited with Hagar in 2003. Hagar left, was replaced by Roth, who's still there. The band announced a US tour starting in July, with Roth on vocals.\n\nAlice In Chains: The Seattle group that brought us Would and Rooster was felled by the drug overdose death of its lead vocalist, Layne Staley, in 2002. Founder Jerry Cantrell kept things humming along, intermittently, but never recaptured the brooding, grittiness of Staley's sound. Indeed, the group was dormant before reuniting, with singer William DuVall taking over for Staley.\n\nOutcome: Alice in Chains tours, and released The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here in 2013. But it goes without saying that it's stale without Staley.\n\nQueen: The British band brought the drama with hits like We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions, performed by mustachioed frontman Freddie Mercury. He died of complications related to AIDS in 1991, and the remaining band members continued to sporadically perform together, including with vocalist Paul Rodgers under the name Queen + Paul Rodgers.\n\nOutcome: You can't regain the brilliance of Mercury's stage presence, but you can't fault Queen for trying. The band is now known as Queen + Adam Lambert, releasing an album in November called Queen Forever, featuring Mercury's vocals.\n\nTLC: The three-woman group was comprised of Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins, rapper Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes and singer Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas. In other words, they were CrazySexyCool. Lopes died in a car crash in Honduras in 2002, leaving the band bereft.\n\nOutcome: In 2002, the two remaining ladies released their fourth album, 3D, which featured songs paying tribute to Lopes and included her vocals. In January, T and C announced plans to record a fifth album and launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund it. And while they continue to perform, that touch of madness that Lopes brought to the group is sorely missed.\n\nThe Beach Boys: They've sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Not bad at all.

We did a couple of shows earlier in the year together and everybody hit it off so well. My two lead singers, Lou Gramm and (current frontman) Kelly Hansen, really hit it off like a house on fire and the rest of the guys were happy to be a part of it. It was very emotional. It brought up a lot of stuff from the past, but it just felt natural and we fell right back into it.\n\nQ: Was it hard to get all the guys back together?\n\nLou Gramm: Surprisingly not. Everybody was actually pretty boned up on their instruments and with a little bit of practice, it was sounding good. Everyone was anxious within reason. We didn’t want to make more of it than what it was, but it ends up being a lot of fun.\n\nQ: With so many members of Foreigner past and present on stage, how do you plan to divvy up the set list?\n\nGramm: The original band is concentrating on songs from “Double Vision” and then (the current lineup) plays songs from any and all of the albums. After they play and we play, we come out for an encore and do “Juke Box Hero\" and “Hot Blooded” together.\n\nQ: What do you remember about the reception to \"Double Vision\" in 1978?\n\nJones: With that album, there was a huge amount of pressure on us to avoid the \"sophomore jinx.\" A lot of people were wondering whether we could repeat the incredible success of the first album (their 1977 self-titled debut). Plus, we were going head to head with The Rolling Stones' \"Some Girls,\" (which was released the same month as \"Double Vision\"). We kept a tally of sales and after about 10 months, we outsold The Rolling Stones. It didn't get much better than that.\n\nQ: Lou, you said in an interview back in 2013 that you and Mick had \"no relationship\" whatsoever.\n\nGramm: At that point, we weren’t on very good terms. But in 2015, we were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and they wanted us to perform together. So we kind of broke the ice in rehearsals, and it certainly was an honor to be inducted with my writing partner. After that, the relationship warmed up.\n\nJones: We both were struck by much good stuff we've achieved together, so why not just bury the hatchet and move on?\n\nQ: Why didn't you speak for so many years?\n\nJones: We were at odds with each other. We had never really come to any kind of closure on several breakups of the band and still felt a little animosity between us. Things were said — very often things that we had nothing to do with, but it seemed like people got a laugh out of spreading misinformation.\n\nGramm: It just wasn't feeling right. One thing led to another, and I decided to go my own way. I don't regret that because it gave me the opportunity to really grow as an artist and a songwriter, and I think I'm a better person for it.\n\nQ: Now that you've reunited, could there be new Foreigner music on the way?\n\nGramm: Mick and I had about five or six Foreigner songs that we were working on when we parted (ways). I still have the the demos of those songs, and we listened to them again a few months ago and they still sound good to us. So we may pick a few of those up and then work on some new ideas.\n\nJones: That's an interesting little project for next year.

Could a similar comeback be in store for Culture Club?\n\nRELATED:Culture Club, Boy George delight at the Celebrity Theatre\n\nMikey Craig, bassist for the eclectic pop band, isn't so sure. Yes, the group has reformed with its classic lineup, featuring flamboyant lead singer Boy George, drummer Jon Moss and guitarist Roy Hay. And yes, the group has recorded a disc called \"Tribes\" that is awaiting release.\n\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\n\nSo, the group is definitely back. But major, new-songs-played-on-the-radio stardom could be another story.\n\n“It would be great if we had a hit record, but nowadays record sales are nothing like they were,” says Craig, calling from London. “People probably make albums more for their own satisfaction these days. That’s pretty much what we did. Culture Club had pretty much died away, but we knew there was still another great album in us, and we’ve done that now.”\n\nHowever, there's still the matter of when and if the disc will be released. There is a PledgeMusic campaign that promised the disc would appear this spring, but that deadline already has come and gone. And Craig, who called in June to plug the group's Phoenix concert, offered little insight about when \"Tribes\" would appear. He does, however, sound enthusiastic about the album. One track called “A Different Man” is inspired by Sly Stone and features a retro soul groove. Another tune, “Runaway Train,” has a country vibe and deals with the group's heady period in the '80s.\n\nAs the song's title indicates, it was a wild time. Formed in 1981, the British group scored major international success with their delightful, boundary-crossing records. There was the country-flavored \"Karma Chameleon.\" \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\" had a reggae tinge. \"Church of the Poison Mind\" was an electrifying Motown pastiche. \"Move Away\" was uptown urban soul at its sleekest.\n\nAll that versatility paid off. The group scored six Top 10 hits in the States, nine in their homeland. There were magazine covers, tours and TV appearances. The band even guest-starred on \"The A-Team,\" and you can't get much more mainstream than that.\n\nBut the group's spectacular crash, fueled by Boy George's drug problems and a fiery, failed romantic relationship between George and Moss, left plenty of scars. That's one reason why Craig, 56, isn't sure he wants to return to the full-speed-ahead stardom of the MTV days.\n\n“I don’t really miss it, to be quite honest,” says Craig, a friendly, thoughtful sort. “The highs were absolutely high. They were really, really high. But the lows were really low. I think I’d like something in the middle, to be honest.”\n\nThe band regrouped in 2014 and launched their first post-comeback world tour this year, a 60-city affair that runs through September. Craig, speaking before the tour launch, sounds a bit sheepish at the thought.\n\n“I've never been away from my family for this length of time,\" he says. \"And even when we were one of the biggest bands in the world, we didn't do the kind of touring that reflected that, so we've honestly never been together for this length of time. That does worry me a little.\"\n\nHe hopes maturity now factors in. After all, the men — save for George — are all fathers, and the guys are firmly in their 50s. But that also means everyone is used to getting things their own way.\n\n\"We're older now, and everybody's got their own ideas of how things work. That makes it a bit trickier to do everything. But I think we respect one another a bit more now, and we take the time to talk about things. We know what buttons not to push. Hopefully, it all works itself out.\"\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nThe turbulent relationship between George and Moss, which wasn't widely known in the '80s, appears to have smoothed itself out.\n\n“It's hard to talk about, because it was Jon and George's relationship,\" Craig says. \"But I think when there are two members in a band who have a relationship, it becomes this kind of dominating force. It worked in a good way, in that I think a lot of creativity came out of it, but at the same time, it was quite destructive. That’s kind of why we fizzled out.\"\n\nReach the reporter at randy.cordova@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Bush’s administration and was embraced by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe plaintiffs and their attorneys were visibly emotional when the jury’s decision were read. The decision marks a key moment in the years-long process that began in 2018 when the families took legal action against Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems, the parent of the fringe media organization Infowars.\n\nJones baselessly said again and again after the 2012 mass shooting, in which 26 people were killed, that the incident was staged, and that the families and first responders were “crisis actors.” The plaintiffs throughout the trial described in poignant terms how the lies had prompted unrelenting harassment against them and compounded the emotional agony of losing their loved ones.\n\nPlaintiffs in the trial included family members of eight school students and employees, in addition to one FBI agent who responded to the scene. The three cases were all condensed into the single trial.\n\nJones was not in the courtroom for the verdict. He was streaming live when the jury’s decision was read in court, mocked the decision on his Infowars show and used it to fundraise.\n\nIt’s unclear when or how much of the money the plaintiffs will ultimately see. Jones has said that he will appeal the decision and during his Wednesday broadcast said that there “ain’t no money” to pay the massive figure the jury awarded the plaintiffs.\n\nChristopher Mattei, an attorney for the plaintiffs, had urged jurors to award at least a half a billion dollars for having permanently mangled the lives of his clients. The figure, he said, would represent the more than 550 million online impressions Jones’ Sandy Hook lie allegedly received online.\n\n“You may say that is astronomical. It is,” Mattei said. “It’s exactly what Alex Jones set himself up to do. That’s what he built. He built a lie machine that could push this stuff out. You reap what you sow.”\n\nMattei praised the jurors after the verdict was reached.\n\n“The jury’s verdict is a testament to that courage, in a resounding affirmation that people of goodwill, dedicated to the truth, mindful of their responsibilities to their fellow citizens can come together to protect the innocent, to reveal lies masquerading as truth, and to set right a historic wrong,” Mattei told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nThe decision in Connecticut comes two months after a separate jury in Texas determined that Jones and his company should award two Sandy Hook parents who sued in that state nearly $50 million. Later this month, the judge in that case will consider whether to reduce the punitive damages awarded under Texas law.\n\nWhile Jones initially lied about the 2012 shooting, he later acknowledged that the massacre had occurred as he faced multiple lawsuits. But he failed to comply with court orders during the discovery process of the lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas, leading the families in each state to win default judgments against him.\n\nDuring the latest trial, families of the Sandy Hook victims offered emotional testimony, telling the jury in haunting terms how Jones’ lies about the shooting had permanently altered their lives and compounded the pain of losing their loved ones.\n\nJones, who was cross-examined by the plaintiffs’ attorneys, but chose not to testify in his own defense as was originally planned, sought to portray himself as a victim of an elaborate “deep state” conspiracy against him.\n\nIn a particularly explosive moment in the trial, Jones tangled with an attorney for the plaintiffs, accusing him of “ambulance chasing,” before descending into an unhinged rant in court about “liberals.”\n\nThe judge overseeing the case admonished Jones several times during his testimony, warning him even at one point that he could be held in contempt of court if he violated her rules moving forward.\n\nJones has attacked the judicial process, even acknowledging in court that he had referred to the proceedings as those of a “kangaroo court” and called the judge a “tyrant.” He has already indicated that he plans to appeal.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/04/jan-6-panel-asked-alex-jones-texts-sandy-hook-lawyer-says/10238783002/", "title": "Alex Jones ordered to pay Sandy Hook parents more than $4 million ...", "text": "Jim Vertuno\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAUSTIN, Texas – A Texas jury on Thursday ordered conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to pay more than $4 million in compensatory damages to the parents of a 6-year-old boy who was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, marking the first time the Infowars host has been held financially liable for repeatedly claiming the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history was a hoax.\n\nThe Austin jury must still decide how much the Infowars host must pay in punitive damages to Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, whose son Jesse Lewis was among the 20 children and six educators who were killed in the 2012 attack in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nThe parents had sought at least $150 million in compensation for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Jones’ attorney asked the jury to limit damages to $8 – $1 for each of the compensation charges they are considering – and Jones himself said any award over $2 million “would sink us.”\n\nWATCH:Alex Jones testifies Sandy Hook shooting was '100 percent real' during defamation trial\n\n'YOUR ATTORNEYS MESSED UP':Alex Jones confronted with texts from his phone in Sandy Hook defamation trial\n\nIt likely won't be the last judgment against Jones over his claims that the attack was staged in the interests of increasing gun control. A Connecticut judge has ruled against him in a similar lawsuit brought by other victims' families and an FBI agent who worked on the case.\n\nThe jury returns Friday to hear more evidence about Jones and his company's finances.\n\n“We aren’t done folks,” Bankston said. “We knew coming into this case it was necessary to shoot for the moon to get to understand we were serious and passionate. After tomorrow, he’s going to owe a lot more.\"\n\nThe Texas award could set a marker for other cases against Jones and underlines the financial threat he's facing. It also raises new questions about the ability of Infowars – which has been banned from YouTube, Spotify and Twitter for hate speech – to continue operating, although the company's finances remain unclear.\n\nJones conceded during the trial that the attack was real and that he was wrong to have lied about it. But Heslin and Lewis told jurors that an apology wouldn't suffice and called on them to make Jones pay for the years of suffering he has put them and other Sandy Hook families through.\n\nJones' media company Free Speech Systems, which is Infowars' parent company, filed for bankruptcy during the two-week trial.\n\nAlso on Thursday, an attorney for the parents said that the U.S. House Jan. 6 committee has requested two years' worth of records from Jones' phone.\n\nAttorney Mark Bankston told the Texas court where Jones is on trial to determine how much he owes for defaming the parents that the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has requested the digital records. He later said outside of court that he plans to comply with the request.\n\nA spokesperson for the committee declined to comment Thursday.\n\nAs Jones testified at the trial on Wednesday, Bankston revealed that the Infowars host's lead attorney, Andino Reynal, had mistakenly sent him the last two years' worth of texts from Jones' cellphone.\n\nReynal asked Judge Maya Guerra Gamble to declare a mistrial over the mistaken transfer of records and said they should have been returned and any copies destroyed. Gamble rejected the request.\n\nReynal also accused Bankston of trying to perform \"for a national audience.\" He said the material included a review copy of text messages over six months from late 2019 into the first quarter of 2020.\n\nBankston said his team followed Texas' civil rules of evidence and that Jones' attorneys missed their chance to properly request the return of the records.\n\n'LIVING HELL':Sandy Hook parents say Alex Jones' claims spawned death threats, harassment\n\n\"Mr. Reynal is using a fig leaf (to cover) for his own malpractice,\" Bankston said.\n\nHe said the records mistakenly sent to him included some medical records of plaintiffs in other lawsuits against Jones.\n\n\"Mr. Jones and his intimate messages with Roger Stone are not protected,\" Bankston said, referring to former President Donald Trump's longtime ally.\n\nRolling Stone, quoting unnamed sources, reported Wednesday evening that the Jan. 6 committee was preparing to subpoena the data from the parents' attorneys to assist in the investigation of the deadly riot.\n\nBankston said outside of court Thursday that the committee had requested the phone records, but hadn't subpoenaed them. He also said he wasn't familiar with everything that was in the records yet, including whether they include any information that the committee is seeking because there was so much information in them.\n\n\"We don't know (yet) the full scope and breadth,\" of the material, Bankston said. \"We certainly saw text messages from as far back as 2019. ... In terms of what all is on that phone, it's going to take a little while to figure that out.\"\n\n\"The Jan. 6 committee doesn't have any more information about what's on that phone than I do. I don't know if it even covers the time period they are interested in,\" he said.\n\nJones didn't attend Thursday's court proceedings. But on his Infowars show Thursday, he said the records were from a year before Jan. 6 and had \"nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"And if anything, I say more radical things on air than I do on text messages. And the idea that there's some type of criminal activity on there is preposterous,\" he said.\n\nLast month, the Jan. 6 committee showed graphic and violent text messages and played videos of right-wing figures, including Jones, and others vowing that Jan. 6 would be the day they would fight for Trump.\n\nThe committee first subpoenaed Jones in November, demanding a deposition and documents related to his efforts to spread misinformation about the 2020 election and a rally on the day of the attack.\n\nIn the subpoena letter, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman, said Jones helped organize the Jan. 6 rally at the Ellipse that preceded the insurrection. He also wrote that Jones repeatedly promoted Trump's false claims of election fraud, urged his listeners to go to Washington for the rally, and march from the Ellipse to the Capitol.\n\nThompson also wrote that Jones \"made statements implying that you had knowledge about the plans of President Trump with respect to the rally.\"\n\nThe nine-member panel was especially interested in what Jones said shortly after Trump's now-infamous Dec. 19, 2020, tweet in which he told his supporters to \"be there, will be wild!\" on Jan. 6.\n\n\"You went on InfoWars that same day and called the tweet 'One of the most historic events in American history,'\" the letter continued.\n\nIn January, Jones was deposed by the committee during an hourslong, virtual meeting in which he said he exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination \"almost 100 times.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/12/alex-jones-verdict-jury-orders-965-million-sandy-hook-lies/10479732002/", "title": "Connecticut jury orders Alex Jones to pay nearly $1 billion for Sandy ...", "text": "Dave Collins\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nWATERBURY, Conn. — The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay $965 million to people who suffered from his false claim that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax, a jury in Connecticut decided Wednesday.\n\nThe verdict is the second big judgment against the Infowars host over his relentless promotion of the lie that the 2012 massacre never happened, and that the grieving families seen in news coverage were actors hired as part of a plot to take away people's guns.\n\nIt came in a lawsuit filed by the relatives of five children and three educators killed in the mass shooting, plus an FBI agent who was among the first responders to the scene.

People hurled abusive comments on social media. Erica Lafferty, the daughter of slain Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, testified that people mailed rape threats to her house. Mark Barden told of how conspiracy theorists had urinated on the grave of his 7-year-old son, Daniel, and threatened to dig up the coffin.\n\nTestifying during the trial, Jones acknowledged he had been wrong about Sandy Hook. The shooting was real, he said. But both in the courtroom and on his show, he was defiant.\n\nHe called the proceedings a \"kangaroo court,\" mocked the judge, called the plaintiffs' lawyer an ambulance chaser and labeled the case an affront to free speech rights. He claimed it was a conspiracy by Democrats and the media to silence him and put him out of business.\n\n\"I've already said 'I'm sorry' hundreds of times and I'm done saying I'm sorry,\" he said during his testimony.\n\nTwenty children and six adults died in the shooting on Dec. 14, 2012. The defamation trial was held at a courthouse in Waterbury, about 20 miles from Newtown, where the attack took place.\n\nThe lawsuit accused Jones and Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, of using the mass killing to build his audience and make millions of dollars. Experts testified that Jones' audience swelled when he made Sandy Hook a topic on the show, as did his revenue from product sales.\n\nIn both the Texas lawsuit and the one in Connecticut, judges found the company liable for damages by default after Jones failed to cooperate with court rules on sharing evidence, including failing to turn over records that might have showed whether Infowars had profited from knowingly spreading misinformation about mass killings.\n\nBecause he was already found liable, Jones was barred from mentioning free speech rights and other topics during his testimony.\n\nJones now faces a third trial, in Texas around the end of the year, in a lawsuit filed by the parents of another child killed in the shooting.\n\nIt is unclear how much of the verdicts Jones can afford to pay.

More defamation trials, more damages and, possibly, criminal charges\n\nJones also said that if he could, he would tell the jury to “research history and understand how dangerous it is when they’ll pick one event of speech that they can say is hurtful, to then use that to set the precedent, to try to knock over all the dominoes and take everybody’s free speech away.”\n\nWithout Jones to testify, Bellis excused the panel at midday. But, at the request of the plaintiffs' attorney, repeated her instructions that the jury should not do any outside research, should avoid any news conferences outside the courthouse and avoid media coverage of the trial.\n\nTwenty children and six educators died in the shooting nearly a decade ago in Newtown, Connecticut. The plaintiffs in this trial, which is taking place about 20 miles away in Waterbury, include relatives of eight of the children killed and an FBI agent who responded to the massacre.\n\nThe trial was set to continue Friday with other plaintiff witnesses.\n\nJones was found liable last year by default for damages to plaintiffs without a trial, a consequence for what the judge called his repeated failures to turn over documents to their lawyers. The six-member jury is now deciding how much Jones and Free Speech Systems, parent of Jones' Infowars media platforms, should pay the families for defaming them and intentionally inflicting emotional distress.\n\nPattis is arguing any damages should be limited and accused the victims' relatives of exaggerating the harm the lies caused them.\n\nBellis has ordered Jones not to mention in his testimony several topics, including free speech rights, the percentage of Jones' shows that discussed Sandy Hook, and whether he profited from those shows or a similar case in Texas.\n\nA jury in that case last month in Austin, Texas, ordered Jones to pay nearly $50 million in damages to the parents of one of the children killed in the shooting. A third trial in Texas is expected to begin near the end of the year.\n\nThe Connecticut trial is scheduled to resume Tuesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/media/alex-jones-sandy-hook-texas-trial/index.html", "title": "Alex Jones trial: Sandy Hook parents ask jury to return $150 million ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe lawyer for two Sandy Hook families that have sued right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a jury on Tuesday to award his clients $150 million in damages in a trial that will determine how much money they receive.\n\n“Now that is a huge verdict to be sure, but it is one that will do justice to the level of harm done in this case,” Mark Bankston, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said in his opening statement.\n\n“Harm that was done to the parents, grieving parents of murdered children who have had to endure for 10 years, the most despicable and vile campaign of defamation and slander in American history,” Bankston added.\n\nBankston said the $150 million figure amounted to $1 for each person who believes false information about the Sandy Hook shooting pushed by Jones, which he argued is about 75 million. The additional $75 million would be to compensate the parents for the emotional and mental anguish they’ve endured over the last decade due to harassment from Jones and his followers.\n\nJones, who is also being sued in Connecticut by the families of other Sandy Hook victims, was found legally responsible in October for false claims he made about the tragedy that claimed 26 lives.\n\nThe judge in the case, Travis County District Court Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, issued default judgments against Jones because he refused to comply with court orders.\n\nJones baselessly said in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting that the incident was staged. Facing lawsuits, Jones has since acknowledged the shooting occurred. He said in a 2019 sworn deposition that a “form of psychosis” caused him to make his false comments.\n\nIn his opening statement, Bankston said, “By just one month after the shooting Alex Jones would become patient zero for the Sandy Hook hoax, he had created a sensation.”\n\nBankston also walked the jury through what he said was a decade-long timeline of Jones’ efforts to push the Sandy Hook hoax narrative, saying that despite a public plea from one of the parents to Jones asking the radio host to stop spreading false information, Jones “doubled down,” targeting the parent in video content and calling him an actor lying about having a child who’d died in the shooting.\n\nIn his own opening statement, Andino Reynal, an attorney for Jones, accused the plaintiffs’ lawyer of misleading the court.\n\n“What we heard was a conspiracy of lies,” Reynal said of Bankston’s opening remarks.\n\nReynal sought to portray Jones as someone who had merely made mistakes when covering the Sandy Hook shooting and suggested the quick nature of the news cycle was in part to blame.\n\n“If you understand the news cycle and how it works, commentators, people on talk shows, they get information, they run with it,” Reynal said. “Alex Jones was wrong to believe these people. But he didn’t do it out of spite.”\n\n“The evidence will show he did it because he believed it because he thought it was important coverage,” Reynal added.\n\nThousands of people were questioning the shooting, not just Jones, Reynal argued, due to what he called “bad coverage” by the mainstream media.\n\n“Alex Jones doesn’t trust the government. Millions of Americans don’t trust the government,” Reynal said.\n\nEvidence to be presented during the trial will show Jones didn’t cause harassment of the parents, Reynal said. He also questioned whether the parents heard Jones’ content about the school shooting.\n\nReynal said he is “honored” to represent Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems.\n\n“He is one of the most polarizing figures in this nation,” Reynal said. “And I am honored to represent him not because I agree with everything he says, but I agree with his right to say it and I agree with every Americans right to choose what they watch and listen to and what they believe.”\n\nDuring the proceedings on Tuesday, Gamble admonished Jones for speaking to the news media during a recess.\n\n“We’re not going to have that happen again,” Gamble said.\n\nGamble said every participant in the trial is “ordered to be silent” about the case when outside the courtroom “or if there is any member of the jury in sight.”", "authors": ["Lauren Del Valle Oliver Darcy", "Lauren Del Valle", "Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/media/alex-jones-punitive-damages-sandy-hook/index.html", "title": "Alex Jones on trial: Jury finds Infowars founder should pay $45.2 ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA Texas jury has decided to penalize Alex Jones with $45.2 million in punitive damages in a lawsuit filed by the parents of Sandy Hook shooting victim Jesse Lewis.\n\nPlaintiffs Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis were awarded a total of just under $50 million in both compensatory and punitive damages. Of the total $49.3 million, the $45.2 million in punitive damages may be reduced due to Texas statute.\n\n“Care and concern is so important and we saw what happens when there is a dearth of that, and so I hope that we all just go home tonight and everybody that’s reading these articles and hearing this message and you chose love with your kids, because you can,” Lewis said Friday after learning of the jury’s decision. “That means being present in the moment with them, looking into their eyes, giving them a hug and just moving from there. Just every moment, realize that you have a choice and your choice is love.”\n\nThe jurors began deliberating around 12:30 pm CT on Friday, after Judge Maya Guerra Gamble reminded them that in a default judgment against him Jones was already found liable for defamation and “intentional infliction of emotional distress” against Lewis and Heslin.\n\nIn an emotional closing argument Friday, Lewis and Heslin’s attorney Wesley Todd Ball had said to the jury, “We ask that you send a very very simple message, and that is, stop Alex Jones. Stop the monetization of misinformation and lies. Please.”\n\nAfter the jury’s decision was announced in court, Jones’ attorney, Andino Reynal, immediately raised the issue of Texas law and the amount of punitive damages. Following the proceeding, he addressed it again while speaking outside the court.\n\n“We think the verdict was too high. As for punitive damages, Texas law caps them at $750,000 per plaintiff so this verdict today amounts to $1.5 million in punitives. Alex Jones will be on the air today, he’ll be on the air tomorrow, he’ll be on the air next week. He’s going to keep doing his job holding the power structure accountable. That’s our only statement,” Reynal said after court.\n\nJudge Gamble acknowledged Reynal’s objection in court but did not immediately rule on it.\n\n“So we do have laws in Texas where we claim to trust our juries and then we don’t trust our juries, and that’s true,” Gamble said at the time. “And I’m sure the judgment will properly reflect that laws of Texas in that regard, so don’t need to worry about that.”\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for the plaintiffs for comment on Reynal’s argument.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Ball had urged the jurors to “deter Alex Jones from ever doing this awfulness again” and “to deter others who may want to step into his shoes.”\n\nReynal had argued for a far lower sum, suggesting that the jurors should multiply Jones’ purported earnings per hour of $14,000 and the 18 hours that he said Jones talked about Sandy Hook on Infowars, for a sum of around a quarter million dollars.\n\nOn Thursday, in the first phase of the trial, the jury awarded the parents $4.1 million in compensatory damages, a far smaller amount than the $150 million the parents’ attorneys had sought. In his closing argument, Ball thanked the jury for their decision to award the $4.1 million, saying it had already made a huge difference in the parents’ lives, and asked them to award enough in punitive damages to bring the total to $150 million.\n\nBernard Pettingill testifying on August 5. Pool\n\nPunitive damages are a form of punishment for a defendant’s behavior. Jones, the head of the conspiratorial media outlet Infowars, repeatedly lied about the Sandy Hook massacre. He stoked conspiracy theories about the victims and their families, prompting multiple defamation lawsuits. He has since acknowledged that the mass shooting occurred.\n\nJones claimed in his testimony that a jury award of just $2 million would destroy him financially. But on Friday morning the jurors heard testimony about Jones’ wealth from an economist, Bernard Pettingill, Jr., who estimated Jones has a net worth of between $135 million and $270 million.\n\nPettingill, Jr., who examined several years of records for Jones and Infowars’ parent Free Speech Systems, said Jones used a series of shell companies to hide his money.\n\nJones used two large loans to make it appear he was broke when in fact he was not, Pettingill, Jr. testified.\n\n“Alex Jones knows where the money is, he knows where that money went and he knows that he is going to eventually benefit by that money,” Pettingill, Jr. said.\n\nAfter one of the jurors asked about the difference between Jones’ money and his company’s money, Pettingill, Jr. said “you cannot separate Alex Jones from the companies. He is the companies.”\n\nJones “monetized his shtick,” he added, even suggesting that Jones could teach a college course about his techniques.\n\nJones’ fear-mongering rants on Infowars have, for many years, been paired with ads for supplements, documentaries, and other products Infowars sells. Pettingill, Jr. said the money poured in, identifying nine different companies that are owned by Jones.\n\n“He is a very successful man, he promulgated some hate speech and some misinformation, but he made a lot of money and he monetized that,” Pettingill, Jr. said on the stand. “My thinking about him is he didn’t ride a wave, he created the wave.”\n\nJones testified earlier in the week about his alleged financial troubles after social media giants like Facebook and Twitter banned his content from their platforms.\n\n“I remember him saying that, but the records don’t reflect that,” Pettingill, Jr said.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Ball asserted that Jones has even more money hidden away in other places and argued that $4.1 million was a drop in Jones’ proverbial bucket. “He’s probably already made it back in donations” from fans, Ball said.", "authors": ["Brian Stelter"], "publish_date": "2022/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/06/alex-jones-trial-whats-next/10255782002/", "title": "What's next for Alex Jones?

Jobs report and abortion fight give Dems new life\n\nAbortion:Sweeping Indiana ban enacted, the first such law since Roe overturned\n\nWhat's next for Alex Jones?\n\nJones' attorneys could appeal the damages by arguing that evidence not meant for the case – two years’ worth of cellphone data – was presented to the jury. That argument probably wouldn't convince a judge, John Browning, a trial lawyer and former Texas appellate justice, told Bloomberg Law.\n\n“The fact that (Federico Andino Reynal, the lead attorney for Jones) filed this emergency motion after the testimony, it reeked of desperation,” Browning said.\n\nThis year, the Austin-based Jones and his companies, including Infowars and Free Speech Systems, face two other lawsuits – one filed in Texas by the family of Noah Pozner, 6, who was killed at Sandy Hook, and another in Connecticut filed by eight families of victims. The trial in Connecticut is scheduled to begin next month.\n\nThe cellphone data could catch up to Jones in multiple ways. Mark Bankston, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, said the evidence suggests Jones may have committed perjury during the trial's discovery period by being untruthful about his text messages.\n\nDave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida, agreed that prosecutors could file perjury charges against Jones. \"His legal problems are not over,\" he told CNN.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nBankston said the House committee investigating the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, which deposed Jones in January 2022, requested the phone records, but he wasn't sure the data covered the time period leading up to and after the incident. In a subpoena letter, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman, charged that Jones helped organize a rally that preceded the riot and repeatedly promoted President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud.\n\nWhat is Alex Jones' net worth? Is he bankrupt?\n\nJones attempted to depict himself and his operation as hurting financially. In late July, Jones' main company, Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Infowars, filed for bankruptcy months after three of Jones' other companies, including InfoW, which was formerly known as InfoWars, also filed for bankruptcy. During this week's trial, Jones testified that any penalty over $2 million would \"sink us.\"\n\nBernard Pettingill, an economist hired by the plaintiffs, testified that Jones and Free Speech Systems are worth up to $270 million and that records showed Jones withdrew $62 million for himself in 2021. \"He's got money put in a bank account somewhere,\" Pettingill said.\n\nOpinion:Alex Jones finally faces consequences. Hateful lies have to come with a cost.\n\nWhat do Sandy Hook families say about the award?\n\nAfter the jury announced its decision, Scarlett Lewis said the jury held Jones accountable – and so did she.\n\nLewis recalled that when she took the stand and looked Jones in the eye, she thought of her son, who saved lives by yelling “run” when the killer paused in his rampage within Sandy Hook Elementary School. “I hope that I did that incredible courage justice when I was able to confront Alex Jones, who is also a bully,\" she said. \"I hope that inspires other people to do the same.”\n\nHow much will Alex Jones pay? Are damages capped?\n\nReynal, Jones’ lead attorney, told the judge he will appeal and ask for a reduction in the damages. After the hearing, he said he thinks the punitive amount could be reduced to $1.5 million, based on a Texas law capping punitive damages at $750,000 per plaintiff.\n\nBankston said he believes he can challenge any attempt to reduce the damages. “We do not believe punitive damage caps are constitutional as applied to our case and will certainly litigate that issue if necessary,” Bankston told Bloomberg Law.\n\nDespite the cap, Bankston said damages will total at least $4.5 million, accounting for emotional distress and reputational damage, along with punitive damages. He plans to argue against lowering damages in bankruptcy court and predicted that the other defamation trials would lead to additional damages.\n\n\"What this is heading towards is there is going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars in the bankruptcy state,\" he said outside the courtroom Friday in a video posted on Twitter by Avery Travis, a reporter with KXAN News, an NBC station in Austin.\n\n\"Over the course of that process, that can get very, very dangerous for Mr. Jones because there's going to be a new level of financial scrutiny,\" Bankston said.\n\nWhat happened during the Alex Jones defamation trial?\n\ncut him off when he held forth on conspiracies, ranging from the Sept. 11 terror attacks being staged to a fake effort of the United Nations on world depopulation.\n\n“This,” the judge told him, “is not your show.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/07/26/two-sandy-hook-parents-seek-150-million-dollars-from-austin-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones/65381852007/", "title": "Alex Jones has choice words for Sandy Hook defamation case ...", "text": "The parents of 6-year-old Jesse Lewis are seeking two awards of $75 million — $1 for every American duped by Austin-based conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' portrayal of the death of their son and 25 others at Sandy Hook Elementary School as a hoax, their lawyer announced Tuesday.\n\nNeil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis sat about 15 feet from Jones in a Travis County courtroom as a jury trial got underway Tuesday to determine how much money Jones will have to pay them for defamation and intentionally inflicting emotional distress.\n\nThe parents' lawyer, Mark Bankston, used his opening statement to the jury to accuse Jones of weaving a pattern of lies that inspired his followers to contact Jesse's parents at home, accost them in public, harass them online and by phone, and threaten their lives.\n\n\"For 10 years, Mr. Jones has robbed Neil and Scarlett of the time they needed to heal for the violent death of their son Jesse,\" Bankston said.\n\nJones' campaign made Jesse's death ugly, Bankston said. Now, every time his parents think about their son, they also have to \"think about this horrible man, this disgusting series of horrible lies that will be forever tied to their son's death.\"\n\nThe trial, expected to continue into the first week of August, will determine how much money Jones will have to pay Jesse's parents for portraying them as liars and actors who conspired with government efforts to use the \"faked\" attack to justify confiscating firearms.\n\nJones, who has argued that the lawsuits are part of a wider attempt by leftists and other opponents to silence his free-speech rights, arrived at the courthouse with silver tape over his mouth bearing the phrase \"Save the 1st.\"\n\nThe tape was off when he entered the courtroom Tuesday morning, and during the trial's first break Jones spoke to reporters and cameras in a hallway outside the courtroom, loudly denouncing the proceedings.\n\n\"You're having all of your rights robbed. This is a kangaroo court. This is a show trial. This is a constitution-destroying, absolute, total and complete travesty,' Jones said.\n\nState District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble called lawyers from both sides back into court and, without jurors present, banned any discussion of the case outside of court that could be overheard by jurors.\n\n\"We are not going to have that again,\" she said.\n\nWith jurors back in court, Jones' lawyer, Andino Reynal, admitted that Jones was wrong with his statements about Sandy Hook, but Reynal said the InfoWars host was duped by others who told a convincing tale about the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn., being a hoax.\n\n\"There was a time that Alex was taken in,\" Reynal said. \"We are not hiding that.\"\n\nReynal added, however, that Jones had the right to raise the questions he did, adding that Jones has already been punished for those statements after being canceled from posting on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nReynal directed his ire at Bankston, deriding him as a \"personal injury lawyer\" engaged in a cynical attempt to enrich himself \"while silencing a political opponent and limiting every American's right to watch and choose what to listen to.\"\n\nLawyers learn one important rule, he told jurors: \"Don't lie to the jury if you hope to get the verdict that you requested. What we heard (in Bankston's opening) was a conspiracy of lies.\"\n\nBut Bankston told jurors that he will be asking for $150 million — $75 million for damaging the parents' reputation and another $75 million for emotional distress. That's even before jurors begin the second phase of the trial, when they will hear testimony about Jones' net worth before assessing punitive damages.\n\nBankston said the $75 million figure represents $1 for every American who was duped by Jones' lies, according to a poll that found 24% of Americans believe the Sandy Hook shooting was staged or might have been. Jones used his highly popular shows to explode the Sandy Hook myth, expanding its reach beyond the cranks and extremists populating dark corners of the internet, Bankston said.\n\nOpening statements Tuesday morning raised the curtain on the first of three trials — two in Austin, one in Connecticut — that will determine how much Jones will have to pay for defamation and emotional distress caused when Jones and others in his Austin-based InfoWars media system repeatedly portrayed the mass shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 students and six educators, as a hoax meant to justify a government crackdown on gun rights.\n\nLast year, Jones was found — without a trial — to have defamed both sets of parents after state District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble issued a rarely granted default judgment against Jones, saying his pattern of bad faith in withholding essential information from pretrial discovery improperly imperiled the families' cases. That means jurors in both Austin cases will be asked to determine the size of damage awards to be assessed against Jones and his main company, Free Speech Systems.\n\nThe second trial in Austin with the parents of another 6-year-old first-grader, and another trial in Connecticut with families of eight Sandy Hook victims, are currently set for September.\n\nAfter opening statements Tuesday, the first witness called by lawyers for Jesse's parents was Daniel Jewiss, a retired Connecticut police detective and the lead investigator of the Sandy Hook school shooting who refuted some of Jones' hoax claims and testified that his work with families continues to this day.\n\nAsked why he traveled to Austin to testify, Jewiss said: \"It is still our job to support those families in every way possible, and it's absolutely horrific the amount of trauma that they have had to endure in the wake of having lost a loved one.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/10/01/judge-default-judgment-issued-against-alex-jones-sandy-hook-suits/5946684001/", "title": "Judge: Default judgment issued against Alex Jones in Sandy Hook ...", "text": "An Austin judge has issued default judgments against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, citing his pattern of bad faith in dealing with lawsuits by parents of two children killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nThe rulings mean the lawsuits will proceed to a trial to determine how much money Jones and his Austin-based InfoWars media system must pay the parents for defamation and emotional distress caused by broadcasts that called the school shooting a hoax.\n\nIt's no longer a matter of whether Jones writes a check to the parents, said Bill Ogden, a lawyer for the parents. \"It's now how big a check is it going to be.\"\n\nDistrict Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said the rarely granted motion for a default judgment was appropriate because prior sanctions, including $150,000 in court-ordered penalties, failed to change Jones' behavior.\n\n\"In considering whether lesser remedies would be effective, this Court has also considered Defendants' general bad faith approach to litigation, Mr. Jones' public threats, and Mr. Jones' professed belief that these proceedings are 'show trials,'\" Guerra Gamble wrote in three similar orders.\n\nOgden said he was thrilled at the result.\n\n\"It's been a long time coming for these parents, and we're happy the way it worked out,\" said Ogden, with the Farrar and Ball law firm in Houston.\n\n\"In Texas, we call (default judgments) death penalty sanctions.

It is not overstatement to say the First Amendment was crucified today,\" Jones and InfoWars lawyer Norm Pattis wrote. \"We are distressed by what we regard as a blatant abuse of discretion by the trial court. We are determined to see that these cases are heard on the merits.\"\n\nIn a video accompanying the statement, Jones said the Sandy Hook lawsuits were part of a campaign by \"the left in this country to weaponize the legal system.\"\n\n\"Every basic form of American liberty is being abolished and overthrown as we speak. They're coming after me because I'm standing in their way,\" he said.\n\nLawyers for the parents had asked the judge to sanction Jones for violating rules on pretrial discovery, as well as previous court orders, by withholding vital information that was first requested in 2018.\n\n\"We still don't have the most basic information about this case,\" lawyer Mark Bankston told the judge during an Aug. 31 hearing, arguing that Jones failed to provide a wide range of requested evidence, including video of his on-air discussions about Sandy Hook, transcripts and the content from social media.\n\n\"Now we're talking about having to find people three years out ... to see who was involved in this case, who might still have documents,\" Bankston said. \"The quality of the evidence and of people's memories all degrades.\"\n\nJones also declined to directly answer many of the questions asked during a sworn deposition, he said.\n\nMore:Texas Supreme Court: Alex Jones, InfoWars can be sued by Sandy Hook parents\n\nBecause the pattern of abuse was so pervasive, Bankston said the parents should be able to skip next year's trials on whether Jones defamed them and proceed directly to determining how much money they're owed in damages.\n\nIn her order, signed Monday but released Thursday, Guerra Gamble agreed, saying lighter sanctions — such as additional monetary penalties or an order banning Jones from introducing certain evidence — would raise legal costs for the Sandy Hook parents while doing little to correct \"persistent discovery abuses\" by Jones.\n\n“After five years of Mr. Jones’ monstrous harassment against these families, and after three years of making a mockery of their lawsuits, Mr. Jones is finally going to suffer the consequences for the decisions he made,\" Bankston said.\n\nThe shooting at Sandy Hook left 26 children and six adults dead in Newtown, Conn.\n\nFour lawsuits — filed in Travis County, where Jones and his InfoWars media system are based — seek monetary awards for defamation and the intentional infliction of emotional distress:\n\n• Scarlett Lewis, mother of Jesse Lewis, complained that Jones called the school shooting \"as phony as a three-dollar bill\" and that other statements on InfoWars implied that parents were not genuinely grieving the loss of their children.\n\n• Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, parents of 6-year-old Noah Pozner, quoted broadcasts in which Jones cast the school shooting as a \"false flag\" hoax to create a pretext for government action limiting gun rights.\n\n• Neil Heslin, father of 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, filed two lawsuits taking exception to statements by Jones alleging that the school shooting was \"a giant hoax\" and disputing Heslin’s claim that he had held his dead son in his arms afterward.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/01"}]}

A Week 17 loss to the Tennessee Titans put an end to the team's playoff hopes, but the Dolphins capped the season with a convincing 33-24 victory over the New England Patriots to finish with a winning record.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't enough to save Flores' job.\n\nIn his first stint as an NFL head coach, Flores compiled a record of 24-25.\n\nMatt Nagy, Chicago Bears\n\nNagy's exit was perhaps the least surprising of them all. Under fire for almost the entire season, the fourth-year coach had to deal with questions and speculation about his job security on an almost-weekly basis.\n\nWith the Bears struggling to a 6-11 record, both Nagy and general manager Ryan Pace were fired on Monday.\n\n\"That’s real. That’s life. We know our record’s not good enough. You can’t run from it,\" Nagy said after Sunday's season-ending loss to the Vikings.\n\nNagy was voted NFL Coach of the Year in 2018 when he led the Bears to a 12-4 record and an NFC North title. However, things went steadily downhill -- despite a playoff berth last season -- and he finished his four-year tenure with a mark of 34-31.\n\nVic Fangio, Denver Broncos\n\nFangio never had a winning season in his three years in Denver, finishing 19-30 overall. A four-game losing streak to finish the 2021 campaign 7-10 likely sealed his fate. Despite constant issues at quarterback, the Broncos fought hard until the end, falling to the AFC West champion Kansas City Chiefs 28-24 on Saturday.\n\nThe team made Fangio's firing official a day later.\n\nSince winning Super Bowl 50, the Broncos have not been to the playoffs in six years — the second-longest active streak behind the New York Jets.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/sport/nfl-week-5-recap-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "NFL Week 5 recap: Changes to concussion protocol, first coach ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWe’ve had changes to the concussion protocol, the first coach firing and officiating controversies.\n\nAnother week in the NFL, and no end of talking points.\n\nWith Week 5 in the books following the Kansas City Chiefs’ 17-point comeback victory against the Las Vegas Raiders, let’s look at the biggest talking points from the past seven days.\n\nA change coming?\n\nThe biggest story coming from Week 5 comes after two controversial roughing-the-passer penalties were called in two days.\n\nThe roughing-the-passer penalty is a rule which was implemented in an attempt to protect quarterbacks from hits that are deemed “unwarranted by the circumstances of the play” by the referees – in other words, hits that are way over the line.\n\nThe rule has been updated over recent years to increase the protection offered to quarterbacks. However, recent events have increased scrutiny on the penalty and when it is being called.\n\nFirst, Grady Jarrett was deemed to have roughed Tom Brady on Sunday on a key third down as the Atlanta Falcons attempted to mount a comeback despite it looking like Jarrett had just tackled Brady. The resultant penalty helped the Tampa Bay Buccaneers hold onto the ball and end the game with a win.\n\nAnd on Monday, the Chiefs’ Chris Jones was called for the same penalty after landing on Raiders QB Derek Carr, despite stripping the ball and also appearing to brace his fall.\n\nThe two penalty decisions have been lambasted by players, commentators and fans since and have increased calls for a review system to be put into place for these situations.\n\nIt’s unclear about whether systemic changes will happen as a result of these two incidents, but such controversial penalty calls have led to rules being tweaked or changed in the past – just look at the pass interference review change which came about after the ending to the 2019 NFC Championship game between the New Orleans Saints and the Los Angeles Rams (although that didn’t last very long).\n\nCarr is sacked by Jones. The play ended in a controversial roughing the passer penalty though. David Eulitt/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nWithdrawn\n\nIn light of recent events involving Miami Dolphins starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, the NFL and NFL Players Association (NFLPA) announced on Sunday they were implementing new concussion protocols to further protect players.\n\nAnd it just so happened that the first player to be ruled out from a game under these new rules was Tagovailoa’s replacement, Teddy Bridgewater.\n\nThe 29-year-old suffered a blow to the head during his first snap of the game. Although Bridgewater passed his evaluation and had no symptoms, a spotter saw him stumble, according to Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel.\n\nStumbling is a considered a sign of ataxia as it demonstrates impaired motor function. The league defines ataxia as “abnormality of balance/stability, motor coordination or dysfunctional speech caused by a neurological issue.”\n\nUnder the new regulations, a player showing signs of ataxia while being evaluated for a concussion would be prohibited from returning to the game.\n\nThere were other players ruled out of games during Week 5 because of the new protocols – Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Pat Freiermuth and New Orleans Saints wide receiver Chris Olave – as the league and players association attempt to protect players better.\n\nBridgewater is tackled by Sauce Gardner of the New York Jets. Edward Diller/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nStuck in the mud\n\nWhen you tune into an NFL game, you want to see high-flying feats of athleticism, big plays and lots of points – see Sunday’s high-flying 38-3 demolition that the Buffalo Bills laid on the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nHowever, this season, offenses in general are finding it more difficult to score lots of points like in recent years.\n\nOutside of the juggernaut teams – the Bills and the Chiefs, for example – converting long drives into touchdowns has become more difficult and that big play ability seems to have dried up for some.\n\nIn the last week, we’ve seen a tedious 12-9 Indianapolis Colts win over the Denver Broncos (which saw the Denver faithful leaving the stadium in a mass exodus before overtime), we’ve seen the reigning champion Los Angeles Rams score 10 points at home and we’ve seen Detroit Lions get shut out 29-0 by the New England Patriots.\n\nNow, this could all be a blip. It could just be that players are still getting warmed up having not played in preseason. It could also be that defenses have wised up to the plays and schemes which have previously worked.\n\nBut it seems a surprising trend given how the league seemed to be going, with more offensively-minded coaches being hired and schemes being revolutionized to max out these high-powered attacks.\n\nMicah Parsons of the Dallas Cowboys sacks Rams QB Matthew Stafford causing a fumble.

Haffey/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nFirst one to go\n\nOn Monday, Matt Rhule became the first NFL coach of the 2022 season to be fired after he was let go by the Carolina Panthers.\n\nRhule has enjoyed a miserable time in Carolina, with a 11-27 record in two-plus years. His firing came a day after a 22-point home loss to the San Francisco 49ers which left the team with a 1-4 record this season.\n\nRhule joined the Panthers on a seven-year, $62 million contract in 2020 having previously coached college football with Baylor and Temple. According to NFL.com, he’s the first ever Panthers coach to serve fewer than three full seasons.\n\nBut he’s struggled to find a quarterback since joining. He’s tried out Sam Darnold, Teddy Bridgewater, Cam Newton and PJ Walker before trading for Baker Mayfield this offseason. None of these options have provided a long-term solution at the sport’s most important position, as Mayfield endures a tough start to the year.\n\nRhule looks on during the second half of the Panthers' game against the Arizona Cardinals.

(AP) — The Tennessee Titans believe the potential reward from quarterback Marcus Mariota working with his third head coach in his fourth NFL season outweighs the risk of change.\n\nOr sticking with the same coach.\n\nSo now the Titans are looking for a new coach to replace Mike Mularkey and build off the franchise's first playoff win in 14 years to make them a true NFL contender.\n\n\"There's nothing more that I want for our fans than to bring a championship here,\" general manager Jon Robinson said Monday afternoon . \"I feel like it's my charge to put the team in the best position to do that.\"\n\nThe Titans fired Mike Mularkey on Monday, less than 48 hours after a 35-14 loss to New England in the AFC divisional round. Mularkey revived a team with the NFL's worst record over two seasons and led them to their first playoff victory in 14 years only to become the first coach let go after winning a playoff game since San Francisco fired Steve Mariucci after the 2002 season.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\nTitans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk turned to Mularkey in November 2015 when she fired Ken Whisenhunt after 23 games . Mularkey went 2-7 down the stretch as the Titans finished 3-13 to land the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2016. That capped a 5-27 record over 2014 and 2015 that was the NFL's worst.\n\nMularkey led the Titans to back-to-back 9-7 records — their first consecutive winning records since 2007-08. He finished with a 21-22 record after a season in which the Titans cost themselves the AFC South title with a three-game skid in December and needed to beat the Jaguars, now in the AFC championship game, to reach the postseason for the first time since 2008.\n\nHis devotion to an offense he's known since being offensive coordinator in Pittsburgh between 2001 and 2003 may have cost him. He said Sunday he was prepared to move \"full speed\" ahead after talking with Strunk. He defended offensive coordinator Terry Robiskie's play-calling, saying he was happy with Mariota's development.\n\nMularkey also said he didn't anticipate any changes on his coaching staff a week after Strunk issued a statement on his job security . But talk of an extension since a 22-21 comeback win against Kansas City in the wild-card round ended Monday morning when Robinson and president and chief executive officer Steve Underwood told Mularkey he was being let go.\n\nStrunk called it \"unfortunate\" that they couldn't find common ground on how to improve.\n\n\"I also view this as an important moment for our football team as we try to make that next step to sustained success on the field,\" Strunk said in a statement.\n\nNow Robinson will oversee his first coaching search with the Titans the seventh NFL team to change coaches since the start of the season. He was hired two days before Mularkey had the interim title removed in January 2016.\n\n\"This boils down to doing what we think is best for the football team moving forward, taking the next step,\" Robinson said.\n\nRobinson said interviews with candidates could be held as early as this week, though the Titans will confirm a candidate only after an interview is completed. The general manager declined to discuss Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, saying he couldn't comment on coaches under contract.\n\n\"This is a very attractive job for a lot of candidates,\" Robinson said. \"I look forward to working with whoever the next head coach is. I think that they will see that myself and Amy will be unified with them in our vision for the football team.\"\n\nIn Mularkey's first full season, the Titans led the NFL scoring touchdowns inside the red zone, and they led the AFC while ranking third in rushing offense. Mariota also threw 26 touchdowns with only nine interceptions.\n\nThis season, the Titans failed to take advantage of an AFC South in which Andrew Luck did not play for Indianapolis and two-time defending division champ Houston lost rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson to an injury early.\n\nMariota also had his worst season yet with a career-worst 15 interceptions and 13 touchdowns. The run game, the basis of Mularkey's offense, slumped to 15th in the NFL.\n\nRobinson said the key is finding the right coach to get the best out of the Titans' roster, and the general manager isn't worried about Mariota working with yet another head coach.\n\n\"Marcus is a pretty resilient guy,\" Robinson said. \"He's a very mentally tough guy. He takes a lot from the standpoint of ownership in things. I have zero concern in Marcus being able to adapt and learn, and do what's best to get the offense going.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

Jay Gruden was ousted three weeks ago following an 0-5 start in Washington. Others will probably be joining him at some point, most likely Dan Quinn of the Falcons, who continue to sink further into disrepair.\n\nWhile the watch is on to see what happens with Doug Marrone in Jacksonville, Jason Garrett in Dallas and perhaps even Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh, it’s worth asking at midseason if any of the league’s first-year coaches are in danger of becoming the next Steve Wilks – a victim of the dreaded “one and done” club.\n\nIn the last decade, 10 coaches have been fired during or after their first season on the job, including Wilks, who was let go by the Cardinals after a 3-13 finish last season, his only year in Arizona.\n\nOf the eight coaches in their first season with their respective teams, only Matt LaFleur of the Packers (7-1) has a winning record. The Cardinals’ Kliff Kingsbury has the next-best record at 3-4-1. The other six teams that changed coaches in the offseason are a combined 7-37, which spells potential trouble.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\nTwo in the group have yet to win a game – Zac Taylor of the Bengals (0-8) and Brian Flores of the Dolphins (0-7). Neither is likely to lose his job after just one season, however. The Bengals went through multiple non-winning seasons under Marvin Lewis and ownership obviously has more patience than most. The Dolphins are undergoing a complete rebuild and will be relying on Flores to help guide them out of the murky depths.\n\nThe only way Bruce Arians doesn’t return to the Buccaneers next season is if he decides to retire again or medical issues make him walk away from the game. Yeah, the reclamation project with Jameis Winston isn’t working out too hot, but that won’t get Arians canned. He can still get Winston right and his general manger will give him ample time to do it.\n\nIt’s more complicated with teams like the Broncos with Vic Fangio, the Jets with Adam Gase and the Browns with Freddie Kitchens, who finished last season as Cleveland’s interim offensive coordinator. Kitchens still falls into the “first-year” coaching fraternity and based upon what I’m seeing and hearing, there’s a good chance he won’t make it beyond this season.\n\nThere’s already too much drama surrounding the Browns and if their three-game losing streak turns into five, six or seven, look out. Things could get ugly in and around that team. Kitchens won the job because of his impressive work with Baker Mayfield in the second half of the 2018 season, but that connection seems to have fizzled.\n\nIf things don’t turn around in the second half this year, don’t be surprised if the Browns revert to what they’ve done over the past 20 years and start overhauling everywhere again, starting with a new head coach.\n\nThings I liked in Week 8\n\n*That ESPN has decided to permanently scrub its Monday Night Football halftime musical act segment. More news and analysis are always better than overproduced fluff.\n\n*Aaron Rodgers’ crazy touchdown pass to Jamaal Williams during the Packers’ Sunday night win over the Chiefs. On third-and-3, Rodgers dropped back and got flushed out of the pocket. He rolled to his right with pressure closing in all over him and while falling backwards, blindly sailed the ball into the corner of the end zone, where Williams managed to take the ball away from linebacker Ben Niemann and get both feet in bounds.\n\nBefore the official could even signal a touchdown, Rodgers was already lying flat on his back.\n\n“I truly thought he was throwing it away,” Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu said.\n\n*Even better, was the double reverse flea-flicker in London during the Rams’ victory over the Bengals at Wembley Stadium. If you haven’t seen it yet, go watch the highlight. Robert Woods ended up tossing the ball back to Jared Goff, who then fired a pass deep down the right sideline to Cooper Kupp for a 65-yard touchdown.\n\nOK, so it probably wouldn’t have worked if Bengals cornerback B.W. Webb hadn’t slipped and fell on the play. Still, it was a thing of beauty.\n\nThings I didn’t\n\n*Cleveland’s three turnovers on three consecutive offensive plays during the Browns’ loss to the Patriots. It’s the first time that’s happened to an NFL team since 2012 (Miami) and it marked just the seventh time it’s occurred since 2000.\n\n*That as good as quarterback Kyler Murray has looked at times for the Cardinals, you can’t help but wonder how well defensive end Nick Bosa would have fit in Arizona. The 49ers rookie has been absolutely dominant in San Francisco’s rotation and during a 51-13 rout over Carolina, he became the first rookie since at least 1982 to record three sacks and one interception in a game.\n\n“I loved him as a player,” Kingsbury said of Bosa the other day. “I’d love to go to the club with him. He’s one of those guys. He’s going to have fun wherever he’s at and he’s an absolute beast on the field. … One of my favorite players in the draft.”\n\n*That the Texans’ chance at making a postseason run likely ended the moment J.J. Watt suffered a torn pec against the Raiders. Watt, the three-time Defensive Player of the Year, was holding Houston’s defense together and now he’s out for the rest of the year.\n\nPhone a friend\n\nEach week in this space, we’ll try to reach out to someone who can offer their own opinion on what’s happening around the league. Today it’s Dave Pasch, the ESPN broadcaster who calls games for the NBA, college football and basketball, and is the radio play-by-play voice of the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nLike a lot of people, Pasch didn’t like the Cardinals’ decision to go for it on fourth-and-1 from their own 30-yard line during Sunday’s 31-9 loss at the Saints. Arizona was only trailing 10-6 at the time and it was still anybody’s game midway through the third quarter.\n\nWhen Chase Edmonds got stuffed for no gain up the middle, Pasch told it straight and voiced his displeasure. It was the wrong call at the wrong time, Pasch said over the air, which made us curious to wonder how the Cardinals feel about an “employee” being critical of the team during a broadcast. Do the Cardinals support Pasch speaking his mind, or would they rather see him suppress his opinions?\n\n“I’ve always said I work obviously for ESPN and then I work for the Cardinals,” Pasch said. “When I work for ESPN, my job is to be completely unbiased. I’m doing 70-75 games a year for college football, NBA, college basketball and my job is to document the game, the story lines and keep the emotions out of it. When I do the Cardinals, and it’s been 18 years now doing the Cardinals, I’m an employee but I’m also a fan and my job is to be the conduit between the team and the fan.\n\n“The best way to do that is to be fair and also to remember that you can’t fool the fans. That was my reaction at the time. I believe they should have punted the ball. Yeah, was I little too emotional? Perhaps. I can probably get too emotional. But it’s my team, I want them to do well. They should have punted the ball. Did it lose the game? No. But the timing and the context of it, it had an impact.\"\n\nFans probably are wondering if Pasch ever hears it from the Cardinals when he says something about them they don’t like. Does he ever get called out for calling them out?\n\n“In 18 years, I can think of one, maybe two times when someone said something, but it’s never come from (team President) Michael (Bidwill) or (Executive Vice President) Ron (Minegar), a coach, a GM. Not once in 18 years,” Pasch said. “The bottom line is, I think they trust me to be fair, honest and professional. I know other announcers for other teams in other sports where they’ve got to be careful. Look, I want to be careful because I want to be a pro. I don’t want to be a loose cannon.\n\n“But I’m reaching the fan because I’m an extension of the organization and I think they understand that.”\n\nHave an opinion on the Arizona Cardinals?

(AP) — As an African American growing up in Queens, New York, Al Holcomb spent his fall Sundays watching Tom Landry and the Dallas Cowboys on television, and dreaming of one day becoming an NFL head coach.\n\nThe 51-year-old Holcomb has spent more than a quarter-century chasing that dream — one that eludes him to this day.\n\nHe has plenty of experience, working 26 years as an assistant coach, including the last 12 at the NFL level. He’s been to two Super Bowls, winning one with the New York Giants, and has coached the likes of Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis, Patrick Peterson and Chandler Jones. Yet Holcomb is still seeking his first interview for one of the NFL’s coveted 32 head coaching jobs, which currently are held by only five minorities, three of whom are Black.\n\n“I wake up every day with a mission that I have to be the best that I can be and have to dispel any myths or stereotypes that may be out there. And prove that I’m a smart football coach who can lead men, put together game plans, engage with the media and do all those kinds of things,” Holcomb said, who currently serves as the defensive run game coordinator for the Carolina Panthers.\n\nWeekly through the remainder of the regular season, The Associated Press will look at the NFL’s coaching pipeline from the perspective of the coaches and executives who aim for the top jobs on and off the field, and the league institutions that have hindered them in their pursuit of those influential positions.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\nHolcomb’s immediate goal is to return to being a defensive coordinator, which often serves as a springboard to becoming a head coach.\n\nHe was at that precipice once, landing as Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator in 2018. But head coach Steve Wilks, who is also Black, and the entire staff were fired after one season when the Cardinals failed to find an offensive identity and finished 3-13. Holcomb's defense finished fourth in the league against the pass and fifth in the league with 49 sacks, but struggled to stop the run.\n\nDavis, who played linebacker for Holcomb in Carolina, described his former position coach as an excellent motivator who knows his personnel and has a natural talent for dissecting other teams' weaknesses and exploiting them. Davis said he was excited when Holcomb moved on to become a defensive coordinator, but disappointed he was let go after one season.\n\n“I think what happened in Arizona really speaks to how minority coaches are being treated in this league,” Davis said. “They didn't even give Wilks a chance to develop his own roster and to get things situated with him and Al. It was literally like they were on borrowed time.”\n\nGetting fired in Arizona was a huge blow for Holcomb, who has never been able to get back to that job level. And he knows he faces an uphill battle moving forward.\n\nPittsburgh’s Mike Tomlin, Miami’s Brian Flores and Houston’s David Culley are the only Black head coaches in the league. Currently there is a growing tendency for NFL clubs to hire young coaches with backgrounds in offense.\n\nHolcomb said one of the biggest challenges in his climb up the coaching ranks was breaking into the league altogether. He never felt he had the right connections or contacts with people in the NFL because at that time there wasn’t a program in place to help develop minority coaches.\n\nWhile Holcomb said he’s never felt like he’s been passed over for a job opening because of the color of his skin, he believes “there’s a lot of opportunities that are afforded to men who aren’t of color that have had tremendously less experience.”\n\n“Maybe it’s just not being in the right place at the right time,\" Holcomb said. \"Maybe it’s not winning enough. But I definitely think that as a minority coach that you have to show that you can do it, whereas sometimes when a non-minority coach has an opportunity they have to show that they can’t do it.”\n\nHolcomb said the increased awareness from the media in recent years surrounding the lack of minority hires at top NFL level positions is a good thing, but added that “in terms of things truly changing, I don’t see that much of a difference.\"\n\nHe said that for minorities to truly make a real impact at the NFL level more needs to be done to help develop the young coaches just breaking into the league so they will be better prepared and have more experience — thus creating a larger pool of potential candidates.\n\nPanthers head coach Matt Rhule called Holcomb one of the top assistants in the league.\n\nRhule hired Holcomb because he wanted coaches who were “great teachers” and “invested in their players.” In particular, he felt Holcomb would help the team's third-down defense and blitz packages because of his lengthy NFL experience.\n\n“He has been a defensive coordinator and he's one of the guys who should be a head coaching candidate,” Rhule said. “He's excellent with players, excellent schematically, a great teacher, patient and a leader. ... I think Al is a tremendous coach and someone that people should really pay attention to.\"\n\nAs for the current disparity in white NFL coaches compared to minorities, it still perplexes Holcomb.\n\n“Every year there’s a new hot name, a young coach, one not of color, that gets an opportunity to lead a franchise, and you’re sitting there going ‘what did they necessarily do to get to that position?’” Holcomb said.\n\n“At the end of the day people are going to hire who they who they feel comfortable with. ... But I know that there’s a lot of qualified men who are good football coaches and probably deserve an opportunity to at least get an interview and land some of these positions.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/jaguars/2021/12/16/urban-meyer-fired-jaguars-coach-what-we-know/8921567002/", "title": "Urban Meyer fired: What we know about disappointing Jaguars tenure", "text": "The first coach firing of the 2021 NFL season came early Thursday when the Jacksonville Jaguars finally pulled the plug on Urban Meyer after just 13 games with the franchise.

While Urban already enjoys a legacy in the game of football that few will ever match, his passion for the opportunity in front of him here in Jacksonville is powerful and unmistakable.\"\n\nControversies during tenure\n\nA month after his hiring, Meyer hired former Iowa strength and conditioning coach Chris Doyle, who had been accused of bullying and allegedly saying racist remarks while with the Hawkeyes. Doyle quit two days after being hired.\n\nIn May, the Jaguars announced the signing of Tim Tebow ... as a tight end. This despite the fact that the former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback had not played in six seasons and had never played tight end. He was cut after team's first preseason game.\n\nThe Jaguars were fined $200,000 and Meyer received a fine of $100,000 for violation of the league's policy on contact during off-season practices.

Miami's Brian Flores was fired this week after leading his team to a 9-8 record.\n\nA person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press the Texans fired Culley on Thursday. The person spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity because the move hadn’t been announced.\n\nHis firing comes days after Houston closed out a 4-13 season with a 28-25 loss to Tennessee.\n\nCulley said Monday he expected to return, but general manager Nick Caserio was said to still be evaluating the coach at that time. Three days later, Culley was out of a job.\n\nFollow every game: Live NFL Scores\n\nThe 66-year-old Culley was hired last January to replace Bill O’Brien after working as an NFL assistant since 1994. He took over a team that went 4-12 in the 2020 season with Deshaun Watson at quarterback.\n\nWatson requested a trade around the time Culley was hired, and before 22 women filed lawsuits against the QB alleging sexual harassment or assault. Those issues kept Watson sidelined all season and precipitated a rebuild in Houston that left Culley at the helm of a depleted team.\n\nCulley didn't have much of a chance without Watson and with a roster where most of the few remaining quality starters were traded or released as the season progressed.\n\nCulley discussed the challenges he faced in his first season as a head coach in an interview with The AP last month.\n\n“There’s a manual that they give you, like here’s all the things that will happen to you,” he said. “Listen, there’s been many, many things that ain’t in that manual that I’ve had to go through here that you just learn, you learn on the run.\n\n“But the big thing is, do what you feel like is right for your team,” he continued. “And be honest with everybody. And that’s what I’m trying to do.”\n\nIn that same interview, he discussed the decades-long path that led him to the Texans and touched on his displeasure at the scarcity of minority head coaches in the NFL.\n\n“It's just very disappointing,\" he said. “And very disappointing for this reason, there are so many minority coaches in this profession from all ethnicities that deserve to have that opportunity.\"\n\nThe New York Jets’ Robert Saleh, who is of Lebanese descent, and Washington’s Ron Rivera, who is Latino, are the only minority head coaches remaining besides Tomlin.\n\nThe Texans also fired offensive coordinator Tim Kelly on Thursday, according to the same person who confirmed Culley's dismissal. Kelly had been with the Texans in various roles since 2014 and had been the offensive coordinator since 2019.\n\nThis is the first time the Texans have fired a coach after one season. The team’s first coach, Dom Capers, spent four seasons in Houston before being fired. Gary Kubiak was hired next, and he was let go in his eighth season. The team fired O’Brien after he opened his seventh season 0-4.\n\nCulley was hired after spending 2019-20 as assistant head coach, wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens. Before coming to Houston, Culley had worked as an NFL assistant starting in 1994, also spending time with Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Kansas City and Buffalo. He began his career as a college assistant and spent 1991-93 at Texas A&M.\n\nHouston beat Jacksonville in the opener before losing eight consecutive games after Tyrod Taylor was injured and rookie quarterback Davis Mills struggled to adjust to the NFL.\n\nBut the Texans played better late in the season, with two of their four wins coming in the last month, including a 41-29 victory over a Los Angeles Chargers team still in playoff contention.\n\nThe late improvement wasn’t enough to save Culley’s job. Now, the Texans face a big offseason in which they’ll have to find a new coach, will look to finally trade Watson and will have the third overall draft pick after not having a first-round pick in the last two drafts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/09/11/longest-tenured-coaches-detroit/72067856/", "title": "Lions' Jim Caldwell on verge of being Detroit's longest-tenured coach", "text": "Dave Birkett\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nWhen Jim Caldwell took over as Detroit Lions coach in January 2014, Brad Ausmus had just been hired to manage the Tigers, Mike Babock was entrenched with the Red Wings and Maurice Cheeks was still on the job with the Pistons.\n\nCheeks got fired less than a month later (and interim coach John Loyer wasn't asked to come back), Babcock took a job with the Toronto Maple Leafs this off-season, and amid reports that Ausmus is headed for the unemployment line, Caldwell is on the verge of becoming the longest-tenured coach in Detroit sports.\n\nA coaching lifer who has been fired from jobs at Wake Forest and with the Indianapolis Colts, Caldwell said his status as the most veteran coach in town after just 20 months on the job doesn't surprise him.\n\n\"Not in our business,\" Caldwell said. \"This is a tenuous business, this is a short-term business.

He's won 19 games over the last two years, and this year the Dolphins dug out of a 1-7 start to finish 9-8.

But let's look past that for a moment, and give him a ton of credit for restoring his coaching profile with the Dallas defense this season. He had Kyle Shanahan as his offensive coordinator in Atlanta, so clearly he knows how to pick 'em on that side of the ball. His personality would fit here, and he does have experience, which matters.\n\nEric Bieniemy, Chiefs OC\n\nThe Giants interviewed Bieniemy in the last coaching cycle, and yes, he's still on the market. The Chiefs are the standard in terms of getting the most out of their offense - obviously, the presence of Patrick Mahomes and the influence of Andy Reid matters - but if the Giants hire Ryan Poles as GM, there could be a match here.\n\nBrian Daboll, Bills OC\n\nJudge wanted Daboll as his offensive coordinator when he was hired, but the Bills would not grant permission for an interview. Daboll will be interviewing for head coaching jobs in this cycle, and his work with Josh Allen and the Buffalo offense should get him serious looks. If the Giants hire Schoen as GM, Daboll could be a match.\n\nTodd Bowles, Buccaneers DC\n\nThe former Jets head coach certainly knows this market, and he's been great as the defensive coordinator of the defending Super Bowl champions. Bowles garnered a lot of respect within the Giants' building given how he handled himself across town through his tenure. This would be a surprise hiring and garner plenty of attention, but the timing might be right for the Elizabeth, New Jersey, native to come home.\n\nPatrick Graham, Giants DC\n\nThis one appears to be a long shot, given Graham's close relationship with Judge. He said just last week that he was here because of their relationship. But Graham's work is respected around the league, and he is viewed as a future head coach. At the very least, the Giants should request and interview to see if Graham is interested.\n\nVance Joseph, Cardinals DC\n\nThe Giants are already looking to Arizona for a possible GM with Adrian Wilson and Quentin Harris set to interview, so it's not out of the question to consider Joseph, who has been a head coach previously and is deserving of another chance. He's helped rebuild the Cardinals' defense and will be a factor in this cycle, as the Dolphins have requested an interview.\n\nArt Stapleton is the Giants beat writer for NorthJersey.com.

Garner Food Co. explains where and why the hot sauce is made in North Carolina. After consulting a marketing adviser, the company’s founder, Sam Garner, landed on Texas Pete because of the state’s “reputation for spicy cuisine” and as a nod to his son’s nickname.\n\n\"The current factory, built in 1942 and added onto too many times to count, sits on the original Garner family home site in northwest Winston-Salem.

Vaccinations will begin Tuesday in Covington and Sumter counties. Gov. Kay Ivey announced the locations Thursday, saying in a statement that delivering vaccine to rural Alabama is important to her due to her own upbringing in rural Wilcox County. “I am proud that our guardsmen stand willing to help our great state in any way, especially as we look to put this virus in our rearview mirror,” Ivey said. “I encourage everyone eligible to take advantage of this great resource, and please remain patient as we continue working to get our hands on as many doses as we are able from the federal government. Be sure to help get the word out to your family, friends and neighbors!” The ALNG units will be able to issue “at least 1,000” doses per day, per site, in a Tuesday-through-Friday schedule.

Victoria Hardwick finished the race at 12:22 a.m. Thursday, claiming the race’s Red Lantern Award. The lantern is an Alaska tradition, awarded annually to the competition’s last-place finisher. Race officials say the award honors the final musher’s perseverance in not giving up. Hardwick, of Bethel, Alaska, finished the race 36th, completing the 850-mile race in 10 days, 9 hours, 22 minutes and 6 seconds. It’s her second Red Lantern Award. She got her first in the 2019 race, when she placed 39th. This year’s race started March 7 with 47 mushers. Nine quit the race, and one was withdrawn after testing positive for the coronavirus. Because of the pandemic, mushers didn’t follow the traditional route that travels across Alaska and ends at Nome at the Bering Sea. It was shortened to a loop with mushers starting and ending the race near Willow, about 50 miles north of Anchorage. It was the first time Nome was not the finish line for the world’s most famous sled dog race. Dallas Seavey won his fifth Iditarod championship, crossing the finish line early Monday morning. He’s now tied with Rick Swenson for the most-ever Iditarod wins.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers on Tuesday advanced legislation offering a broad shield from lawsuits related to COVID-19, saying businesses and health care providers deserve protection for doing their best during a challenging time. Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee backed the measure in a party-line vote over strong objections from trial lawyers and consumer advocates, who said the measure would reward bad actors who flouted health guidance. Very few lawsuits have been filed related to COVID-19, critics say. The bill, which has already passed the Senate, would raise the bar for successful pandemic-related lawsuits against businesses, health care providers, nursing homes, nonprofits, governments, churches and schools. Instead of proving negligence by a preponderance of the evidence, plaintiffs would have to prove “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct” by clear and convincing evidence. That’s a “double whammy” requiring plaintiffs to both show more egregious conduct and meet a higher standard of proof, said Barry Aarons, a lobbyist for Arizona trial lawyers. The legislation effectively creates broad immunity for anyone who can claim some link to the pandemic, he said. A nursing home might claim, for example, it was unable to properly respond to a patient’s stroke or heart attack because of COVID-19.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court has said it will hear arguments in a lawsuit by a group of legislators challenging Arkansas’ coronavirus restrictions. Justices granted the request for oral arguments in the case late last week but did not immediately schedule the hearing. A Pulaski County judge last year dismissed the lawsuit, and the legislators appealed to the Supreme Court. The case is moving forward a week after Gov. Asa Hutchinson lifted most of the state’s virus restrictions but left the state’s mask mandate in place through at least the end of March. It also comes after the Senate passed a measure expanding the Legislature’s ability to terminate a disaster declaration during a public health emergency. The lawsuit argues that the restrictions put in place during the pandemic required legislative approval. Arkansas on Wednesday reported 14 more coronavirus deaths as the state saw a drop in its active virus cases. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began now total 5,507. The state’s active virus cases, which don’t include people who have recovered or died, dropped by 67 to 2,808. The state reported 325 new cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 327,781. Its COVID-19 hospitalizations increased by three to 260.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: AMC Theatres says it will have 98% of its U.S. movie theaters open Friday as a bunch of theaters reopen in California. Even more are expected to open by March 26. AMC said more than 40 of its locations in the Golden State are reopening Friday, and the state is expected to open 52 of its 54 locations by Monday. The company is preparing to resume operations at the rest of its California locations once the proper local approvals are in place. AMC’s announcement is welcomed by film fans not only because more of them will get to return to reclining seats and a stadium-style format but also because it means the company has hopefully put the worst behind it. It was only in June that AMC cautioned it may not survive the coronavirus pandemic, as its theaters closed and film studios started releasing more movies directly to viewers on streaming services. More theaters opening will also mean more jobs. AMC spokesman Ryan Noonan said the company is welcoming back employees from before theaters were shut down, as well as bringing in new workers. All will be trained on its cleaning and safety protocols, which include social distancing and automatic seat blocking in each theater, mandatory mask-wearing, hand sanitizing stations, upgraded air filtration, contactless ticketing, and mobile ordering for food and drinks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state Senate panel advanced a bill Wednesday that would grant minimum wage and overtime rights to thousands of farmworkers and allow them to organize and join labor unions. The bill, sponsored by three Democratic lawmakers, would regulate working hours for overtime, rest and eating breaks and would guarantee farmworkers living in cramped quarters space that conforms with distancing guidelines recommended by health authorities to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Several states allow farmworkers collective bargaining to some extent – among the many rights originally denied them on the basis of skin color under U.S. labor laws first adopted in the 1930s. “Generations of workers have been exploited for profit,” said Sen. Jessie Danielson, a bill co-sponsor who was raised on a family farm in northern Colorado. Danielson told the Senate Business, Labor, and Technology Committee that most farmers and ranchers treat their workers well. But she cited a litany of abuse, including relentless work hours in all weather conditions, substandard housing, lack of regular access to medical care, and the fear of retribution, including firing, for workers who complain about their labor and living conditions. “The pandemic brought the struggle of these essential workers to the forefront,” Danielson said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state House of Representatives on Tuesday voted unanimously in favor of legislation that requires Gov. Ned Lamont to provide top legislative leaders with recommendations for spending the approximately $2.6 billion Connecticut expects to receive in state COVID-19 relief funds from the latest congressional package. The legislation creates an unusual process that ultimately gives the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee until May 16 to report its approval or modifications to Lamont’s proposal, if any, to the leaders. “I wanted to make sure that we as a group, we are a team addressing the Coronavirus American Rescue Fund and that all of us are participating in making the decisions and supporting what we need to do with these dollars,” said Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, the House chair of the Appropriations Committee. Rep. Mike France, R-Ledyard, the top House Republican on the committee, said he’s pleased the legislation also requires Lamont’s budget office to provide legislators with an accounting of how Connecticut spent earlier federal pandemic aid. The bill now awaits final legislative approval by the state Senate.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Officials at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Wilmington have announced that all veterans enrolled in Veterans Affairs health care are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. The Delaware State News reports veterans must be enrolled in VA health care. And they should preferably receive care at the Wilmington VAMC or one of its five Community Based Outpatient Clinics in Delaware or southern New Jersey. “By expanding the eligibility criteria, we will be able to vaccinate all of our veterans more quickly and get closer to having staff return to their team assignments so we can offer more routine care to veterans at a pre-pandemic level,” Vince Kane, director of the Wilmington VAMC, said in a statement. The Wilmington VAMC has so far administered more than 22,000 vaccine doses to veterans and medical center staff.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than two dozen clergy members from the capital region rolled up their sleeves inside the Washington National Cathedral and got vaccinated against COVID-19 on Tuesday in a camera-friendly event designed to encourage others to get their own shots. The interfaith “vaccine confidence” event targeted in particular Black, Latino and other communities of color, with the aim of overcoming reluctance among populations disproportionately hit by a pandemic that has killed more than a half-million people in the country. “Over 50% of all cases and almost half of all deaths are in persons of African American, Latino or Hispanic background, American Indian and Pacific Islanders,” said Dr. Eliseo Perez-Stable, director of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. “Now, much has been said about, ‘Well, the risk is greater because there’s more disease, more diabetes, more obesity, more heart disease.’ But the reality is that the infections are more likely because people live in more crowded conditions. They work in jobs that do not allow the privilege of teleworking. They cannot self-isolate at home.” Following a moment of prayer for COVID-19 victims, the socially distanced attendees applauded when the Rev. Patricia Hailes Fears from Fellowship Baptist Church became the first one present to be inoculated.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Claes Bell repeatedly called his doctor, desperate to get a state form signed so he could get a COVID-19 vaccine before traveling to be at his father’s bedside after heart surgery. But the 39-year-old, who suffers from hypertension, said he couldn’t get through and eventually called a private, 24-hour emergency doctors network where he paid $45 for a virtual consult. “I’m privileged. I have the money to pay for that,” said Bell, a father of three. “It just sets up a scenario where your outcomes are going to be different depending on your income and employment.” Gov. Ron DeSantis recently opened up vaccine eligibility for younger people with health conditions to get the jab at pharmacies and community centers, but they’re required to have their doctor’s OK. The form requires little more than a signature and is aimed at preventing healthy younger people from jumping the line. But critics say it’s an onerous added barrier for minorities and low-income residents without health insurance or access to a doctor. The inequitable distribution of has been an ongoing challenge for the governor. Of the 3.2 million people who have received one or two doses, less than 6% have been Black – about a third of the corresponding share of the state’s population. Even those like Bell with insurance say they can’t reach their doctors because their offices have been flooded with requests.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Pulling the plug on the South’s largest St. Patrick’s Day parade didn’t stop the party in Savannah, where gaudy green-clad tourists kept bars, restaurants and hotels busy for days and had police handing out thousands of masks amid fears the revelry could brew a coronavirus outbreak. Tourism officials and business owners said the Irish holiday Wednesday and the weekend preceding it were the busiest they’ve seen since the pandemic began a year ago. They credited visitors weary of the virus and given hope by rising vaccinations. “The ’rona might not be done with us, but there are a lot of people who are done with the ’rona,” said Jessica Walden, co-owner of the bar Bay Street Blues near Savannah’s riverfront. St. Patrick’s Day is typically the most lucrative time of year in Savannah, whose parade dates to 1824. It has since ballooned into one of the South’s biggest street parties after Mardi Gras. The celebration Wednesday was notably more subdued. Still, a steady stream of people strolled downtown sidewalks and the riverfront promenade of bars and souvenir shops. Tables outside restaurants were mostly full, and a daiquiri bar had more than a dozen people lined up waiting to enter. Only about half the people celebrating outside wore masks, despite a large green banner hanging from City Hall urging revelers to “MASK UP.”\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: As the coronavirus ravaged other parts of the U.S., residents of this rural Pacific island watched safely from afar. Kauai, one of the world’s most sought-after vacation destinations, has been nearly impossible to visit for most of the past year, with officials bucking pressure to ease quarantine rules as the state’s economy tanked. As a result, Hawaii’s least populated county has been one of the safest places to be. Hair salons were open, kids went to school and played team sports, and residents enjoyed restaurants, bars and beaches without the typical hordes of visitors – or the fears of surging virus numbers. As of Wednesday, Kauai has recorded only 218 confirmed COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, compared with more than 28,000 statewide. Now, local officials are loosening restrictions, saying early measures and the island’s departure from a state testing program that allowed in more people gave it time to build a strong foundation of public health. A unique “resort bubble” program also helped Kauai bring back some tourists and prepare to reopen more broadly. Next month, the island will rejoin the state’s Safe Travels program, which allows travelers to avoid quarantine with a single negative pre-flight coronavirus test.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A fourth lawmaker in the state House of Representatives has tested positive for the coronavirus in less than a week’s time – and just as the Legislature is debating a bill that would ban local governments from requiring that people wear masks. The increasing number of lawmakers out sick with the virus has legislative leaders in the conservative state worried they may not be able to finish business in a timely fashion. “Of course I’m concerned,” Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke said Wednesday, before the announcement of the fourth COVID-19 diagnosis among his colleagues. Bedke wasn’t wearing a face covering but put one on before getting in an elevator in the Statehouse. “We’re reemphasizing the safety protocols. We also want to be done by the end of the month. I guess we’ll just see how it goes,” he said. Republican Rep. Julie Yamamoto said Thursday that she tested positive Wednesday afternoon and immediately left the Statehouse. She had been on the House floor earlier in the day without a mask as lawmakers debated a huge tax-cut bill. All four lawmakers out with the illness are Republicans who rarely or never wear masks. “I actually feel fine,” Yamamoto said. “The coughing is the worst thing. And I was doing that before with just the asthma and allergies.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will expand COVID-19 vaccine eligibility this month to include people with underlying health conditions and more categories of workers, including in food service and construction, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Wednesday. The expansion to so-called Phase 1c is expected March 29. It’s the last category before vaccines are available to the wider public. Illinois has allowed people with some underlying health conditions to receive the shots since last month, but Chicago and its surrounding areas have largely held off because supplies are limited in the densely populated region. The expansion includes workers in finance, higher education and retail. Still, issues persist with snagging limited appointments and eligibility confusion. Criteria have changed several times at a federally backed mass vaccination site at the United Center, which has allowed people with underlying health conditions since it opened this month. Initially, it was supposed to be open to Illinois residents but then was narrowed to Chicagoans. Later, those in city ZIP codes hit hard by the pandemic were given priority, with officials saying suburban Cook County residents would be offered limited access. Also Wednesday, Chicago schools officials announced staff and vendors can sign up for vaccinations at four dedicated sites for educators.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state attorney general’s office vigorously defended Gov. Eric Holcomb’s emergency powers in response to a restaurant’s lawsuit challenging his order that masks must be worn inside restaurants – even though Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita, who took office in January, previously called for curbing the governor’s authority. Yergy’s State Road BBQ in Bluffton filed a suit in December against the Wells County Health Department, Holcomb and the state after it was shut down for violating face-covering requirements and capacity limits amid the pandemic. The lawsuit contends that the county health order closing the restaurant was based on unconstitutional executive orders issued by the governor and that Holcomb didn’t have authority to mandate mask-wearing without backing from the Legislature. The restaurant in the town about 20 miles south of Fort Wayne maintains the order caused “unjust injury to Yergy’s fundamental civil rights, liberty interests and property rights.” The state attorney general’s office, however, argues that based on “broad, clear, and unambiguous language” of Indiana’s emergency powers law, the General Assembly “intended to grant the executive branch the authority to protect Hoosiers through an emergency declaration.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Zero Iowa nursing homes have active COVID-19 outbreaks as of Thursday, a milestone in the pandemic response nearly a year after the disease wound its way into the state. Nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to the disease and have accounted for nearly 40% of the state’s 5,600-plus deaths, despite making up less than 1% of the state’s population. Family visits to the facilities were strictly limited last spring as officials tried to keep the virus from finding a foothold in the facilities. That led to months of isolation for thousands of frail, elderly Iowans. “Without a doubt this has been probably the longest and most difficult journey for long-term care providers in their lifetimes,” Iowa Health Care Association Senior Vice President Lori Ristau said in an interview. “Residents are like a second family to them. So that was very traumatic and a lot to work through. That makes the progress we’re seeing even more meaningful and more joyful because of how long this road has been for them.” Nursing home residents, along with health care providers, were the top priority for immunization after vaccines arrived in the state in December. Gov. Kim Reynolds said during a Wednesday news conference that more than 90% of residents and 60% of staff have been vaccinated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are working to give prosecutors and courts time to clear a backlog of several thousand criminal cases that built up during the coronavirus pandemic, though they disagree about how much is enough time. The Senate approved a bill Wednesday night that would suspend until May 1, 2023, a law aimed at protecting defendants’ constitutional right to a speedy trial. The law requires cases to come to trial within five months of a defendant who has been jailed entering a plea and within six months if the defendant is free on bond. Lawmakers have said there’s a backlog of about 5,000 criminal cases, and prosecutors worry many of them will have to be dismissed if the deadlines are not suspended. “This is a serious public safety issue,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Kellie Warren, R-Leawood. “It’s a solution. It’s not ideal, but it’s that something that we still need.” The House approved its version of the measure three weeks ago, suspending the speedy trial deadlines for three years instead of two, until May 1, 2024. It can either accept the Senate’s version and send that to Gov. Laura Kelly or demand negotiations with senators. But some GOP conservatives and Democrats are nervous about suspending the deadlines, worried defendants will languish unnecessarily in jail.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Republican lawmakers have doubled down on demanding that the Democratic governor obtain their approval before spending the massive federal pandemic relief headed to the state. The lawmakers also started signaling their own priorities for allocating Kentucky’s share of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, passed by congressional Democrats over united Republican opposition. The state government is expected to receive about $2.4 billion. Friction between Gov. Andy Beshear and GOP lawmakers extended to the budget when the Legislature mostly held the line on spending, rejecting extra outlays Beshear wanted for education and other priorities. Now they’re trying to find a path forward on spending the federal relief. One potential place for common ground is broadband – a priority for Beshear and lawmakers alike. The GOP-dominated Legislature pushed through a bill Tuesday designating $250 million of the federal aid to extend broadband service to the hardest-to-reach regions of Kentucky. Meanwhile, Republicans tucked language into another spending bill Tuesday putting more restrictions on Beshear, saying the governor’s budget office would forfeit more than $900,000 into the state’s budget reserve fund if any of the federal funds are spent without the Legislature’s permission.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With states receiving steady supplies of vaccine, Gov. John Bel Edwards on Thursday further expanded eligibility to a long list of healthy essential workers who don’t have one of the two dozen medical conditions that already provided access to the shots. As the Democratic governor announced the widened eligibility, the state also kicked off an outreach campaign aimed at getting vaccines to people in underserved areas and persuading those who are skeptical, as the state continues to see available, unused appointments for its vaccine doses. The new immunization eligibility rules, which take effect Monday, will include workers at grocery stores, bars, restaurants and colleges. That’s expected to be the last expansion of access before Edwards throws open vaccinations to all adults around the state. Already, most of the adult population is expected to meet one of the eligibility criteria on the books. Those added to the list Monday will also include people who work at agricultural sites, post offices, manufacturing facilities, utility companies, construction sites, banks and veterinarian offices. Judges and their staff, public transit workers, river pilots, clergy, communications workers, people in the media and security staff all will be eligible.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Younger Mainers account for a growing number of COVID-19 infections in the state, raising concerns that they could fuel another spike. People in their 20s make up the highest percentage of new cases, about 18%, and those under 20 account for nearly 16%, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Together, those groups account for about a third of new infections, compared with residents over 70, who account for nearly 12% of cases but 85% of deaths. There are signs pointing to another wave of COVID-19 cases, and young people are most likely to facilitate that spike, Dr. James Jarvis, COVID-19 incident commander for Northern Light Health, told the Portland Press Herald. While younger people aren’t as likely to suffer from severe illness, they can still spread the coronavirus to others, including at-risk groups, often while having no symptoms themselves, Jarvis said. “If young people are infected and then go visit (others), that’s just one step away from an outbreak occurring.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Restaurants, retail outlets and gyms are among locations that will see a further loosening of COVID-19 restrictions just days after Mayor Brandon Scott pushed back against Gov. Larry Hogan’s decision to reopen many businesses statewide. Beginning Friday, March 26, Baltimore will allow indoor dining at 50% of capacity and outdoor dining at 75% capacity, news outlets report. Religious facilities, retail, indoor and outdoor recreation, gyms and casinos will also be allowed to operate at 50% of capacity. Until now, indoor dining in Baltimore had been operating at 25% of capacity, as had gyms, retail, shopping malls and recreation. Outdoor dining was permitted at 50% of capacity. Scott’s order is still stricter than the reopening plan allowed under Hogan’s statewide order, announced last week, which allows for lifting capacity restrictions at restaurants and opening up large indoor and outdoor venues to 50% capacity. Scott weighed the city’s legal options for several days ahead of Hogan’s order becoming effective Friday and eventually announced the city would stick to its existing restrictions despite ambiguity about his power to do so under Hogan’s order. However, Scott, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the city will now begin reevaluating COVID-19 restrictions on a two-week basis.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Just in time for baseball season, ballparks, arenas, and indoor and outdoor stadiums will be allowed to open Monday with a strict 12% capacity limit after submitting a plan to the state Department of Public Health. The step is part of the state’s ongoing reopening efforts as Massachusetts continues to ramp up vaccination efforts and as hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 continue to drop, according to the Baker administration. Also Monday, gathering limits for event venues and in public settings will increase to 100 people indoors and 150 people outdoors. Outdoor gatherings at private residences and in private backyards will remain at a maximum of 25 people, with indoor house gatherings remaining at 10 people. Dance floors will be permitted at weddings and other events only, and overnight summer camps will be allowed to operate this summer. Exhibition and convention halls may also begin to operate, following gatherings limits and event protocols. Beginning Monday, Massachusetts will institute a new pandemic travel advisory that will urge everyone entering the state, including returning residents, to quarantine for 10 days after arriving if they’ve been out of state for 24 hours or more. An earlier advisory called for a 14-day quarantine and made it a mandate.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state had the country’s fifth-highest rate of new COVID-19 cases in the last week and is among 14 states where infections rose over the past two weeks, a trend that may be tied to the increasing prevalence of a more contagious coronavirus variant, health officials said Wednesday. The seven-day case average was 2,372, an increase of more than 1,000 from March 1. The average positivity rate, 6.4%, was 3.8% two weeks ago. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive, said Michigan is in a “different place” than earlier in the pandemic because of vaccinations but warned that herd immunity is still quite some distance away. At least 25% of residents 16 and up have received at least one dose. State Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel said to achieve herd immunity and stop the uncontrolled spread of the virus, 90% to 95% of people will probably need to have immunity. Meanwhile, more than 220 Defense Department military and support personnel are expected at Ford Field in Detroit on Friday to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Shots are expected to start Wednesday and run for eight weeks. Lt. Gen. Laura J. Richardson, commander of U.S. Army North, said 6,000 vaccines can be administered each day at the site. “State government can’t tackle this pandemic and the vaccination drive alone,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Thursday during a news conference at Ford Field.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Officials at the Department of Natural Resources say sales of its statewide cross country ski pass have been the best in six years. The DNR says more than 17,900 people bought the Great Minnesota Ski Pass, which is required to access many trails in the state. The agency collected more than $510,000 from sales, which will go toward trail maintenance, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The Legislature in 2019 increased prices from $6 to $10 for the daily pass, from $20 to $25 for the annual pass and from $55 to $70 for the three-year pass. DNR spokeswoman Rachel Hopper said the trail maintenance fund saw decreasing revenue in recent years that forced a delayed payment to clubs in 2019, before the new prices were in effect. This winter’s boost, which she attributed in part to the COVID-19 pandemic steering people toward outdoor activity, has helped refill the fund. “Sales were so good that we were able to move the payments back to the normal timing,” Hopper said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A Millsaps College and Chism Strategies State of the State quarterly survey showed 63% of the more than 600 participants said they will “definitely or probably” get vaccinated against COVID-19. Another 25% noted they either would not get the shot or were unsure about it. That’s a significant leap from January, when the survey found almost 50% of people said they would refuse the vaccine or were uncertain. “We have seen a massive turnaround in just two months in the way Mississippians perceive the coronavirus vaccination program,” Nathan Shrader, Millsaps College Department of Government and Politics chair, said Thursday. He pointed to education about COVID-19 vaccines and encouragement from state officials and public health experts as the drivers that surged vaccination support. As of Thursday, more than 330,000 Mississippians were fully vaccinated, 11% of the state’s population. Among survey results, 55% of participants disagreed with Gov. Tate Reeves’ repeal of all county mask mandates, saying the decision was made too soon. Although Reeves rolled back mask mandates, state health officials continue to urge mask-wearing and social distancing.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A new effort has begun in St. Louis County to help homebound residents and people with disabilities get vaccinations. The county health department is working with 15 fire and emergency management services districts to deliver COVID-19 vaccine to homes and independent living facilities, St. Louis Public Radio reports. “We’ve lined up a lot of partners, and we already have a lot of people who have been asking us for this for quite some time,” said Spring Schmidt, the county’s deputy director of public health. A pilot program began earlier this month with five fire districts. Schmidt said the county is expanding the effort to prioritize people who have no other choice than to have a vaccine delivered to their home. “Some homebound residents can rely on family members or loved ones to drive them to schedule appointments, but not everyone can immediately respond when a vaccine becomes available,” said Dawn Chapman, a member of the county’s disability commission who also is helping schedule vaccine appointments. Meanwhile, the Kansas City region is seeing a slight uptick in the rolling average for new coronavirus cases. The region, which includes Kansas City and its suburbs in both Missouri and Kansas, reported 160 new cases Wednesday.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has a total of 19 confirmed cases of coronavirus variants in 11 counties, the state health department said Wednesday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the state this week of 11 tests that identified variants matching two California strains and another that originated in New York, along with three more cases of the United Kingdom variant already identified in Gallatin County. The California and New York variants involve specimens that were submitted for testing from January to early March in Beaverhead, Cascade, Glacier, Hill, Jefferson, Madison, Phillips, Roosevelt, Silver Bow and Valley counties. When these samples were initially submitted for testing, the California and New York versions had not yet been classified by CDC. Gallatin County has 11 known cases of the U.K. variant, including the three that were confirmed this week. “Montana continues to submit both random and suspect COVID-19 samples to the CDC for testing,” said Adam Meier, director of the Department of Public Health and Human Services. Meier stressed the best thing Montanans can do to protect themselves is get vaccinated and continue to follow CDC guidelines about wearing masks, social distancing, staying home if sick, washing hands often and avoiding large crowds.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A variant of the coronavirus first found in Brazil has been found in the city, state health officials said. On Wednesday, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services confirmed two people in Douglas County had tested positive for the so-called Brazil P.1 variant, the Omaha World-Herald reports. That strain is believed to be responsible for a surge in hospitalizations in Brazil even though many people there had already developed COVID-19 and made antibodies against it. Investigations into the Douglas County cases are underway, state health officials said. As of Thursday, the state’s virus-tracking dashboard showed more than 205,500 people in Nebraska have tested positive for the virus, and 2,130 have died from COVID-19 since the outbreak began last year. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has decreased over the past two weeks, going from nearly 261 new cases per day March 2 to just over 232 new cases per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The city is making all residents 16 and older eligible for COVID-19 vaccines starting April 5 as part of its efforts to inoculate the population as quickly as possible. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak on Wednesday said opening eligibility was made possible through the approval of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and increased production. But whether shots would be available, he said, depended on the supply delivered by the federal government. The timeline could mean appointments in the coming weeks open to hundreds of thousands more people in Nevada, where roughly 61% of the population is older than 18 and younger than 65. The state’s new timeline satisfies the goal that President Joe Biden announced last week, when he said he wanted everyone in the U.S. 18 and older to be eligible for vaccines by May 1. The timeline would not require Nevada to alter its vaccine playbook that prioritized and designated available doses for seniors and front-line workers. Throughout the state, teachers, health care workers, police officers and hospitality industry workers have already been made eligible to receive the vaccine, as have individuals ages 65 and older. Nevada also plans to make residents 16 and up with underlying health conditions eligible for shots Monday through partner pharmacies.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKeene: Keene State College is planning for a fully in-person fall semester. Currently, classes have been a mix of in-person, hybrid or online, with many campus activities curtailed because of the coronavirus pandemic. But officials are planning to resume all in-person classes, athletic events, on-campus student activities and study-abroad opportunities in the fall. Keene State President Melinda Treadwell said officials expect to be in a better place by the end of the summer with the vaccine rollout underway. “Our students have told us loud and clear that they want to be together on campus in our community. We are having a successful spring semester, and are actively planning a shift to additional on-campus and in-person community experiences for the fall 2021 semester,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “Safety guided by science will remain a priority in the fall, and we will continue to carefully monitor the pandemic to make decisions accordingly.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJackson Township: Nothing, not even a global pandemic, can stop the team at Six Flags Great Adventure from entertaining guests year after year. The Jackson thrill park launches its 2021 season this month, with innovations necessitated by caution for COVID-19 still in place. “The pandemic required us to pivot and explore new ways to entertain, which included bringing back something from our past with a new twist,” said park marketing and public relations manager Kristin Fitzgerald. That something was the Six Flags Wild Safari Drive-Thru Adventure, which kicks off its season Saturday. The 4.5-mile trip across a 350-acre preserve housing approximately 1,200 animals resumed operation as a drive-thru experience in 2020 for the first time in nearly a decade. Across the park, COVID-19 safety measures remain in place, including a limit on daily attendance. All guests, including park members and season pass holders, must make advance reservations and are required to have been healthy for at least 14 days prior to visiting. All employees and guests older than 2 are required to wear masks covering their nose and mouth at all times, with the exception of designated mask break zones and in pools and waterpark attractions. Temperatures will be checked on arrival, and social distancing will be encouraged.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nKewa Pueblo: Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, made his first solo trip as the nation’s second gentleman Wednesday, stopping at a vaccination clinic in an Indigenous community in northern New Mexico and later meeting with a group of working mothers as part of an effort to promote the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package. Looking east toward snowcapped mountains, Emhoff told tribal leaders it was an honor for Kewa Pueblo to be his first stop in the state as he and other top Democrats have spent the past few days traveling and talking about the funding that will be trickling down to families, businesses, tribes, cities and state governments over the coming months. He watched as Kylea Garcia got her vaccination and took the opportunity to encourage others to do the same. “Get the vaccine when it’s your turn,” he said, “because it will save your life, and it will save the lives of others. It’s the right thing to do. It’s safe, it’s painless, and it’s going to help us all get through this pandemic.” Kewa Pueblo, formerly known as Santo Domingo Pueblo, has vaccinated more than 4,300 people, including most of its tribal members. At the heart of its efforts to combat COVID-19 has been the pueblo’s health clinic, which has been transitioning from testing and contact tracing to vaccinations. It recently opened a drive-thru for second doses.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio got his COVID-19 shot Thursday, then ripped embattled Gov. Andrew Cuomo, accusing the fellow Democrat of letting his personal political crisis influence important decisions on pandemic restrictions. The mayor’s ire revolved around Cuomo’s decision Wednesday to lift a ban on indoor fitness classes – just a day after de Blasio said it was still unsafe for groups of people to exercise together indoors. “The state of New York continues to make decisions without consulting the city of New York or our health experts or any locality, and this is why we need local control,” said de Blasio, who has long chafed under Cuomo’s broad power to set coronavirus policy. De Blasio implied that Cuomo, who is facing sexual harassment allegations from several women, is easing coronavirus restrictions to curry favor with a virus-weary public. “Is this being done because of what the data and science is telling us, or is this being done for political reasons?” de Blasio asked. “Because it sure as hell looks like a lot of these decisions are being made by the governor because of his political needs.” Reporters were barred from a news briefing Thursday at which Cuomo announced a plan to let fans return to Yankees and Mets games this season.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A sizable group of college students will be eligible for a vaccine in April, under guidance from the state Department of Health and Human Services. When North Carolina drafted its initial COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan in October 2020, college students were listed as a priority, just ahead of the general public. When schools reopened in August, the cohort proved it had the ability to rapidly contribute to community spread and fuel outbreaks through off-campus parties. But in January, North Carolina bumped the group from the priority list amid a backlash from state lawmakers and encouragement from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to give stronger preference to older adults and those working in certain job sectors. On Tuesday, health officials released a statement saying college students who live on campus or in other congregate settings will be able to receive starting April 7, regardless of their age, health condition or employment status. “We want to prioritize those in congregate settings,” state health department secretary Mandy Cohen said at a news conference Wednesday. “We know that’s where the virus spreads fastest, so that is why we’re doing that prioritization. I don’t think there’s going to be a huge time difference.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring has announced that applications are again being accepted for 2021 Specialty Crop Grants due to additional one-time funding from a coronavirus relief package passed by Congress late last year. “Projects that solely enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops in North Dakota are eligible for these grants,” Goehring said. “We encourage organizations, institutions and individuals to submit proposals on their own or in partnerships.” North Dakota has not yet received an allocation amount from USDA’s Agriculture Marketing Service but is expected to receive it in the next few weeks. The North Dakota Department of Agriculture will distribute the funds through a competitive grant program. Goehring said an information manual with application instructions, scoring criteria and an application template can be found on NDDA’s website. Applications must be submitted in electronic form by 4 p.m. CDT April 7. Applications will then be reviewed, scored, ranked and provided to Agriculture Commissioner Goehring to determine which will be forwarded to USDA for final approval in May. Projects funded by the grants start Oct. 1, 2021, and must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: High school juniors and seniors will be able to substitute their end-of-year grades for the statewide final exams as soon as the governor signs a bill passed nearly unanimously by the Ohio House and Senate on Wednesday. The legislation also waives the American history exam requirement, lets schools spend extra time administering all federally required tests and exempts home-schooled kids from yearly evaluations. “Our freshman and sophomore classes, though they were excluded, will still have time to meet the necessary requirements for graduation,” said Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond. The bill’s passage followed weeks of debate about how to modify state testing requirements for students during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Mike DeWine is expected to sign the bill. The original plan had been to let school districts choose whether they wanted to test kids at all. That idea became impossible in February when the Biden administration announced it wouldn’t be handing out waivers to federal testing requirements. So lawmakers quickly moved to determine how to test without harming students who’ve fallen behind during the pandemic. The exam results will be published by the Ohio Department of Education but won’t impact school rankings or eligibility for the EdChoice scholarship program.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Muscogee (Creek) Nation Department of Health and the federal Indian Health Service said Wednesday that they will provide 4,000 vaccinations to all Native Americans and members of their households during a two-day clinic next week. Any member of a federally recognized tribe and members of their households, Native American or not, are eligible for an appointment, said Muscogee (Creek) Health Secretary Shawn Terry. The March 26-27 clinic will be held at River Spirit Expo Center, the Tulsa World reports. About 21,000 of the tribal nation’s estimated 65,000 Oklahoma citizens have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, and the clinic is an effort to reach out to a larger population of Native Americans, according to Terry. “It’s a way for us to do a large event in an urban setting and do it efficiently,” he said. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Wednesday reported a total of 433,516 coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and nearly 1.5 million vaccinations. The federal Centers for Disease Control has reported 7,610 deaths in Oklahoma due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the state health department.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: All adult residents will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine beginning May 1, state health officials confirmed Wednesday. Last week, following President Joe Biden’s pledge to make all adults eligible for vaccines by May 1, Gov. Kate Brown said she would not change the state’s eligibility schedule until she was sure Oregon would receive enough vaccines. Since then officials said they have received an order from the United States Department of Health and Human Services that directs vaccination sites to make the change with eligibility. “We are following up with the administration for more specifics about when vaccine shipments to states will increase, but in a briefing with governors earlier this week, it was clear the White House has worked hard to secure additional vaccine supplies for states in the coming weeks,” Charles Boyle, a spokesman from the governor’s office, said Wednesday. Those who can currently receive the vaccine include health care workers, first responders, teachers and residents over age 65. People who are 45 or older with a preexisting condition, seasonal and migrant farmworkers, food processors, the homeless and those affected by last summer’s wildfires are scheduled to become eligible March 29.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Health officials on Thursday announced changes to the state’s vaccine provider map to make finding appointments more accessible. The provider map will now allow the public to easily see what pharmacies and providers have received first doses of vaccine each week, Executive Deputy Secretary of Health Keara Klinepeter said. “It is also important to remember that doses do not equal appointments,” she said. “Even if a provider has received an allocation of doses, the provider is the best source of information as to whether they have appointments available.” Klinepeter said the state intends to centralize information on which providers have appointments available onto the map in the coming weeks. That will be important as the state moves toward opening vaccination appointments to more Pennsylvanians by May 1. Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said the department is currently working to restructure where vaccine doses are being sent to make sure the most Pennsylvanians possible are receiving shots. Beam said Pennsylvania is ranked second in the nation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for number of doses administered per 100,000 residents statewide. In total, 1.3 million Pennsylvanians are fully vaccinated, and 2.5 million have gotten a first dose.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: All residents ages 16 and older will be eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine starting April 19, Gov. Daniel McKee said Thursday. The change is possible because the state has learned it will be getting significantly more vaccine from the federal government in the near future, the Democratic governor said at a news conference. President Joe Biden promised last week that all the nation’s adults would be eligible by May 1. “If Rhode Island can get the vaccine supply we need, we can achieve and beat this goal,” he said. “We are confident the president will deliver.” He warned that it will likely take two weeks or so for everyone who wants an appointment to book one, but the goal is to provide a first dose of the vaccine to everyone who signs up by the end of May. The state has already given more than 282,000 vaccine first doses, while more than 136,000 people, or about 12% of the state population, have been fully vaccinated, state Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott said. But she said mask-wearing is still important. If 70% of the state population is vaccinated, the state could lift COVID-19 emergency restrictions, McKee said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Clemson University is planning to have a mostly normal fall semester with more students in classrooms and more fans at football games. Thanks to weeks of low coronavirus spread on campus and the increased efforts of the state’s vaccine rollout, Clemson President Jim Clements announced the university would be almost all in-person next fall. “Almost all courses” will be offered completely in-person next semester, Clements said in a memo. This semester, about one-third of classes are completely in-person. Students and faculty will still be able to request virtual accommodations due to the coronavirus, but Clements said the school is banking on the community to be widely vaccinated by the time classes resume Aug. 18. Still, “we will continue to put the health of our staff, faculty, students, and community members first as we plan for the fall,” Clements said. Clemson spokesperson Joe Galbraith said the university will let employees and students continue to work from home only on a “case-by-case” basis. COVID-19 guidelines on capacity, masking and social distancing will remain in place until further notice, though, according to Galbraith.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has repealed an ordinance that required residents to put garbage containers curbside if their garbage hauler requested it. The ordinance, which was passed in April 2020 and repealed Tuesday evening in a 8-0 vote, was aimed at helping local garbage haulers facing workforce problems during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to save time during pickup. Its repeal means the city’s previous rules on garbage will once more be in effect, requiring garbage cans to be stored in an “inconspicuous place” and not put on the curb for pickup. Councilor Alex Jensen said he’d like to hear from Public Works at a future informational meeting about what they’d learned during that period and whether there were any changes that should or shouldn’t be considered.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Restaurant patrons can now sit eight to a table and dine until 1a.m., according to a new Shelby County health directive issued Wednesday. The directive, which goes into effect at midnight Saturday, still requires people seated together at restaurants to be from the same family or close contact group. Customers can stay until 1:30 a.m. to complete their meal or pay. Additionally, the Shelby County Health Department issued a new mask mandate, effective Wednesday, clarifying that people who cannot medically tolerate wearing a face covering do not have to wear a face shield. People declining to wear a face covering because of a medical condition are not required to show medical documentation. The mandate also clarifies that scarves, ski masks and balaclavas are not substitutes for masks, although coverings made of “suitable layered fabrics” are acceptable. Medical- or procedure-grade masks are recommended but not required.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A woman who was recorded on police body camera video refusing to wear a mask at a bank last week was arrested Wednesday after declining to wear a mask inside another Texas business. Terry Wright, 65, already had a warrant out for her arrest after she refused to wear a mask in a Bank of America branch in Galveston last Thursday. On the video, she taunts the officer, asking if he’s going to arrest her. Police arrested Wright on Wednesday after she entered the Office Depot in Texas City and said she would not cover her nose and mouth to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, police spokesman Cpl. Allen Bjerke said. She was arrested on Galveston warrants for trespassing and resisting arrest, Bjerke said. Wright, of Grants Pass, Oregon, was taken into custody without incident, Bjerke said, noting that she was not charged for trespassing at the office supply store and that no additional charges were expected. Gov. Greg Abbott last week lifted statewide orders requiring people to wear face masks in public, declaring businesses should decide for themselves which COVID-19 precautions to take on their properties. Many businesses have kept their own mask rules in place.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: All adults can begin signing up for a COVID-19 vaccine next Wednesday – one week earlier than previously planned because the state has unallocated doses, Gov. Spencer Cox said Thursday. About 15% of the state’s supply isn’t being claimed by eligible people making appointments, the Republican governor said. He acknowledged that opening up eligibility so widely means there won’t be enough vaccines for all residents over 18 at first but the goal is to prevent vaccines from going unused. “We always want to keep demand above availability,” Cox said during a televised news conference on PBS-Utah. Utah teenagers 16 and older may also have a chance to get the Pfizer vaccine in some parts of the state starting next week too, Cox said. New coronavirus cases have been decreasing since January. More than 714,000 of the state’s 3.2 million residents have been fully vaccinated, according to state data. More than 380,000 virus cases have been reported in Utah, along with 2,041 known deaths, according to state data.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A committee of more than two dozen health care providers and advocates is calling for the immediate vaccination of the state’s prison inmates. WCAX-TV reports the memo from the COVID-19 Vaccine Implementation Advisory Committee to Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine, dated Monday, says inmates have little or no ability to protect themselves or demand better conditions. The memo comes as the Department of Corrections continues to cope with an outbreak of COVID-19 at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport, the state’s largest prison. Gov. Phil Scott has said inmates are vaccinated when they fit within the state’s guidelines for age or high-risk medical conditions. All inmates will be eligible for vaccination by the end of April. “There are dozens and dozens of groups, sectors and populations who have requested prioritization. A case can be made for each,” said Scott spokesperson Jason Maulucci. “But with a limited supply, everyone can’t be at the front of the line, so preservation of life must be the top priority.” On Wednesday, the Department of Corrections reported 12 new cases of the coronavirus at the Newport prison, 10 among inmates and two among staff. There are currently 40 cases among inmates and six among staff at the prison.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Schools and colleges can hold outdoor graduation ceremonies with as many as 5,000 attendees. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports Gov. Ralph Northam made the announcement Wednesday. The Democratic governor said Virginia will restrict capacity at outdoor ceremonies to 5,000 people or 30% of the venue’s capacity, whichever is lower. Indoor ceremonies will be capped at 500 people or 30% of the venue’s capacity. All attendees will need to wear masks and socially distance themselves. “While graduation and commencement ceremonies will still be different than they were in the past, this is a tremendous step forward for all of our schools, our graduates and their families,” Northam said in a statement. School districts and colleges across the state are still deciding how best to honor this year’s graduates, though Liberty University said Thursday that it will offer an outdoor, in-person ceremony and an online option. The University of Virginia is considering two proposals: holding an in-person graduation this spring with no guests or postponing graduation until guests can attend. Virginia Tech intends to host several in-person ceremonies with a restricted number of guests. It will also host an online ceremony.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal judge on Thursday dismissed an industry lawsuit that sought to block a $4-an-hour pay boost for Seattle grocery workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour issued the ruling after hearing oral arguments earlier in the day. “This is a big win for grocery store employees who have been critical and vulnerable frontline workers since the start of the pandemic,” City Attorney Pete Holmes said in a statement. The Seattle City Council in January approved the pay boost for workers at large grocery stores, to remain in effect as long as the city has a declared civil emergency related to the pandemic. Assistant City Attorney Jeremiah Miller told the judge the hazard pay was justified by the facts that the employees work among members of the public and are at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus and that grocery companies have made record profits during the pandemic. The judge rejected arguments by the Northwest Grocery Association and the Washington Food Industry Association that the pay increase interfered with collective bargaining and discriminated against large grocery stores. The industry warned that some stores would be unable to absorb the increased labor costs, especially those like Grocery Outlet that operate on smaller margins.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Supreme Court won’t be making its annual trip to the West Virginia University College of Law in Morgantown this year as a result of COVID-19, but the special docket of cases will be heard virtually. The school and the court have made arrangements to allow students and the public to watch the arguments online, Chief Justice Evan Jenkins said in a news release. “We will miss being on campus next week and the opportunity to meet in person with the students, but the justices are committed to continuing our outreach efforts even in a COVID environment,” Jenkins said. Documents for the cases have been posted online. The arguments will be streamed Tuesday on the court’s YouTube channel through a link on the West Virginia judiciary website. The court also will judge the finals of the Baker Cup Moot Court appellate advocacy competition at 1 p.m. The final competition will also be livestreamed.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Implementing a new call center to help unemployed people 24 hours a day, seven days a week is moving ahead with the signing of a $1.2 million contract, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced Thursday. The state Department of Workforce Development received a $2.4 million federal grant that it is using to begin overhauling the 50-year-old computer system that Evers has blamed for causing delays in helping customers and getting out unemployment benefits amid the coronavirus pandemic. Problems with the state’s call center, which was unable to handle the massive spike in calls particularly early on in the pandemic, will be the first target for improvements with the system. Republicans have blamed the Democratic governor for not doing more sooner to address the problem, and a state audit showed less than 1% of calls to the hotline were answered by state officials. Evers fired Caleb Frostman, the former secretary of the department that handles unemployment claims, and pushed the Legislature to approve new funding to upgrade the computer system. Lawmakers have known for years that the department’s computer system and software were out of date, but the pandemic laid bare the problems. The department hopes to have the new call center up and running within six months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Shots of COVID-19 vaccine are now available or soon will be for anybody over 18 in almost one-third of the state’s counties. In the past few months, vaccines have been available to health care workers, first responders, residents of long-term care facilities and senior citizens, among others. Vaccines are now widely available or close to being in eight of Wyoming’s 23 counties: Campbell, Converse, Fremont, Hot Springs, Johnson, Sheridan, Washakie and Weston, Wyoming Department of Health spokeswoman Kim Deti said Thursday. At the same time, anybody who qualified for a vaccine earlier can still get it, Campbell County Public Health Director Jane Glaser told the Gillette News Record. The department recently got almost $500,000 in federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act funding to help with vaccination clinic costs. “We were not getting complete supplies with the shipments of vaccines,” Glaser said. “We’ve had to use our own funds to purchase syringes and various things.” Campbell County Public Health has been doing three vaccination clinics per week, averaging between 260 and 300 vaccines per clinic. “We’re having a really good rollout with the vaccine so far, but it’s definitely not going to be over anytime soon,” Glaser said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/19"}]}

But holding the coronation then will allow for the hugely popular Trooping the Colour parade celebrating the monarch's official birthday to go forward in June. (The king's actual birthday is in November, when he will turn 74.)\n\nThere were some small clues for royal fans hoping for coronation details signaling what kind of king Charles will be.\n\n\"The Coronation will reflect the monarch’s role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry … The Ceremony has retained a similar structure for over a thousand years, and next year’s Coronation is expected to include the same core elements while recognizing the spirit of our times,\" the statement said.\n\nWhat does that mean? \"Further details will be announced in due course,\" the palace said. So it may be some time before those invited to the first British coronation in 70 years learn if they need to pull out their heavy ceremonial robes and set aside hours in their diaries on May 6.\n\nLeaks about the details of the coronation have been turning up in the British press for weeks, including reports that there will be fewer guests, the ceremony will last only about an hour and guests, even the most posh of aristocrats, will be allowed to wear morning suits instead of ceremonial robes. None of that has been confirmed.\n\nAnother detail not mentioned: As is tradition, Charles will be crowned while sitting on King Edward's Chair (made in 1300 and used by every sovereign since 1626), under which sat the \"Stone of Scone\" or Stone of Destiny, a hunk of sandstone used at Scottish coronations and stolen by the English at the end of the 13th century. In 1996, the stone was returned to Scotland by the British government with the understanding it would be borrowed for coronations. The Scots announced last month the stone would be used in King Charles' coronation before being returned to Edinburgh Castle's Crown Room.\n\nIt is no secret that King Charles, for years while he was Prince of Wales, indicated he wanted a \"slimmed down monarchy\" when he became king, in order to demonstrate to the people that the monarchy is worth keeping as a cost-effective benefit to the nation. Coronations are expensive to mount and are paid for by the government, meaning taxpayers.\n\nThe coronation of the king's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, took place in June 1953, more than a year after she became queen in February 1952. It was a near-four-hour ceremony, most of it televised. Some 8,000 people, many wearing coronets and draped in their ermine robes, were crammed into the abbey to watch the young queen, then 26, be crowned with St. Edward's Crown, the 360-year-old crown traditionally used for the actual moment of crowning.\n\nAmong those watching was her son and heir, Prince Charles, then 4, seated with his widowed grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and his aunt, Princess Margaret, both of whom died in 2002.\n\nFor the first time, millions watched the coronation on TV. In fact, many Brits rushed out and bought their first TVs just so they could see the ceremony and the celebrations in the aftermath, when the queen, now wearing the Imperial State Crown, emerged with her family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to wave to exultant crowds still feeling the effects of Britain's post-war gloom.\n\n(Those who watched the queen's funeral last month will remember the Imperial State Crown, the Orb and Scepter were on the queen's coffin during the ceremony. That crown is the one the monarch wears for all official ceremonies after leaving the abbey from the coronation. These \"Instruments of State\" were removed from the coffin, as a sign that her reign was over, just before it was lowered to her burial place beneath the floor of St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.)\n\nAlso still up in the air officially are the roles 40-year-old Prince William, Charles' heir and the new Prince of Wales, his wife, Princess Kate of Wales, 40, and their elder son, Prince George of Wales, will play in the coronation.\n\nLike the queen's funeral last month, planning and carrying out a coronation takes time and military organization and precision. A coronation typically takes place months after accession to the throne, following a period of national and royal mourning, which ended Sept. 27.\n\nOperation Golden Orb, the codename for King Charles' coronation, has been planned out for years.

Following the death of the Queen, he has become the oldest person ever to take the British throne at the age of 73.\n\nAlthough he is King and has begun his royal duties, his official accession to the throne – the coronation – will be an important symbolic moment in his reign and for the country for which he is now head of state.\n\nHowever, said the Financial Times, it is expected to be a “scaled-back” affair that “takes into account the straitened times in which Britain finds itself”.\n\nWhen will the coronation be?\n\nThe coronation of King Charles III will take place Saturday 6 May 2023, eight months after his mother’s death.\n\nIt is traditional to “wait until a sufficient time period of mourning has taken place” before crowning new sovereigns, said The Daily Telegraph.

The queen's eldest son, Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor, 73, is now King Charles III of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the date for the formal coronation ceremony for the new king has not yet been announced.\n\nShortly after the queen was laid to rest, the royal family's official Twitter account shared a new photo of Queen Elizabeth II climbing a hill with a walking stick in one hand and a coat draped over the other. She looks off in the distance, wearing sunglasses and a head scarf, as lush greenery fills the landscape behind her.\n\nAlong with the photo, the account shared a quote from William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\": \"May flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest.\"\n\nQueen laid to rest alongside husband, Prince Philip\n\nThe queen was laid to rest in an intimate ceremony away from cameras in Windsor, where she was reunited with her husband and her parents.\n\nCharles and senior royal family members gathered late Monday for the private interment ceremony at St. George’s Chapel, a gothic church on the grounds of Windsor Castle that has hosted royal weddings, christenings and burials since the 15th century.\n\nIn contrast to the pomp and pageantry of her grand state funeral, royal officials said the queen's internment was a “deeply personal family occasion.” They said the queen was interred together with Prince Philip’s remains at the King George VI memorial chapel, an annex within St. George’s.\n\nWhen Philip, the queen's husband of 73 years, died last year, his coffin had been placed in a different part of St. George’s Chapel, ready to be moved to the memorial chapel to join the queen when she died.\n\nElizabeth II’s parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, were also interred there along with the ashes of Princess Margaret, the late monarch’s younger sister who died in 2002.\n\nSt. George's is the resting place of 10 former British monarchs, including Henry VIII and the beheaded Charles I.

Events include prayer and a choir performance at St George's chapel. Nearly 800 people were expected to attend, including royal family members, and the hymn, \"All My Hope on God is Founded,\" was performed.\n\nWhile the procession took place, the Imperial State Crown sat atop the queen’s coffin along with her scepter and orb.\n\nDuring the committal service, the crown, scepter and orb were removed from the top of the coffin. The items were placed on an altar at St. George’s Chapel, and marked the final separation of the late queen from her crown.\n\nThe “Wand of Office” was broken by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Andrew Parker. The breaking of the wand is a tradition in a sovereign’s funeral, according to The Independent, and hasn’t been seen since King George VI died in 1952.\n\nThe new king stood by quietly during the moments of farewell and appeared somber and a bit teary-eyed before his mother’s coffin was lowered into the vault.\n\nPast tears:Did Queen Elizabeth cry at Prince Philip's funeral?

She wore Bahrain Pearl Drop Earrings and a four-strand pearl choker necklace, both from the queen's collection, People reported.\n\nFuneral attire:Princess Kate, daughter Charlotte honor Queen Elizabeth with sweet details\n\nRoyals escort the queen's casket to Wellington Arch, Windsor Castle\n\nFollowing the funeral, the coffin – accompanied by units of the armed forces in dress uniforms and members of her family – was carried through the capital’s streets.\n\nAt Wellington Arch near Hyde Park, it was placed in a hearse and driven to Windsor Castle – where Elizabeth spent much of her time – for another procession before a committal service in St George’s Chapel. She will be laid to rest with her late husband, Prince Philip, at a private family service.\n\nWhat is the hearse the queen is in?\n\nThe queen’s coffin was moved from the gun carriage to the royal hearse at Wellington Arch as it was taken to Windsor. The hearse drove 25 miles west of London to Windsor Castle and St George's Chapel, a mini-cathedral that seats 800 and is often used for royal weddings. It's where Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were married in 2018.\n\nAt Windsor, the state hearse traveled in procession to St George’s Chapel via the Long Walk. Once inside, a committal service began at 4 p.m. local time, 11 a.m. EDT.\n\nThe glass-walled hearse allows the queen’s coffin to be viewed – and it is lit up when it is dark out.\n\nFuneral program: What happened at queen's funeral\n\nThe funeral concluded just after noon, local time. The pall bearers escorted the queen's coffin onto the gun carriage.\n\nThe queen will be buried in a special chapel beneath the floor of St George's with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband, Philip.\n\nThe program also included:\n\nPatricia Scotland Commonwealth Secretary-General read a lesson from Corinthians 15 as a tribute to the queen’s life of dedication to service and the nation.\n\nA sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nChoirs sang the Anthem, taken from \"Songs of Farewell\" by Hubert Parry, a favorite of King Charles'.\n\nA short anthem, composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the queen’s coronation in 1953, presenting a reflective moment in the service.\n\nThe third hymn, \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\" is a Welsh tune, and was sung at the wedding of The Prince and Princess of Wales at Westminster Abbey in 2011. The arrangement is by James O’Donnell, a former organist at the Abbey.\n\nThe Archbishop gave the commendation over the queen’s coffin. The commendation will include the familiar line, \"Go Forth, O Christian Soul, From This World,\" which is often heard during funerals.\n\nThe choirs sang a new anthem, composed for the service by Sir James McMillan. The words are taken from Romans 8, which leads with the hopeful, confident line, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\"\n\nThe dean pronounced the blessing from the altar, and the congregation will remain standing for the last post, which will be sounded by the state trumpeters of the household cavalry.\n\nThis was followed by two minutes’ silence, to be observed across the United Kingdom.\n\nThe trumpeters then sounded the reveille, before the national anthem was sung.\n\nThe sovereign’s piper played the traditional lament, ‘Sleep, dearie, sleep.’\n\nAt the conclusion of the lament, at noon local time (7 a.m. ET), the pall bearers entered and moved the queen’s coffin to the state gun carriage.\n\nCharles writes note to the queen tucked in funeral wreath atop coffin\n\nThe funeral wreath on the queen's coffin was anything but funereal – it was a massive assembling of color and symbolism topped with a note from Charles. \"In loving and devoted memory. Charles R,\" it read.\n\n\"Charles R\" is the monarch’s official signature, with R being Latin for \"Rex\" or king. (Elizabeth’s signature was Elizabeth R for \"Regina,\" Latin for queen.)\n\nThe sight of that note immediately evoked memories of the note that sat on Princess Diana’s coffin during her funeral procession to Westminster Abbey in 1997. It was from her sons and signed \"Mummy.\"\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace’s notes on the funeral, the queen’s wreath included, at the king’s request, flowers and foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the king’s private home Highgrove House.\n\nThe foliage was chosen for its symbolism: Rosemary for remembrance. Myrtle for the ancient symbol of a happy marriage, and cut from a plant grown from a sprig of myrtle in the queen’s 1947 wedding bouquet. English oak symbolizes the strength of love.\n\nAlso included are scented pelargoniums, garden roses, autumnal hydrangea, sedum, dahlias, and scabious, in shades of gold, pink and deep burgundy, with touches of white to reflect the Royal Standard on which it sits.\n\nAnd at the request of the king, a longtime environmentalist, the wreath is made in a sustainable way, formed in a nest of English moss and oak branches and without the use of floral foam.\n\nWho attended the queen’s funeral?\n\nThe guest list for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II amounted to hundreds of people, a mix of members of the British royal family, foreign royals (many of them relatives of the queen), domestic and foreign government leaders, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, British religious and military leaders, members of the royal households, and scores of ordinary people, from the National Health Service, for instance, who were invited to mark their service to the nation.\n\nThe top British royals:\n\nKing Charles III\n\nCamilla, Queen Consort\n\nPrincess Anne Princess Royal, Vice Adm. Sir Tim Laurence\n\nPrince Andrew Duke of York\n\nPrince Edward Earl of Wessex, Sophie Countess of Wessex\n\nPrince William, Prince of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nPrince George of Wales\n\nPrince Charlotte of Wales\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nEarl of Snowdon\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nAlso there are some two dozen other members of the queen’s family, including descendants of her mother’s Scottish family. All eight of her grandchildren are there and some of the older 12 great-grandchildren, including the new second and third in line in the succession, Prince George of Wales, 9, and Princess Charlotte of Wales, 7.\n\nMany of the foreign royals who attended also are related to the British royal family through descent from Queen Victoria, sometimes known as the \"grandmother\" of Europe in the 19th century. The monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are there. Also, Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, making their first overseas trip since assuming the throne of Japan in 2019.\n\nThe Bidens top the foreign leaders list, which also includes France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Ireland’s President Michael Higgins. Also there: Ursula von der Leyen, representing the European Union that Britain quit amid many recriminations in 2016. Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also are there, representing three of the major Commonwealth nations over which the queen also reigned.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral:See King Charles III, Prince Harry, all royals who attended\n\nIs Prince Harry at the funeral? Harry wore military medals, but not his uniform\n\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, were visiting the U.K. from their home in California to promote several causes they are involved with when the queen died.\n\nAt Monday's funeral, Harry wore his military medals but not his uniform. He wore the uniform during a vigil on Saturday with Queen Elizabeth's grandchildren.\n\nRoyal experts have explained that only working members of the royal family will wear the military uniform for the five events during the late monarch's period of mourning and state funeral.\n\nHarry walked in to Westminster Abbey alongside his brother, Prince William. But during the service, Harry and Meghan sat in the second row behind his father, while William, Princess Kate and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across the aisle in the first row.\n\nIs Sarah 'Fergie' Ferguson at the funeral?\n\nSarah Ferguson, affectionately known as Fergie, attended the state funeral for the queen Monday. The Duchess of York, 62, has remained close with the royals despite her divorce from Prince Andrew in 1996. The former pair share daughters Princess Beatrice, 34, and Princess Eugenie, 32, who were also in attendance.\n\nFollowing the queen's death, Ferguson wrote in a tribute on Twitter that \"she was was the most incredible mother-in-law and friend.\"\n\n\"I will always be grateful to her for the generosity she showed me in remaining close to me even after my divorce,\" the Duchess of York added. \"I will miss her more than words can express.\"\n\nState funeral at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe queen's casket entered Westminster Abbey around 11 a.m. local time Monday. The choir of St. George's Chapel sang The Sentences as the queen's coffin procession, including King Charles, Prince William, Princess Kate, Prince Harry, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince George, Prince Charlotte, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, followed the coffin into the abbey.\n\nDavid Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, opened the service before attendees joined together to sing The Hymn, \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nDuring the funeral, speakers included Most Rev. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury; Rev. Mark Birch, Minor Canon and Precentor; Patricia Scotland, Commonwealth secretary-general; Shermara Fletcher, principal officer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Relations, Churches Together in England; and Rt. Rev. Dame Sarah Mullally. As the funeral concluded, the choir sang \"God Save the King.\"\n\nFuneral music: Hymns sung at queen's funeral\n\nThe music during the funeral will be sung by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and included The Sentences, written by William Croft, whose Sentences have been used since the mid 1500s, and at every State Funeral since the early 18th century.\n\nThe choir of St George's Chapel sang The Sentences during the procession as the casket entered. The choir of Westminster Abbey began the funeral service in song, later joining with the choir of the Chapel Royal for a rendition of \"Like as the Heart.\" The funeral's attendees sang \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nThe choir also sang \"The Lord’s My Shepherd,\" which also was heard at the Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh in 1947. The choir sang \"God Save the King,\" featuring different lyrics from what many have known for decades as \"God Save the Queen,\" as the funeral concluded.\n\nDetails about Queen Elizabeth's coffin\n\nThe oak coffin was made more than 30 years ago, funeral directors previously confirmed to USA TODAY. Leverton & Sons, which has served as funeral directors to the royal household said it inherited the coffin made for the queen by another firm, Kenyons.\n\nAndrew Leverton, a funeral director at Leverton & Sons, previously told British outlet the Times \"It is made from English oak, which is very difficult to get hold of.\n\n“Oak coffins are now made from American oak. I don’t think we could use English oak for a coffin now. It would be too expensive,” he told the outlet.\n\nThe coffin is also lined with lead, Leverton & Sons said. The lead lining makes the coffin so heavy that eight military bearers carried it Monday.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's casket:Queen to be buried in decades-old coffin lined with lead that takes 8 people to carry\n\nImperial State Crown: Details about crown atop casket\n\nThe majestic Imperial State Crown sits atop the queen’s flag-draped coffin as the queen was moved to Westminster Abbey, along with her scepter and orb.\n\nThe crown, the same one the young Queen Elizabeth II wore for her coronation in 1953, is adorned with stones including the 317-carat Cullinan II diamond, one of several stones cut from the more than 3,000-carat Cullinan Diamond, mined in South Africa in 1905, when the nation was a British colony. The main stone – the 530.2-carat Cullinan I diamond, also called the Star of Africa – rests at the top of the monarch’s scepter.\n\nAs the royal jewels are in the news, so are repeated calls to return the diamonds to their country of origin. The queen's death at 96 on Sept. 8 has also renewed the conversation of the royal family's ties to colonialism and the queen's lack of apology or atonement.\n\nCalls for reparation from former colonial powers are not new, but they have resurged in recent years. Barbados in November 2021 removed the queen as its head of state, becoming the region’s newest republic. Six other Caribbean countries have signaled their intent to follow suit.\n\nThe monarchy:Imperial State Crown and royal scepter glimmer, but some say on back of colonialism\n\nWhat is the gun carriage used to carry the queen?\n\nWhen the coffin emerged from Westminster Hall, the pallbearers placed it on the green gun carriage that was used for the funerals of the queen’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather, all kings.\n\nKing Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward flanked the procession, followed by several other members of the royal family including Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nKing Charles, more royals arrive at funeral\n\nKing Charles was met with applause by crowds as his motorcade arrived at Westminster Hall for the queen's coffin procession to Westminster Abbey. Prince William and Prince Harry joined him.\n\nOne car contained Queen Consort Camilla and Catherine, Princess of Wales, with her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Another featured Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.\n\nMore members of the royal family, including Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrived shortly after.\n\nThe funeral’s order of service showed that George and Charlotte will walk together behind their parents. They will be followed by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and other royal family members.\n\nThe royal children’s 4-year-old brother, Prince Louis, is not expected to be present at the funeral, which will be attended by some 2,000 people.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Liz Truss, more world leaders arrive\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, is among the top world leaders who arrived at Westminster Abbey ahead of the funeral.\n\nBiden arrived at Westminster Abbey for the queen’s funeral in his armored limousine, The Beast. He was among the few international diplomats who, for security reasons, did not ride on a fleet of chartered luxury buses provided for other world leaders. Biden stepped out of the The Beast a few minutes after 10 a.m. local time. He did not say anything or address the press.\n\nMany other leaders arrived Monday morning via bus; the Bidens arrived separately. British Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte Macron, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and wife Michelle Bolsonaro and Israeli President Isaac Herzog and wife Michal Herzog were also spotted arriving.\n\nThe president signed the official condolence book and attended a reception Sunday at Buckingham Palace hosted by King Charles III.\n\nBiden is among many world leaders who traveled to the United Kingdom to honor Queen Elizabeth’s long reign. During his visit, Biden told media the queen \"was the same in person as her image: decent, honorable and all about service.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the royal family, King Charles and all of the family. It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you’ll never overcome it,\" the president said, adding that he told Charles the queen will be with him \"every step of the way, every moment.\"\n\nThe day before the funeral:Biden arrives in London for funeral; Queen's grandchildren stand vigil by coffin\n\nTom Parker Bowles, more royals' family members arrive\n\nLess than an hour and a half before the funeral is set to begin, notable arrivals connected to the royal family began to trickle in. Queen Consort Camilla's family was also photographed arriving at Westminster Abbey, including Laura Lopes, Camilla's 44-year-old daughter, and Tom Parker Bowles, her 47-year-old son. Princess Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, were also photographed upon arrival.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nWhere will Queen Elizabeth II be buried?\n\nThe queen will be buried at St George Chapel at Windsor Castle, where many of her ancestors are buried, including her parents, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother.\n\nFollowing the funeral at Westminster Abbey, the coffin procession will begin, joined by King Charles, other members of the royal family, past and present members of the queen's household, governors general and prime ministers of the realms.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral details:When is it? Will it be on TV? Your questions, answered\n\nKing Charles thanks the public for 'messages of condolence' ahead of queen's funeral\n\nAhead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, King Charles III issued a statement Sunday evening thanking people in Britain and across the world for \"the many messages of condolence.\"\n\n\"Over the last ten days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched,\" the king said. \"In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother.\"\n\n\"As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief,\" Charles concluded his statement.\n\nAhead of the queen's funeral Monday, a new photograph was released Sunday.\n\nAccording to the royal family on Facebook, the photo was taken to mark the queen's Platinum Jubilee earlier this year. She was the first British monarch to reach this milestone.\n\n\"Tomorrow, millions will come together to commemorate her remarkable life,\" the post read.\n\nPrince Charles is now King Charles III. Here's what to know about UK's new monarch.\n\nHow old is Westminster Abbey, site of Queen Elizabeth funeral?\n\nWestminster Abbey, where Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral will be held Monday, has a centuries-long association with the royal family, hosting generations of coronations, royal weddings and funerals.\n\nThe church, which was consecrated in 1065 and “has been the setting for every coronation since 1066” and 16 royal weddings, a statement on the abbey’s website says.\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's connection with Westminster Abbey ran like a thread through her early life and her long reign,” the site says. “As an 11-year-old girl, she watched as her father was crowned here. As a young adult, she married here and was crowned here.”\n\nFourteen English monarchs were buried there between 1066 and 1760, including Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of King Henry VIII, who was interred in the abbey in 1603. The Unknown Warrior, whose body was brought from France in 1920, is buried in the abbey’s nave. Author Charles Dickens is among those buried in Poets' Corner of the abbey.\n\nThe funeral of Princess Diana was held at the abbey in 1997 and the Queen Mother’s funeral took place there in 2002. More recently, Prince William and Duchess Kate, now the Prince and Princess of Wales, were married there in 2011.\n\nVisual guide to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey\n\nQueen's funeral more than ceremony, designed to show monarchy's stability\n\nThe queen, who died Sept. 8 in Scotland at age 96 after 70 years on the throne, was widely considered the glue holding the U.K. together. She was also the most canny of her Windsor ancestors about using ceremony and splendor to bond the monarchy and the people who pay for it.\n\nNot since 1965, for former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, has Britain mounted a state funeral, which is usually reserved for monarchs, with exceptions for distinguished figures such as Churchill, the queen's first prime minister of her reign.\n\nRoyal funerals are planned decades in advance by governments and the crown, and the plans are updated regularly. The monarch plays a crucial role in deciding details. The choice of flowers in the wreath on her coffin, the music and prayer selections, even the bespoke design of the Royal Hearse (lots of glass and inside light so the casket can be seen even at night), were all decisions made by the queen.\n\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nMourners line the streets during queen's funeral\n\nAt 6 a.m. local time, snipers were on rooftops, sniffer dogs were on the streets, drains were being searched and surveillance drones have been banned from all of central London. Around 20 miles of barriers have been erected to control crowds as the queen’s coffin travels the short distance from Westminster Hall, where it is lying-in-state, to Westminster Abbey, and then onward to Windsor Castle after the funeral for burial.\n\nA full five hours before the funeral gets underway, London’s transportation network was already busy on a public holiday, with the subway system seeing members of the public rushing to secure viewing spots in and around Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. Many carried small fold-up chairs, and Londoners almost entirely wore black in the quiet of the city. Volunteers in purple vests every few yards provided help with directions and other needs.\n\nHyde Park, one of London's central parks, is a designated screening spot for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on Monday. The 11 a.m.-ceremony will be broadcast live on large screens for attendees to see for free at the park, and the Hyde Park site will show the procession through London following the funeral, the procession through Windsor and the Committal Service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nSigns and staff are present across the city to direct people to either the park or other \"viewing areas\" where they may catch a real glimpse of the state funeral route. The park and viewing areas include dedicated spots for anyone who has an accessibility need, including British Sign Language interpreters and a dedicated location for wheelchair users.\n\nPeople watched the funeral and procession from almost everywhere – lining the streets 10-deep to sitting on blankets in parks.\n\nLucy Hartnell, 26, from Hertfordshire, organized a picnic at Hyde Park of what she and friends assumed were “queen favorites” including strawberries, cucumber finger sandwiches, Prosecco, cupcakes and chips. They took the tube into London and were \"shocked\" how easy it was for them to get to Hyde Park to view the funeral.\n\nThey said they attended to not miss a big event and aren’t really pro-royal or anti-royal, which has been a large debate among young people.\n\n\"We’re not super against the royals or for them, we just wanted to be part of them moment,\" Hartnell said.\n\nThey said the transition to a king likely won’t affect them, but they said the area where they grew up is very pro-monarchy. \"Our grandparents care a lot. We don’t care that much either way. People our age are like 'we should get rid of the monarchy.' But no one cares enough to actually do anything about it … we just like having them,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Nicole Fallert, Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara, Maria Puente, Laura Trujillo, Amy Haneline and Morgan Hines, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/uk/royal-family-king-charles-iii-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Royal family: As King Charles III takes the throne, big changes lie ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGod save the Queen, long live the King.

As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/uk/royal-news-newsletter-10-14-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "What King Charles III's coronation might look like | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the October 14 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nMark your calendars, royal-watchers. King Charles III will be crowned in Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023, eight months after he succeeded his mother.\n\nAs expected, the date has been the source of heavy speculation in the past few weeks. Many hoped for June 2 – 70 years to the day since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II – as a symbol of continuity between the reigns.\n\nBut, alas, picking a date isn’t as simple as looking at a calendar. It has to be checked against everything else going on to avoid clashes with other major events (the FA Cup soccer final, for example), as well as ensuring the availability of key players like the abbey itself and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who conducts the ceremony.\n\nWith the date locked in, attention now turns to the details of the day. The United Kingdom being the only monarchy in Europe that retains the ritual of a coronation, it will be a typically royal occasion, full of the pageantry loved by so many. But, at its heart, it is also a deeply religious ceremony.\n\nWhile the specifics of next year’s event have yet to be revealed, coronations have stayed largely the same for more than 1,000 years, so we have a pretty good idea of what to expect.\n\nIt’s likely to start with the King and Queen Consort traveling to the abbey in procession in the Gold State Coach – seen earlier this year in Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Once Charles and Camilla arrive, Buckingham Palace says, the coronation “will reflect the monarch’s role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry.”\n\nThat line from the palace has been interpreted as a hint that Charles’ coronation will be different from the one his late mother experienced seven decades ago.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II sits on a throne during her coronation in Westminster Abbey in London. Centrall Press Photo LTD/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBack then, the planning committee orchestrated a grand state affair to introduce the young, somewhat unknown Elizabeth to the world and assert her position as the new monarch. Britain was still emerging from a world war, and it was felt the country needed an elaborate occasion to rally behind.\n\nThe ceremony – which was the first royal event to be televised – ran for more than three hours and temporary structures were erected within the abbey to accommodate a swollen guest list of more than 8,000 people.\n\nThe core elements of the service were the recognition, oath, anointing, investiture, crowning and homage. The recognition is when the sovereign stands in the theater of the abbey and presents themself to the people. After taking the coronation oath – which is a vow to rule according to law, exercise justice with mercy, and maintain the Church of England – the monarch is anointed with holy oil by the archbishop. This is considered the most sacred part of the service.\n\nThe next part is the investiture, when the sovereign is dressed in special coronation robes and presented with the symbols of the monarchy: the orb, coronation ring, scepter and rod. Then St. Edward’s Crown is the placed atop the monarch’s head before royal princes and nobles of the realm make their way to the sovereign to pay their respects.\n\nThe occasion will also see the Queen Consort crowned in a similar but smaller ceremony.\n\nExperts say Charles III’s coronation will be a significantly more subdued occasion than his mother’s, with arrangements influenced by the ongoing cost of living crisis in the UK.\n\n“We’re no longer the sort of society we used to be,” says Bob Morris, honorary research fellow at University College London’s Constitution Unit.\n\nIt would be “ridiculous for us to have the kind of imperialistic coronation that we had in 1953,” he adds. “Secondly, we’re in the middle of a recession or damn near it. And that’s a very good reason for not splashing the cash.”\n\nSt. Edward's Crown has been used in coronations for English, and later British, monarchs. Jack Hill/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCraig Prescott, a lecturer in law at Bangor University in Wales, tells CNN it’s inevitable the event will be adapted and points to the ceremony’s length as one aspect that could be overhauled.\n\n“(The monarchy is) not a museum. It’s a living, breathing part of our constitutional, political and social arrangements, and so in order to be effective, it has to keep in tune with the times,” he explains. “The coronation service has always sort of shifted as time has gone on.”\n\nPrescott continues: “Although (the Queen’s coronation) was televised, it wasn’t a television event in the modern sense … Those organizing it today will have more than one eye on the idea that this will be primarily viewed through television and a lot of it could be speeded up with a more modern, sharper approach.”\n\nSpecifically with the service, Morris thinks that feudal elements, like the homage by peers, could be removed entirely.\n\nMeanwhile, Prescott suggests prayers and readings could be pared back, and in doing so make space for “the involvement of the other faiths in the UK.”\n\n“We’ve seen that in other royal events, where you have people from other faiths taking part (and) saying prayers from their own faith backgrounds.”\n\nRegardless of ceremonial modifications, Prescott says next year’s royal set piece promises to be spectacular.\n\n“(The coronation) is new for almost everyone,” he says, adding: “When you think about the monarchy, it’s such an old institution but it’s able to deliver something new.”\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nA royal show of force.\n\nThursday was yet another busy day for the working Windsors. Up in Glasgow, Scotland, the King visited the Burrell Collection, where he officially reopened what is regarded as one of the world’s greatest single-person art collections after a six-year refurbishment. While the King was at the museum, the Queen Consort was back in London visiting Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where she met domestic abuse frontline staff working on the maternity ward. Shortly after, on the other side of town, the Prince and Princess of Wales traveled to the Copper Box Arena in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park for an event with Coach Core. The couple’s Royal Foundation launched the programme in 2012, but a decade later it is an independent charity supporting disadvantaged young people through sport apprenticeships. Meanwhile, Sophie, Countess of Wessex celebrated World Sight Day in Malawi, which last week became the first country in southern Africa to eliminate trachoma, an infectious disease that causes blindness. Sophie has been in Malawi and Botswana this week to see the legacy of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, which aims to end avoidable blindness across the Commonwealth and beyond. Since the official royal mourning period ended, all the royals have been showcasing their work with a series of engagements over the past two weeks.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales arrive at Copper Box Arena in London on October 13, 2022.

The lawsuit accuses Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) of engaging in various means of criminal activity to obtain information on high-profile figures over the years. Elizabeth Hurley, Sadie Frost, David Furnish and Doreen Lawrence make up the rest of the plaintiffs behind the legal action, filed last week. They claim they were “victims of abhorrent criminal activity and gross breaches of privacy,” according to a statement from their representatives. The group accuses ANL of hiring private investigators to carry out unlawful acts such as planting listening devices in homes and cars and recording private calls. It also claims the publisher would pay corrupt police officials to obtain inside information, engaged in impersonation and deception to obtain medical records, and would hack into bank accounts and financial transactions by “illicit means and manipulation.” CNN has reached out to ANL for comment.\n\nPrint editions of the Daily Mail newspaper Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nCorgi parade in honor of the late Queen.\n\nCorgi owners descended on Buckingham Palace with their pups on Sunday for a heartfelt tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II. One owner who brought her 15-week-old corgi Clive to the royal residence said: “We love the Queen and she’s just been so kind to the breed, and it’s her favorite breed, and we’re just so proud now to own a corgi in memory of the Queen.” Another corgi owner said she thought the Queen had loved the dogs because they are “really loyal and really faithful,” adding they are a “joy to be around.” The Queen is reported to have had more than 30 corgis during her lifetime, with her remaining two going to live with the Duke and Duchess of York after her death. As owners across the country paid their respects to the late monarch in the month since her passing, many have brought their beloved dogs along, while others have left corgi toys and figurines among floral tributes.\n\nA Corgi is seen at Windsor Castle on September 12, 2022.

The program features a team of craftspeople who repair items their owners thought were beyond saving.\n\nCharles invites host Jay Blades and his team to Dumfries House in Scotland, where he asks them to help restore an 18th-century bracket clock and ceramic pottery made for Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.\n\nWhile it’s somewhat surprising to see the King popping up on a TV show (after all, the Queen famously never gave interviews to the press), it should be noted the episode was filmed between fall 2021 and March 2022, when Charles was still the Prince of Wales.

She increasingly handed over duties to Charles, from the recreational to the constitutional. Last week, she couldn't attend the annual Highland Games, the Braemar Gathering, which she never missed throughout her reign.\n\nOn Tuesday she presided over the transition of one prime minister to a new one, a constitutional duty as head of state which took place at Balmoral for the first time in her reign.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the palace announced she would not be able to attend via Zoom the meeting of the Privy Council, the standing committee of senior governmental advisers, after doctors' orders to rest.\n\nShe also missed significant appearances in June during the four days of celebration of her Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne.\n\nThe world reacts:King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nIn February, two weeks after marking the 70 anniversary of her ascension to the throne in 1952, the palace announced she had tested positive for COVID-19. During an audience in mid-February, the queen mentioned to her visitors that she had difficulty \"moving,\" leading to \"ongoing mobility\" issues, as Buckingham Palace put it, that prevented some appearances, including the State Opening of Parliament on May 10.\n\nShe had missed this important head-of-state role only twice before during her reign, both for pregnancies, but for the first time she officially delegated Charles to stand in for her, accompanied by his elder son, Prince William.\n\nShe was preceded in death by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years, who died April 9, 2021, at Windsor Castle at age 99, just short of his 100th birthday.

Sign up here.\n\nThe death of a monarch is followed by a flurry of rituals, including an address to the nation by the new king and by the prime minister, followed by long-established funeral plans carried out with military precision.\n\nFor now, however, Britain prepared to mourn.\n\nThe plans include a funeral worthy of the devout and dutiful woman who pledged herself at age 21 in service to her nation and never wavered as the living symbol of the British people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's historic reign\n\nShe reigned, never ruled, as Britain's head of state and constitutional figurehead for decades. She acceded to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, when her father, King George VI, died at age 56. She was just 25.\n\nHaving celebrated her Diamond Jubilee of 60 years on the throne in 2012, she was the U.K.'s oldest monarch ever, and the longest-serving, surpassing her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria, who reigned 63 years and died in 1901.\n\nMore than half the people alive in Britain today have known no other monarch on their throne, their coins, their bank notes and their stamps. A modest, even shy girl, she became the most famous woman in the world, the most photographed and depicted human being in history, who met and shook hands with an estimated 4 million people or more during her reign.\n\nShe inherited a sun-never-sets empire just starting to disintegrate, then presided over its final collapse into a Commonwealth of nations that looked to her as its leader, and to which she was deeply committed to the end. She was Britain's stiff upper lip during the 20th-century post-World War II recovery, the last gasps of the empire, the Cold War and the war on terrorism.\n\nIn her colorful hats and her sturdy sensible shoes, her ever-present handbag on her arm, she was a constant through kaleidoscope changes as the 20th century roared into the 21st: the growth of television, Beatlemania, Britain's demographic transformation to a multi-ethnic society, and the rise of a celebrity culture that ensnared nearly every member of her family.\n\nShe adapted to changing times by changing – and yet not changing on the important things, such as maintaining a dignified silence – while embracing the internet age with a palace website, Facebook and Twitter accounts, and even a royal channel on YouTube.\n\nShe was stoic and carried on through the antics and scandals of members of her family. Most recently, she had to weather the public downfall of her son Prince Andrew for his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which later led in an embarrassing civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. And her grandson Prince Harry's decision to move to America with his wife, Meghan, and leave royal life behind resulted in months of recriminations further inflamed by accusations of racism (hotly denied) in the royal family.\n\nWhen it was necessary, she shed her usual reserve. She presided over the heart-rending 1997 funeral of her former daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, the \"people's princess.\" She did it – despite her desire to protect Charles and Diana's two sons – to save the standing of the monarchy from a grief-maddened populace enraged by what seemed to be royal coldness and detachment in the wake of Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nIf the queen seemed occasionally out of step with the accelerating changes, she redeemed herself and the monarchy by adjusting, and she gained new popularity and admiration in her later years. Always deeply respected, she was beloved by the time she reached 80, helped partly by the release of the film \"The Queen.\" Dame Helen Mirren's transcendent performance as Her Majesty won her the Academy Award for best actress in 2007, and her tribute in her acceptance speech is as apt a eulogy as any.\n\n\"For 50 years and more, Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty – and her hairstyle,\" Mirren said in her acceptance speech. \"She has had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head and her handbag on her arm. She has weathered many, many storms. And I salute her courage and her consistency.\"\n\nWhat happens to the monarchy after Queen Elizabeth's death?\n\nBiographers point to the queen's devotion to duty as her most important personal and professional characteristic, raising questions about whether the monarchy can survive long without her. Even foes of the monarchy, known as republicans in Britain, acknowledged they admired her. They see the monarchy as a hereditary institution wrapped in wealth and privilege that has no place in a modern democratic society; they credit her with not only saving it but making it more popular than ever.\n\nKing Charles III takes over:What happens to the other royals under new slimmed-down monarchy?\n\n\"She will be remembered for keeping the British monarchy going through the 20th and into the 21st century – and for leaving it in better shape,\" says Robert Lacey, the British historian and biographer who has written four books on the queen. \"She was imbued with a great sense of duty and responsibility. In the long run, that would be a strength and her charm.\"\n\nElizabeth's sense of duty was established early in her life during the monarchy's worst modern crisis: the abdication of the throne by her uncle, King Edward VIII, in 1936. The abdication shocked Britain, especially after the government and palace had kept the crisis out of the headlines until almost the day it happened. From the perspective of commoners and dukes alike, the former king was seen as shirking his duty and turning his back on his country.\n\nThe profound effect on 10-year-old Elizabeth, Lacey says, is that from then on duty was her watchword. Unlike Edward, the queen swore to never abandon the role she was thrust into by chance of birth and thus throw the monarchy and nation into crisis.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's early life\n\nShe was unlikely to be queen when born the first child of Prince Albert (Bertie) and the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the Duke and Duchess of York, on April 21, 1926, at her parents' townhouse in London. Her father's eldest brother, known in the family as David, was the Prince of Wales and heir to the throne after his father, and her grandfather, George V. Although single when he became Edward VIII in January 1936, he was still young enough to marry and have children.\n\nElizabeth spent her early years in quiet family life, largely at family estates in the country, where she developed a lifelong affinity for horses and dogs, especially Welsh corgis. That bucolic life was shattered after Edward quit the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nThe abdication thrust Elizabeth's father to the throne as George VI (he took the name to honor his father), which made Elizabeth heiress presumptive and the likely next monarch. So she became a queen in training under the tutelage of her father and her austere paternal grandmother, Queen Mary.\n\nShe made her first public speech at age 14 in 1940 on BBC Radio, speaking to children, like her, who were being evacuated to safety from the London Blitz in World War II. Two years later, she got her first military appointment, colonel-in-chief of the Grenadier Guards.\n\n'I remain committed to serving you':Queen Elizabeth II's most memorable, poignant quotes\n\nOver the years, her official duties increased, giving her a taste of what was expected of her in charitable work and as figurehead of the British government and military. She became head of children's hospitals. She toured Scotland with her parents. She even became a licensed military driver in 1945 toward the end of the war.\n\nAlthough she and her younger sister, Princess Margaret Rose, spent much of the war years in the safety of Windsor Castle, they and their parents helped rally the British in the brutal effort to win the war against the Nazis. When Britain succeeded, the country was nearly bankrupt but also deeply bonded to the royal family for their roles.\n\nOn her 21st birthday, during a visit to South Africa, then still part of the empire, Princess Elizabeth addressed the British people by radio, vowing that her life, \"whether it be long or short,\" would be dedicated to serving the nation and the imperial family, now known as the Commonwealth. In 1977, celebrating her Silver Jubilee of 25 years on the throne, she told the nation that though her vow was made \"in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it.\"\n\nFamily life was at times tumultuous\n\nIn 1947, Elizabeth married her distant cousin, Philip (she was the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary), the exiled Greek prince raised mostly in Britain who was an officer in the Royal Navy and with whom she had been in love since she was 13 and he was 18.\n\nIn contrast to the 1981 fairy-tale extravaganza wedding of Charles to the former Lady Diana Spencer, Elizabeth's wedding was simple. With the country still recovering from the war, she collected ration coupons for her dress like other young brides of the time, which further endeared her to the public.\n\nThe wedding in Westminster Abbey helped lift some of the gloom that fell over London after the war, and soon there were two children to celebrate: Charles, the heir, and Princess Anne, now the Princess Royal. Her early years as a wife and mother were her happiest; then her father died in his sleep while she was on holiday in Kenya. She flew home a queen, somber but composed.\n\nShe was crowned a year later, on June 2, 1953, by this time royally trained for her job, ready for the responsibilities, accepting of the fact that her life and her family's life would never be the same again.\n\nAs a queen, Elizabeth has been an unqualified success. As a mother, not always. She suffered grief and ridicule as head of a modern, often dysfunctional royal family trapped in public expectations of Victorian-era values.\n\nCharles was born in 1948, followed by Anne in 1950. Andrew and Edward came much later, in 1960 and 1964.\n\nThe queen always wanted a large family but put it off because duty came first, biographer Lacey says. Hers was never a warm and fuzzy persona, he says, and her cool aloofness may have carried over into family life.\n\nCharles told his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, in 1994 that the queen was an absentee mother. She was off being queen and he was left with nannies, he said. Andrew and Edward, however, insisted they weren't starved for motherly attention. \"They made it clear they thought their mother had been absolutely marvelous,\" Lacey says.\n\nStill, her children were the chief source of distress in the most painful year of her life, 1992, what she called her \"annus horribilis,\" when the marriages of three of her children collapsed, accompanied by reams of scandalous tabloid headlines.\n\nThen, on Nov. 20, 1992, the queen's beloved Windsor Castle burned for 15 hours; 100 rooms were damaged or destroyed. \"It was symbolic of what was happening to the house of Windsor,\" Lacey says.\n\nTaxes paid to restore the castle because it was state property but Elizabeth opened parts of Buckingham Palace to the public the following year, and tourist receipts helped offset the costs.\n\nThen, things got worse. The death of the then-divorced Diana in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, threatened the queen's standing and that of the monarchy more than any time of her reign.\n\nWhile the queen's weeping subjects piled flowers waist-high outside Buckingham Palace and Diana's home at Kensington Palace in London, the royal family kept their grief under wraps as they holed up on their annual summer holiday at Balmoral, their estate in Scotland.\n\nThe queen's instinctive need to grieve privately was seen as out of sentimental step with a nation that wanted an unprecedented public display of sorrow and respect. At that moment, the queen's renowned sense of public sentiment eluded her. Her stiff upper lip, and the monarchy, seemed frozen in a distant time.\n\nOn the advice of then-new but savvy Prime Minister Tony Blair and others, the queen was persuaded to return to London to speak to the nation in a rare televised address. At the funeral the next day, when Diana's casket passed her standing outside the palace, she bowed her head.\n\nWith that simple gesture, the queen began turning public opinion.\n\nEsteem for the queen grew as years passed and a lifetime of official engagements stacked one on top of another. By the time of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012, according to Buckingham Palace, she had conferred more than 404,500 awards and honors; hosted 1.5 million people at garden parties and another 50,000 people a year at banquets, lunches, dinners and receptions; met 11 U.S. presidents (13 as of 2021); hosted 102 state visits in London; traveled on 325 overseas visits, including 96 state visits, to 150 countries; sent more than 540,000 telegrams to couples in the U.K. and Commonwealth celebrating a diamond wedding anniversary; served as patron to more than 620 charities or organizations; sat for 129 official portraits; and launched 23 ships. She also owned 30 corgis since 1944, and her horses won nearly every major race in Britain.\n\nDespite her calculated royal distance from the public – she never gave an interview, and people who met her were encouraged not to divulge what she said, which was usually innocuous anyway – the queen had become a familiar mother figure to her family of subjects.\n\n\"I think it's because we are comfortable with her,\" says Ingrid Seward, a veteran royals observer, biographer and editor of Majesty magazine, as the queen's popularity soared in her later years. \"We can sympathize with all that she has gone through. We know that the queen is always looking out for us. We really respect her.\"\n\nDuring her later years, foes of the monarchy acknowledged they would never be able to abolish the throne as long as the queen was alive. Public admiration for her was just too great, conceded Graham Smith of Republic, Britain's loudest advocacy group for scrapping the monarchy.\n\nThat's because the queen went about her job and avoided controversy, Smith says. Although every prime minister starting with Winston Churchill briefed her nearly every Tuesday during her reign, Elizabeth stayed above politics, never giving a hint of her political leanings or signaling publicly which prime minister she liked best.\n\nSerious debate about getting rid of the royals will come only under a monarch less astute, less admired and more gaffe-prone than Elizabeth on the throne, Smith says. \"Her most enduring quality was her ability to hold onto power.\"\n\nLacey considers that a fitting tribute to a woman who devoted her life to performing a role she didn't choose.\n\n\"In the end,\" Lacey says, \"she triumphed.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/23/uk/royal-news-newsletter-09-23-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Queen Elizabeth: The royal court's mourning period is not over yet ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the September 23 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nThe United Kingdom may be re-emerging from a self-imposed lockdown, which saw businesses across the country close in a sign of respect for the Queen’s funeral on Monday, but the royal court continues to grieve.\n\nThat’s because shortly after the late monarch’s death, King Charles III asked the family and royal households to observe another week of mourning after the state funeral.\n\nAs a result, most of the public engagements expected of the senior royals have been canceled. A handful have gone ahead but these have largely been opportunities for the Windsors to acknowledge some of the parties involved in the ceremonial arrangements of the last fortnight.\n\nFor example, the Prince and Princess of Wales surprised volunteers at Windsor’s Guildhall on Thursday to express their gratitude for helping with the crowds that turned out to pay their respects. Separately, Princess Anne visited Portsmouth Naval Base to thank navy personnel for the part they played in the funeral procession.\n\nJust a day after laying his mother to rest, Charles III turned his attention to government matters and picked up where the late Queen had left off, approving a series of ministerial appointments, according to Downing Street. While it seems so much has happened since, let’s not forget that Queen Elizabeth II had only invited new Prime Minister Liz Truss to form a government just two days before her death on September 8.\n\nThe King has now reportedly returned to Scotland with the Queen Consort to grieve privately but you can expect that the sovereign’s signature red boxes are being sent north for him to continue his daily duties. The red boxes contain important papers from government ministers in the UK and from representatives across the Commonwealth and beyond.\n\nSo in the interim while the family retreats for a brief time, royal-watchers are turning their attention to the future, where questions over the King’s coronation have emerged.\n\nThe palace has yet to announce a date for the coronation but it’s likely to be quite a few months away.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales thank volunteers and staff who worked on the Queen's funeral. Ian Vogler/AFP POOL/Getty Images\n\nHistorically, there has always been something of a gap between a new monarch’s accession to the British throne and their coronation. If we think back to Queen Elizabeth II’s example, her coronation was held 16 months after becoming monarch on June 2, 1953. The reason for that is to allow an appropriate amount of time to mourn the previous sovereign and also because organizing a coronation takes a lot of planning.\n\nWhat we do know is that it will be held at Westminster Abbey, because that’s where every coronation since 1066 has taken place. Since William the Conqueror, all but two monarchs have been crowned there. Edward V died before he could be crowned and Edward VIII abdicated.\n\nWhile the coronation is expected to have some of the pomp and pageantry associated with royal occasions, it will also likely be an Anglican ceremony. However, some have wondered if the King intends to make it more inclusive after his remarks while hosting a reception for faith leaders at Buckingham Palace on Friday.\n\nDuring that event, Charles said he sees Britain as a “community of communities” and this understanding has made him realize that he has an “additional duty” to “protect the diversity of our country.” So, it is possible we may see that additional role and a multi-faith Britain reflected in some capacity at the coronation next year.\n\nUnlike the state funeral, which the Queen had a hand in planning, the coronation will be fully designed by the King, in consultation with the UK government. With preparations likely to only be starting in earnest now, he’ll want to be sure he is balancing the national mood – which could be less jubilant after a difficult winter amid the cost-of-living and energy crises – with reflecting his vision of the future monarchy.\n\nWATCH\n\nCNN speaks to people who braved the tightly-packed crowds in central London to watch the funeral procession, saying goodbye to the longest-reigning British monarch.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What it was like to be part of the crowds at the Queen's funeral 02:09 - Source: CNN\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nQueen’s funeral draws 26 million viewers in the UK.\n\nThe Queen’s state funeral and committal services in the UK were the first to be televised for a British monarch.

However, that’s not her final resting place. The Queen was buried at the King George VI Memorial Chapel, in an annex of St. George’s on Monday evening, following a private burial service attended by King Charles III and other members of the royal family. It was at this point that the late Duke of Edinburgh’s coffin was also relocated and moved to the crypt so that the Queen could be laid to rest alongside her beloved husband of 73 years. The burial service was conducted by the Dean of Windsor, who earlier in the day had led the committal service.\n\nThe Queen's coffin arrives at St. George's Chapel, Windsor, on Monday. Henry Nicholls/Pool/Reuters\n\nThe royal residences, including Windsor Castle, have been closed since the monarch’s death on September 8. But the general public will be able to view the Queen’s final resting place when the castle reopens for tours on September 29. Some areas within royal residences reopened to tourists on Thursday, including the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Queen’s Gallery in Edinburgh, Scotland, according to the Royal Collection Trust. However, Buckingham Palace’s summer opening of the State Rooms and Royal Mews will not return this year. Additionally, special displays marking the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse will not reopen to the public, the trust added.\n\nIN PICTURES: QUEEN ELIZABETH’S FAREWELL\n\nAcross the UK, people have been paying their respects to the Queen.

CHARLES III HAS ALREADY EXPRESSED MANY OF HIS.\n\nAnalysis from CNN’s Luke McGee, UK and European Policy and Politics Editor\n\nThe death of the Queen marked the end of an era for the monarchy in more ways than one. She was the last senior royal from a generation that will soon seem alien to modern monarchists.\n\nDuring her 70 years on the throne, Elizabeth gave only one media interview, which was limited to the subject of her coronation. She never publicly stated a strong opinion on any subject that could be considered political or controversial. She avoided any kind of public intervention into how the public institutions of the UK should be run. In fact, the most controversial political moments during Elizabeth’s reign came from the indiscretion of others.\n\nFormer UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that the Queen “purred” in delight when Scotland voted to remain part of the UK in a 2014 independence referendum. The Sun newspaper speculated in 2016 that the Queen supported Brexit, something that former Buckingham Palace communications director Sally Osman was quick to rubbish while interviewed on CNN earlier this week.\n\nCompare this to the royals who now lead the monarchy into a new, more uncertain future. Elizabeth’s eldest child, now King Charles III, embarrassed the family when letters he wrote to former Prime Minister Tony Blair between 2004 and 2005 were published.\n\nWhile the letters seemed fairly innocuous – focusing on things like subsidies for farmers and, amusingly, the merits of publishing private letters such as these – the fact that the first-in-line to the throne was so happy to express political views to the prime minister alarmed those who supported the convention that the monarchy is apolitical.

At age 73, he is the oldest monarch to ever take the British throne.\n\nNot since 1952 when Charles' grandfather, King George VI, died and his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, took the throne at the age of 25, has a sovereign died and a new sovereign succeeded.\n\nCharles will be crowned probably within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned.\n\nThe queen died Thursday at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, at age 96 after 70 years on the throne. Her funeral is set to take place at Westminster Abbey, where most important royal ceremonies take place.\n\nThat will be followed by a committal service in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where she will be buried in the King George VI Memorial Chapel alongside her beloved late husband, Prince Philip, and her parents and sister.\n\nThe world reacts: King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nWhat happens next after the death of Elizabeth?\n\nMost people in the U.K. have never lived through such a momentous event as the death of a monarch, so they have nothing to compare it to. But there's little puzzlement in the royal palaces, in Parliament or the British government, and almost certainly none in Charles' mind.\n\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out decades in advance, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication, traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a killer pandemic.\n\nWhat kind of sovereign will Charles be? That's a different question. But we can make some guesses based on what he's said and done at least since his investiture as Prince of Wales in an elaborate (and largely modern-invention ceremony) in July 1969 at Caernarfon Castle in Wales, when he was 20.\n\nLegally, he became king from the moment of the queen's death, meaning he is head of state for the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a dozen other countries. He's also the titular head of the Church of England, head of the military and the judiciary, and a host of other royal titles and duties.\n\nCharles, like his mother, will likely take the religious significance of his coronation very seriously, as a man long interested in philosophy and religious thought.\n\n\"He won’t really be king (in his mind) until he's consecrated with the holy oil, makes the sacred oath and has the crown on his head,\" says his American biographer Sally Bedell Smith. \"That moment when he is a 'transcendent being,' in a way, is really, really crucial.\"\n\nWhat happens now that Queen Elizabeth II has died?From funeral plans to processions\n\n► Stay up to date with the latest on King Charles III and the royal succession with our newsletter Keep Calm and Carry On. Sign up here.\n\nWhat is Charles' legacy as Prince of Wales?\n\nJust as the queen was the longest-serving monarch in British history, Prince Charles has been the longest-serving Prince of Wales in history – but not just that, says Bedell Smith.\n\n\"His record as Prince of Wales, in its breadth and depth, will be his real legacy,\" Bedell Smith says. \"He was the most innovative prince of Wales ever – he was an activist in a way no other heir to the throne ever has been.\"\n\nPart of the impetus for doing all he did, including his philanthropy, his entrepreneurial initiatives, the institutions and traditions he helped to preserve, demonstrate \"his wish to prove himself worthy of being king,\" Bedell Smith says.\n\n\"As prince of Wales, he had the freedom to do all these things, and he sometimes crossed the line of constitutional propriety, but as prince of Wales he was not bounded by it as the queen was.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth II dies at 96:King Charles III takes the throne\n\nCamilla and the shadow of Princess Diana\n\nThe first potential problem of Charles' reign – what to call his wife – has been mostly resolved by his mother: On the eve of her Accession Day, Feb. 6, 2022, she declared publicly in a message to her people that it was her \"sincere wish\" that Charles' second wife Camilla, 75, then the Duchess of Cornwall (instead of Princess of Wales), should be known as Queen Consort when her son succeeds.\n\nIt was what Charles had wanted from the day he married the former Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005 when it was announced that she would be known as Princess Consort when he became king. It was a gesture to the many still-angry partisans of the late Princess Diana, who blamed Camilla for breaking up her marriage to Charles.\n\nBy law and custom, Camilla would be Queen Consort anyway, and legislation would be required to go against Charles' wishes as king. But his mother provided for a smooth transition and reduced public carping by making clear her wishes in advance.\n\nThe late queen's endorsement of Camilla was crystal clear by January 2022 when she \"graciously\" appointed Camilla a Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter. Founded by Edward III in 1348, the prestigious Order of the Garter is the oldest and most senior British order of chivalry; the appointment was an unmistakable sign of the top royal's approval.\n\n\"It paves the way for the duchess to become not only queen by right when Prince Charles succeeds to the throne, but queen by name,\" wrote royal biographer Hugo Vickers in The Daily Mail at the time. \"There is no greater honor or better indication of the respect in which she is held by the queen.\"\n\nIt also means that Camilla will be crowned alongside Charles at his coronation.\n\nBut will Charles' low popularity ratings, still influenced in some quarters by his contentious 1996 divorce from Diana, the so-called \"War of the Waleses,\" hobble him? Unflattering pop-culture portrayals such as \"The Crown\" and \"Spencer\" don't help, says Bedell Smith.\n\n\"There will be a lot of people in media and on social media who want to undermine him,\" she says. \"The shadow of Diana, shockingly, hasn’t diminished in all these years. It will plague him for the rest of his life; it's baggage he's carrying unfairly but it’s there. The only thing he can do is sail on and do his job and try not to let it get to him.\"\n\nWhat happens to the other royals?King Charles III promises a new slimmed-down monarchy\n\nWhat are Charles' plans?\n\nCharles has made no secret of his desire to \"slim down\" the monarchy – reduce the number of working senior royals supported by taxpayers – and reduce the overall multimillion-pound annual cost of the royal show. There has been talk that he will perhaps open Buckingham Palace to paying tourists year-round (it's only open during the summer now) or by turning private royal residences, such as Balmoral Castle in Scotland, into museums.\n\nHis many causes (organic farming, architecture and urban planning, fighting climate change, to name a few) will not be abandoned but at least initially he will be too busy with routine matters, such as weekly meetings with the prime minister and going through the multiple red boxes of government documents he must read daily, Bedell Smith predicts.\n\nKing Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth:What to know about British royal line\n\n\"He will be more voluble in those meetings than his mother, he will offer more opinions which, fortunately, (ministers) don’t have to do anything about,\" Bedell Smith says. \"He will be less reserved in his meetings than his mother was but he won’t try in any way to directly influence government policy because the (unwritten British) constitution prohibits that.\"\n\nOf course, there is incremental change and then there is big, honking, alarm-bell change, and the difference is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nCharles, whose interest in religions other than the Church of England, once mused about altering his role as \"Defender of the Faith\" to \"Defender of Faith,\" to acknowledge the diversity of religions in modern Britain.\n\nBut that would require legislation in Parliament and would likely send the British establishment up the wall. After all, since 1701 it's been illegal for a British sovereign or spouse to be a Roman Catholic.\n\nInstead, Charles might choose a less controversial gesture, such as a more inclusive and ecumenical coronation featuring a more visible presence of other faiths, suggests Bedell Smith, who describes Charles as a \"spiritual questor\" since his school days in Scotland.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nCan Charles toe the line as a 'constitutional' king?\n\nMost of the speculation about the new king has focused on whether Charles would violate those prohibitions by being outspoken about political and other matters of public debate in a way his mother carefully avoided.\n\nAs prince of Wales, Charles was not always as scrupulous as his mother was, says Clive Irving, a longtime British journalist (former managing editor of the Sunday Times in London) and author of \"The Last Queen,\" a biography of Charles' mother that questions whether the monarchy can survive after her.\n\n\"She has always been neutral and apolitical, no one has caught her out on her political views and that is the difference between her and Charles – he can't help himself,\" says Irving. \"We know nothing about her views, we know an incredible amount about Charles' views. It's incredibly difficult to step into the shoes of (the queen's) kind of monarch.\"\n\nStill, says British journalist and royals commentator Anna Pasternak, Charles has learned important values from his mother, including deep loyalty to the monarchy and an \"unshakeable sense of duty.\" But she was no-nonsense and unemotional; he's more passionate, Pasternak says.\n\n\"One thing I’ve observed is that the more impassioned members of the royal family don’t tend to fare well,\" Pasternak says. \"If you have the stoicism that the queen (had), you do better, you’re able to put the role before your own character and your personal needs. Charles hasn’t been able to do that.\"\n\nWhat's the critical take on Charles?\n\nA frank critic of Charles, Irving describes him as a \"self-centered and narcissistic,\" having lived a coddled, entitled and privileged existence, an \"archaic-looking figure\" out of step with the times, and unused to being challenged.\n\n\"How can that kind of psychology possibly adapt to a completely different responsibility as head of state?\" Irving says. \"The magic of monarchy means something different to him, he interprets it through his own psychology.\"\n\nIrving predicts that the first year of Charles' reign will see the monarchy head \"over a cliff very fast\" amid disillusionment with the new king. \"She was brilliant at projecting classlessness – how can he possibly share the realities of our lives if he's never lived those realities?\"\n\nHowever privileged his upbringing, Charles has gone out of his way to demonstrate he cares about the less fortunate, especially through his charities, such as the Prince's Trust, which he founded in 1976 to help disadvantaged youths. The trust claims to have provided support to more than 1 million youths over the years.\n\nLast month, Charles served as editor of a special edition of the British African-Caribbean newspaper The Voice, the only national Black British newspaper operating in the U.K., which is marking its 40th anniversary this year. According to the palace, his edit celebrated the achievements of the Black community and reiterated Charles' collaborations with Black leaders and the work of his charities in those communities. (Charles' charities, his vast Duchy of Cornwall, and a host of other prince of Wales duties and activities will be taken over by his heir, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and other members of the family.)\n\nCharles also has attempted to push back against the criticism that he is too much a meddler to be a constitutional king. In an interview with the BBC for a documentary when he turned 70 in 2018, Charles made it clear he knows the rules and will follow them as king.\n\n\"I'm not that stupid,\" he snapped in the interview. \"I do realize that it is a separate exercise being sovereign, so of course, I understand entirely how that should operate.\" He should: He's been in training for this job since he was 4.\n\nCharles faces rare challenges\n\nCharles faces a challenge few other succeeding monarchs in British history have ever faced, a challenge not alleviated by his lower popularity ratings compared to his mother's, says Carolyn Harris, a historian and teacher at the University of Toronto and author of \"Raising Royalty: 1000 Years of Royal Parenting.\"\n\n\"When there is a long reign, the monarchy and the person as the monarch come to be seen as the same,\" Harris says. \"For many people, the queen is the only monarch they've ever known, so they closely associate the monarchy with her. The challenge is to step into that role when there's been a successful monarch in that role for decades.\"\n\nIrving says this transition could have been ameliorated had the queen abdicated or stepped aside before her death, allowing Charles to serve as prince regent for a period.

And the Queen’s moves to future-proof the monarchy reflects Camilla is no longer viewed as the royal mistress but a central figure in “the firm.”\n\nOn Saturday, Prince Charles and Camilla announced they were “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words” according to a spokesperson.\n\nElizabeth ascended to the throne on February 6, 1952, following the death of her father, King George VI, at the age of 56.\n\nThroughout her reign, Elizabeth has often used landmark moments to reaffirm her devotion to her duties, and did so once more in her message on Saturday, despite the fact she is nearing her 96th birthday.\n\n“As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in 1947 that my life will always be devoted to your service,” she said.\n\nThe Queen also expressed “a sense of hope and optimism” for the year ahead, before conveying her gratitude to her family for their support and paying tribute to her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n“I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign,” she shared.\n\nThe monarch ended her message by restating she looked forward “to continuing to serve you with all my heart” and shared her hope her jubilee would provide an opportunity for people to come together after the difficulties of recent years.\n\nTraditionally, the Queen marks her Accession Day at her countryside retreat of Sandringham in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London. It’s a chance for her to reflect upon the death of her father away from the glare of the public. In keeping with previous years, no public engagements are expected on Sunday.\n\nThe nation will have the chance to honor the monarch’s historic reign in a series of jubilee-themed festivities set to take place throughout the year, culminating in a blockbuster, four-day public holiday in June.\n\nOver the long weekend, beacons will be lit across the United Kingdom; Buckingham Palace will host a music concert; street parties are being encouraged; and a pageant will bring together more than 5,000 personnel, performers, key workers and volunteers from the UK and the Commonwealth.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Queen Elizabeth's history with US Presidents 02:00 - Source: CNN\n\nHowever, the Queen did host a special reception earlier Saturday for some Sandringham community members on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee.\n\nShe welcomed pensioners and representatives from several local charities to the Sandringham House ballroom to celebrate her historic milestone with cake.\n\nOne of those in attendance was former cookery student Angela Wood, who helped develop a recipe intrinsically linked to the start of her reign – Coronation Chicken, a dish of cold chicken in a curry cream sauce served with a side salad.\n\nThe Queen appeared to be in great spirits during the engagement, according to Britain’s PA Media news agency.

Agricultural accounts for half of the country’s total emissions, including 91% of its biogenic emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the global warming power of carbon dioxide in the short term.\n\nThe industry had previously been omitted from the country’s Emission Trading Scheme, a government regulatory body which sets limits on emissions by sector.\n\n“No other country in the world has yet developed a system for pricing and reducing agricultural emissions, so our farmers are set to benefit from being first movers,” Ardern said.\n\nBut farm groups are unconvinced and have raised concerns about the high costs this will impose on the industry. Andrew Morrison, chairman of farm lobby group Beef + Lamb New Zealand, said in an email to farmers on Tuesday, “we will not accept a system that disproportionately puts our farmers and communities at risk.”\n\nAndrew Hoggard, president of the rural advocacy agency Federated Farmers, said in a statement that the government’s plan will “rip the guts out of small town New Zealand.”\n\n“We didn’t sign up for this. It’s gut-wrenching to think we now have this proposal from government which rips the heart out of the work we did. Out of the families who farm this land,” he said. “Our plan was to keep farmers farming. Now they’ll be selling up so fast you won’t even hear the dogs barking on the back of the ute as they drive off.”\n\nHowever, the proposal hopes to incentivize farmers to reduce emissions without imposing damaging costs. In a statement, the government said the revenue raised will be “recycled back into the agriculture sector through new technology, research and incentive payments to farmers.”\n\nAlready some of this technology is being used. Researchers at dairy company Fonterra are trialing the effects of “Kowbucha,” a probiotic thought to reduce methane-emitting burps.\n\n“By rewarding farmers who take action to cut their emissions we can support more farmers to improve their productivity and profitability while achieving climate goals,” Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor said Tuesday.\n\nThe proposal will now go to a consultation, due to end in November this year.", "authors": ["Christian Edwards"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/10/11/new-zealand-tax-cow-burps-climate-change/10467071002/", "title": "New Zealand government wants to tax cow burps to fight climate ...", "text": "Nick Perry\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand – New Zealand's government on Tuesday proposed taxing the greenhouse gasses that farm animals make from burping and urinating as part of a plan to tackle climate change.\n\nThe government said the farm levy would be a world first, and that farmers should be able to recoup the cost by charging more for climate-friendly products.\n\nBut farmers quickly condemned the plan. Federated Farmers, the industry's main lobby group, said the plan would “rip the guts out of small-town New Zealand” and see farms replaced with trees.\n\nFederated Farmers President Andrew Hoggard said farmers had been trying to work with the government for more than two years on an emissions reduction plan that wouldn't decrease food production.\n\n“Our plan was to keep farmers farming,\" Hoggard said. Instead, he said farmers would be selling their farms “so fast you won’t even hear the dogs barking on the back of the ute (pickup truck) as they drive off.”\n\nOpposition lawmakers from the conservative ACT Party said the plan would actually increase worldwide emissions by moving farming to other countries that were less efficient at making food.\n\nNew Zealand’s farming industry is vital to its economy. Dairy products, including those used to make infant formula in China, are the nation’s largest export earner.\n\nThere are just 5 million people in New Zealand but some 10 million beef and dairy cattle and 26 million sheep.\n\nThe outsized industry has made New Zealand unusual in that about half of its greenhouse gas emissions come from farms. Farm animals produce gasses that warm the planet, particularly methane from cattle burps and nitrous oxide from their urine.\n\nThe debate in New Zealand is part of a broader global reckoning about farming's impact on the environment and the steps some say are needed for mitigation.\n\nYosemite in peril:How climate change’s grip is altering America’s national parks\n\nTrees can't outrun climate change: Should humans give them a lift?\n\nIn the Netherlands, farmers have dumped hay bales on roads and driven tractors along busy highways to protest government proposals to slash emissions of damaging pollutants.\n\nIn New Zealand, the government has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make the country carbon neutral by 2050. Part of that plan includes a pledge that it will reduce methane emissions from farm animals by 10% by 2030 and by up to 47% by 2050.\n\nUnder the government's proposed plan, farmers would start to pay for emissions in 2025, with the pricing yet to be finalized.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said all the money collected from the proposed farm levy would be put back into the industry to fund new technology, research and incentive payments for farmers.\n\n“New Zealand's farmers are set to be the first in the world to reduce agricultural emissions, positioning our biggest export market for the competitive advantage that brings in a world increasingly discerning about the provenance of their food,\" Ardern said.\n\nAgriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said it was an exciting opportunity for New Zealand and its farmers.\n\n“Farmers are already experiencing the impact of climate change with more regular drought and flooding,” O'Connor said. “Taking the lead on agricultural emissions is both good for the environment and our economy.”\n\nThe liberal Labour government's proposal harks back to a similar but unsuccessful proposal made by a previous Labour government in 2003 to tax farm animals for their methane emissions.\n\nFarmers back then also vehemently opposed the idea, and political opponents ridiculed it as a “fart tax” – although a “burp tax” would have been more technically accurate as most of the methane emissions come from belching. The government eventually abandoned the plan.\n\nAccording to opinion polls, Ardern’s Labour Party has slipped in popularity and fallen behind the main opposition National Party since Ardern won a second term in 2020 in a landslide victory of historic proportions.\n\nIf Ardern's government can't find agreement on the proposal with farmers, who have considerable political sway in New Zealand, it's likely to make it more difficult for Ardern to win reelection next year when the nation goes back to the polls.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}]}

The higher prices make wheat more expensive for food makers, who will likely pass those costs on to consumers.\n\nUkraine and Russia together are responsible for about 14% of global wheat production, according to Gro Intelligence, an agricultural data analytics firm. The two countries supply about 29% of all wheat exports. Prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine was on track for a record year of wheat exports, while Russia’s wheat exports were slowing, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\n“This could not come have come in the worse time,” said Robb MacKie, president and CEO of American Bakers Association.\n\nWith wheat prices already on the rise, the conflict abroad is placing even more pressure on a still ailing supply chain. Russia is the top exporter or wheat, while Ukraine is in the top 5. The two counties compete in export markets like Egypt, Turkey, and Bangladesh.\n\n“Depending on how this comes out and how long it goes, wheat farmers [in Ukraine] may not be able to plant spring wheat, corn and other things. So, they might go a year without any crops,” MacKie added.\n\nThat will likely push prices on US consumer items like cereal and bread higher. Cereal and baked goods were up 6.8% in the last year because of inflation, according to the US Labor Department. Consumer prices usually lag market prices of wheat, corn, grain – as these commodity prices are contracted in advance. That means the impact may not be felt for weeks or months.\n\nRussia’s actions also have caused a major disruption to Ukrainian ports, hobbling the export market.\n\n“You’ve got all kinds of logistical restrictions,” said Jim Heneghan, SVP of Agribusiness at Gro Intelligence. For example, “Ukrainian ports [are] closed to commercial traffic,” Heneghan said. And there also are reports of commercial ships being attacked.\n\nThe disruptions are tightening global wheat supplies, even as demand stays the same or spikes. And with less supply, prices are rising even more than they have during the pandemic.\n\nGlobal food prices rose as much as 28% in 2021, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Supply chain disruptions and extreme weather contributed to the higher prices.\n\nThe current situation “is just adding to additional food price inflation that we’ve been witnessing,” Heneghan said.\n\nUS food prices are not immune\n\nMost US consumer brands don’t rely on imported ingredients, said Katie Denis, who leads communications and research for the Consumer Brands Association, a US trade group.\n\n“For the US market, we only import about 8% of the total stuff needed for the [consumer packaged goods] industry,” she said. “It’s pretty minimal.” Most imported items come from Mexico and Canada, she added.\n\nHigher wheat prices are good news for US farmers, as more demand could shift to the US. Even so, although US companies may not have direct exposure to disruptions in Ukraine, they aren’t immune from them, either. “This is a global economy,” Denis said. “The pricing pressure will be something felt across the entire world.”\n\nGro Intellligence’s Heneghan said that as global supply tightens, US wheat farmers could export more product. “A lot of times, you’ll see the demand come back to the US … when you have global events that shut down exportable surpluses,” he said. “But it comes at a higher price.”\n\nThat could be good news for US farmers, he added, but not for consumers.\n\nWheat grows in a field near Uzhhorod, in the Zakarpattia region of Western Ukraine, in July 2020. Ukrinform/Shutterstock\n\n“Over the next few months, you’ll see what food companies … will have to do with the higher prices they’re having to contend with,” Heneghan said. Food and consumer goods producers may choose to absorb some of the price hikes, but they are more likely to continue to pass them onto consumers, he noted.\n\nThe producer price index, which tracks average price changes America’s producers get paid for their goods and services, rose 9.7% in the 12 months ended in January, not adjusted for seasonal swings, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in February.\n\nAnd they’re likely to raise prices further as input costs rise, Heneghan said, especially because wheat isn’t the only crop that’s getting more expensive.\n\nOther agricultural commodity prices are going up, such as corn and soybeans, not to mention oil. “It’s going to give [consumer goods makers] even more reason to think about moving forward with those price increases,” Heneghan said.\n\nCNN’s Anneken Tappe and Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner Vanessa Yurkevich", "Danielle Wiener-Bronner", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/homes/slowing-housing-market/index.html", "title": "5 signs the housing market is starting to slow down | CNN Business", "text": "There is a shift happening in the housing market.\n\nAfter more than a year of soaring demand, exploding home prices and increasing real estate sales, the market finally seems to be cooling off.\n\n“The housing market isn’t crashing, but it is experiencing a hangover as it comes down from an unsustainable high,” said Taylor Marr, Redfin deputy chief economist.\n\nMortgage rates have increased more than two and a half percentage points this year. And the higher costs of financing a home have changed the calculations for many would-be homebuyers. As a result, year-over-year home sales have been dropping in recent months.\n\nIn a Fannie Mae survey on homebuyer sentiment, a record 79% of respondents said it’s a bad time to buy a home.\n\n“While a lot of home sellers are already dropping their prices, more homeowners will likely decide to stay put now that the mortgage rate on a new home is significantly higher than their current one,” said Marr.\n\nWhile the market is still very strong by historical standards, here are five reasons to believe the tide is turning.\n\n1. The inventory of homes for sale is growing\n\nWith demand for homes outstripping supply, the inventory of homes for sale had been consistently declining year-over-year during the pandemic housing boom, said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “We were talking about low inventory in 2019 and it kept getting worse.”\n\nBut in May the inventory started moving in a different direction, according to Realtor.com’s data, and the most recent week saw active listings up 13% from last year.\n\n“Seeing the number of homes increase is great news for buyers,” said Hale. “It shifts the trend and they are seeing more homes. It should help balance the market, slowing down home price growth and increasing the time on the market.”\n\nIn addition to the high costs pushing prospective buyers out of the market, part of the reason there are more listings is that more homeowners are deciding to sell, Hale said. More new listings entered the market in May than any other month since June 2019, according to Realtor.com.\n\n“But home prices are showing a lot of sticking power,” said Hale. “Price growth is going to slow, but I expect prices to stay high. If home sellers can’t get the price they want, they are likely to not put it on the market.”\n\n2. More price cuts\n\nIf you’ve been looking at homes you may be noticing something you haven’t seen in a long time: price cuts.\n\nFor a while homes were selling so quickly, and often with bidding wars, that sellers would commonly get more than they asked for. But as affordability challenges squeeze buyers and there is less competition to buy, some sellers are deciding to lower their price.\n\nPrice cuts were seen in 10.5% of homes in May, up from 6.2% in May of 2021, according to Realtor.com.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean there’s a liquidation sale on houses.\n\n“The share of homes with price reductions is higher now, but May’s share is still lower than every May going back to 2017,” Hale said. “It is less competitive than last year, but it is still pretty competitive.”\n\n3. Real estate companies are laying people off\n\nWith less activity in the housing market, real estate companies are announcing layoffs.\n\nThis week Redfin said it cut about 8% of its employees and Compass said it would reduce its workforce by 10%.\n\nDemand for Redfin’s services in May was 17% below expectations, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said. As a result, the company isn’t generating enough work for agents and support staff.\n\n“Today’s layoff is the result of shortfalls in Redfin’s revenues, not in the people being let go,” he said.\n\nAt Compass, 450 of its 4,500 employees will be cut, “due to the clear signals of slowing economic growth,” according to a company statement.\n\nThese cuts follow other contractions in the real estate industry as the red hot housing market has begun to smolder.\n\n4. Mortgage applications are down\n\nAs mortgage rates have spiked, would-be homebuyers are applying for fewer loans.\n\nIn the week ending June 10, mortgage purchase applications were down 16% from a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\n“Purchase applications were down compared to last year, as ongoing inventory shortages and affordability challenges have cooled demand, coinciding with the rapid jump in mortgage rates,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting.\n\nWith mortgage rates well above 5%, refinance activity that was on fire when rates were at rock bottom during the pandemic has dried up, running more than 70% lower than last year.\n\n5. Fewer people are shopping for homes\n\nWith prices so high and mortgage rates still climbing, fewer people seem to be shopping for homes right now.\n\nAn index from Redfin that assesses homebuyer demand – by measuring the requests for home tours and other home-buying services from Redfin agents – was down 14% year-over-year during the week ending on June 12. This was the ninth consecutive week of declines in the index.\n\n“If it weren’t for the surge in mortgage rates, the housing market would still be in a boom right now,” said James Cappello, a Redfin agent in the Bay Area. “Demand from homebuyers was still extremely high as recently as February, but rates are making it really tough. Going from 3% to nearly 6% almost instantly has scared a lot of people out of the market.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/business/palm-oil-indonesia-export-ban-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Palm oil: Indonesia export ban could send prices soaring | CNN ...", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN Business) Indonesia will start restricting exports of palm oil this week, a move that could make the global food crisis worse and push up the prices of hundreds of consumer products.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo announced Friday that Indonesia would suspend exports of cooking oil, and the raw materials used to make it, \"until further notice,\" in a bid to secure local supplies.

That would fuel inflation, just as global food prices hit all-time highs.\n\nWhat is palm oil?\n\nPalm oil is a common ingredient found in many of the world's food, cosmetics and household items.

Ukraine is typically a major producer of sunflower oil, but that has been \"completely messed up by Russia,\" said Fry.\n\n\"We've got the perfect storm,\" he added, noting that other factors, such as droughts in South America and Canada, had also constrained supplies of soybean oil and canola oil, respectively.\n\nWhy is Indonesia taking this step?\n\nIndonesia's leader, also known as \"Jokowi,\" said in a statement Friday that the decision to ban exports was to \"ensure the national availability of cooking oil\" and help keep it affordable.\n\nIndonesians have had trouble getting access to the kitchen staple as global palm oil prices surged, leading the government to roll out cash subsidies, according to Antara , Indonesia's state news agency.\n\nThe country had already taken other steps to protect local supplies.

According to its report, \"war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils.\"\n\nThe most recent FAO Food Price Index — which measures the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities — was 33.6% higher than in March 2021.\n\nIn their report Friday, JPMorgan analysts said that Indonesia's export ban was \"adding fuel to the fire.\"\n\n\"This is yet another reminder of the vulnerability present across agricultural supply chains in an environment of already historically tight inventories, compounded by the indefinite loss of Ukrainian export volumes and historically high production costs,\" they wrote.\n\nIn a way, the world had been relying on palm oil from Indonesia \"to fill the gap\" left by other disruptions — \"and Indonesia suddenly blocked that flow,\" Fry said.\n\n— Anna Cooban, Claudia Dominguez, Livvy Doherty, Chris Liakos, Julia Horowitz and Jorge Engels contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/business/dairy-farmers-food-inflation/index.html", "title": "Milk prices: Why you could be paying 50% more this year | CNN ...", "text": "Prices are rising at the fastest pace in decades, creating a cost-of-living crisis that’s forcing people around the world to make tough choices about what to buy.\n\nThe United Kingdom is no exception: inflation hit a 40-year high of 9% in April and is forecast to peak above 10% toward the end of this year. The high cost of fuel and heating is just part of the problem. Food prices have also leaped, climbing nearly 7% compared with a year ago, according to data released Wednesday.\n\nA big part of the problem is the soaring price of dairy products. The cost of milk, cheese and eggs — supermarket staples — shot up 9.5% in the 12 months to April. The price of whole milk rose more than 12%.\n\nIn the United States, wholesale milk prices jumped 38% last month year-over-year, while the retail price of fresh whole milk was up 15%.\n\nThere could be more pain to come, according to a recent analysis by Kite Consulting, which specializes in the UK dairy industry. Between 2020 and 2021, a standard four-pint carton of milk cost between £1.10 ($1.36) and £1.20 ($1.49). This year, it could reach £1.70 ($2.11), the consultancy said. That would mark an increase of more than 50% from the bottom end of the range.\n\nWhy the dramatic spike? It partly comes down to supply and demand. Covid-19 drove up the price of many goods as lockdowns distorted global supply chains. This weighed on milk production, as farmers dealt with more expensive fertilizer and animal feed as well as new environmental rules. Meanwhile, the appetite for dairy products, especially in developing countries, grew during the recovery.\n\nThen came the invasion of Ukraine, which further scrambled access to products like wheat, fertilizer and fuel, hiking costs for dairy farmers once again.\n\n“The war is the thing that’s causing the major problem at present,” Kite Consulting managing partner John Allen said.\n\nA customer shops for food items inside a Tesco supermarket store in east London. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe price of fertilizer\n\nOne of the biggest problems is the spiking price of nitrogen-based fertilizers, which are essential to dairy farming.\n\n“If you look at April 2022 compared to April 2021, you see fertilizer prices almost four times where they were before,” Robert Craig, who runs three dairy farms in northern England with about 1,500 cows.\n\nIf farmers cut back on how much fertilizer they use, they can’t grow enough grass to feed their cows while they graze. A recent lack of rain in England is making the problem even worse.\n\nJessica Langton, who helps run a family farm in Derbyshire with 100 cattle, is concerned.\n\n“We get the majority of our income from milk, so we need to be producing a large amount of grass to feed [cows] through the summer and the winter,” she said. Milk from her family’s farm is used to make cheddar cheese.\n\nLangton noted that a lot of other farms also rely on fertilizer to grow wheat, maize and barley to feed their cows. If they can’t produce enough, they could be forced to sell some of the herd, either to slaughter or to other dairy farmers.\n\nFertilizer prices were increasing before the invasion of Ukraine because of a spike in natural gas prices last year. Nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea and ammonium nitrate are produced from natural gas.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine made matters worse. Russia and its ally Belarus are major exporters of fertilizer, but few buyers want to touch their supply now. An estimated 18% of the UK’s urea comes from Russia and 7% of its ammonium nitrate, according to Independent Commodity Intelligence Services.\n\n“Russia is such a big exporter of fertilizer, and they have so many sanctions,” said ICIS analyst Deepika Thapliyal. “That’s going to keep supply very tight.”\n\nThe price of fuel and animal feed\n\nEnergy prices aren’t just a factor in fertilizer production. Fuel is also essential to running a farm, where tractors and other machines can run for between 16 and 20 hours a day.\n\nLangton estimates that the cost of the diesel her family uses has more than doubled compared to last year.\n\nHeifers feed in a barn at a farm in Ashford, Kent. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe price of animal feed for cows, which supplements their diets, has surged, too. The UK’s National Farmers’ Union estimates that feed prices have climbed by 70% over the past two years.\n\nBefore the war, Russia and Ukraine accounted for more than a quarter of global wheat exports. But the disruption caused by Russia’s blockades at Ukrainian ports sent prices to an all-time high in March. They’ve since come down slightly but remain extremely elevated, rising again in recent days as India banned exports.\n\nWheat, along with maize and soy, serves as a benchmark for feed prices, Allen of Kite Consulting said.\n\nCraig, the farmer, said that Ukraine produces the “vast majority” of feed for organic dairy cows in the United Kingdom. Now, that product is practically inaccessible.\n\nHow it shakes out\n\nIt’s not a given that grocery stores will hike milk and other dairy prices in line with dramatic forecasts. Stores are wary of raising the price of essential items too much, lest they scare away customers.\n\n“Some retailers will be prepared to take a much lower margin, if not potentially small losses, [to] make [sure] people come through the door,” said Tom Holder, a spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium. “No one wants to go to the supermarket that has the high-priced milk.”\n\nBut farmers like Langton and Craig worry that the dynamics hurting their businesses aren’t going away. Many have to contend with rising labor and transportation costs, too.\n\n“There’s literally nobody to employ. You advertise jobs and there’s very little response,” said Craig. Two of his farms produce milk for cheese. Milk from the third farm is dried and used in a cappuccino mix made by Nestlé (NSRGY).\n\nKite Consulting estimates that total costs of production for dairy farmers will rise by 29% from 2021 to early 2023. Government subsidies, meanwhile, are dropping, making it even harder to break even.\n\n“If we don’t see the milk price increasing alongside hyperinflation, we could see a lot of dairy farms exiting the industry across the UK,” Langton said, referring to the price at which her family can sell its milk to processors.\n\nRising food costs will hit poorer households the hardest. About a quarter of Britons have already skipped meals in response to the cost-of-living crisis, according to a survey published by Ipsos this week. That number rises to one in three for people with lower incomes.\n\nDavid Beasley, head of the United Nations World Food Programme, has warned that rising food prices will cause social unrest in some parts of the world.\n\nAs prices are pushed higher to help farmers stay in business, demand is expected to begin to fall off, allowing the market to rebalance itself. But when that moment will arrive remains an anxiety-inducing unknown.\n\n“I don’t think it’s too expensive yet,” Kite Consulting’s Allen said.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/business/companies-pulling-back-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Companies pulling back from Russia over the war in Ukraine | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nDozens of the world’s biggest companies have abandoned or scaled back their operations in Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exodus affects every corner of the economy, from its vast energy riches through autos, finance, retail, entertainment and fast food, starving Russia of new investment and removing products and services that had become popular in the decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHere’s a look at the major corporate departures.\n\nAutos\n\nFord (F) announced it was suspending its operations in Russia.

We are a purpose-led and values-driven organization that believes in doing the right thing.”\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is also planning to break away from its Russian business.\n\n“As a result of the Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine we have decided that, under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network,” the “Big Four” consultancy said in a statement.\n\n“Our main focus at PwC continues to be doing all we can to help our Ukrainian colleagues and support the humanitarian efforts,” it added.\n\n“We are also committed to working with our colleagues at PwC Russia to undertake an orderly transition for the business, and with a focus on the wellbeing of our 3,700 colleagues in PwC Russia.”\n\nEnergy and metals\n\nBP said it was planning to exit its 19.75% stake in Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft, and suspending their joint ventures — which amount to one of the biggest foreign investments in Russia.\n\nEquinor will also begin to exit its joint ventures in Russia, the Norwegian oil and gas company announced.\n\n“We are all deeply troubled by the invasion of Ukraine, which represents a terrible setback for the world,” said CEO Anders Opedal.\n\nThe company said it had $1.2 billion in long-term investments in Russia at the end of 2021.

Employees will still be paid.\n\nBurger King said it is pulling corporate support from its businesses in Russia. Restaurant Brands International, which owns the burger chain, said it “has suspended all of its corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing and supply chain.” That doesn’t necessarily mean that Burger King restaurants will be closed in Russia, however, as the company said the chain’s roughly 800 locations there are “fully franchised and managed by a local master franchisee.” This means that the company cannot simply pull the plug on those restaurants as other brands such as McDonald’s have done.\n\nCoca-Cola (COKE) said that it is “suspending its business in Russia.” The company stated that “our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” adding that it will monitor the situation as things change.\n\nHeineken will stop producing and selling beer in Russia.

The company said the conflict is having a “huge human impact” and is “resulting in serious disruptions to supply chain and trading conditions.” In addition to pausing its retail and manufacturing operations in Russia, it will suspend all trade with the country and its ally, Belarus.\n\nIkea said 15,000 workers would be directly affected by the shutdown in the region. The company will continue to pay them, at least for the time being.\n\nImperial Brands (IMBBY), one of the world’s largest tobacco players, will sell off its Russian business.\n\nThe company behind Winston and Gauloises cigarettes says its operations in Russia comprise 1,000 employees in sales and marketing, as well as a factory in the city of Volgograd.\n\nImperial will “continue to pay their salaries until any transfer is concluded,” it said in a statement.\n\nInditex, the parent company of Zara, said it is pausing operations in Russia and closing 502 stores in the country. In a statement, the company said Russia accounts for about 8.5% of its earnings before interest and tax.\n\nMothercare is suspending business in Russia and stopping shipments there.\n\n“Our local partner has confirmed that it will be immediately pausing operations in some 120 stores and online,” it said on March 9.\n\nRussia accounts for around 20% to 25% of sales for the retailer, which specializes in goods for parents and babies.\n\nMondelez (MDLZ) said it would scale back all non-essential activities in Russia “while helping maintain continuity of the food supply.” The company said it would focus on “basic offerings,” and discontinue all new capital investments and suspend a advertising spending in the country.\n\nGerman sports company Puma said it is suspending operations of all of its stores in Russia. The company said it operates more than 100 stores in the country.\n\nLuxury fashion house Prada is suspending its retail operations in Russia.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) CEO Jon Moeller said in a letter to employees on March 7 that the company has “discontinued all new capital investments in Russia” and is “suspending all media, advertising, and promotional activity.”\n\n“We are significantly reducing our product portfolio to focus on basic health, hygiene and personal care items needed by the many Russian families who depend on them in their daily lives,” Moeller said. “As we proceed with the reduced scale of our Russian operations, we will continue to adjust as necessary.”\n\nUnilever (UL) said it will “continue to supply our everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia to people in the country,” adding “we will keep this under close review.” But the company noted it is has suspended imports of its products to Russia and is stopping all investment in the country, in addition to stopping exports from there. It said it won’t profit from its presence in Russia.\n\nShipping goods\n\nUPS and FedEx have suspended operations in Russia and Belarus. FedEx said it suspended operations to “support the people of Ukraine.” DHL said it has suspended inbound shipments to Russia and Belarus.\n\nMaersk and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company are both halting cargo bookings with Russia.\n\n“As the stability and safety of our operations is already being directly and indirectly impacted by sanctions, new Maersk bookings to and from Russia will be temporarily suspended, with exception of foodstuffs, medical and humanitarian supplies,” the Denmark-based company said in a statement.\n\n“We are deeply concerned by how the crisis keeps escalating in Ukraine,” the company added.\n\nMSC, a Swiss-owned container shipping line, said its suspension would cover “all access areas, including Baltics, Black Sea and Far East Russia.”\n\nTransportation\n\nFrench train maker Alstom said that it will “suspend all deliveries towards Russia” in a statement on March 9.\n\nThe group is also suspending all future business investments in Russia, it added.\n\nAlstom owns a 20% stake — as a capital investment — in Transmashholding (TMH), the Russian locomotives and rail equipment provider.\n\n“There was no material business nor operational link between Alstom and TMH,” the company said. “The book value will be re-assessed as part of the fiscal year 2021/22 closing accounts.”\n\n— Rishi Iyengar, Michelle Toh, Diksha Madhok, Chris Isidore, Vanessa Yurkevich, Paul P.

Now it’s $4.31. Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans.”\n\nOil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too.\n\n\n\nLast time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it’s $4.31.\n\n\n\nOil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans. pic.twitter.com/uLNGleWBly — President Biden (@POTUS) March 16, 2022\n\nThe administration’s focus on the intricacies of energy prices shows the level of frustration inside the White House with one of the central drivers of high inflation.\n\nGas prices skyrocketed to record highs last week, following a spike in crude oil to levels unseen since 2008.\n\nPrices at the gas pump are going down – but only very gradually. The national average for regular gas dipped to $4.31 a gallon on Wednesday, according to AAA. That’s down a penny from Tuesday and two pennies from Monday.\n\nThat’s despite the fact that Brent oil collapsed by 28% between the March 6 intraday peak and Tuesday’s close.\n\n‘It just seems to take a long time’\n\nThis is nothing new. The industry even has a nickname for this practice: Rockets and feathers.\n\n“This has been going on for 40 years,” Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, told CNN. “Prices do dip, it just seems to take a long time. You can’t deny the data that is out there.”\n\nOld or new, Biden isn’t a fan, especially after observing this phenomenon last fall when gas prices retreated slowly after the administration released emergency oil reserves and Omicron hit.\n\n“Try explaining how it’s just rockets and feathers to President Biden, and you’d better be ready to hear, ‘That’s a bunch of malarkey’ coming back at you,” a senior White House official told CNN. “The president is very much within his rights to point out that if you’re going to have rockets on the way up, you need to have rockets on the way down, not feathers.”\n\nBut it may be unreasonable to say pump prices should change instantly just because oil prices do. It takes time for price swings to filter through the supply chain.\n\nA gas station owner may be selling fuel today that was purchased days earlier when oil prices were much higher. (That’s especially true in today’s extremely volatile market.)\n\n“Don’t get me wrong. There would be some lag,” Lipow said. “What if I was the guy who just bought my tanker load yesterday and the next two days crude oil dropped?”\n\nTom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, said gas stations have little choice but to pass along the impact of higher oil prices on the way up because of the pressure on their profit margins.\n\n“And on the way down, It’s like, ‘We’ll be as patient as we can,’” Kloza said. “They will fall, but at a much slower pace.”\n\nJoe Brusuelas, chief economist at consulting firm RSM, noted that gasoline prices are a function of past purchases and expectations around the cost of future deliveries – and there is vast uncertainty right now about the direction of oil prices.\n\n“Criticism of price setting at gasoline stations is somewhat misguided,” Bruseulas said.\n\n$1,300 hit to households\n\nThere are real economic consequences here.\n\nEvery 10-cent increase in the price of gasoline costs consumers at least $11 billion over the course of a year, according to Moody’s Analytics.\n\nGas prices have surged over the past year and a half, and at the end of last week, they stood about $1.50 a gallon higher than the 2019 average. If prices stay this high, consumers will pay $165 billion more over the course of 2022 than they did in 2019, according to Moody’s Analytics.\n\nPut another way: Annual average spending on gasoline would climb by roughly $1,300 per US household, Moody’s told CNN.\n\nThe senior White House official suggested gas station owners are not passing along savings to consumers as quickly as they could.\n\n“This is using price power in a way that is not particularly fair from the perspective of the consumer,” the official told CNN.\n\nGasBuddy’s Patrick De Haan said earlier this week the gas price drop should accelerate if oil stays below $100 a barrel.\n\n“Stations lost their shirt on the way up, but now margins are improving and they will start passing the discounts on to you,” De Haan wrote on Twitter.\n\n‘Uneven’ link between oil and gas prices\n\nOf course, the oil industry was in deep distress just two years ago. Oil prices crashed, with US crude turning negative for the first time ever, driving gasoline prices dramatically lower.\n\nThe National Association of Convenience Stores, a trade group that represents the fuel retailing industry, acknowledged in a blog post Wednesday that retailers might not immediately slash prices after an oil rally “to make up for the margin they lost during the price increase.”\n\n“On any given day, retailers don’t know where wholesale prices could be heading, so they try to recapture lost margin as quickly as possible—because they don’t know if wholesale prices may rise and margins could tighten,” the NACS said in the post.\n\nThe industry group also pointed out that one complicating factor is that the fuels industry is currently going through its annual government-mandated transition to summer-blend fuels.\n\n“Retailers want lower gas prices just as much as their customers,” the NACS said. “When prices are low, consumers have more disposable income to make in-store purchases. They’re also happier, which is also good for business.”\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, the trade group representing the oil and gas industry, said in a statement that retail prices in many industries go down slower than they go up.\n\n“On gas prices, the American people are looking for solutions, not finger pointing,” said Frank Macchiarola, API’s senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs.\n\nThere is some academic research that supports the argument from the White House.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis published a report in 2014 pointing out there is an “uneven” relationship to how oil prices impact gas prices. That report was based on a review of academic work measuring the so-called pass-through of oil and gasoline.\n\n“When oil prices rise after being steady for some time – gasoline prices shoot up quickly,” the Fed paper said. “In contrast, when oil prices fall after being steady for some time, gasoline prices retreat slowly.”\n\nWho owns the gas?\n\nBiden’s focus on this issue comes after House Democrats wrote a letter last week urging Congressional leadership to immediately investigate and hold hearings on “alleged price gouging within the oil and gas industry.”\n\nDemocrats also introduced a Big Oil Windfalls Profit Tax that would aim to “curb profiteering” by oil companies.\n\nAlthough gas stations are often emblazoned with the logo of a major oil producer like Exxon or Shell, they are often owned and operated by independent retailers. Gas station owners are licensed to represent that household brand.\n\nFor example, ExxonMobil (XOM) says it does not own or operate retail gas stations in the United States, even though there are countless Exxon and Mobil gas stations throughout the country. As of the end of 2020, Exxon listed nearly 11,000 distributor sites in the US.\n\nOil refiners own less than 5% of the nation’s roughly 150,000 retail gas stations, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Many gas stations are owned by an individual or a family, while others fall under a corporate entity that owns hundreds.\n\nAt the end of the day, Kloza said people who can wait before buying gas will benefit.\n\n“If you can hold off five days to fill up your tank, you will get a lower price,” Kloza said.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/business/self-checkout-retail/index.html", "title": "Nobody likes self-checkout.

Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.\n\n“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.\n\nCustomers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it, too.\n\nSelf-checkout is everywhere, despite its issues. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe machines are expensive to install, often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.\n\nDespite the headaches, self-checkout is growing.\n\nIn 2020, 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout, up from 23% the year prior, according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.\n\nThis raises the question: why is this often problematic, unloved technology taking over retail?\n\nMaking customers do the work\n\nThe introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers, a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.\n\nInstead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers, Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles, pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work, the model promised lower prices.\n\nShoppers at Piggly Wiggly, the first self-service supermarket, in 1918. Library of Congress/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nSelf-checkout, however, was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66%, according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.\n\nThe first modern self-checkout system, which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores, would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.\n\nCustomers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.\n\nThe technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.\n\nBut self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.\n\nIt took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets, which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.\n\nWalmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The rationale was economics based, and not focused on the customer,” Charlebois said. “From the get go, customers detested them.”\n\nA 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay,” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”\n\nThe mixed response led some grocery chains, including Costco (COST), Albertsons and others, to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.\n\n“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes, coupons, payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions,” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.\n\nWalkaways\n\nThe move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.\n\nRetailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision, said Christopher Andrews, a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”\n\nStores have challenges with self-checkout, including higher levels of theft. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers, they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs, he said.\n\nSelf-checkout, Andrews added, “delivers none of what it promises.”\n\nIn the biggest headache for store owners, self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.\n\n“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout, losses would be 77% higher” than average, according to Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.\n\nCustomers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.\n\nSome products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce, including fruit and meat, typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.\n\n“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably,” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”\n\nOther customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item, swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak), scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.\n\nStores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features, such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors, requiring store employees to intervene.\n\n“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience,” Beck said.\n\nSelf-checkout is here to stay\n\nDespite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners, the trend is only growing.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.\n\nIt may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.\n\nAmazon has developed cashier-less Go stores. Other retailers are trying to jump in on the trend. Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nStores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers, even though there’s little evidence to support that. But, because customers are doing the work, rather than waiting in line, the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.\n\nStore owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line 02:22 - Source: CNN Business\n\n“It’s an arms race. If everyone else is doing it, you look like an idiot if you don’t have it,” said David D’Arezzo, a former executive at Dollar General, Wegmans and other retailers. “Once you let it out of the bag, it’s pretty difficult not to offer it anymore.”\n\nCovid-19 has also hastened the spread of self-checkout.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many customers opted for self-service to avoid close interactions with cashiers and baggers.

It’s costing them tons of money to store it.\n\nNow add on to that glut another category of product that stores have to deal with: returns.\n\nSo instead of piling returned merchandise onto this growing inventory heap, stores are considering just handing customers their money back and letting them hang onto the stuff they don’t want.\n\ngoTRG processes more than 100 million units of returned items annually. Stephen Ironside/goTRG\n\n“It would be a smart strategic initiative,” said Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. “Retailers are stuck with excess inventory of unprecedented levels. They can’t afford to take back even more of it.”\n\nReturned products are handled in a number of different ways, he said. Retailers take back merchandise from the customer, evaluate it, and if it’s in good condition put it back on the shelf at the same or lesser price.\n\nThey can refurbish damaged returns and sell them for less or offload them to liquidators to resell. They also can sell returned products to foreign liquidators for sale in Europe, Canada or Mexico.\n\n“Given the situation at the ports and the container shortages, sending product overseas isn’t really an option,” said Flickinger. Lastly, retailers can hire third party firms to handle all aspect of merchandise returns for them.\n\nEach of these options, however, tack on additional costs for retailers, he said.\n\n“For every dollar in sales, a retailer’s net profit is between a cent to five cents. With returns, for every dollar in returned merchandise, it costs a retailer between 15 cents to 30 cents to handle it,” said Flickinger.\n\nThere is one other option for retailers to address returns while avoiding more product bloat and that’s to consider a ‘returnless return,’ said Steve Rop, chief operating officer with goTRG, a firm that processes over 100 million returned items annually for companies like Wal-Mart, Amazon and Lowe’s.\n\nJust keep it\n\nRop said his company’s clients are 100% considering offering the “keep it” option for returns this year, although he wouldn’t disclose if any of his customers have implemented the “Keep it” returns policy yet.\n\nIn some instances, when they determine it would be easier, some retailers advise customers to just keep or donate their return after issuing a refund. Walmart said it had nothing to share at this time. Lowe’s didn’t provide a comment for the story.\n\n“They’re already discounting in stores to clear out products but, when there’s heavy discounting, buyer’s remorse goes up. People are tempted to buy a lot to only return it later,” he said.\n\nThe goTRG's facility in Bentonville, Arkansas stores a variety of returned general merchandise and consumer electronics. Stephen Ironside/goTRG\n\nRefunding customers while simultaneously letting them keep their returns isn’t a new practice, said Rop. “It started with Amazon several years ago,” he said.\n\nThe offer makes sense for some types of products – lower price-tier bulky items like furniture, kitchen appliances, home decor, baby chairs, walkers, strollers where it’s costly for the retailer to cover the shipping cost for the return.\n\n“Other products like kids’ toys, footwear, towels and bedding raise sanitary concerns when it comes to returns. It could also apply to these categories,” he said.\n\nAnother concern with cheaper items: Stores typically discount returned products, so the amount of money they can make on an inexpensive return is miniscule – and may not be worth the tradeoff, says Keith Daniels, partner with Carl Marks Advisors.\n\nStill, a “keep it” policy has its own disadvantages, namely: Companies will need to ensure that they don’t become victims of fraud.\n\n“One thing retailers need to track and ensure is that customers that become aware of the [Keep it] policy do not begin to abuse it, by seeking free merchandise over a series of orders by getting a refund but getting to keep the merchandise,” said Daniels.", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/22/business/inflation-roundup-orange-juice-laundry-cars-gas/index.html", "title": "What's getting more expensive | CNN Business", "text": "New York, NY CNN —\n\nInflation and supply chain snags have sent prices for everyday items soaring, from Tide laundry detergent to new cars. Here’s what CNN Business found got more expensive this week, and what might be next.\n\nOrange juice\n\nA combination of short supply and high demand has sent orange prices soaring. Frozen orange juice futures have risen by 50% over the course of the pandemic, reaching a two-year high Thursday. Citrus disease and bad weather are constraining orange crops in the U.S. and globally. And then there’s just plain bad timing, as demand for orange juice had been dipping for the past few years, but experienced a spike during the pandemic – US sales of 100% non-concentrated juices jumped from $5 billion in 2019 to $5.5 billion in 2020 and stayed mostly at that level through 2021.\n\nFlorida had such a small harvest last year – only 44.5 million boxes of oranges – its lowest crop since the 1944-45 season. In 2019 to 2020, by contrast, it harvested 73.2 million boxes. Brazil also faced a historic drought that cut its crop by 31% from its 2019-2020 season.\n\n“You have your classical supply-demand mismatch,” said Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors, which specializes in agricultural commodities analysis. As a result, consumers should expect “much higher prices at the supermarket.”\n\nHomes\n\nThe median home sales price was $346,900 in 2021, up 16.9% from 2020. That’s the highest increase on record since 1999, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThe housing market frenzy was a boon for the typical homeowner, who accumulated $50,200 in housing wealth, looking at the median price jump from 2020 to 2021.\n\n“That is a sizable wealth gain for homeowners across the country,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “The housing market has seen a spectacular performance this last year with sales rising and prices rising. But inventory is at an all-time low.”\n\nThe inventory of unsold existing homes fell to a record low of 910,000 at the end of December, down 18% from November.\n\nLaundry detergent\n\nProctor & Gamble announced this week it’s raising prices by an average of about 8% on retail customers next month for its Tide and Gain laundry detergents, Downy fabric softener and Bounce dryer sheets.\n\nThe company attributed the price increase to cost pressures, including transportation, labor and the commodities it uses to manufacture its products. The US producer price index, a gauge for prices manufacturers are paying, rose 9.7% last year.\n\nGas\n\nPrices at the pump are rising again. Crude oil climbed above $81 for the first time in two months, and gasoline prices are creeping back up.\n\n“This is a terrible situation. Gas prices are in this political danger zone,” Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNN.\n\nSince Monday, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline increased by a penny to $3.32 Thursday, according to AAA. On Friday it reached an average of $3.326.\n\nIowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and Oklahoma have seen the biggest increases, of 5 cents and more. Prices in Washington D.C. have also jumped 5 cents since last Thursday.\n\nAutomobiles\n\nEdmunds, a car shopping website, said the average price for a new car was $46,426 in December 2021, up 14% from the year prior. A computer chip shortage limited production of new vehicles, leading to inventory too low to meet demand.\n\nThe record high prices could be coming down, but they won’t reach pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAs inventories are projected to build again, experts say there should be less pressure on prices.\n\nJ.D. Power forecasts that the average wholesale price of used cars should fall about 9% from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of this year, and that prices should continue to decline in 2023. But they’re unlikely to get to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nUsed car prices also increased almost 40% in December 2021 from the year prior, a new analysis by the Anderson Economic Group found.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/business/costco-kirkland-signature-trader-joes-store-brands/index.html", "title": "The hidden makers of Costco's Kirkland Signature and Trader Joe's ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nKirkland Signature.

Store brands have never been more popular.\n\nThey have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry, according to IRI.\n\nAs prices surge, store brands – also known as private labels, white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.\n\nBut the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.\n\nRetailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers, likewise, have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.\n\nMany leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.\n\nTrader Joe's first private brand product in the 1970s was granola. As the grocer grew, it switched to mainly its own brands. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAlthough store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands, manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit, some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.\n\nOther brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers, hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.\n\n“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it,” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”\n\nBut there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers, produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries, Costco (COST)executives have said.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny and Dixie, also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY), the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.\n\nEight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore\n\nStore labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.\n\nMacy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills, according to Christopher Durham, the president of the Velocity Institute, a trade association for private brands.\n\nMontgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers, while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice, Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee, one of the most famous private labels of the period.\n\nEight O'Clock Coffee sold at The Great Atlantic And Pacific Tea Company (A&P) in 1949. Joe Scherschel/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock\n\nYet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears, Roebuck.\n\nIn 1925, Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later, Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench, according to Durham. Its Kenmore line, which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances, became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.\n\nThese private labels were the exception, however.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, national brands such as Jell-O, H.J. Heinz, Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.\n\nMost customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands, not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed, which gave manufacturers immense leverage.\n\nAdditionally, many store brands were also considered dull, cheap knockoffs of national brands.\n\nThe low point of private label came during the 1970s, Durham said, when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer, soap, cola, beans and other staples.\n\nShopper loyalty\n\nRetailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons, including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.\n\nPrivate brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising, distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.\n\nGreat Value is Walmart's largest store brand. John Gress/Reuters\n\nIn the mid-20th century, many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades, the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now, stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.\n\n“Forty years ago, Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now, Walmart is much bigger than P&G,” said Steenkamp, the marketing professor.\n\nToday, stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.\n\nStores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty, said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI.\n\nCostco (COST), for example, will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.\n\nCostco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products, but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one, company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nCostco generates nearly one-third of its sales from its Kirkland Signature label. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRetailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement, while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.\n\nThe US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.\n\nAmazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.\n\nMost stores start small with their own brands. Grocers, for example, will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta, flour, sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.\n\n“You don’t start with the most difficult things,” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success, then they enter new categories.”\n\nHow to find out who makes store brands\n\nSo how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?\n\nProduct recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.\n\nLast year, for example, Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables, including private brands for Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B.\n\nJ.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year, as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle, Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.\n\nThen there are the dedicated private label manufacturers, such as Treehouse Foods (THS), which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets, big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year, for example, came from Walmart (WMT).\n\nTarget has dozens of its own brands, such as Cat & Jack, Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nJames Walser, who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009, said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.\n\nSome large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger, for example, makes about 30% of its own private products.\n\nPerhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the size of the US grocery industry. It is a $1.17 trillion industry, according to IRI.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/06"}]}

The Alabama Finance Department confirmed that the bond sale, which had been approved last month, was finalized. The deal closure comes after criminal justice reform activists had strived for more than a year to disrupt the sale. But legal wrangling over the project is continuing through ongoing litigation. Gov. Kay Ivey and lawmakers approved the construction as a solution to Alabama’s ongoing prison woes. Critics of the plan argue that the state is ignoring the bigger issues – prison staffing levels and leadership – to focus on building projects. “The construction of new and modern correctional facilities is absolutely and undeniably necessary to support the safety of both inmates and staff, to improve mental health care, to provide space for vocational and rehabilitative programs, and ultimately to protect public safety,” Alabama officials said in a statement. “No eleventh-hour lawsuits by inmates or activists will halt these efforts, and the state intends to move to dismiss the lawsuits and to vigorously defend against the claims as being without merit.” Activists had tried to discourage the deal, calling it a cruel investment in mass incarceration.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Some rain helped firefighters battling a wildfire that prompted evacuations. About a half-inch fell into early Monday, allowing crews to build more fire breaks to help control the wildfire started by lightning June 21. “It’s not really like a season-ending type of rain; it’s more like a slowing,” said Mark Enty, a spokesperson for a state firefighting team. The fire has been burning near the community of Anderson. Evacuation orders were place for all properties accessed by roads, trails or driveways on the west side of the Parks Highway from mileposts 269 to 275. The city of Anderson, located about 80 miles southwest of Fairbanks, is not under an evacuation order. At least one home has been confirmed to have been lost, and Enty said Denali Borough officials will make an official assessment of other structures. The fire was estimated to be 110 square miles.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Evictions in the greater Phoenix area have returned to pre-pandemic levels. The latest data from the Maricopa County Justice Court shows that landlords filed 5,792 evictions in June, compared with 5,669 in June 2019, before the pandemic began. Maricopa County had among the highest levels of evictions in the United States before state and federal eviction moratoriums that slowed lockouts during the coronavirus pandemic. Those eviction bans have long since ended. June also saw the highest number of monthly eviction filings since the pandemic began in spring 2020. A court spokesman emphasized that applications for rental assistance are still being accepted and encouraged tenants in need to apply.\n\nArkansas\n\nParagould: Jimmie Lou Fisher, who served as Arkansas’ state treasurer for more than two decades and was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, has died, a funeral home said. She was 80. Fisher died Monday at Arkansas Methodist Medical Center in Paragould, Mitchell Funeral Home said. A cause of death was not released. Then-Gov. Bill Clinton appointed Fisher as state auditor in 1979. She later served as treasurer from 1981 to 2002. “I will always remember that early October morning in 1991, when Jimmie Lou introduced me as I kicked off my presidential campaign on the steps of the Old State House,” Clinton said in a statement Tuesday. “As always, she was enthusiastic, caring and kind, saying just the words we all needed to hear.” He added: “She loved Arkansas and Arkansas loved her back. And she did a fine job as state treasurer.” Fisher ran for governor in 2002 and lost to Republican Mike Huckabee, capturing 47% of the vote. “She loved politics and was a faithful and fierce warrior for her party throughout her adult life,” Huckabee said Tuesday. A funeral service is scheduled for Thursday in Paragould.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Former U.S. Rep. Katie Hill, who was ordered to pay attorneys’ fees to a British tabloid and two conservative journalists she sued after the publication of intimate photos without her consent, has filed for bankruptcy protection. If successful, the move could allow Hill to avoid paying about $220,000 in fees to the defendants, the Los Angeles Times reports. The Democrat who briefly represented a district north of Los Angeles had accused multiple parties in a revenge-porn lawsuit of violating the law by publishing or distributing the compromising photos. The lawsuit was thrown out, and a judge later rendered the financial judgments. Hill did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She resigned in 2019 after the publication of the photos and amid a House ethics probe into allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship with one of her congressional staffers, which she denied. Hill, 34, gained national attention in 2018 when she was elected to Congress in a district long under Republican control. She was celebrated as the face of millennial change and was close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who allegedly made a threatening phone call against the state’s top elections official has been charged with retaliating against an elected official. Kirk Wertz, 52, was arrested June 6 in suburban Denver over the June 30 phone call to the office of Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold after investigators tracked his cellphone moving from Goodland, Kansas, to Colorado, according to a court document. Authorities have not revealed what the alleged threat was. His alleged statements to the person who answered the phone at Griswold’s office and to a state trooper who called the number back later were redacted from a document explaining why he was arrested. A spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney’s Office, Carolyn Tyler, confirmed that Wertz had been charged but declined to elaborate beyond what was included in the document. Wertz was being held in jail Friday after making his first appearance in court Thursday. There was no attorney listed as representing him yet in court records. In a statement, Griswold thanked law enforcement for taking action against Wertz and said threats would not deter her from carrying out her election duties. “The wave of violent threats directed at election officials and workers across the county is extremely concerning,” she said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The wife of a former state lawmaker pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with her role in the alleged theft of more than $600,000 in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven. Lauren DiMassa, one of several people including her husband who were arrested in the investigation, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy in U.S. District Court in Hartford. Sentencing has not been scheduled. She remains free on bail. Federal prosecutors said West Haven paid DiMassa, formerly known as Lauren Knox, nearly $148,000 for services she never provided to the city. She and her husband were accused of submitting fraudulent invoices to the city for coronavirus-related services including youth violence prevention, but instead they used the money for their own benefit, prosecutors said. DiMassa’s lawyer, Francis O’Reilly, said in court that it was important to note that DiMassa turned over most of the money she received from the city to her husband. O’Reilly declined to comment after the hearing. DiMassa’s husband is former state Rep. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat who also served as an aide to the West Haven City Council. He resigned from both positions after his arrest in October. He has pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: While the First State saw a slight decline in fatalities in 2020, a report released Tuesday still ranks Delaware among the deadliest states for pedestrians. Smart Growth America’s Dangerous by Design 2022 report analyzed federal crash and fatality data from 2016 to 2020 – the latest statistics publicly available – finding Delaware’s pedestrian fatalities declined slightly during the pandemic, averaging 2.89 deaths per 100,000 people from 2016-20. That represented a 0.42 decline in deaths per 100,000 people from 2016 to 2019, but long-term comparisons between rates from 2011-15 and 2016-20 show little change, keeping Delaware the fifth most dangerous state for pedestrians, the report shows. New Mexico was at the top with 3.76 pedestrian deaths per 100,000 people annually, followed by Florida with 3.22 deaths, South Carolina with 3.19 deaths and Arizona with 2.98 deaths, according to the report. Delaware has consistently ranked among the deadliest states for pedestrian safety, and over the past decade, the number of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities on the state’s roadways has nearly doubled. The First State saw non-motorized fatalities increase from 21 in 2009 to 28 in 2020, according to the latest statistics available through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s online database.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. residents can now preregister for monkeypox vaccination appointments, WUSA-TV reports, citing a Tuesday announcement by DC Health. Once appointments become available, starting Thursday, people who preregistered will receive an email invitation to make an appointment. Residents will then have 48 hours to claim their appointment. About 3,000 appointments are expected to become available this week. Currently, eligibility for the vaccination is limited to adults in certain sexual circumstances that would increase their risk, based on where the virus has been circulating most heavily in the U.S. But residents who do not meet the current vaccine eligibility criteria are still encouraged to preregister. The monkeypox vaccinations are free and based on availability. At the appointment, confirmation of an appointment and proof of residency will be required.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: U.S. immigration officials say 25 Cuban migrants landed in South Florida on Tuesday – the latest arrival amid a mass migration from the island to escape political and economic troubles. The group was seen sitting off the side of the road by a beachside park in Key Biscayne in the early morning and included women and a few children, who were all taken into custody. Chief Patrol Agent Walter Slosar of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said via Twitter it was a smuggling incident that was being investigated. Between last October and May, Customs and Border Protection officials have found and detained about 1,000 Cubans arriving in Florida. Meanwhile, as of Sunday, the U.S. Coast Guard said it had stopped more than 3,000 Cubans at sea since last October. The majority of Cubans continue to migrate by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, with about 140,000 arriving since last October – a number that exceeds the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when more than 124,700 Cubans came to the U.S. Cuba is seeing its worst economic crisis in decades due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the tightening of U.S. sanctions. Last summer, people staged massive protests, which ended in hundreds of arrests, according to nongovernmental groups.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLithonia: A man became trapped while trying to crawl down through a vent from a strip mall roof into a pizza restaurant Tuesday, forcing firefighters to slice open the vent to free him, police said. The man was taken to a hospital, and the extent of his injuries was unclear. Police told local news outlets that emergency responders cut open the vent where it extended upward from a pizza oven at a Little Caesars outlet in suburban Lithonia, about 15 miles east of downtown Atlanta. Brittany Davis, a U.S. Army recruiter, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution she could hear the man yelling for help when she arrived for work at a neighboring recruiting office. “I looked on the roof but couldn’t see anybody,” Davis said. She called 911. Davis said a Little Caesars employee told her he could hear the man’s voice coming from inside the oven. Davis said she went inside the pizza restaurant and spoke to the man, who reported he was in pain and having a panic attack. “I’m not sure what time the restaurant closes at night, but the oven still gives off heat after they close, I imagine,” DeKalb County Fire Cpt. Jason Daniels told WXIA-TV. “For him to get down into the pipe … he had to do it in a certain window of time when the oven was cool enough, and obviously nobody was there.” The man walked to an ambulance shortly after being removed and was taken to a hospital. Police did not identify him or announce any criminal charges.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island was given new land Tuesday in a deal that will protect and manage a pristine white sand beach and ocean bay area that is home to endangered and endemic species and to rare, culturally significant Native Hawaiian artifacts. Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit land preservation group, transferred its ownership of Pohue Bay and surrounding land to the National Park Service. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has the world’s largest and most active volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kilauea. Most of the coastline where the bay is located is made of ancient lava flows, black rock and sea cliffs that dart out into the ocean. Pohue Bay, a rare and idyllic oasis in an otherwise rugged landscape, is home to endangered hawksbill sea turtles, green sea turtles, endangered Hawaiian monk seals and other species found only in Hawaii. The area houses anchialine ponds – landlocked pools with a mix of fresh and salt water – where rare Hawaiian red shrimp called ʻōpaeʻula live. The area is also culturally significant because it has remains of ancient Hawaiian villages, petroglyphs, burial sites and the largest known abrader tool quarry in the state, according to the Trust for Public Lands. Abraders are ancient tools used for sanding, smoothing and grinding.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lame-duck Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has given a big pay boost to an administrative assistant who is also a top state Republican Party official in a move that could hinder the ability of the next lieutenant governor by significantly depleting the office’s budget before January’s power transition. In an email Monday, McGeachin informed the Idaho Division of Financial Management that Machele Hamilton would go from part time to full time and jump from $20,000 to $77,000 annually. Her hourly pay is an increase from $20 an hour to about $37 an hour. Her title in the new role is director of strategy and constituent services. She is also the first vice-chair of the Idaho Republican Party. Hamilton is making about $30,000 more than McGeachin’s former chief of staff, Jordan Watters, who resigned in March when McGeachin couldn’t stay within last year’s budget. It’s not clear why Hamilton is being paid so much more than Watters, whose chief of staff duties would likely have included everything in the title Hamilton was given. Hamilton answered the phone for McGeachin’s office Tuesday afternoon but said McGeachin wasn’t available. Hamilton declined to comment about her employment in the office, and McGeachin didn’t respond to a message left with Hamilton by the Associated Press concerning Hamilton’s employment.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A Wisconsin doctor has purchased two clinical buildings in northern Illinois where he plans to offer abortion pills as early as Friday at one location and surgical abortions within six months at the other site. The move comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights last month. That led abortion providers in Wisconsin to stop the procedures while the courts determine whether the state’s 1849 law banning most abortions stands. Abortion remains legal in Illinois, making it a likely draw for residents of many other states in the Midwest and even the South. Dr. Dennis Christensen said he’s part of a group trying to revive abortion services in Rockford, in part to accommodate Wisconsin patients. Christensen is an obstetrician-gynecologist who has provided abortions in Madison and Milwaukee and is now mostly retired, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. He recently purchased a former acupuncture office for $75,000 and the former Animal Emergency Clinic of Rockford for $350,000, according to the Winnebago County records. The newly formed Rockford Family Planning Foundation is fundraising and is preparing the second site for surgical abortions, birth control and related care. “We feel like it’s absolutely essential for us to get open as quickly as possible,” said Jeanne Bissell, the group’s president.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Students across the state had small improvements in their English and math scores, with standardized test results released Wednesday indicating a tentative bright spot following years of pandemic-disrupted learning. Results for the spring 2022 ILEARN exam from the Indiana Department of Education show the statewide percentage of students meeting their grade expectations for math climbing to 39.4% from 2021’s 36.9%. The English proficiency levels rose to 41.2%, up from last year’s 40.5%. ILEARN was first implemented in 2019 to replace the state’s ISTEP exam for students from third to eighth grade. The state did not test students in 2020 because of COVID-19-related school shutdowns. Students with passing scores remain about 7 or 8 percentage points below 2019’s pre-pandemic pass rates. The 2022 report also says most grades saw slight increases in passing scores, with the exception of sixth and eighth graders, who saw minor decreases in English scores. All grade levels’ math proficiency increased at least 2 percentage points since 2021. Charity Flores, chief academic officer at the Department of Education, presented the findings to the Board of Education on Wednesday. This year marks the second year of recovery, she said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds declined Tuesday to say whether she would get behind a so-called red flag law in Iowa after a new bipartisan federal gun safety law would offer funding to states that enact them. Reynolds, a Republican, said she wouldn’t rule it out and plans to “take a look at everything.” But she also said that she believes red flag laws have not stopped some shootings in other states and that Iowa needs to have a “balance” that recognizes the rights of gun owners as it moves forward. “When we focus on one solution to the issues that we see with active shooters, we tend to, I think, not think about what other solutions are,” she said. “And we eliminate potential things that we can do right away.” Extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws, allow police or family members to get a court order that temporarily confiscates firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia currently have red flag laws in place. Many of those states are clustered in regions of the U.S. largely governed by Democrats, but some states run by Republicans such as Florida and Indiana also have them. Such laws have gained some bipartisan support, including among U.S. lawmakers as 29 Republicans joined Democrats to pass the federal gun safety law in late June.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas State Board of Education is looking to veteran teachers to help mitigate staff shortages this fall. The board on Tuesday passed a measure giving any retired educator who previously held a Kansas teaching license an easier pathway back into the classroom during the 2022-23 school year. The new transitional license option, intended for retired educators whose prior teaching credentials have been lapsed for at least six months, streamlines the process and eliminates application fees and professional development requirements needed for typical license renewals. Applicants will still have to pay $50 for a background check, since the state education department outsources that work. Over the past five years, teacher retirements ebbed, but they ticked back up in the past five years, according to Kansas State Department of Education data. In 2020, the agency recorded 785 educators as having retired, but in 2022, KSDE has reported a record-high 986 teacher retirements, said Shane Carter, director of teacher licensure. However, the department in the past few years has also seen a surge in the number of retired teachers who have renewed their teaching license, Carter said, more than doubling from 368 retired teacher renewals in 2020 to 766 in 2022.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A medical marijuana advisory team formed by Gov. Andy Beshear will hold a town hall on the issue Thursday evening in northern Kentucky. The Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee is traveling around the state to gather views on the issue and provide feedback to the governor’s office. The next town hall is set for 5:30 p.m. Thursday at Northern Kentucky University’s student union ballroom in Highland Heights, a statement from the Justice & Public Safety Cabinet said. Other meetings are set for Tuesday at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet in Frankfort and July 25 at Hopkinsville Community College. The first meeting was held July 6 in Pikeville. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey and Public Protection Secretary Ray Perry serve as co-chairs of the 17-member panel. It includes health care professionals, members of law enforcement and advocates for medical marijuana.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State authorities have once again been blocked from enforcing a near-total ban on abortion, this time under a judge’s order released Tuesday by a state court in Baton Rouge. Judge Donald Johnson’s order halts enforcement temporarily while lawyers for a north Louisiana clinic and other supporters of abortion rights pursue a lawsuit challenging the legislation. Johnson set a hearing for next Monday. State Attorney General Jeff Landry criticized the ruling in a series of posts on Twitter. “To have the judiciary create a legal circus is disappointing,” Landry wrote in one post. “The rule of law must be followed, and I will not rest until it is. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer for that to happen.” Kathaleen Pittman, director of the north Louisiana clinic that was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, expressed relief in a phone interview. Pittman said the Hope Medical Group for Women clinic in Shreveport is ready to resume counseling and abortions. Louisiana’s two other clinics are in the capital, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. “We look forward to arguing for a preliminary injunction before Judge Johnson next Monday and, in the meantime, we take solace in the fact that crucial healthcare for women has been restored in the state of Louisiana,” Joanna Wright, an attorney for the clinic, said in an email.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal circuit court has reinstated a ban on lobster fishing gear in a nearly 1,000-square-mile area off New England to try to protect endangered whales. The National Marine Fisheries Service issued new regulations last year that prohibited lobster fishing with vertical buoy lines in part of the fall and winter in the area, which is in federal waters off Maine’s coast. The ruling was intended to prevent North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340, from becoming entangled in the lines. The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine issued a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston vacated that ruling Tuesday. The circuit court sent the case back to the district court level but noted in its ruling that it does not think the lobster fishing groups that sued to stop the regulations are likely to succeed because Congress has clearly instructed the fisheries service to protect the whales. “Although this does not mean the balance will always come out on the side of an endangered marine mammal, it does leave plaintiffs beating against the tide, with no more success than they had before,” the court ruled.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Commercial and recreational fishermen woke up Sunday to new mako shark regulations from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to boost the number of the migratory predator. Michael Luisi, acting director of the department’s Fishing and Boating Services, said a zero retention limit was established for shortfin mako sharks in both commercial and recreational fishing. Prior to that, a very limited number of the species could be retained. Luisi said penalties for doing so would include “severe and hefty” fines for violators. “Most shark fishermen are going to be up on the regulations because they have to just go fishing,” said Mark Sampson, captain of the charter boat Fish Finder, based in Ocean City. “But your average guy that goes out to catch tuna or black sea bass might not have taken the time to learn shark regulations. So if he accidently catches one on his line, he won’t know if it’s a keeper or not. Those anglers are the ones that are the most frustrated with regulations.” After 40 years of being at the helm of a charter boat, Sampson remains busy with clients that do not always plan on coming back with a shark. For some, the experience is enough. The average season for shark fishing runs from mid-May to October, with mako sharks caught to mid-June.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A family’s beloved pet cat that’s been dodging airport personnel, airline employees and animal experts since escaping from a pet carrier at Logan International Airport about three weeks ago was finally caught Wednesday. “Whether out of fatigue or hunger we’ll never know, but this morning she finally let herself be caught,” an airport spokesperson said in a statement. The cat, named Rowdy, was given a health check and will be returned to her family. “I’m kind of in disbelief,” said her owner, Patty Sahli. “I thought, ‘What are the odds we’re actually going to get her back?’ But I got a call this morning, and I am just so shocked.” Rowdy’s time on the lam began June 24, as Sahli and her husband, Rich, returned to the U.S. from 15 years in Germany with the Army. When their Lufthansa flight landed, the 4-year-old black cat with green eyes escaped her cage, in pursuit of some birds. Soon Rowdy herself was on the receiving end of a chase, as her getaway set off a massive search involving airport and Lufthansa personnel, construction workers, and animal welfare advocates, as well as the use of wildlife cameras and safe-release traps. Despite numerous sightings, Rowdy always eluded her pursuers – but now, a little calm has been restored. “It was such a community effort,” Sahli said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: An effort to lock certain voting rights into the Michigan Constitution has taken a major step toward the fall ballot, eclipsing a rival campaign led by Republicans to limit absentee voting and add other restrictions. Promote the Vote, a coalition of 27 groups, submitted nearly 670,000 signatures Monday. While the signatures still must be validated by election officials, the petitions contain about 245,000 more names than necessary to qualify for the Nov. 8 election. The ballot question would expand voter rights by allowing nine days of in-person early voting, state-funded absentee ballot postage and drop boxes in every community. Promote the Vote is the same coalition that helped pass no-reason absentee voting and same-day voter registration in 2018. Khalilah Spencer, president of Promote the Vote, said the campaign “observed the 2020 election, and even the 2018 election, and we see where there could be improvements.” In addition to increased access to early voting, the constitutional amendment would require 24-hour absentee ballot drop boxes in every community. Voters could also join a permanent list to have absentee ballots sent for every election. And it would require election audits to be conducted in public by state and county officials and certified based only on the official records of votes cast. Some portions are already in Michigan law, but the state has seen attempts at “manipulating the language in that law, and we want to make sure we close those loopholes,” Spencer said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Local governments in the state are trying to find creative solutions to managing the cost of fueling their fleets of vehicles as gas prices remain high. With gas prices recently near $5 a gallon in the Twin Cities, municipal leaders are looking to keep police squad cars, fire engines, dump trucks and park equipment fueled, yet stay on budget. The city of Buffalo is urging carpooling and checking tire pressure on its vehicles to stretch a tank of gas. “We’re projecting we will be coming in over our fuel budget,” said Taylor Gronau, Buffalo’s assistant city administrator. “However, a lot of those trips are necessary and needed.” Several communities are trying to add more electric and hybrid vehicles to their fleets – only to find huge backlogs, the Star Tribune reports. Earlier this summer, Minneapolis started a program that gave home inspectors the option of taking e-bikes to job sites. It saved wear and tear on the vehicle fleet and cut the city’s gas consumption. Several other city agencies, including IT and public works staff, are also looking into e-bikes. While dozens of local governments are under state fuel contacts, which cover a majority of fuel purchases in bulk and at a fixed rate, many other communities don’t participate, including Buffalo, which relies on retail gas stations to fuel its fleet.\n\nMississippi\n\nPearl River County: A volunteer fire department lost the use of three trucks when its own station went up in flames. WLOX TV reports the fire happened Monday night at the Nicholson Volunteer Fire Department station. Nicholson is a community in Pearl River County, near the Gulf Coast and the Louisiana state line. Five neighboring firefighting agencies assisted in fighting the blaze. Three trucks were heavily damaged, according to the TV station. And a county press release said several other pieces of key firefighting equipment were destroyed in the fire. Former Nicholson fire Chief Bobby Robbins estimated the damage at $1 million and said it could take roughly 100 days to have the equipment replaced. There were no injuries. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Robbins said the trucks were donated by Deep South, a company from which the team is now considering renting. The Pearl River County Fire Marshal said officials are working with other agencies in the meantime to borrow equipment. Authorities must determine how the fire started as well as how to provide immediate protection in Nicholson without the fire trucks, equipment and a usable firehouse.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Developers announced plans Monday to expand the capacity of a controversial wind power transmission line so much that it would match that of four new nuclear power plants. Invenergy Transmission, the Chicago-based company attempting to build the Grain Belt Express, now says the project will be able to deliver 5,000 megawatts of power, about 25% more than originally planned, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Investment in the project, which would stretch about 800 miles from Kansas to Indiana on a route crossing Missouri and Illinois, also would soar to about $7 billion, Invenergy said. Various municipal utilities in Missouri have long intended to buy power from the project, but now five times as much electricity will be delivered to the state – rising from 500 to 2,500 megawatts, compared to earlier plans. The project will help unlock $7.5 billion in energy cost savings in Missouri and Illinois, according to its developers. The Grain Belt Express has the support of several area advocacy groups, including the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and the Associated Industries of Missouri. But some farmers who don’t want high-power transmission lines on their land have fought the project.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: The scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park opened for the 2022 summer season Wednesday after a spring marked by heavy snow and cool temperatures delayed plowing and maintenance work, park officials said. The July 13 opening matches the road’s latest opening dates since it first opened to the public on July 15, 1933. The alpine highway also opened July 13 in 2011 due to a late snowpack and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vehicle reservations are needed to travel on Going-to-the-Sun Road and can be obtained at the recreation.gov website. The $2 timed entry reservation fee is in addition to the $35-per-vehicle park entry fee. Timed reservations are also needed to enter the North Fork area, but they are not needed to enter other parts of the park such as Many Glacier, Two Medicine, St. Mary or the Chief Mountain Highway. The park’s free shuttle service along Going-to-the-Sun Road operates on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Supporters of the late Malcolm X are making a new push to get him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The Omaha native was nominated 15 years ago but rejected amid concerns of controversy, the Omaha World-Herald reports. A Malcolm X Memorial Foundation board member submitted a nomination for the next class of honorees – selected every five years – for the human rights activist, who was born as Malcolm Little in 1925 and was assassinated in 1965. JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike called him “one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history,” according to the World-Herald, and putting him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame would push “the rest of the state to know about the true civil rights history of Omaha.” Malcolm X is one of eight Nebraskans nominated this year. New members may only be named at least 35 years after their deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The University of Nevada, Reno is expecting fall enrollment to match numbers from a year ago – still down from pre-pandemic levels, when the campus saw record enrollment of 21,000 in the fall of 2019. “We are all least even where we were last year,” UNR President Brian Sandoval said. At UNR, fall 2020 enrollment, including non-degree-seeking students, was 19,961. It climbed to 20,129 in fall 2021. The state’s seven colleges – including Truckee Meadows Community College and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas – have all felt the effects of closing campuses and moving classes online. Enrollment systemwide topped 112,427 in the fall of 2019, according to data from the Nevada System of Higher Education. In 2021, enrollment was 106,259. Spring 2022 enrollment was estimated at 95,446 across the seven institutions. Among the factors affecting enrollment, Sandoval said, are the hardships students experienced from COVID-19, travel restrictions including for foreign students, and fewer Californians enrolling as the neighboring state has dramatically increased its admissions. “Students are challenged on a lot of levels,” Sandoval said, adding that housing prices and inflation are also affecting how many can afford higher education.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge has consolidated hundreds of lawsuits alleging physical and sexual abuse at the state’s youth detention center, more than two years after the first case was filed. David Meehan sued the state, the youth center, agencies that oversee it and multiple former employees in January 2020, alleging he endured near-daily rapes and beatings at the Youth Development Center in Manchester in the 1990s. At the time, he was one of about three dozen men and women who had come forward, but since then, about 450 have filed lawsuits alleging abuse by 150 staffers over six decades. The civil litigation has largely been on hold since 11 former youth workers were arrested last year, but a judge last week kicked it into high gear with an order setting out the consolidation process. While consolidation brings the “the risk of cookie-cutter dispositions,” proceeding with individual cases would present a “backbreaking clerical burden” for the court, said Merrimack County Superior Court Judge Andrew Schulman. The state is expected to produce more than 3 million pages of documents in the initial discovery phase. Discovery likely will take several months, and groups of cases will be combined for joint trials, lawyers said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A new “strike force” within the state attorney general’s office will aim to enforce New Jersey laws that protect the right to an abortion, working to make sure that patient confidentiality and personal health information are secure and that patients and providers are not threatened or intimidated by protesters. The Reproductive Rights Task Force announced Monday by acting Attorney General Matt Platkin is intended to ensure the full implementation of laws that give New Jersey some of the strongest protections for abortion rights in the United States. As other states ban or severely restrict abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the 49-year constitutional right to an abortion in the United States, New Jersey is expected to become a haven for people from those states who are seeking the procedures. Two laws signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on July 1 bar the extradition of people who receive or perform an abortion in New Jersey to those states that restrict or criminalize the procedure and prohibit public agencies from aiding investigations conducted by those states into abortions provided in the Garden State. The new group of attorneys and law enforcement officers within New Jersey’s Department of Law and Public Safety “will ensure that these laws are enforced to the full extent possible, and that we use every available resource to protect access to abortion care in New Jersey,” Platkin said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Physicians and researchers are urging state lawmakers to allow the use of psychedelic mushrooms in mental health therapy aimed at overcoming depression, anxiety, psychological trauma and alcoholism. A legislative panel on Tuesday listened to advocates who hope to broaden the scope of medical treatment and research assisted by psilocybin, the psychedelic active ingredient in certain mushrooms. Oregon is so far the only state to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin. Recent studies indicate psilocybin could be useful in the treatment of major depression, including mental suffering among terminally ill patients, and for substance abuse including alcoholism, with low risks of addiction or overdose under medical supervision. Physician Lawrence Leeman, a medicine professor at the University of New Mexico, urged legislators to move forward without waiting for federal decriminalization or regulatory approval to expand responsible therapies using doses of psilocybin. Leeman and other advocates outlined emerging psilocybin protocols, involving six-hour supervised sessions and extensive discussions about the experience in subsequent counseling. He warned legislators that public interest is spawning illicit, underground experimentation without safeguards.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Soaring demand for the monkeypox vaccine caused the appointment system to crash in New York City, one of many places where supplies have been running out almost as soon as they arrive. City health officials acknowledged the frustration over the limited supply of the vaccine and vowed to build a “stable appointment infrastructure” as the vaccine supply increases. U.S. infections now exceed 1,000 from the growing outbreak. Most patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. Vaccine shortages have added to anxiety around the virus. Health officials say anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases in the U.S. have been men who have sex with men. Scientists warn that anyone who is in close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection, regardless of their sexual orientation. “After COVID, this should have been easy,” said Daniel Ross, 25, a Harlem man who was one of the many who sought to make an appointment Tuesday. “I kept refreshing and refreshing. … I was frustrated.” Ross soon gave up on the appointment portal, which went down minutes after it went live. “It’s going to haunt me,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Local Republicans are planning a 30-day raffle of guns and ammunition, a move that’s drawing criticism in light of recent mass shootings across the U.S. The Forsyth County Republican Party will offer semi-automatic weapons, among other guns, in the raffle, the Winston-Salem Journal reports. Organizer Vernon Robinson said each raffle ticket will bear a three-digit number the purchaser can check each day against one of the games in the North Carolina Education Lottery from Sept. 9 through Oct. 8 to determine the winner. “The biggest problem with raffles is that the buyers can’t be sure the folks who are conducting it are playing it straight with the numbers,” Robinson said. “The way we solve that problem is to use the N.C. Education Lottery’s daily Pick 3 numbers.” A lottery spokesman said the agency does not know of any law that prevents other groups from using publicly released drawing numbers to decide their own raffles. Robinson said he hopes the fundraiser will net the party some $9,000 to $10,000 to “beat Democrats.” “The only people who are upset about gun raffles are people who are hostile to guns and gun owners,” he said. Kevin Farmer, chairman of the Forsyth County Democratic Party, said the move was “disappointing but, given the extremist nature of the Republican Party, not at all surprising.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State Attorney General Drew Wrigley on Tuesday rejected calls to release body camera footage of a fatal police shooting in Fargo and said he will personally oversee the case himself. Wrigley’s announcement came a day after family members and their supporters demanded to see video in the death of 28-year-old Shane Netterville, of Jamestown. About 50 people gathered Monday evening outside Fargo City Hall in a protest organized by a Native American group. Wrigley said the footage will be made public once all the proceedings are complete. “As a matter of course, law enforcement does not release evidence to the media for public consumption,” he said, noting there are only limited exceptions. Officer Adam O’Brien, an 11-year veteran of the department, shot Netterville on Friday after police responded to a report of people slumped over in a van. A police report said when officers arrived and tried to make contact with the occupants, the vehicle began to travel directly toward officers, and O’Brien fired. Netterville was driving the van, which police said had been reported stolen. Another man was arrested at the scene after he reportedly ignored commands of officers and was found to have methamphetamine. A third person who fled the scene was apprehended Tuesday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Columbus Division of Police will refer for internal review only one of 24 alleged misconduct cases during the 2020 racial injustice protests presented by an investigative team, police said Tuesday. Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said in a statement that she would only be referring one sergeant to the Internal Affairs Bureau for an administrative investigation. The referrals came after an investigation by retired FBI agent Richard Wozniak and Columbus Special Prosecutor Kathleen Garber, who were tasked in 2020 with looking into alleged criminal misconduct by officers during protests in May and June following the murder of George Floyd Jr. by then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin. In the statement, Bryant said she “immediately put together a team” to see which, if any, of the cases could be investigated further. Bryant noted that any administrative investigation must also comply with the contract with Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge #9, which mandates that all investigations occur within 90 days of the receipt of the complaint. Only one case fell within the 90-day time frame because the clock was stopped while the sergeant’s conduct was under a criminal investigation, Bryant said in the statement. The criminal investigation concluded May 27.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: People who believe they are descendants of victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre can now provide genetic material to help scientists when they begin trying to identify remains of possible victims. Danny Hellwig, laboratory director with Intermountain Forensics, said Wednesday that researchers are not ready to begin trying to match DNA for identification, but an outpouring of requests from local residents on how to provide genetic material led them to begin the process of accepting donations. “That’s what prompted this,” Hellwig said. “We didn’t expect the amount of support and willingness to help … people have jumped out of the woodwork” to offer their DNA for testing. Black people who had ancestors in Tulsa in 1921 are sought, Hellwig said. “What we need is to populate these databases with family lines” of direct descendants, making identifications of the remains possible within days, Hellwig said. “If we’re only matched with very distant relatives, it can take much longer,” with previous efforts to make such matches taking four years or more, he said. The Salt Lake City nonprofit foundation is examining 14 sets of remains removed from a Tulsa cemetery a year ago and has said at least two of the remains contains enough usable DNA for testing for possible identification.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Far-right Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson’s trial started this week on one count of felony riot in connection with a brawl outside a Portland bar in 2019. Jury selection began Monday and is scheduled to continue through Thursday, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Prosecutors allege Gibson instigated a street fight between Patriot Prayer and anti-fascists May 1, 2019, at the now-closed bar Cider Riot. In an arrest warrant affidavit, Deputy District Attorney Brad Kalbaugh said video of the brawl shows Gibson and his two co-defendants “taunting and physically threatening members of the Antifa group in an effort clearly designed to provoke a physical altercation.” Three other brawl participants with the Patriot Prayer group, Chris Ponte, Ian Kramer and Matthew Cooper, were indicted and pleaded guilty. Kramer, who knocked a woman unconscious and fractured her vertebrae with a baton, pleaded guilty to riot, assault and unlawful use of a weapon. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison and five years of probation. Ponte, who prosecutors said threw a rock and hurt a woman, pleaded guilty to a riot charge in a plea deal. He was sentenced to three years probation and 10 days in jail. Cooper pleaded guilty to riot and was sentenced to three years’ probation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The governor tweeted he had “big news” Tuesday, announcing the state budget passed in recent days includes funding for three new state parks. Gov. Tom Wolf’s press secretary, Beth Rementer, subsequently said the park sites haven’t been chosen, but work to identify and purchase the land is underway by the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The state’s 2022-23 spending plan includes $56 million to add the new state parks to what is currently a 121-park system. The three will be the first new state parks in Pennsylvania since 2005, not counting Washington Crossing, which was transferred from the state Historical and Museum Commission. The money will also help develop the state’s first park for the use of all-terrain vehicles and similar motorized recreational vehicles. “Our beautiful state parks are among the finest in the nation,” Wolf tweeted. “I’m proud that we secured funding in this year’s budget to make this investment in our park system.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A woman who authorities say pretended to be a decorated Marine Corps veteran with cancer to fraudulently collect about $250,000 in veterans benefits and charitable contributions has agreed to plead guilty, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Sarah Jane Cavanaugh, 31, of East Greenwich, signed an agreement in U.S. District Court in Providence under which she will admit to wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, forgery, and fraudulent use of medals, U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha said in a statement. She has also agreed to pay more than $82,000 in restitution. She faces more than 20 years in prison, but prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence on the low end of sentencing guidelines, according to court documents. Cavanaugh’s attorney, Kensley Barrett, said Tuesday that while he appreciates the interest that the case has garnered, he has no comment at this time. There is no record of Cavanaugh ever serving in the U.S. military, according to authorities. However, she did work as a licensed social worker for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Providence. Through her job, she gained access to documents, personal information and medical records belonging to a real veteran with cancer, which she used to create fraudulent documents and medical records in her name, prosecutors said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawyer for disgraced attorney Alex Murdaugh said Tuesday that investigators have indicated they intend to pursue murder charges against him for the deaths of his wife and son, who were fatally shot outside their home more than a year ago. Lawyer Jim Griffin said in a statement that the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division told Murdaugh family members they plan to seek indictments from a grand jury later this week. “We won’t have any comment until charges are actually brought against Alex,” Griffin said. Officials with both state police and the attorney general’s office would not comment on whether authorities were pursuing the indictments, which were first reported by news and opinion website FITSNews. Murdaugh already faces dozens of criminal charges that have piled up in the months since his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, were killed. But until now he has not been charged in connection with their deaths; he’s repeatedly denied any role in those killings. The deaths led to at least a half-dozen investigations into Murdaugh and his finances resulting in charges that he stole $8.5 million from people who hired him and that he lied to police in saying he was shot by a stranger on a roadside when – officials say – he really asked a friend to kill him so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Citizens who called the National Weather Service concerned about some “silvery objects” in the sky around the city this week prompted the agency to tweet that the objects were not aliens but rather test balloons launched by a South Dakota aerospace subsidiary. “Sorry, not aliens,” the NWS tweeted in response to the calls it received. The high-altitude balloons were launched by Raven Aerostar, a subsidiary of Raven Industries. “As a South Dakota company and the world leader in stratospheric balloon technology, our team conducts stratospheric balloon flights throughout the year, and many of them are launched from our dedicated hangar near Baltic,” Aerostar president Jim Nelson said. “Two of our Thunderhead Balloon Systems are currently over Sioux Falls.” The balloons, which look like hot air balloons, operate miles above the surface of the earth. Once a balloon reaches the stratosphere, it changes from a teardrop to a pumpkin shape, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Aerostar said the balloons have a variety of uses, including monitoring wildfires, expanding cellular networks and military reconnaissance. They navigate by autonomously changing altitude to take advantage of wind currents in the atmosphere.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is increasing its investment by $1.4 billion for a strategic plan that includes programs advancing the study and treatment of pediatric cancer and other catastrophic diseases, the hospital said Wednesday. The additional funding is part of a six-year expansion plan that launched last year, and it will raise the six-year operating and capital budget to $12.9 billion, the Memphis-based hospital said in a news release. New funding will affect scientific operations, clinical care, global medicine and infrastructure. The number of new jobs will increase from from 1,400 to 2,300, while funds for construction, renovation and capital needs will rise from from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the hospital said. As part of the expansion plan, more investment will be seen in areas including structural biology, advanced microscopy, data sciences, global childhood cancer care, and collaborative projects involving St. Jude and scientists across the U.S. and the world, the hospital said. Additional funds also will be used on construction projects including Domino’s Village, a 140-unit housing facility; the Family Commons, a treatment-free zone for patients and their families to rest and enjoy themselves; and two 15-story towers dedicated to patient care and clinical research, St. Jude said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas student leaders are advocating for campus officials to “protect reproductive rights” and take action in response to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last month and the state’s ban on abortions. A statement released by the student-run UT Coalition for Reproductive Justice and Rights on Tuesday includes a series of demands, including calling for UT leadership to expand sex education and reproductive health care resources, support adding an emergency contraceptive vending machine on campus, and advocate for reproductive health care access. “We unequivocally support reproductive rights, justice, and autonomy for all. The right to control our bodies and the ability to make healthcare decisions that should be private should not belong to any government or anyone other than ourselves,” the statement said. “We stand in solidarity with all abortion-seekers affected by this decision.” Sameeha Rizvi, vice president of the student-run UT Senate, said the coalition published the statement to emphasize “the lack of response from the university” to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She said students believed that collective action would help persuade UT to potentially take action on the demands.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man is in custody after police say he admitted attempting to hang one man and killing another as part of a “purge” that he claimed was directed by a higher power. Christian Francis Taele, 28, was arrested after police responding to a report of an assault found the 23-year-old victim strung from a piece of gym equipment at an apartment complex in Ogden on Saturday evening. It was unclear if Taele had an attorney who can speak on his behalf. KSL-TV reports he is being held for investigation of attempted murder. Witnesses said Taele, of Lake Shore, approached the victim, strangled him with a rope or strap, and kicked him numerous times before dragging him into the gym. The man was hospitalized and had no signs of brain activity. “The attack was unprovoked, and there is no indication that either the suspect or victim have ever spoken prior to the attack,” police wrote in an affidavit. While Ogden police were interviewing Taele, investigators say he confessed to a homicide in Spanish Fork and provided details of the slaying and the crime scene that had not been publicized. In that case, the body of 49-year-old Ryan Hooley was found next to a trash bin Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Leaders of the Vermont Army National Guard are investigating allegations of misconduct in recent months following a report made public last year on the Guard’s culture and policies. Vermont Adj. Gen. Greg Knight said in a statement Monday that he could not elaborate on the investigations but that it’s critical for members to know that “all members are, and will continue to be held accountable regardless of rank or position.” “I am disappointed that poor decisions and behavior continue to happen, but am glad to see our members report bad behavior when they see it,” he said. In November 2019, Knight requested an assessment by the National Guard Bureau Office of Complex Investigations. The 113-page report released last year found the Vermont National Guard’s sexual assault polices lacked specifics to ensure compliance, a prevention program had inadequate resources, and many personnel perceived favoritism and a “good old boy” network. The investigation concluded that “the command climate and culture within the VTNG is generally sound, though there is room for improvement,” and made 35 recommendations. “Our people are by far the most important part of our organization,” Knight said in the statement. “These investigations are a result of our people trusting the process, and reporting aberrant behavior to the chain of command.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWhitewood: Flooding in a remote pocket of southwest Virginia has damaged more than 100 homes and left some 40 people unaccounted for, but there are no confirmed deaths or injuries, authorities said Wednesday. First responders in Buchanan County began receiving reports of rising water and damage Tuesday night, authorities said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. After daybreak, crews conducted aerial surveys to examine the extent of the disaster. Several small communities in the Virginia county that borders West Virginia and Kentucky were affected, according to the sheriff’s office. About 40 people – a mix of adults and children – were reported unaccounted for, but that number was expected to decrease as swift-water rescue teams continued to survey the area, authorities said. A shelter was established at a local school. Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Eric Breeding said the number of persons unaccounted for was based on relatives trying to contact a resident in an area where there may be limited or no phone service. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that they are in trouble or in danger. They’re just letting us know that we need to check on these people,” Breeding said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, prosecutors said. According to King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office spokesperson Casey McNerthney, a judge on Monday ordered the 48-year-old man to remain jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail but denied prosecutors’ request for an anti-harassment order protecting Jayapal, The Seattle Times reports. In 2016, Jayapal became the first Indian American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a Democrat who heads the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Seattle police arrested the man outside Jayapal’s house at 11:25 p.m. Saturday after she called 911 and reported an unknown person or people were in a vehicle using obscene language, a probable cause statement said. She told a dispatcher her husband thought someone may have fired a pellet gun, the statement said. Officers arrested a man who was standing in the middle of the street with his hands in the air and a .40-caliber handgun holstered on his waist, the probable cause statement said. A neighbor told police she heard the man yell something to the effect of “go back to India, I’m going to kill you,” the statement said. The neighbor also said the man drove by Jayapal’s residence at least three times, yelling profanities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A helicopter crash last month that killed six people occurred when the aircraft hit a rock face 15 minutes after takeoff from a local airport, federal investigators said in a preliminary report Tuesday. The Vietnam-era Bell UH-1B “Huey” helicopter struck the rock face in an area about 4 miles from Logan County Airport in Amherstdale, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said in the report. The cockpit and cabin then crashed into a roadway and a guardrail and were consumed by fire. Investigators have not yet released any information about the cause of the accident. A final report could take a year or two to complete, they said. The June 22 flight was the last scheduled for the day during a multiday reunion for helicopter enthusiasts where visitors could sign up to ride or fly the historic Huey helicopter, described by organizers as one of the last of its kind still flying. The helicopter was flown by the 114th Assault Helicopter Company, “The Knights of the Sky,” in Vinh Long, Vietnam, throughout much of the 1960s, according to the website for MARPAT Aviation, a Logan County flight school that operated the helicopter. After the Huey returned to the U.S. in 1971, the website says, it was featured in movies such as “Die Hard, “The Rock” and “Under Siege: Dark Territory.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A federal judge is siding with the Sun Prairie School District in a lawsuit filed by two Black parents who objected to their children’s middle school assignment that asked students how they would punish a slave in ancient Mesopotamia. Dazrrea Ervins and Priscilla Jones claimed the Black History Month assignment in February 2021 violated their civil rights as well as those of their children. The question was not part of the school district’s curriculum on ancient Mesopotamia. Three teachers came up with the assignment on their own, according to an internal investigation. The teachers were placed on administrative leave and later resigned, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Along with complaints about the assignment, the lawsuit also accused the district of discriminating against one of the children for his learning disability and failing to protect him from racist bullying. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, in Wisconsin’s Western District, said the parents failed to show evidence that their civil rights or those of their children were violated by the assignment. “A reasonable jury certainly could find that its content and timing were offensive, insensitive and justifiably upset students and their families,” Peterson wrote. “But a hostile environment claim requires much more than a single upsetting episode.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local search and rescue responders are hoping to raise donations for a helicopter and secure county support to cover operational costs, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Teton County Sheriff Matt Carr announced the campaign Monday, saying the county’s search and rescue team responded to a record number of calls for service last year, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/07/18/iran-pentagon-ballistic-missiles-column/12788249/", "title": "Iran won't slow down on ballistic missiles: Column", "text": "Ilan Berman\n\nWith time for nuclear diplomacy between Iran and the P5+1 nations (the U.S., UK, Russia, China, France and Germany) running out, and with the White House scrambling to cobble together some sort of deal with Tehran, it's perhaps not surprising that Pentagon's latest annual assessment of Iran's military capabilities has so far garnered little attention, either within the Washington Beltway or outside it.\n\nThe study, submitted to the U.S. Congress earlier this year (with an unclassified summary made public in recent days), is minimalist in nature, providing only the broadest contours of the contemporary challenge posed by Iran. Even so, it contains some useful insights into the current state of Iran's military capabilities — and, by inference, what they might mean for American security and U.S. interests abroad. Here are a few takeaways:\n\nIran's president is still just window dressing. The rise of Hassan Rouhani to the Iranian presidency last summer brought with it widespread hope that Iran had at long last turned over a new political leaf. This perception has only been strengthened by the soft diplomatic tones of Mr. Rouhani himself, and by the Iranian regime's newfound willingness to talk to the West about its nuclear effort. The Pentagon report, however, helpfully reminds us that Mr. Rouhani is simply the hired help, and that Iran's Supreme Leader holds that title for a very good reason. \"Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei remains unchallenged atop Iran's power structure as both the political-spiritual guide and the commander in chief of the armed forces.\" In other words, for all of his reformist political rhetoric and overtures toward the West, Mr. Rouhani isn't the ultimate arbiter of Iran's nuclear flexibility or its global interests — or of much else, for that matter.\n\nIran remains a source of regional instability. Since its inception in 1979, the Islamic Republic has made the \"export\" of its radical vision of global Islamic revolution a key regime priority. Thirty-five years on, those efforts are still going strong. Iran's covert and asymmetric activities are \"continuing unabated in countries such as Syria and Iraq,\" the Pentagon study points out. This includes massive ongoing military support (in the form of snipers and drones, among other things) for the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Damascus, as well as an extensive footprint on Iraqi soil — one that is once again growing in response to the advances of Sunni extremists.\n\nIran's international troublemaking, meanwhile, is on the rise. The Qods Force, the elite paramilitary unit of Iran's feared Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), \"has continued efforts to improve its access within foreign countries and its ability to conduct terrorist attacks,\" the study notes. This presence now extends far beyond the Middle East to include Latin America, Asia and Europe, making the IRGC a truly global threat actor.\n\nIran's military capabilities are steadily growing. The Iranian regime may now be negotiating with the West over its nuclear effort, but it is simultaneously arming for regional dominance. \"Tehran is quietly fielding increasingly lethal symmetric and asymmetric weapon systems,\" the Pentagon report notes. These include \"more advanced naval mines, small but capable submarines, coastal defense cruise missile batteries, attack craft, and anti-ship ballistic missiles\" — tools that are intended to allow Iran to more effectively and completely control the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway through which nearly a fifth of world oil transits.\n\nThese capabilities, U.S. officials have warned in recent years, are already robust enough to allow Iran to close the Strait for brief periods of time, even with a sustained U.S. military presence in the region. But Iran's continued build-up guarantees that in the event of a regional conflict, America will need to contend with an Islamic Republic with its hand squarely on the global oil spigot.\n\nIran is bolstering its ballistic missile arsenal. Recent U.S. government estimates have warned that the Islamic Republic could potentially develop a intercontinental ballistic missile by next year. The Pentagon report qualifies this somewhat, stating that \"Iran has publicly stated it may launch a space launch vehicle by 2015 that could be capable of intercontinental ballistic missile ranges if configured as a ballistic missile.\" That change in phraseology reflects internal questions within the U.S. government about the pace of Iran's missile development.\n\nWhat isn't in doubt, however, is the Iranian regime's intent to become a global missile power. In recent years, the Islamic Republic has made heavy investments in both its ballistic missile and its space programs — technologies that, if fused together, would allow the regime to rapidly field an ICBM. The Iranian government, moreover, has consistently rejected any constraints on its ballistic missile capabilities as part of negotiations with the P5+1 powers. The message is clear: Iran sees missiles as inextricably linked to its global status, and isn't willing to give up on either.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon report on Iran is modest in both scope and depth, it nonetheless conveys the unmistakable impression that the Iranian regime — which not long ago was on the ropes as a result of Western pressure — has gotten a new lease on life. So, too, have its military capabilities, with all that this implies for the Middle East, and for us.\n\nIlan Berman is vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

Kay Ivey’s campaign page Tuesday morning, indicating it had been mistakenly flagged as an imposter account, though the governor suggested the move was prompted by her criticism of President Joe Biden’s vaccination-or-testing mandate. Ivey, a Republican, cited her staunch opposition to the Democratic president’s vaccine push. But Facebook indicated that was not the case. “We fought back and won. Evidently, they’re upset that I said I’m standing in the way of President Biden to protect Alabamians from this outrageous overreach by the federal government,” Ivey said in a statement posted on social media. The dispute involved Ivey’s campaign page and not her gubernatorial account. Ivey is running for reelection in 2022. However, Facebook indicated the content on Ivey’s page played no role. Her campaign called the tech giant’s statement about the page being incorrectly marked as an imposter account a “nonsense excuse.” It said Facebook first said it was unpublishing the page because of “harassment and bullying,” and the campaign fought to get it restored. Ivey has strongly encouraged peopled to get vaccinated against COVID-19, even going as far to say that “it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks” for a spike in cases. But she has vowed resistance to Biden’s mandate.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Overwhelmed by a surge in COVID-19 patients, Alaska’s largest hospital on Tuesday implemented crisis standards of care, prioritizing resources and treatments to those patients who have the potential to benefit the most. “While we are doing our utmost, we are no longer able to provide the standard of care to each and every patient who needs our help,” Dr. Kristen Solana Walkinshaw, chief of staff at Providence Alaska Medical Center, wrote in a letter addressed to Alaskans and distributed Tuesday. “The acuity and number of patients now exceeds our resources and our ability to staff beds with skilled caregivers, like nurses and respiratory therapists. We have been forced within our hospital to implement crisis standards of care.” Alaska, like other places, has seen a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly contagious delta variant. State health officials said Tuesday that there were 691 new cases and six recent deaths, all Anchorage men in their 50s to 70s. A woman in her 60s from out of state also recently died in Juneau, the department said. Health officials said statewide there are 202 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who are hospitalized, and nine additional patients are under investigation. Officials said 33 of those people are on ventilators.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an effort by the Arizona Senate to keep secret records of its ongoing review of the 2020 election in Maricopa County that are in the possession of the contractors conducting the recount. The high court, without comment, rejected the appeal filed after an appeals court and trial court both ruled the documents are public records that must be released. The court also dissolved a stay on the appeals court ruling it put in place Aug. 24 so it could review the record and decide whether to accept the appeal. The Arizona Court of Appeals had ruled that the documents sought by the watchdog group American Oversight detailing how the recount and audit are being conducted are public and must be turned over. Republicans who control the Senate have tried for months to keep secret how their contractors are conducting the recount. They argued that because the records are maintained by Senate contractors, they were not subject to public records law, and legislative immunity applies. But the appeals court in its Aug. 19 ruling rejected that argument. The court said the main contractor, Florida company Cyber Ninjas, was subject to the records law because it was performing a core government function that the Senate farmed out.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 36 new COVID-19 deaths and more than 1,500 new coronavirus cases Tuesday. The Department of Health said Arkansas’ death toll from COVID-19 now totals 7,334 since the pandemic began. The state’s coronavirus cases rose by 1,544 to 477,191 total. Arkansas ranks 15th nationally for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said 11 of the deaths announced Tuesday were delayed reports, with two occurring as far back as June. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the state dropped by 16 to 1,097. There were 432 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units and 281 on ventilators. There were 33 ICU beds available in the state, and Hutchinson said at least 14 were equipped for COVID-19 patients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOlympic Valley: A popular ski resort whose name included a derogatory term for Native American women changed its name to Palisades Tahoe on Monday. The renaming of Squaw Valley Ski Resort is one of many efforts nationally to address a history of colonialism and oppression against Native Americans and other people of color. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, may have once simply meant “woman,” but over generations, the word morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women, according to experts. “It was the right thing to do, and I think it’s going to make a difference. I think we’re going to be seen as a more welcoming, inclusive resort and community,” said Palisades Tahoe President and COO Dee Byrne. Byrne said that after studying the issue for the past year, the resort’s research concluded the word is very offensive “not just to Indigenous women but to all women.” The resort is in Olympic Valley, which was known as Squaw Valley until it hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics. Tribes in the region had been asking the resort for a name change for decades. The valley, in the Lake Tahoe area, is within the ancestral homeland of the Washoe people, Darrel Cruz of the Washoe Tribe Historic Preservation Office said in a statement. He said the word is a “term that was inflicted upon us by somebody else, and we don’t agree with it.” Washoe Tribal Chairman Serrell Smokey said the tribal council expressed “its great appreciation for this positive step forward.”\n\nColorado\n\nArvada: Visiting the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Flatirons Campus outside Denver on Tuesday, President Joe Biden tried to advance his domestic spending plans by warning about climate change’s dangers while highlighting how his clean-energy proposals would also create well-paying jobs. “Here’s the good news: Something that is caused by humans can be solved by humans,” Biden said. He deemed the need for a clean-energy future an “economic imperative and a national security imperative” and said there was no time to waste, as the impact of climate change seems to grow more severe by the year. Biden said extreme weather events will cost more than $100 billion in damages this year and underscored his goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 while using solely carbon pollution-free power 15 years earlier. “We can do that; we can do all of this in a way that creates good jobs, lowers costs to consumers and businesses, and makes us global leaders,” the Democratic president said. Biden spoke about “more jobs for the economy” on an earlier tour as he checked out a giant windmill blade on the ground outside the lab and got a demonstration of wind turbine technology.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he wants to extend the state’s mask mandate for public schools beyond the end of this month, when his pandemic-related emergency powers are set to expire. Lamont, a Democrat, said another 90-day extension of his powers is warranted. State lawmakers have extended his emergency declarations in the past, although Republicans and some Democrats have argued it’s time to get back to normal. “I just think it should continue a little bit longer,” Lamont told reporters following an event in Hartford, referring to the mask mandate and new coronavirus variants. “We’ve got not just delta but mu. We’ve got flu season.” Lamont’s general counsel has a list of 10 executive orders, including the mask mandate, that he believes should continue beyond the end of this month, the governor said. Officials from his administration were slated to meet Tuesday with legislative leaders about extending them. “What I want is legislative input on the executive orders. I’d like to know where they stand. I’d like to have their fingerprints on some of the decisions,” he said. Lamont said he believes a requirement for masks in public schools should remain in effect for “a little bit longer.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Faculty and students are split over a University of Delaware policy that prevents instructors from informing students if someone in their class has tested positive for the coronavirus. While the school says it’s concerned about student privacy, wants to prevent panic and has formal contact tracing mechanisms in place, some worry that system may be inadequate. Nada Abuasi, a student at the university, called the policy “harmful” and worried many people on campus might not be aware they’ve been exposed. “I would rather you be upfront with me that someone in my class has COVID, and maybe I was sitting next to them, because I might have immunocompromised people at home,” Abuasi said. Andrea Boyle-Tippett, the university’s director of external relations for the Office of Communications and Marketing, said the idea of faculty passing on exposure information, even without naming the student, “was causing privacy problems because if the class size is small, then by a possible elimination, you can figure out who the student is.” Some instructors, including ethics professor Mark Greene, agreed with the new protocol, saying they shouldn’t have to inform students and face questions that “most of us aren’t qualified to answer.” Others worried they were wrongly “withholding public health information.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the second year in a row, the Broccoli City music festival has been canceled over COVID-19 concerns, WUSA-TV reports. The 2021 performance lineup included Lil Baby, Snoh Aalegra, Moneybagg Yo, Lucky Dave, Rubi Rose and more. The hip-hop concert, which was scheduled this year for Oct. 2 at RFK Stadium, typically draws about 30,000 attendees. “At the heart of Broccoli City is the belief that our people deserve the best of everything – including safe spaces to gather in celebration of our culture,” festival organizers said in a statement. “In that spirit, we have decided to cancel the Broccoli City Festival 2021 this October to reduce the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 and do our part to slow the spread in the communities of color we serve.” The official festival statement also made a plug for vaccines. “In the meantime, please continue to take COVID-19 seriously,” organizers said. “Get vaccinated, get tested and take care of yourselves (and each other) so that we can all gather next year in 2022 to celebrate 10 years of Broccoli City building better communities, Black change and Black culture.” The festival has been postponed until May 2022. Organizers said tickets would be automatically refunded within 14 business days.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that people who decide not to get a COVID-19 vaccine might be making the wrong choice but defended their right to make that choice. Speaking a day after holding a news conference to condemn vaccine mandates, DeSantis agreed that the shots save lives. “There are some of those folks who may make a decision that’s not ultimately the right decision for them,” DeSantis said at a news conference Tuesday in Miami-Dade County. “There’s obviously probably people that have been hospitalized who probably wouldn’t have been if they had done that.” The discussion was a follow-up to a campaign-like event Monday, when DeSantis and the two independently elected Republican Cabinet members criticized mandates. Several Gainesville city employees spoke at the event, saying government shouldn’t force them to get inoculated. One speaker said vaccines change people’s RNA, which has led critics to say DeSantis is spreading anti-vaccine theories. But the Republican governor said he doesn’t share the opinion. “Honestly I don’t even remember him saying that. So, it’s not anything I’ve said,” he said. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines deliver a synthetic form of messenger RNA into the body, but that material is short-lived and doesn’t affect a body’s genetic material.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: At least 18 of the 20 gorillas at the city’s zoo have now tested positive for the coronavirus in an outbreak that began just days before the facility had hoped to obtain a veterinary COVID-19 vaccine for the primates, officials said Tuesday. Zoo Atlanta had announced the first positive tests among the western lowland gorillas Friday after employees noticed the gorillas had been coughing, had runny noses and showed changes in appetite. A veterinary lab at the University of Georgia returned positive tests for virus that causes the respiratory illness. Zoo Atlanta said the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirmed that at least four of the samples from the gorillas so far have tested positive for the delta variant of the virus. The zoo said it was using monoclonal antibodies to treat the gorillas at risk of developing complications from the virus. Officials said there’s no evidence the gorillas can pass the virus back to humans, and visitors are too far away to be infected by the animals. Because the gorillas live close together in four troops, zoo officials said it’s impossible to keep infected animals isolated. Officials said they believe an asymptomatic employee who cares for the gorillas passed on the virus. The employee had been fully vaccinated and was wearing protective equipment such as a mask and gloves.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Citing the high vaccination rate among residents, Gov. David Ige said there would not be another “full-scale shutdown” in the state despite the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. Instead, if further restrictions are needed, they would likely be in the form of curfews or reducing the size of social gatherings, Ige told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. There are signs the rapid rise in cases in abating, and hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients have remained stable. The seven-day average for new cases is 567, a 37% drop from two weeks ago, and the number of coronavirus tests coming back positive has declined to 6.9% from 7.8% over that same time period. As of Monday, 392 people were hospitalized in Hawaii, down from 435 a week ago. Those in intensive care units also fell, from about 100 more than a week ago to 79 on Monday. “It is getting a little better, but I think it is still too early to call it a definite trend that would provide relief,” Ige said. Any increase in hospitalization rates or those admitted to ICU units would trigger new restrictions, he said. He said curfews could reduce the number of people coming into emergency rooms because of accidents. Social gatherings could also be reduced. Currently 10 people can gather inside, and that could be cut in half. The 25-person limit for congregating outdoors could be reduced to 10.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Public health officials say crisis standards of care are imminent for the state’s most populated region as hospitals continue to be overrun with unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. The southwestern and southern Idaho regions that include Boise and Twin Falls may get official authorization to begin rationing health care – a step intended to ensure the patients most likely to survive are given access to scarce resources like intensive care unit beds – any day now, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said Tuesday. “We continue to set new records each week,” he said of coronavirus hospitalizations. “We do not see a peak in sight.” Hospitals in the northern half of the state were given permission to begin rationing care last week. “Nearly all the metrics we track are trending in the wrong direction” when it comes to the virus, deputy state epidemiologist Dr. Kathryn Turner said. But even as the state continues to see new records in the number of people hospitalized or on ventilators with COVID-19, weekly vaccination rates are dropping. And Gov. Brad Little, who has never issued a statewide mask mandate, said he’s working with Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden to see if they could use the courts to stop President Joe Biden from requiring large employers to mandate vaccines or implement routine coronavirus testing.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council agreed Tuesday to pay a total of $20.5 million to two of at least a dozen men who have had murder convictions dismissed after being allegedly framed by the same police detective. With the vote to settle the lawsuits of Armando Serrano and Jose Montanez, the council avoided the possibility of a larger payout had the suits gone to trial. That happened in 2009, when a former prison inmate who accused Reynaldo Guevara of framing him won a $21 million jury verdict, and in 2018 when another jury awarded $17 million to a man who made similar allegations. Russell Ainsworth, an attorney representing Montanez, said he hoped the city would take what happened in this case – a four-year legal fight that culminated with a judge ruling against the city by determining the case could go to trial – that it should settle the 11 pending lawsuits that involve Guevara. “I hope they settle these before running up millions of dollars in legal fees,” he said. “The city needs to resolve these cases, or they will face trial after trial.” Chicago’s police department has been dogged by decades of scandal, cover-ups and brutality. Serrano and Montanez spent 23 years in prison. A key witness in their case admitted he’d lied about hearing them confess because Guevara had threatened to beat him if he didn’t.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A nine-member task force created by the Indiana Supreme Court will help landlords and tenants resolve their disputes and access federal rental assistance resources. The Indiana Eviction Task Force will review the state’s eviction process and make recommendations for implementing a pre-eviction diversion program, including ways to more quickly and effectively distribute federal emergency rental assistance funds to landlords and tenants. Members of the task force, who include local judges and representatives from nonprofits, will submit recommendations to the high court on how the program should work by Jan. 17. “Our courts are both the front line in providing parties a fair chance to resolve their disputes and the last line of defense in getting resources … to the people who need them,” Chief Justice Loretta H. Rush wrote in her Monday order. “And that money must move quickly.” Since the federal COVID-19 eviction moratorium ended Aug. 26, Indiana has seen a surge of residential evictions. An estimated 93,000 Indiana households are behind on rent and at risk of eviction, according to National Equity Atlas’ Rent Debt Dashboard. Yet 83% of those Hoosiers haven’t applied for assistance. Since early September, Indiana’s eviction filings have risen 22% above the pre-pandemic average, state data shows.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state lost an estimated 7.2million trees in cities and farms when last year’s hurricane-force derecho swept across the state, a new Iowa Department of Natural Resources report shows. Cedar Rapids, Des Moines and Davenport suffered the largest tree losses in the Aug. 10, 2020, storm, according to the DNR report, as winds surged up to 140 mph in some counties. The storm damaged thousands of homes, business and vehicles, along with a millions of acres of cropland. Overall, Iowa cities lost about 4.5 million trees, or 13% of the state’s 34 million urban trees, the report says. The storm damaged an estimate 32,773 acres of urban tree canopy. Iowa’s rural lands lost 2.7 million trees, the state reported. The state puts the costs to Iowa at $20 million annually, with the trees no longer able to capture and store carbon that contributes to climate change, reduce air pollution, or provide windbreaks and shade that cut energy use. The state cumulatively sustained $11.5 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has called the derecho “the costliest thunderstorm in U.S. history.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state legislator accused of kicking a high school student in the testicles pleaded guilty Monday to three lesser misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and was placed on a year’s probation under a deal with the local prosecutor. Republican Rep. Mark Samsel also agreed not to use social media for personal purposes or have any contact with the high school student who said he was kicked or another another student who complained of an interaction with Samsel. The lawmaker also agreed to write letters of apology to both students. Samsel had faced three misdemeanor criminal charges of battery following what the local prosecutor described as “rude, insulting or angry” interactions with two students, as a substitute teacher during an April 28 art class at the high school in Wellsville. One student told a sheriff’s deputy that Samsel had manhandled him and kicked him, according to an affidavit from the deputy. The lawmaker said in a Facebook post last month that “extreme” stress caused him to have “an isolated episode of mania with psychotic features” in a classroom. He disclosed he was undergoing mental health treatment and surrendered his state substitute teacher’s license. But Mary Woods, whose niece had a class with Samsel the same day, said he should have received time in jail.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Citing a national shortage of a drug increasingly used to treat COVID-19 patients, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Tuesday that the federal government is going to cap the supply to states. The drug company Regeneron makes the treatment, a “monoclonal antibody” approved for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 patients. “Health care providers will no longer be able to order the treatments directly,” Beshear said in a news release. “Instead, state governments will supervise the distribution of a capped number of treatments delivered to them each week.” The shortage comes amid an “extraordinary demand” for the treatment, Beshear said. Generally administered intravenously, it has been shown to be successful at limiting the severity of illness in some patients and keeping them out of the hospital. But demand has skyrocketed as COVID-19 cases soared in recent weeks. Beshear said he worries too many Kentuckians will hear about the antibody treatment and rely on getting it instead of a COVID-19 shot. “What this shortage ought to tell you is that if you’re unvaccinated, and you get really sick, not only might there not be a bed in the hospital for you because they are so full, but that monoclonal antibody treatment might not be there for you, either,” Beshear said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Louisiana Department of Revenue is granting filing extensions to taxpayers in 25 parishes whose homes and businesses were affected by the impacts of Hurricane Ida. The automatic extension due date is Jan. 3, 2022, for excise, franchise, income, severance and withholding taxes with original or extended due dates on or after Aug. 26 and before Jan. 3 eligible. This is an extension to file the applicable tax returns, not to pay any taxes due, the department said in a news release. Payments submitted after the original deadlines are subject to penalties and interest. The extension applies to those in Ascension, Assumption, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson, Lafourche, Livingston, Orleans, Plaquemines, Pointe Coupee, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. Helena, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Martin, St. Mary, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Terrebonne, Washington, West Baton Rouge and West Feliciana parishes. In addition, the department said people may be eligible for state sales tax refunds for personal property destroyed in a natural disaster, such as clothing, furniture, electronics, recreational equipment and appliances not permanently attached to a house or building. Refunds are limited to items not covered by insurance or any other type of reimbursement.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: The state has a new high-speed toll plaza near its southern border. The Maine Turnpike plaza in York opened early Wednesday, just as the old one located to its south was deactivated. The new plaza has six high-speed toll lanes that don’t require drivers to stop, WMTW-TV reports. The demolition of the old plaza is expected to take a little more than a year. State officials have said drivers will continue to pass through the old toll booth lanes during the dismantling. The speed limit will be 10 mph. Maine Turnpike Authority has said the old plaza “does not provide the modern, open, highway speed electronic tolling that travelers now expect and deserve.” It has also said the new plaza will be safer and much more efficient.\n\nMaryland\n\nEaston: A Confederate monument is set to be moved from a courthouse lawn on the Eastern Shore after local officials voted Tuesday night to relocate it to a Virginia battleground. The Talbot County Council voted 3-2 to approve a resolution to move the “Talbot Boys” statue that commemorates more than 80 soldiers who fought for the Confederacy. The statue dedicated in 1916 is thought to be the last Confederate monument still standing on public property in Maryland besides cemeteries and battlefields. For years, local activists have fought for the removal of the Jim Crow-era statue on the lawn adjacent to a former slave market site in Easton. In May, civil rights advocates sued the county seeking the court-ordered removal of the statue depicting a soldier with a Confederate flag draped over one shoulder, calling it a racist symbol of oppression and claiming it is unconstitutional and illegal. Singer Maggie Rogers, an Easton native, has been among those pushing for its removal, taking to social media to drum up support and posting videos about the County Council meeting. Private funds will cover the cost of relocating the statue to the private Cross Keys Battlefield in Harrisonburg, Virginia.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: For the first time, the city’s voters have narrowed the field of mayoral candidates to two women of color who will face off against each other in November. City Councilors Michelle Wu and Annissa Essaibi George topped the five-person race in Tuesday’s preliminary runoff. They bested acting Mayor Kim Janey, City Councilor Andrea Campbell and John Barros, the city’s former economic development chief. All five were candidates of color – a major shift away from two centuries of Boston politics dominated by white men. Wu’s parents immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan. Essaibi George describes herself as a first-generation Arab Polish American. Whoever wins Nov. 2 will make history in a city where, for the past 200 years, the office has been held exclusively by white men. Earlier this year, Janey became the first Black Bostonian and first woman to occupy the city’s top office in an acting capacity after former Mayor Marty Walsh stepped down to become President Joe Biden’s labor secretary. Wu and Essaibi George’s advancement to the general election ushers in a new era for the city that has wrestled with racial and ethnic strife. All the candidates in Tuesday’s primary were Democrats. Mayoral races in Boston do not include party primaries.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Provocative pro-Palestinian protests outside a Jewish synagogue are protected by the Constitution’s First Amendment, a federal court appeals said Wednesday. The court declined to stop the demonstrations or set restrictions in Ann Arbor. The protests have occurred on a weekly basis since 2003, with people holding signs that say “Jewish Power Corrupts,” “Stop Funding Israel” and “End the Palestinian Holocaust.” Members of Beth Israel Synagogue, including some Holocaust survivors, said the protests have interfered with their Saturday worship and caused emotional distress. “But the congregants have not alleged that the protesters ever blocked them from using their synagogue or that the protests were even audible from inside the building,” Judge Jeffrey Sutton said. He said a proposed remedy – a 1,000-foot buffer and limits on signs – would likely violate the First Amendment. “The key obstacle is the robust protections that the First Amendment affords to nonviolent protests on matters of public concern,” Sutton said in summarizing the case, joined by Judge David McKeague. Judge Eric Clay agreed with the result but on different grounds. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief in support of the activists, saying the protests are entitled to protection even if “offensive, upsetting and distasteful.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Attorneys asked a judge Wednesday to dismiss a new manslaughter charge against the former suburban Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop this spring. Former Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter has said she mistakenly drew her firearm instead of her stun gun as Wright was trying to drive away from officers during the stop in April. Potter is recorded on body-camera video an instant after the shooting saying she drew the wrong weapon. Potter is white. Wright was Black. His death sparked several nights of protests. Prosecutors charged Potter with second-degree manslaughter. Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office later took over the case, added a count of first-degree manslaughter earlier this month. Potter is scheduled to stand trial in December. The second-degree manslaughter charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison; first-degree has a maximum 15-year sentence. Potter’s attorneys, Paul Engh and Earl Gray, filed a motion Wednesday seeking to dismiss the new charge. They argued that Minnesota statutes define first-degree manslaughter as endangering someone by recklessly handling a gun or other dangerous weapon and that Potter didn’t consciously realize she was holding a gun or was about to fire it.\n\nMississippi\n\nOlive Branch: A local startup is trying to turn a rice-production byproduct into a way to avoid water shortages and reduce carbon emissions. Glanris President and CEO Bryan Eagle said he knows it’s a big goal, but everyone needs to do something to try to change the world. “We’re running out of water ... we’re past the tipping point where there are too many people and not enough fresh water,” Eagle said. While water is a renewable resource, global demand is quickly outpacing the rate at which aquifers and other fresh water sources renew. So Glanris buys rice hulls – they make up 20% of the weight of a rice harvest and have to be removed before the rice is eaten – and turns it into a water-filtrating activated carbon. The company’s patented process is relatively simple, Eagle said. The rice hulls are put into a rotary kiln and roasted at 400 degrees Celsius for about 8 minutes. Coconut shells, which have been previously used for water purification, need to be roasted at 1,000 degrees Celsius for about 12 to 18 hours. After roasting, the rice hulls are cooled and put back into the containers in which they were delivered. In most other cases, rice hulls are burned, releasing greenhouse gases. “We’re stopping that burning and creating a stable carbon,” Eagle said. “What we’re really addressing is climate change.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The state’s new health czar lamented that the pandemic has become so embroiled in politics as another child died of COVID-19 and as the coronavirus sickened record numbers of youths. Donald Kauerauf, who began serving three weeks ago as the director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, told lawmakers Tuesday that “we failed, as a nation, public health because we got to this point.” In emergency planning, Kauerauf said, you plan for the “absolutely worst” scenario – but “we didn’t plan for this reaction from the public.” And he said it was crucial to retool the public message as he works toward a goal of getting about 80% of the state’s residents vaccinated. Currently, 52.8% have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, state data shows. “We’ve got to start something new,” Kauerauf said. The state just ended what is shaping up to be one of the deadliest months of the pandemic. Data lags by several weeks, but COVID-19 deaths in Missouri have already reached 878 in the five weeks that span August – more than triple the numbers seen this past spring, before the highly infections delta variant of the virus took hold, according to state data analyzed by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. A child died last week in the St. Louis area, the Post-Dispatch reports.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A group advocating for “right-to-work” policies is suing to strike down the state’s Clean Campaign Act, arguing it contains a provision that violates political speech protections. Montana Citizens for Right to Work filed the lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in Helena against Montana Commissioner of Political Practices Jeff Mangan, the Montana State News Bureau reports. A “right-to-work” law prohibits a company and a union from signing a contract that would require workers to pay dues or fees to the union that represents them. The lawsuit argues that a provision in the Clean Campaign Act is unconstitutional because it requires political committees to notify candidates of negative mailers, but mailers endorsing candidates are not subject to the same requirement. The lawsuit asks a judge to strike down the entire Clean Campaign Act and prohibit Mangan from following through on prosecuting Montana Citizens for Right to Work over a previous alleged violation. The filing appears to be a preemptive strike at the state’s top political cop, claiming Mangan is preparing a civil prosecution against the group for violating laws on notifying candidates if a negative mailer is sent out within 10 days of Election Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Creighton University plans to invest $37 million in a new residence hall for freshmen that will be the institution’s first new dormitory since 2006. Most of the 400-student dormitory will be divided into four-person suites that will each have two bedrooms, two living spaces and a shared bathroom. Each floor will also have kitchenettes, and there will be a larger kitchen on the second floor, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The hall will include an interfaith prayer space and two prayer rooms for Muslim students. It will also have an elevated outdoor courtyard capable of hosting gatherings and events. The new residence hall will be built a few blocks east of the new $75 million CL Werner Center for Health Sciences Education that will house Creighton’s School of Medicine. Both new buildings are slated to open in the fall of 2023. Currently, Creighton has eight dorms. All unmarried undergraduate students from outside the Omaha area are required to live in a residence hall for their first two years.\n\nNevada\n\nHenderson: The city and Las Vegas Valley Water District say they’re joining forces for enforcement patrols to identify water wasters in suburban southern Nevada. On Wednesday and Thursday, Henderson Conservation Awareness Assistants and LVVWD’s Water Waste Investigators will tour commercial and residential areas known for high water use to make sure people are following watering rules. Fall seasonal water schedule rules changed Sept. 1, and officials say water conservation is more crucial following the first-ever Colorado River water shortage declaration in August. Climate change, drought and high demand combined to trigger mandatory delivery restrictions to states, farmers and tribes that rely on the parched river and its shrinking reservoirs. Watering is now limited throughout southern Nevada to no more than three days per week based on a property owner’s regional assignment. Sunday watering is prohibited. Customers violating watering restrictions or found letting water spray or flow off their property can face city administrative water waste fines. Henderson conservation and customer official Tina Chen told KTNV-TV the water waste patrols show that everyone is striving toward a common goal of eliminating as much water waste as possible.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Two agencies in the state are working on resettlement plans for Afghan refugees. The refugees are currently being screened at military bases before they arrive in New Hampshire. Jeff Thielman, president and CEO of the International Institute of New England, said the Manchester agency has agreed to receive 50 evacuees from Afghanistan. “We’re all going to work together to provide people with the basic needs, food, clothing, shelter,” Thielman told WMUR-TV. The agency will also work to help refugees with long-term needs such as education and employment. Another agency, Ascentria Care Alliance in Concord, has proposed resettling 100 Afghan refugees. Both agencies have submitted proposals to the U.S. State Department. Under a program called “Operation Allies Welcome,” some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States, including translators, drivers and others who helped the U.S. military during the 20-year war and who feared reprisals by the Taliban after they quickly seized power last month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state intends to divest assets from the parent company of Ben & Jerry’s after a preliminary review found the ice cream maker engaged in a boycott of Israel or Israeli-controlled territories, the Division of Investment announced Tuesday. Officials warned Bergen County-based Unilever in a letter that its subsidiary’s actions had triggered New Jersey’s 5-year-old law requiring state pension funds to divest from pro-boycott businesses. New Jersey holdings in Unilever total approximately $182 million in stocks, bonds and short-term paper, according to the Treasury Department. British conglomerate Unilever plc, a multinational consumer goods company that employs 1,600 people in Englewood Cliffs, has 90 days to appeal the decision. Unilever acquired the ice cream company, known for embracing progressive causes, in 2000. The contract grants the Ben & Jerry’s board independence to make decisions about its social mission, Unilever has said. Ben & Jerry’s, a Vermont company founded by two Jewish Americans, said in July that it would continue operating in Israel but stop sales in controversial settlements located in Palestinian territory in the West Bank and Jerusalem. It is not a boycott of Israel, the company said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Supreme Court has ruled state law doesn’t require that vehicle taillights all be working perfectly – only that they work well enough for their intended use. A ruling Monday by the state’s highest court stems from a man’s conviction for violating a state law requiring that certain vehicle equipment be in “good working order.” To conclude that “good working order” means free from flaws or defects “would impose an absurd standard for vehicles on New Mexico roads and highways because it would require that equipment be in perfect condition, beyond a more reasonable expectation that equipment functions for its intended use,” Justice S. Shannon Bacon wrote for the court. The case began when a Bernalillo County sheriff’s deputy pulled the man over because one bulb in a tail lamp didn’t work despite the rest of the lamp being illuminated. The man was convicted both for driving a vehicle with defective equipment and for driving under the influence, and his appeals argued there weren’t grounds to pull him over because his tail lamp was operating well enough. The Supreme Court’s ruling sends the case back to district court for further proceedings.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Theater royalty welcomed back boisterous audiences to “Wicked,” “The Lion King” and “Hamilton” for the first time since the start of the pandemic, marking Tuesday as the unofficial return of Broadway. Kristin Chenoweth surprised the crowd at “Wicked” by appearing onstage for a speech on the same stage where she became a star years ago. “There’s no place like home,” she said, lifting a line from the musical. The crowd hooted, hollered and gave her a standing ovation. Julie Taymor, the director and costume designer of “The Lion King,” congratulated her audience for the courage and enthusiasm to lead the way. “Theater, as we know, is the lifeblood and soul of the city,” she said. “It’s time for us to live again.” And Lin-Manuel Miranda at “Hamilton” summed up the feeling of a lot of people when he said: “I don’t ever want to take live theater for granted.” The trio of shows were beaten by Bruce Springsteen’s concert show in June and the opening of the new play “Pass Over” on Aug. 22, as well as the reopening of two other big musicals, “Hadestown” and “Waitress.” But the return of the three mega-musicals – the spiritual anchors of modern Broadway’s success – is an important signal that Broadway is back, despite pressure and uncertainty from the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The flap over absentee ballots in the 2020 election resurfaced Wednesday at the General Assembly as Republicans gave final approval to legislation that would limit Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein’s ability to enter future legal settlements. The bill, now headed to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk following a party-line House vote, was introduced by GOP lawmakers angry about being left out of negotiations last year between Stein’s office and a labor-affiliated group that sued state election officials. Republican legislative leaders had already intervened to become defendants in the lawsuit. The enforced settlement, which ultimately was challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, increased from three to nine the number of days mailed absentee ballots could be received after Election Day and still count. To prevent what they call “collusive settlements” in the future, GOP members passed the bill stating legal settlements challenging state law or the constitution must be backed by the Senate leader and House speaker when they are named parties. The 2020 settlement broke up bipartisan legislation approved to carry out the fall elections during the pandemic that had kept the ballot grace period at three days, GOP Rep. Destin Hall of Caldwell County said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A state official told a legislative committee Tuesday that the state’s largest and most expensive leased office space is now mostly utilized, after it sat nearly vacant for months when an agency allowed its more than 400 employees to work from home indefinitely. The Associated Press reported in May that taxpayers are on the hook for nearly $3 million in rent over the next two years for the North Dakota Information Technology Department’s unused office space in Bismarck. The report spurred a legislative review of all state leases. Greg Hoffman, the Information Technology Department’s director of administration, told the interim Government Administration Committee that about 90% of the 85,000-square-foot leased space in a newly remodeled, privately owned office building in north Bismarck is now being used. The Department of Environmental Quality last month moved about 140 of its employees from a leased office building just north of the state Capitol to the IT department’s space. Hoffman said the environmental agency is subleasing two floors of the building at $12 a square foot; the IT agency pays $15 a square foot to lease the building. Other agencies also are using the building’s meeting spaces, he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Three of the prison guards involved in the February death of inmate Michael McDaniel were previously disciplined for excessive use of force or not intervening when inmates were in danger or when guards used unjustified force, records show. The disciplinary documents, obtained by the Associated Press, show a number of past incidents in which Lt. Bruce Brown and correctional officers Adam Causey and Jerry Perkins were reprimanded for actions similar to those made in connection with McDaniel’s in-custody death. The three men were among the seven employees at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient who were fired last month after a state investigation into the death of the Black inmate found guards used unjustified force, and a supervisor failed to intervene. The Franklin County Coroner’s office had declared McDaniel’s death a homicide and ruled the cause as a “stress-induced sudden cardiac death.” The autopsy detailed injuries to his head, face, shoulders, wrists, hands, knees, feet, toes and abdomen. He also had multiple rib fractures, and the coroner found evidence of heart disease. Security footage released by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction in July showed McDaniel, 55, collapsing on his own and being taken down to the floor by guards at least 16 times before he died Feb. 6.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Southeastern Oklahoma State University, which was found to have discriminated against a transgender English professor, must reinstate her with tenure, a federal appeals court ruled. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver on Monday ordered professor Rachel Tudor to be reinstated with tenure and ordered a lower court to recalculate how much pay and attorney fees she is entitled to receive. A federal jury in Oklahoma City previously awarded Tudor more than $1 million after finding the university discriminated against her and wrongfully denied her tenure. But the trial court later reduced that award because of a $300,000 state cap on non-economic damages. Both parties appealed. Tudor began working at Southeastern in 2004. She began presenting as a woman in 2007 by wearing women’s clothing, styling her hair in a feminine way and going by the name Rachel, according to her lawsuit against the university. After she was denied tenure in 2010, Tudor filed a discrimination complaint. She was fired the following year. The U.S. Department of Justice also sued the university, leading to a settlement with Southeastern agreeing to hold mandatory anti-discrimination training and to implement policy changes to reduce discrimination.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Silver Falls State Park officials are planning to log about 100 acres in the park’s backcountry beginning this month in forest that was partially burned by the Beachie Creek Fire last September. The plan sparked concern from advocates and scientists who feel that the park should let the forest regenerate naturally and that the project is more about earning money than sound forest practice. The timber being removed has an estimated value of more than $1 million, and the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department estimates the project will fetch a $300,000 profit that will be used for future “forest health programs,” parks officials said. The plan includes two projects: a logging operation in the backcountry and the removal of about 200 hazard trees from around historic buildings. Both projects are far from the waterfalls most people visit at Silver Falls but are close to and along some popular backcountry mountain bike and hiking trails, including the upper section of the popular Catamount Trail. The larger backcountry project, called the “Beachie Creek Salvage,” could begin this month and would produce 2.2 million board feet of timber. Trees logged would come from forest that’s fully burned, partially burned and green trees, interim park manager Chris Gilliand said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Police announced a new three-year contract with the city Tuesday that offers raises, along with a $1,500 bonus, but lets the city make some of the disciplinary reforms it sought. The Philadelphia Police Department’s more than 6,000 officers will see raises of 2.75% this year and 3.5% in each of the next two years. City officials, meanwhile, promised more transparency in the disciplinary process a year after protests against police brutality rocked Philadelphia and the nation. They said the reforms increase penalties for wrongdoing, add a civilian to the three-person review panel and ban officers from fraternizing with hate groups. There were no changes to the residency rule, which allows officers to move outside the city after five years on the force. Mayor Jim Kenney, at a news conference Tuesday, called that disappointing, saying he believes they should remain city residents. The contract, handed down by an arbiter, also lets the police union know when any personnel files are requested by city prosecutors, the local Fraternal Order of Police said. The office is currently led by District Attorney Larry Krasner, who has feuded with the union and this year charged three former homicide detectives with perjury in an exoneration case that cost the city a nearly $10 million settlement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWakefield: Researchers are hoping eight recently released young great white sharks will yield insights into some of the questions scientists still have about the famous species. The sharks were released after being tagged with tracking devices by researchers this summer at the Atlantic Shark Institute of Wakefield, officials announced Tuesday. The devices will allow the scientists to locate the fish for 10 years and learn more about their movement and patterns. “It’s the most white sharks that have been tagged in this study to date and will aid considerably in filling in some of the missing pieces for this iconic species of shark,” said Jon F. Dodd, executive director of the institute, which has been working with the O’Seas Conservation Foundation. “In several parts of the world, the great white shark is determined to be critically endangered, and that makes this research all the more vital.” The most important part of the tagging was that most of the sharks were young, Dodd said. In the past few years, about 300 sharks have been tagged, but most were older. This time around, the youngest shark is a few weeks old, Dodd said. “Largely absent from the majority of those tags have been the much younger white sharks, and much about their behavior and habits is still largely unknown,” Dodd said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCamden: Gov. Henry McMaster toured an elementary school Wednesday that he said is an excellent example of how to fight COVID-19 in schools without requiring everyone to wear masks. Camden Elementary School starts with a thermal scanner that takes the temperature of every student as they walk in without them having to stop. Any student warmer than normal is pulled aside and checked more carefully. The school and others in the Kershaw County School District have isolation rooms set up where any students who might have COVID-19 can be placed. When a possible case is identified, school nurses and others do a careful tracing to figure out whether any students were within 3 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes, the federal guideline for having to quarantine. They review classroom seating charts, video from school buses and even game film from football games to try to pull out only students who are considered close contacts. Classes are carefully measured to keep students the right distance apart, and while half the students in a grade go to the cafeteria for lunch – sitting three students at an eight-student table – the other half stay in their classrooms. “This is how you do it,” McMaster said. “This is how you win in South Carolina.” Kershaw County schools do not have a mask mandate this school year, following the wishes of Republican legislators who put a one-year provision in the state budget meant to prevent school districts from requiring masks.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Within days after authorities began investigating allegations of a guard sexually abusing prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary, two of the alleged victims were dead. But with officials being tight-lipped about both a criminal investigation into the matter and an ongoing probe by the state into workplace misconduct at the prison, it’s unclear if the deaths played a part in Gov. Kristi Noem’s firing of prison administrators earlier this summer. Michael Noland, 23, died March 27, and Michael Hand, 25, died April 3. Both men were serving prison sentences at the Sioux Falls prison and were found unresponsive in their cells. The Department of Corrections announced the deaths as suicides, while the Division of Criminal Investigation and the Attorney General’s Office began a months­long criminal investigation into former penitentiary guard Rian Fitzpatrick, who last week was formally indicted and charged with engaging in sexual acts with prisoners. The indictment file says the crimes began in early February and went on until mid-March, while a public advocate representing Fitzpatrick said last week in court that he was employed with the state until only recently.\n\nTennessee\n\nFranklin: An alderman says he was “appalled” to see the state make national headlines in the past several weeks due to unruly school board meetings that devolved into chaos, threats and heckling over coronavirus protocols. The first recent meeting to gain national attention was an August Williamson County school board meeting at which hundreds of unruly anti-mask parents interrupted the meeting, screamed at parents who supported pandemic safety protocols, and ended the meeting with threatening health care workers. The viral meeting garnered attention and public remarks from President Joe Biden, who condemned the attack. “I was appalled,” said John Schroer, an at-large alderman for Franklin. “We have parents fighting parents.” At a Rutherford County meeting, adults heckled a high school student who shared that his grandmother died from COVID-19. One man shouted at him to shut up. Others laughed at the teen. “He was mocked by adults in the crowd,” Schroer said. “I’ve never in my life been embarrassed to be a Tennessean, but I was embarrassed to be a part of that group known as Tennesseans treating other Tennesseans that way.” Schroer likened COVID-19 protections to prohibiting smoking indoors because of secondhand smoke and asked Volunteers to care for one another.\n\nTexas\n\nMidland: Federal officials have cleared the way for construction of a dump in West Texas that could hold spent nuclear fuel for up to 40 years. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a license to Interim Storage Partners LLC to build and run a facility that could take up to 5,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel rods from power plants and 231 million tons of other radioactive waste. The decision puts the federal agency on a collision course with state officials in Texas, where opposition to nuclear waste storage has been building for years. Last week, Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill that purports to prohibit the storage or transportation of high-level nuclear waste such as spent fuel rods through the state. “Texas will not become America’s nuclear waste dumping ground,” Abbott tweeted Tuesday. Environmental groups including the Sierra Club have filed federal lawsuits to block the project, arguing that the discovery of groundwater under the site makes it unsafe to store radioactive waste there. Interim Storage Partners plan to build the facility next to an existing dump site in Andrews County, near the Texas-New Mexico state line, for low-level waste such as protective clothing and other material that has been exposed to radioactivity.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A judge tossed out a lawsuit filed by James Huntsman, a member of one of the state’s most prominent families and brother of a former governor, against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in a ruling issued Tuesday. Huntsman had accused the Utah-based faith known widely as the Mormon church of fraud and sought to recover millions of dollars in contributions, saying the church spent donations solicited for charity on commercial purposes. Judge Stephen Wilson rejected Huntsman’s claims and said no reasonable juror would believe that Latter-day Saint leaders made false statements about how tithing funds would be used. In a lawsuit filed in March, Huntsman said he was defrauded out of millions during the 24 years he gave 10% of his annual income to the church. He is the brother of former U.S. diplomat and ex-Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. and son of late billionaire philanthropist Jon Huntsman Sr. He alleged that the church has “repeatedly and publicly lied” about the use of billions of dollars in contributions meant to pay for missionary work, temples and other educational and charitable work. Church spokesperson Eric Hawkins said the church is “grateful” the judge granted its motion for summary judgment in a statement Tuesday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont is planning to freeze tuition for the fourth straight year, University President Suresh Garimella said Wednesday. In a statement, Garimella said he would ask the university’s trustees to approve his proposal not to increase tuition next year for any students, regardless of their degree level or residency status. Room and board charges will remain flat for the third consecutive year. Comprehensive fees for undergraduates will also remain frozen. “Students graduating in UVM’s Class of 2023 will complete four years of study at the state’s flagship paying the same for tuition as they did when they started,” Garimella wrote. “We are intensely focused on reducing student debt so Catamounts can build their lives and careers without the burden of large loan payments.” Undergraduate tuition, room and board, and fees for Vermont students currently total about $32,350. For nonresidents, the cost is about $57,250. Garimella first froze tuition in November 2019, during his first six months as president. He has continued the freeze since then. Garimella said the school is committed to maintaining affordability for a college education for UVM students and their families.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A global conservation nonprofit and the state’s largest electricity utility have announced plans to develop what they say will be a large-scale solar project on former surface mines in the southwest Virginia coal fields. Dominion Energy Virginia plans to repurpose about 1,200 acres of the former Red Onion surface mine and surrounding properties for the 50-megawatt Highlands Solar project in Wise and Dickenson County, the company said in a news release with its project partner, The Nature Conservancy. The project will be developed within The Nature Conservancy’s Cumberland Forest Project, a land conservation initiative launched in 2019, and adjacent areas. Brad Kreps, director of The Nature Conservancy’s Clinch Valley Program, said in a statement that the hope is for the project to develop a model that can be replicated in other coal mining regions across the U.S. Construction would tentatively begin in 2024 or 2025, subject to review and approval from state regulators. The Nature Conservancy announced a similar initiative two months ago with two solar energy firms. Taken together, the utility-scale solar projects within the Cumberland Forest Project will cover nearly 1,700 acres and generate an estimated 120 megawatts of solar energy, according to the news release.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Washington Department of Natural Resources lands east of the Cascades will reopen to public access Thursday. The department closed those lands July 23 because of extreme heat, drought and wildfire danger and large fires burning across the West that had stretched wildfire resources. At the time of the closure, the number of fire ignitions in the state was about double the 10-year average, state Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz said in a news release. Franz said conditions have improved dramatically thanks to the tireless efforts of firefighters, an expanded air fleet, and a focus on attacking fires quickly to limit spread. Firefighters have worked on approximately 1,750 fires that burned more than 650,000 acres, which is significantly less acreage burned than last year, she said. More than 98% of DNR fires were caught during the initial attack this fire season, she said. “After months of moving from fire to fire, we are optimistic that we have turned a corner,” Franz said. “I am extraordinarily grateful to everyone who complied with this closure for sharing in the sacrifice necessary to prevent wildfires.” A statewide burn ban remains in effect and is set to expire Sept. 30. More than three-quarters of Washington state remains in drought conditions, Franz said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Tests show a type of bacteria that causes the severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease has resurfaced at a state-run hospital, health officials said. Routine screening found Legionella bacteria at the Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital in Huntington. The hospital is operated by the state Department of Health and Human Resources. The building where the bacteria was detected did not house patients. In April the hospital replaced all faucets and a hot water heater and installed a recirculation pump after the bacteria first was detected in two sinks in the hospital’s administration building. The bacteria in the latest tests was found in the same places as in April: a CEO restroom and a former human resources break room in a basement, the DHHR said in a news release. Legionnaire’s disease can be dangerous to people with lung or immune system problems. It is spread by inhaling droplets from contaminated water sources. The disease can be treated with antibiotics.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Election clerks are reacting with a mixture of concern and confusion to the first inquiry made by a special investigator hired by Republicans to examine how the 2020 presidential election was run in the battleground state. Based on an Associated Press survey of all 72 county election clerks, the email Monday from the lead investigator landed in the junk folders of at least seven counties and wasn’t received by at least 11 others. Several that did get it flagged it as a security risk. Clerks for at least six counties said they would not be forwarding the email to municipalities in their jurisdiction as requested by the investigator, former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, a conservative who last year told a group of Trump supporters that the election had been stolen. “If there was fraud, it wasn’t in my county,” Christopher Marlow, the Lincoln County clerk, told the AP. “We keep very accurate voter lists and we are diligent in our work. All our voters are alive and received one vote each!” Former President Donald Trump won Lincoln County with 61% of the vote in 2020. The pushback and confusion from clerks is just the latest twist in Wisconsin, where conservatives at Trump’s encouragement are ordering investigations into the 2020 election. President Joe Biden carried the state by nearly 21,000 votes.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A state legislator is no longer among the Republicans challenging Liz Cheney for a U.S. House seat in 2022. Republicans should unite to defeat Cheney, state Rep. Chuck Gray, of Casper, said in a statement suspending his campaign Tuesday. Former President Donald Trump last week endorsed Cheyenne lawyer Harriet Hageman in the Republican U.S. House primary. Cheney, also a member of the GOP, reacted to the endorsement by saying: “Bring it.” Gray was among more than half a dozen Republicans to challenge Cheney for her vote to impeach Trump for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Gray is the third candidate, after Cheyenne attorney Darin Smith and Sheridan County Republican Party Chairman Bryan Miller, to suspend or end a campaign after Trump’s endorsement of Hageman, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Those still in the race include state Sen. Anthony Bouchard, of Cheyenne, and retired U.S. Army Col. Denton Knapp, of Gillette.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/30/whopper-swordfish-alaska-quaketsunami-masks-indoors-foolish-news-around-states/117689494/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The U.S. Department of Justice won’t help defend Republican U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama against a civil lawsuit that claims he helped to incite the Jan. 6 violence at the Capitol. In a court filing Tuesday, the Justice Department urged a judge to deny the congressman’s request for immunity as a federal employee over his remarks at a pro-Donald Trump rally that occurred before the rioting at the .Capitol. Brooks had argued that he was acting within the scope of his office when he spoke at a rally Jan. 6 and thus was due the legal protections afforded federal employees and members of Congress who are facing civil lawsuits over their jobs. The Justice Department said the event was campaign-related and it would not certify that Brooks was acting in his official capacity. Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, who served as a House manager in Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial, filed a lawsuit in March against the former president and others, including Brooks, whose actions he charges led to the events.\n\nAlaska\n\nPerryville: A powerful earthquake that struck just off Alaska’s southern coast caused prolonged shaking and prompted tsunami warnings that sent people scrambling for shelters. Residents reported only minor damage, but officials said that could change after sunrise and people get a better look. The National Tsunami Warning Center canceled the warnings early Thursday when the biggest wave, of just over a half-foot, was recorded in Old Harbor. A tsunami warning that had also been issued for Hawaii was also canceled, and officials said there was no threat to Guam, American Samoa or the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. The warning for Alaska covered nearly a 1,000-mile stretch from Prince William Sound to Samalga Island, near the end of the Aleutian Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was magnitude 8.2 and hit 56 miles east southeast of Perryville at about 8:15 p.m. Wednesday. The quake was about 29 below the surface of the ocean according to USGS. Several other earthquakes, some with with preliminary magnitudes of 6.2 and 5.6, occurred in the same area within hours of the first one, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Drought conditions still exist across Arizona but recent monsoon rain has had a significant impact for the better. The latest drought monitor “shows substantial improvement” in the two most severe drought categories, now reporting 52% of Arizona in either extreme or exceptional drought, down from 84% last week, the National Weather Service office in Phoenix said Thursday. The month isn’t even over yet and Tucson has recorded its wettest July in the city’s history. The southern Arizona city received 7.08 inches of rain as of Wednesday, according to the National weather service. That breaks the previous July record of 6.8 inches set in 2017. Because of an active monsoon season, Tucson has been hit with more than 5 inches of rain since last July 23. Meteorologists said the normal rainfall amount for Tucson in July is about 2 inches. Meanwhile, Phoenix has received 1.67 inches of rain this month, its wettest July since 2013.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas Board of Trustees approved a plan to keep a statue of the late Democratic Sen. J. William Fulbright on its flagship campus, despite calls to remove it because of his support of segregation. The board approved a resolution that called for keeping the statue at its location on the Fayetteville campus, but with “contextualization” about Fulbright’s legacy. The resolution cited a new Arkansas law that prohibits removing or relocating monuments without state approval. The resolution approved also called for keeping Fulbright’s name on the Fayetteville campus’s college of arts and sciences. Fulbright was a University of Arkansas graduate and served as the university’s president for three years starting in 1939. He is known for creating an international education scholarship in his name. But the university has faced calls to remove his statue and his name from the school over his opposition to integration and civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Jose Sanchez Villalobos, the architect of a subterranean tunnel that shuttled tons of marijuana from Mexico to the U.S. for drug cartel Sinaola under Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was sentenced in San Diego federal court to 10 years and one month in custody for a drug-distribution conspiracy – just over the 10-year minimum mandatory sentence. Villalobos’ tunnel linked a Tijuana warehouse to another in Otay Mesa and was equipped with a hydraulic elevator, electric rail cars, lighting, wooden floors and a storeroom. It was a feat of engineering that U.S. authorities would later marvel at as the “most elaborate smuggling tunnel” to be uncovered along the U.S.-Mexico border at the time. In a plea agreement in December, Sanchez admitted to planning, financing and supervising the construction of “multiple” cross-border tunnels from 2010 to 2012, as well as overseeing their operation as smuggling conduits. Sanchez, 58, has already served most of his prison term. Since his arrest in Mexico in 2012, he has spent about eight years in custody there and another year and a half in San Diego after being extradited to face charges in the U.S. With good behavior credits, he is likely due to be released within a few months.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Boulder County has suspended consideration of a permit needed for a long-sought reservoir expansion by Denver Water until a federal court hears a lawsuit filed by the utility that alleged the county is stalling on the permit and jeopardizing the project. The county on Tuesday said it had agreed to a Denver Water request to put the process on hold pending the outcome of the suit, which Denver Water filed in U.S. District Court on July 14. It canceled public hearings on the project set for August and September. Denver Water contended it has made good-faith efforts over several years on a local-use land review needed to begin work on Gross Reservoir. It alleged the county has used the process to delay the review, jeopardizing federal and other deadlines for the project. In June, county planning and permitting staff determined that Denver Water hadn’t provided satisfactory answers to requests for information on the project. The Gross Reservoir Expansion Project would be the largest construction project in the history of Boulder County. It would raise the 340-foot Gross Dam by an additional 131 feet, increasing reservoir capacity by 77,000 acre-feet. Environmentalists and many local residents argued it will cause serious impacts to the environment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal appeals court overturned a lower court order issued last year that required Connecticut to resume fingerprinting for gun permit applicants despite the state’s suspension of those services because of the coronavirus pandemic. A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York vacated the preliminary injunction on technical grounds. The judges also noted local police resumed fingerprinting shortly before the June 2020 preliminary injunction was issued, and state police resumed the services shortly after it was issued. The Connecticut Citizens Defense League and six people seeking gun permits sued Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, the state’s public safety commissioner and local police chiefs in federal court in New Haven, saying the suspension of fingerprinting services violated their Second Amendment gun rights. Judge Jeffrey Meyer agreed and issued the injunction requiring fingerprinting to resume. The appeals court judges said the six plaintiffs’ claims were moot because fingerprinting resumed, and the defense league did not have legal standing to be a part of the case.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The city is granting some parking violators amnesty as it returns to normal operations. The city issued about 1,800 tickets on Monday and Tuesday to residents for failing to update their parking permits or move their cars for street cleaning, Mayor Mike Purzycki said in a news release. The city announced last week that enforcement suspended because of the pandemic would resume, but because so many people were ticketed, the mayor said the city will offer limited ticket amnesty this week only. Tickets issued for these violations between Monday and Friday will be converted to warnings and anyone who has paid will get a refund, Purzycki said, but “ticketing will resume as normal” starting Monday. The amnesty does not apply to metered parking tickets or any other parking enforcement violation. City officials are reminding residents that other city services that have resumed include ticketing, booting and towing of vehicles for traffic and parking violations and for delinquent fines and fees, water utility service disconnections for delinquencies and sheriff sales.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The White House Historical Association unveiled three new historical markers at the northern end of Lafayette Park – less than a block from the White House. The three large horizontal tablets have illustrations and text that address different issues. One focuses on the construction of the White House, with an emphasis on the fact that enslaved people and paid laborers took part. The second focuses on former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who founded the association in 1961. The third addresses Lafayette Park’s history as a center for public protests, dating to 1917 and continuing through last summer’s protests over police brutality and racial injustice. The intersection of 16th and H streets in front of the markers was officially named Black Lives Matter Plaza by the city government last year. Stewart McLaurin, the president of the association, credited former first lady Michelle. Obama with unintentionally jump-starting the project. As first lady, she publicly spoke multiple times of her intense awareness that she woke up every morning in a house built by enslaved people. The White House Historical Association is a nonprofit donor-supported group that helps maintain many of the White House’s interior furnishings. It also funds the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Florida man was discovered inside a giant floating contraption shaped like a hamster wheel on a beach, according to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office. The agency said the “driver” Reza Baluchi was not injured. The 49-year-old told authorities he was attempting to raise money for charity by “running” on water from St. Augustine to New York City by way of Bermuda, but ran into some problems. Baluchi and his hydropod, as he calls it, washed ashore near Hammock, in Flagler County, about 30 miles from where he first started the endeavor in St. Johns County. Flagler County deputies said they arrived at the beach after several alarmed callers reported seeing the UFO, unidentified floating object. The hydropod is basically a metal cylinder with paddle wheels. The long-distance runner told authorities he “came across some complications that brought him back to shore.” The money Baluchi was trying to raise was to go to first responders, the kind that just got him out of his latest situation. The vessel is reportedly outfitted with GPS and enough food and water for days. This is hardly the adventurer’s first brush with disaster: Baluchi made his first failed attempt in 2014, trying to get to travel north, before having to be rescued in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean at a cost of $144,000 to taxpayers. His second attempt two years later also failed when he was stopped by the Coast Guard for safety reasons.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia is asking a judge to toss out a Department of Justice lawsuit challenging the state’s sweeping new election law. In a motion to dismiss filed Wednesday in federal court in Atlanta, attorneys for the state called the lawsuit “a politicized intrusion” into the state’s constitutional authority to regulate its elections. The state’s election laws “are reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and well within the mainstream of election laws across the country,” they wrote. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the lawsuit last month, saying that Republican state lawmakers in Georgia had rushed the election overhaul through with an intent to deny Black voters equal access to the ballot. The move by the Biden administration came two weeks after Garland said his department would look closely at Republican-led efforts to tighten state voting rules. He said the federal government would act if prosecutors found unlawful activity. The U.S. attorney’s office in Atlanta declined to comment on the motion to dismiss.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony on the nomination of Daniel Gluck, the executive director of the Hawaii Ethics Commission, to serve on the Intermediate Court of Appeals. Critics have questioned Gov. David Ige’s choice of Gluck, a white man, for the job, noting it has been 30 years since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the appeals court and 20 since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the Supreme Court. Others have questioned his legal experience given he hasn’t brought as many cases to trial as other potential nominees put forward by the state Judicial Selection Commission. The committee didn’t vote on the nomination. Judiciary Committee Chairman Karl Rhoads said the committee would vote on Wednesday. Gluck’s supporters noted his keen legal mind, his dedication to social justice and his fairness.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise said a Boeing 737 from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service in Australia arrived at the center last weekend to help fight wildfires. The jet is being made available through an agreement between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Australia. The airtanker has two internal tanks with a capacity of 4,000 gallons. The aircraft is named Marie Bashir after Dame Marie Bashir, a former governor of New South Wales. “We greatly appreciate having this airtanker from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service assisting us,” said Kim Christensen, deputy assistant director for operations for the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re proud of the long history of cooperation we have with Australia and other countries.” The center moved to national preparedness level 5 earlier this month. That’s the highest level and means firefighting resources are stretched thin because of multiple large wildfires burning in the West. The center said that on Thursday there are 82 large, active fires in 13 states that have burned 2,600 square miles. More than 21,500 firefighters and support personnel are mobilized to fight the wildfires. So far this year, wildfires have burned more than 5,300 square miles.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Severe thunderstorms swept through the Chicago area and northern Illinois early Thursday with high winds that left thousands of homes and businesses without power. The National Weather Service said several areas recorded wind gusts in excess of 60 mph that knocked down tree limbs or toppled whole trees, damaging some power lines. Weather observers recorded a 64 mph wind gust at the DuPage Airport in DuPage County about 3 a.m., and the Chicago Executive Airport in Cook County had a 55 mph wind gust. ComEd reported that more than 24,000 of its customers remained without power at about 7:20 a.m. The Illinois Department of Transportation said some trees were toppled in Waukegan just before 4 a.m., as the storms pushed across the area. The National Weather Service said “life-threatening” swim conditions were expected Thursday on Lake Michigan as a cold front moved its way through the area, bringing cooler, less humid air. According to a beach hazard statement, waves of 4 to 7 feet and rip currents are expected along the lake in Cook County and in northwestern Indiana’s Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties until Friday night.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington:Indiana University and the city of Bloomington plan to rename Jordan Avenue after local residents who rose to prominence after escaping slavery. A task force is recommending the city-owned section from East Davis Street to 17th Street be named Eagleson Avenue, and the university-owned section, from East 17th Street to Fee Lane, be named Fuller Lane or Mattie Fuller Lane. The city said in a news release its portion of the street would be named after the Eagleson family, whose members for four generations made significant contributions to the city, university, state and nation, starting with Halson Vashon Eagleson, who was born into slavery in 1851 and came to Bloomington in the 1880s. The university’s portion would be named after Mattie Jacobs Fuller, who was born into slavery in 1856 but lived in Bloomington from age 4 until her death in 1940. The news release said she was a successful businesswoman and suffragist and made the donation that founded Bethel AME Church.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: An influential hog dealer sanctioned twice for defrauding pork producers out of hundreds of thousands of dollars said it has fired employees responsible for its latest violations and paid restitution to affected sellers. Lynch Livestock, based in Waucoma, also announced that pork industry veteran Dan Sutherland would lead the company going forward “as a further safeguard against future violations,” citing Sutherland’s experience in compliance matters. Lynch announced those moves in a press release posted online Wednesday, after the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had taken enforcement action against the company for illegal buying practices for the second time since 2017. The company’s longtime owner, Gary Lynch, a top booster of Iowa State athletics and political donor to Iowa Republican elected officials, hasn’t returned messages seeking comment. In the press release, his company said the USDA received a complaint in January that employees at its Waucoma buying station were manipulating the scale and issuing false tickets to artificially lower payments to producers. Lynch said it investigated the allegations and terminated an unspecified number of employees who engaged in those practices. The USDA has not revoked Lynch’s dealer license and praised the company in a press release last week for its cooperation and voluntary corrective actions. The company operates 39 buying stations across eight Midwestern states, and markets hogs to major packing plants across the country.\n\nKansas\n\nLeawood: A Leawood physician has surrendered his medical license after admitting that he told a drug company he would not sell one of their products unless he was hired for more speaking engagements. Dr. Steven M. Simon gave up his medical license this month after being sentenced in April to three years of probation for soliciting health care kickbacks, KCUR reported. Simon was also ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. Simon, a pain doctor, admitted in January that he told a representative for AstraZeneca that he would not continue to prescribe Movantik, which is used to treat constipation caused by opioid medications, unless he was paid for more speaking engagements. The company then determined it would no longer hire Simon as a speaker, according to his plea. Doctors can legally accept meals, speaking fees and other compensation from drug and medical device companies but cannot receive kickbacks for prescribing drugs or medical devices. Simon has also been sued by patients who claimed he prescribed them fentanyl spray because its manufacturer, Insys Therapeutics, was paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: A ferry that carries vehicles across the Mississippi River between Kentucky and Missouri is reopening after a one-day closure for engine maintenance, officials said. The work was completed earlier than expected, allowing the Dorena-Hickman Ferry to reopen Thursday morning, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. Capt. Jeremy Newsom had anticipated the closure to last for a few days. The ferry connects Kentucky 1354 at Hickman, Kentucky, with Missouri Route A and Route 77 near Dorena, Missouri. It is the only direct route between the states.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A judge is allowing some of those being sentenced to probation in his court to get a COVID-19 vaccination to reduce their community service requirement. Judge Fred Crifasi in Baton Rouge said vaccination is not mandated but offered as an option. “Getting vaccinated is a service to the community,” Crifasi said Thursday in an emailed statement to the Associated Press. “We are currently in a serious predicament in Louisiana. So, if a probation candidate is inclined to get vaccinated, I will grant credit for that effort towards any requirement of community service. The amount of hours varies and depends on the person’s circumstances. It is not a mandate. If a person is not inclined, they do not have to do it.” Crifasi’s probation option is being offered as coronavirus infections across the state are skyrocketing. The state health department reported 4,413 new COVID-19 cases Thursday and the daily hospitalization number was 1,620, nearly 100 more than a day earlier. It had been below 300 for much of May and all of June. Louisiana has been among the states with the lowest overall vaccination rate.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine church that sued over coronavirus restrictions last year is taking a preemptive legal strike against future restrictions associated with a variant of the virus that’s spreading across the country. Calvary Chapel in Orrington is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to stop Democratic Gov. Janet Mills from enforcing or reinstating any pandemic-related restrictions because of the delta variant. The state responded by noting that the governor’s civil emergency already expired, making the lawsuit unnecessary. “For more than two months, there have been no restrictions whatsoever on the size of gatherings, and the state of emergency expired at the end of June. Given that, we are disappointed that Calvary Chapel continues to waste public and judicial resources by attempting to litigate an issue that is now moot,” said Marc Malon, spokesperson for the state attorney general’s office. But church officials are worried that restrictions could be reinstated. Describing Mills’ previous restrictions as a 14-month “reign of terror,” church officials claimed in their request for a preemptive injunction that any restrictions would violate their religious liberties protected by the Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court has heard similar requests on behalf of religious organizations and lifted limits in California.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:Peter Schultz, aboard the boat the Reel One, caught a 301-pound swordfish at the Big Fish Classic Tournament on July 23, setting a state record. Schultz became the first officially recognized record-holder for swordfish, according to the Maryland Department of National Resources. The DNR maintains state records for four divisions of fish: Atlantic, Chesapeake, Nontidal and Invasive. Until Schultz, the swordfish category within the Atlantic division was vacant in the record books, with no one claiming that spot in state history. Schultz called the catch \"the fish of a lifetime,\" according to a news release from the Department of National Resources. Schultz, an Annapolis resident, was about 50 miles offshore at Washington Canyon when he made the catch. It took Schultz and his team 8 hours to bring in the fish.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGreenfield: Magician Penn Jillette is urging people to support a fundraising effort by the agricultural fair in his Massachusetts hometown he credits with inspiring his show business career. Jillette said he saw his first fire eater and his first freak show at the Franklin County Fair in Greenfield and spent some of the “happiest times of my life” there. He made the comments in a nearly 4-minute video posted on the fair’s Facebook page Wednesday. He even participated in the demolition derby one year. “I can trace my whole career back to Greenfield, Massachusetts, and the Franklin County Fair,” the talking half of the Penn & Teller comedy/magic team, said in the video. The fair, run by the Franklin County Agricultural Society, is still trying raise about $90,000 toward its $260,000 goal so it can fix erosion damage at the fairgrounds and make other improvements. Fair President Michael Nelson told Masslive.com that he emailed Jillette’s representatives asking for help, and got a response from Jillette about an hour later. The fair was canceled in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, but is scheduled for Sept. 9-12 this year. The fair is “America at its best,” Jillette, who lives in Las Vegas, said in the video.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:City Council member Andre Spivey has been charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and accused of accepting $1,000 from an undercover law enforcement agent. Spivey was named late Tuesday in an indictment filed in federal court in Detroit. The bribe allegedly was accepted on Oct. 26, 2018, according to the indictment which also said that between 2016 and 2020, Spivey and “public official A” accepted more than $35,000 in payments to influence votes “concerning an industry under review by the council.” Public official A is identified in the indictment as a member of Spivey’s staff. Elliott Hall, an attorney for Spivey, said the indictment was expected. Hall said Spivey did nothing in return for the money and had been cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s office for more than a year. The Associated Press left voicemails Wednesday seeking comment from Hall and Spivey on the indictment. Spivey represents the city’s District 4 and first was elected in 2009. He did not file for reelection and is not on the ballot for the city’s Aug. 3 primary.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRed Lake: A man was charged Wednesday in the killing of a Red Lake Nation police officer who was fatally shot while responding to a call to a residence on the tribe’s reservation in northwestern Minnesota. David Donnell Jr., 28, of Redby was charged in federal court with one count of second-degree murder and four counts of assault with a dangerous weapon in the death of Officer Ryan Bialke. Bialke, 37, was killed Tuesday after he went to Donnell’s home on a report of a suicidal male with children possibly in the residence, according to the Red Lake Department of Public Safety. Federal authorities said Donnell was standing on the porch when officers arrived, then went inside the house. Because Donnell refused to comply with orders from the officers and had an active warrant, police broke down the front door, Department of Justice officials said. That’s when Donnell began firing. Bialke was struck by gunfire and died at the scene, officials said. Donnell fled and was taken into custody at a nearby residence a short time later, authorities said. Court documents do not list an attorney for Donnell. The tribe said Bialke was a six-year veteran of the Red Lake Police Department. He is survived by his wife and four children.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: Cases of COVID-19 are surging in Mississippi, but Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said a federal recommendation for people to wear masks indoors is “foolish.” “It has nothing to do with science,” Reeves said during a speech at the Neshoba County Fair, according to WAPT-TV Mississippi has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation, and Reeves on Thursday encouraged people to get vaccinated. He went on camera to get his own vaccination early this year. But during his outdoor speech at the fair, Reeves repeated what his office had said earlier this week – he will not set a mask mandate for schools. Some Mississippi school districts have started classes, and others will begin by mid-August. “I don’t think you’re going to see any school district mandate masks in schools,” Reeves said at the fair, according to WJTV-TV. “I think if you start seeing them do that, the parents will erupt, and they should, and I feel certain they will.” Some Mississippi school districts have mask mandates for the new academic year, but others said wearing a mask is optional. Last week, the state Health Department recommended masks be worn indoors in school settings by all unvaccinated people 2 and older.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: St. Louis County Health Director Dr. Faisal Khan said he was called racial slurs and physically assaulted after defending a new mask mandate to fight COVID-19. Khan said in response, he raised his middle finger at a crowd gathered at a St. Louis County Council meeting, according to a Wednesday letter obtained by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “After being physically assaulted, called racial slurs and surrounded by an angry mob, I expressed my displeasure by using my middle finger toward an individual who had physically threatened me and called me racist slurs,” Khan wrote to the councilwoman who led the meeting. The St. Louis County Council voted 5-2 on Tuesday to end the county’s mask mandate, saying the county executive did not consult with them before issuing it. County Executive Sam Page has insisted the mask mandate is still in effect, despite the vote. Orders took effect Monday there and in the city of St. Louis, requiring everyone age 5 or older to wear masks inside public spaces and on public transportation even if they are vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A prosecutor for the Crow Tribe accused a federal law enforcement officer of assault, criminal endangerment and negligent endangerment after the officer’s police dog allegedly caused extensive injuries to a suspect during a traffic stop. A civil complaint from prosecutor David Sibley seeks to ban Bureau of Indian Affairs officer Steve Stallings from the Crow reservation in southeastern Montana over the July 20 incident. Sibley said Thursday he filed the complaint a day earlier in Crow Nation Tribal Court, but did not know when Stallings would be officially served with the suit. Stallings was the handler for a dog that latched onto the leg of tribal member Harris Redstar following a traffic stop in Lodge Grass, according to the complaint. The dog continued to hold Redstar’s leg in its jaws even after he was on the ground and in handcuffs, causing extensive injuries that required Redstar to be hospitalized, the prosecutor said. Redstar had been in a confrontation with a second officer before Stallings’ arrival. He faces charges of resisting, obstructing and assaulting an officer and is due to make an initial court appearance next month, Sibley said. Stallings could not be reached for comment. A bureau spokesperson did not have an immediate response to the allegations.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Police arrested a 31-year-old man who jumped the fence surrounding the Governor’s Mansion in Lincoln and sat down in the backyard, according to the Nebraska State Patrol. The incident happened Wednesday afternoon, when Gov. Pete Ricketts was not in the mansion, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. The patrol said State Capitol security spotted the man as he scaled the fence and entered the back yard. He was quickly arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance, trespassing and criminal impersonation because police said he gave officers a fake name.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada casinos rode a robust economic rebound from coronavirus restrictions in June, taking in more than $1 billion in winnings for the fourth straight month and nearly reaching a record set a month earlier, state regulators reported Thursday. But a spike in COVID-19 cases since mid-May – and the restoration of indoor mask mandates for vaccinated and unvaccinated people beginning Friday – could cloud the July outlook for an economy heavily reliant on tourism and gambling. The Nevada Gaming Control Board said casinos reported house winnings of $1.19 billion statewide during the month. That was more than double the $567 million reported in June 2020, the first partial month of reopening after coronavirus pandemic casino closures, and topped the monthly casino win figure of $1.04 billion in June 2019. Board analyst Michael Lawton noted the last time casinos totaled billion-dollar winnings for four straight months was January to April 2008.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSalem: Gov. Chris Sununu signed three bills aimed at protecting not just canines but cats and wild critters, as well. Animal equity was the theme for two of the new laws: One will require drivers who injure or kill cats to notify police or the pets’ owners or else face a $1,000 fine, a mandate that has long existed for dogs. Another would expand the state’s animal cruelty laws and make it illegal to beat, whip, torture or mutilate any wild animal, fish or bird. The third bill, however, focuses squarely on dogs, making it a misdemeanor to maliciously remove a tracking collar or microchip from someone else’s dog. The bill, which also makes stealing a dog a felony for a second offense, was prompted by what supporters described as a growing problem of “dog flipping” in which people steal dogs to sell for profit. All three laws take effect Jan. 1.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCamden: A former teacher and child protective services worker who admitted to producing child pornography images of a young boy who was in his care has been sentenced to nearly 21 years in federal prison. Kayan Frazier, 29, of Somers Point will also have to pay his victim restitution under the 250-month sentence imposed Tuesday, although the amount has not yet been determined. He will also be on permanent supervised release once he’s freed from prison. Frazier had pleaded guilty in February to sexual exploitation of a child. Frazier was a substitute teacher for the Atlantic City School District between 2015 and 2017 before taking a job with the state Department of Child Protection and Permanency. The exploitation of the child occurred between March 2017 and April 2019, according to federal prosecutors. Authorities executed a search warrant at Frazier’s home in April 2019 after law enforcement officials learned that child porn images were being shared online by Frazier, prosecutors have said. He was at the home that day with the boy, and authorities have not said how long Frazier had been caring for the child. Authorities recovered thousands of images of child sexual abuse on Frazier’s cellphone and other electronic media, including images of the boy, which had been taken in Frazier’s apartment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The New Mexico Freedoms Alliance will be holding statewide protests against mask-wearing requirements in schools on Saturday. The group has been rallying to push the state to remove all requirements for mask-wearing and allow parents and students to decide whether they want to wear a mask. Last year, the New Mexico Public Education Department required all to mask up on school grounds to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. This year, the requirements are a bit complicated and largely in flux. On Monday, the Public Education Department issued a more relaxed mask-wearing policy, stating individuals in secondary schools do not need to wear masks if fully vaccinated. All students and staff in primary schools are still required to wear masks. Masks will not be required outside for anyone. The New Mexico Freedoms Alliance said masks have negatively impacted students by impeding their learning and causing headaches and other physical ailments. The protests will take place in about 15 cities across New Mexico. In Las Cruces, a protest will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Albert Johnson Park on the corner of Main Street and Picacho Avenue.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Eight years after a judge ruled police violated the constitution by stopping, questioning and frisking mostly Black and Hispanic people on the street en masse, people in communities most affected by such tactics say they have been shut out of the legal process to end them. Attorneys for plaintiffs in two landmark stop-and-frisk lawsuits said in court papers Thursday that community stakeholders have had “very little contact” in the last three years with the court-appointed monitor overseeing reforms and that reports he has issued don’t reflect their experiences. They’re demanding greater input, including an advisory board comprised mostly of reform advocates and public housing residents, annual community surveys and biannual audits of NYPD stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement activity – the results of which would then be summarized in public reports every six months.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville:State officials are for the second time in slightly more than a year trying to determine the source of potentially harmful compounds found in foam floating on a creek. In both instances, the man-made chemicals found in the Gray’s Creek area don’t appear to be connected to the Chemours plant, which is in the same area and makes a similar compound, The Fayetteville Observer reported. The state Department of Environmental Quality said in a memo dated June 22 that tests were conducted in March on foam from an unnamed tributary of Rockfish Creek. The tests showed that the foam contained perfluorooctane sulfonate, also known as PFOS, and three other compounds. In July 2020, department officials said tests on foam found floating in a creek revealed high levels of PFOS. This year’s memo noted that there are no federal or state health advisory levels for polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS compounds, in surface water or in foam. This year’s results showed PFOS levels at 614 parts per trillion, well above the 70 parts per trillion set for drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency The agency has found that PFOS can have harmful impacts on people’s health at certain levels. including cancer.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Minnesota electric company that wants to sell its financially troubled coal-fueled power plant in North Dakota expects to know Friday if its member utility cooperatives will endorse the deal that includes purchasing electricity over the next decade from the factory’s prospective buyer. North Dakota officials have hailed the potential sale announced last month of Great River Energy’s Coal Creek Station to Rainbow Energy Center as a savior for hundreds of jobs at the plant and an associated lignite coal mine that are about 50 miles north of Bismarck. North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum called the announcement a “huge sigh of relief” for the plant and mine, nearby communities and workers. But opponents believe the sale is delaying an inevitable closure, as coal continues to be eliminated from energy portfolios and regulations mount to curb the climate change effects of burning the fuel. The companies have not publicly disclosed terms of the deal, which includes an associated transmission line that runs more than 400 miles from central North Dakota to Minnesota.\n\nOhio\n\nSandusky: Amusement park operator Cedar Fair Entertainment said it plans to add esports to its lineup of roller coasters and water parks. It wants to build a 1,500-seat esports arena in Ohio for gaming tournaments near Cedar Point, its flagship amusement park in Sandusky, the company announced Thursday. The Ohio-based amusement park chain hopes to begin construction on the $28 million arena by the end of the year. The company said it believes it will be a draw for gamers across the Midwest. Plans call for the arena to have 200 gaming stations and host tournaments year-round beginning in the first half of 2023. It also could be used for concerts and other events, the company said. The building will have locker rooms, a food court and dormitory rooms for esports participants.The booming esports industry is especially popular among teens and youngers adults, which also is a target audience for the company’s 11 amusement parks and four separate water parks across the U.S.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of initial unemployment claims and the less volatile moving four-week average of initial claims are down in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission reported Thursday. The number of initial weekly claims fell by about 50%, from 7,787 to 4,394, and the moving average dropped from 8,237 to 7,046, the agency reported. “The decline is a promising indicator of the direction we’re heading,” said OESC director Shelly Zumwalt. “We are continuing to review applications for the Back-to-Work Initiative,” a $1,200 stipend offered to anyone returning to work for 32 or more hours per week for six consecutive weeks.The state’s latest unemployment rate of 3.7% in June was down from a high of 14.7% in April 2020 during a shutdown amid the coronavirus outbreak. The state health department reported 1,806 new virus cases and a seven-day average of 1,268 daily cases, compared to a seven-day average of 196 on June 25, as infections have increased with the highly contagious delta variant sweeping across the state.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city has banned homeless people from camping in forested parks both to protect them from potential wildfires and prevent them from accidentally starting blazes during a summer of drought and record-breaking heat. The City Council adopted the rule Wednesday for “high-risk hazard zones,” including in and around Portland’s famous Forest Park and in heavily forested wetlands and natural areas across the city. The ban will apply during wildfire season or whenever a county burn ban is in effect. The 8-square-mile Forest Park in the heart of Portland is one of the largest urban forests in the U.S. There have been frequent reports of fires at unsanctioned campsites and at clusters of RVs across the city from illegal burning, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The city stressed that the rule was to prevent fires from starting in the city but also to protect homeless people from blazes started near encampments by others. Nonprofit groups working with the city will visit the camps, provide information about fire risk and help residents relocate voluntarily before any aggressive sweeps take place, the newspaper said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGettysburg: Authorities have announced the arrest of a new suspect in a rape and murder more than three decades ago for which another man served 16 years in prison before he was exonerated by DNA evidence. State police and Adams County prosecutors said Chris Speelman, 58, of New Oxford is charged with criminal homicide, rape, robbery and burglary in the August 1987 slaying of 85-year-old Edna Laughman. Lt. Mark Magyar said the arrest was made possible by advances in genetic genealogy and the hard work of investigators. District Attorney Brian Sinnett said a company analyzing the DNA profile provided by investigators came up with a list of surnames, including Speelman’s, and other information including hair and eye color. Sinnett said Speelman had lived next-door to the victim “within the same structure” about a decade before her murder. A DNA sample provided by him a few months ago was “an absolute match” to the suspect’s DNA, he said. Another man, Barry Laughman, a distant relative of the victim, was convicted in 1988 and served 16 years before he was cleared.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:Mayor Jorge Elorza had to be held back from Gov. Dan McKee during a disagreement over a proposed contract for the city’s public school teachers. During a ceremonial lighting of the WaterFire basins along the Providence River to mark the return of the city arts festival on Wednesday, Elorza was seen on video pointing his finger at McKee and yelling, “You’ve got to face the community on this.” Elorza was held back by a member of McKee’s state police security detail. Both men are Democrats. Elorza confirmed after the event he was trying to discuss the teachers contract. He wants the contract made public before the teachers’ union votes on it Friday so the community can have input. The state has taken control of the city’s underperforming schools. “If you believe it’s a transformational contract, stand before the community and tell them why you believe it’s transformational,” Elorza said. “But simply hiding and doing it in secret and wanting to wrap this up before facing the community, that’s not the way that this is supposed to be done.” McKee declined to comment.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLaurens: Malouf Companies, which warehouses and distributes home furnishings and other consumer products, is investing $47.2 million in a project in Laurens County and will create 240 new jobs, Gov. Henry McMaster’s office said in a news release. “We couldn’t be more excited to congratulate Malouf for its decision to establish its first South Carolina facility in Laurens County. This $47.2 million investment, along with the 240 new jobs it will create, are huge wins for the community, and we look forward to seeing this great company continue to grow,” McMaster said. Malouf’s new facility will increase the company’s warehousing capabilities and improve distribution capacity to meet demand, officials said. The new facility is expected to be operational by Nov. 30. The Coordinating Council for Economic Development has approved a $200,000 Rural Infrastructure Fund grant to Laurens County to assist with site preparation and building improvements.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem barred the state’s Department of Education from applying for federal grants in history or civics over concerns about how certain teachings on systemic racism would be tied to the grants. The U.S. Department of Education this month backed away from proposed grant guidelines that suggested using curricula that teach racism is embedded into the country’s institutions. After releasing proposed rules for the $3 million American History and Civics Education grant program in April that included references to the New York Times’ “1619 Project” and “anti-racism” teaching, the U.S. Department of Education had faced backlash from conservatives, who argued it was an example of critical race theory making its way into elementary and high school classrooms. “Our students should learn America’s true history by studying both our triumphs and our mistakes,” Noem said in a statement. “Only then will students learn that America remains the shining example of exceptionalism throughout the history of the world.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Seven unemployed Tennessee residents have filed a lawsuit over Gov. Bill Lee’s decision to opt out of the federal unemployment benefits programs earlier this year. They said in a federal complaint filed this week against Lee and Department of Labor Commissioner Jeff McCord that they struggle to survive on state unemployment funds as they look for work, news outlets reported. They are asking a federal judge to instruct Lee to reenter the federally funded pandemic unemployment compensation programs run by U.S. Department of Labor. “This program has served as a lifeline for thousands of Tennesseans who remain affected by the pandemic,” Nashville attorneys W. Gary Blackburn and Bryant Kroll wrote. State officials declined to comment on pending litigation. Lee announced in May that Tennessee would withdraw from federal unemployment programs that would pay an additional $300 a week in benefit payments. The state reverted Sunday to benefits through Tennessee’s Unemployment Compensation program, which pays up to $275 a week.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The city announced that Lou Neff Road and all associated parking along the loop around the Zilker Park Great Lawn will remain closed through Aug. 7 and will reopen Aug. 8. The work to realign the road, accommodate ADA improvements, perform asphalt maintenance and make electrical service modifications was scheduled to be finished by Friday, but the asphalt work has been delayed to minimize the impact on park programming. During this road closure, the Austin Parks Foundation is asking Zilker Park visitors to take alternate forms of transportation, including bicycles, ride sharing and public transportation. As parking will be limited during this time, using CapMetro is highly encouraged. The CapMetro 30 Local route goes to Zilker Park via Barton Springs Road.\n\nUtah\n\nHurricane:A missing 4-year-old boy who was found dead in his toy chest died accidently of positional asphyxiation, police said. The search for Kache Wallis of Hurricane began Sunday after his family woke up in the morning and discovered he wasn’t in his bed. Police, family and friends conducted searches inside and outside the house before someone opened the small toy chest and found the boy inside. The Utah Medical Examiner’s Office investigated the cause of death. Police said it was caused by positional asphyxiation, or a lack of air because of the position of a person’s body. The Hurricane Police offered their condolences to the boy’s family.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington:A bridge will be closed for repairs for the next three months between South Burlington and Williston, and the closure is expected to cause traffic delays on other roads, the Vermont Agency of Transportation said. The Muddy Brook Bridge between Kimball Avenue in South Burlington and Marshall Avenue in Williston will be closed starting on Monday, the agency said. Drivers should expect increased traffic on U.S. Route 2 and Vermont Route 2A and additional traffic delays in the area, the agency said. They are encouraged to add extra time to their travel plans or take other routes. The bridge is expected to be closed until November.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Health officials are warning people and pets to avoid swimming or wading in the James River after hundreds of thousands of gallons of sewage spilled from a Goochland County sewer line into a tributary of the river. The Department of Health issued an advisory Thursday after the sewage release from the sewer line into Tuckahoe Creek on Tuesday night, news outlets reported. The Goochland County Department of Public Utilities shut off the pipe less than four hours later, but not before 300,000 gallons of “raw, undiluted sewage” spilled into nearby Tuckahoe Creek. The water advisory applies to Tuckahoe Creek beginning at River Road and the James River from Robious Landing Park in Chesterfield, Goochland, and Henrico counties to Belle Isle in Richmond. Officials warned that swallowing contaminated water from the river could cause gastrointestinal illnesses and that external contact could cause “infections of the ears, nose, throat and skin.” There is no impact on drinking water at this time, officials said. An end date for the advisory will be based on bacteria levels in the water.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Three schoolteachers in the state who sued chemical company Monsanto over exposure to materials in fluorescent lights have been awarded $185 million. The law firm that represented the teachers, Friedman Rubin, said a jury returned the verdict Tuesday in King County Superior Court. The teachers, who worked at the Sky Valley Education Center in Monroe, said they suffered brain damage from exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in the fluorescent lighting at the school. “This is a big step in holding Monsanto accountable,” the teachers’ attorney, Rick Friedman, said in a statement. Bayer, which bought Monsanto in 2018, said the company disagreed with the verdict and might appeal. The company said the light ballasts that were the focus of the lawsuit were obsolete. This was the first of 22 trials involving teachers, parents and students who spent time at the Sky Valley Education Center. A 2019 Associated Press investigation found that millions of fluorescent light ballasts containing PCBs probably remain in schools and day care centers across the U.S. four decades after the chemicals were banned over concerns that they could cause cancer and other illnesses. Many older buildings also have caulk, ceiling tiles, floor adhesives and paint made with PCBs, which sometimes have been found at levels far higher than allowed by law. PCBs are mixtures of compounds manufactured by Monsanto Co. and widely used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment until they were banned in 1979.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: Workers began repairs this week on West Virginia 2 in Mason County on a slip believed to have been caused by heavy rains earlier this month. Both lanes will be closed from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. beginning Wednesday and running for about four days. Emergency and mail delivery vehicles will be allowed to pass through while both lanes are closed, the Department of Transportation said in a news release. “The area presented a challenge due to the length of the slip,” said Kathy Rushworth, Division of Highways District 1 maintenance engineer. “We gathered information and considered several methods of repair and chose soil nails as the most efficient and effective for the location.” One lane of West Virginia 2 will reopen after the initial closure until repairs are finished in about four weeks. The location is near the Jackson County line.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Strong thunderstorms caused widespread damage across Wisconsin, left tens of thousands without power and triggered tornado warnings. The severe weather stretched from the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan and began Wednesday night in northwestern Wisconsin. By 2 a.m. Thursday, the numerous tornado warnings across the state expired. The National Weather Service surveyed hard-hit areas in southeastern Wisconsin and confirmed it was a tornado, probably rated EF1, that caused damage around the Jefferson County community of Concord, where the storm toppled farm buildings and left a path of destruction. Cows could be seen grazing among debris that landed in farm fields. Gov. Tony Evers signed a declaration imposing a state of emergency in Wisconsin. Evers’ order directs state agencies to help those impacted by the storms. It also allows the Wisconsin National Guard to be activated to support local authorities with recovery efforts. Meteorologist Denny VanCleve in Sullivan said there’s a good chance that it was a tornado, or possibly two, that caused widespread damage. Utility crews worked to restore service to thousands of power customers. Electricity was knocked out to about 90,000 customers across Wisconsin, according to the tracking website PowerOutage, US. The tornado warnings started in Wausau and were issued for Waukesha, Jefferson and Milwaukee counties around 1 a.m. Thursday. The National Weather Service placed nearly the entire state under a severe thunderstorm watch until 2 a.m. Thursday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A man was run over and killed by a pickup truck during Cheyenne Frontier Days. The accident happened Tuesday morning near a carnival area next to the rodeo grounds. The victim, whose identity wasn’t released, was riding in the bed of a full-size pickup that slowed to a stop in traffic, the Cheyenne Police Department said in a statement. The man lost his footing and fell as he was getting out of the truck bed. The driver of the other pickup truck pulled ahead with the flow of traffic and ran over the man, police said. An ambulance took the man to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Frontier Days was back this year after being canceled for the first time in 2020 because of the coronavirus. The rodeo and Western culture festival draws thousands to Wyoming’s capital city over the last two weeks in July.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/27/protest-prisons-skeleton-board-monarch-slump-news-around-states/41072781/", "title": "Protest for prisons, skeleton on board: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The city will pay a $25,000 fine for obstructing the view of a Confederate monument, a judge ordered last week under the direction of the state Supreme Court. Circuit Judge Marshell Jackson Hatcher imposed the fine that had been ordered by the state’s high court. Justices in November ruled that Birmingham violated a state law protecting historic monuments and directed the circuit judge to enter an order declaring that Birmingham violated the 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act and to fine the city $25,000. Alabama sued Birmingham in 2017 after municipal officials in the majority-black city erected a wooden box obscuring the inscriptions on a 52-foot-tall obelisk honoring Confederate veterans. The 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act prohibits relocating, removing, altering or renaming public buildings, streets and memorials that have been standing for more than 40 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature failed to override more than $70 million in vetoes dealing with school construction projects and the state ferry system. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued the vetoes last summer, after lawmakers had adjourned. The veto override session was announced late Thursday, with no clear indication of sufficient support. House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent from Dillingham, said in a statement that Alaskans “deserve to know where their elected officials stand.” House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt, in response, said the vote “was about nothing more than creating material to use against other members in the next election cycle.” Lawmakers attempted to override a $5 million veto of funds for the ferry system and vetoes of funds for school debt reimbursement to municipalities and a construction fund for rural schools. The issues were considered as part of one vote.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A 62-year-old man was cited last week after trying to disguise a fake skeleton as a passenger just to use the HOV lane. The Arizona Department of Public Safety says a trooper pulled over the man Thursday after noticing he had placed a fake skeleton in the passenger’s front seat. The skeleton was sitting upright, wearing a hat and tied to the front seat. Department spokesman Raul Garcia said troopers cite about 7,000 HOV lane violators every year. Last April, a man was pulled over after driving in the HOV lane with a mannequin wearing a sweatshirt, baseball cap and sunglasses.\n\nArkansas\n\nSalem: Thieves have stolen the old school bell that hung at the top of the steps at the historic Old Main schoolhouse. Friends of Old Main Board of Directors member Ron Plumlee recently discovered the bell was missing while checking on maintenance at the old schoolhouse. The bolts holding the bell in place were apparently sawed off, Plumlee said. The theft is suspected to have required at least two people because of the bell’s size and weight, he said. The bell has been at the top of the steps for at least 70 years. The school was built in 1930 and is now operated by Friends of Old Main as a nonprofit activity center. The bell was brass with an inscription around the top and has many marks from ringing over the years. Anyone with information that might lead to the recovery of the bell or the apprehension of those responsible is asked to contact the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office at (870) 895-2601.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The western monarch butterfly population wintering along the state’s coast remains critically low for the second year in a row, according to an environmental group. The count of the orange-and-black insects by the Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey. That’s not much different from last year’s tally, when an all-time-low 27,000 monarchs were counted. By comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the California coast in the 1980s. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the western United States due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A research center at Colorado State University dedicated to studying the chemical compounds in hemp is expected to open this spring, school officials said Thursday. The announcement comes after the university received a $1.5 million donation from a Golden-based company that makes products out of CBD, a popular cannabis compound with unproven health claims. The money would be used to fund research, cover operating costs and purchase equipment, university officials said. The facility would allow faculty and undergraduate and graduate students to study the formulation of cannabinoids, separation efficiencies, efficacy testing and more, The Denver Post reports. Researchers at the facility would work in partnership with Panacea Life Sciences, a company founded by university alumna Leslie Buttorff that manufactures CBD products for people and pets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The state Department of Motor Vehicles will soon allow a nonbinary gender designation on driver’s licenses. Starting Monday, three gender options will be available for state-issued license and identification cards – male, female and nonbinary, denoted by the letter X, according to the New Haven Register. “We want to be sure that we’re fair for everyone, to respect people’s gender identity,” Deputy Commissioner Tony Guerrera said. Connecticut will be one of 12 states that allow nonbinary gender identification on driver’s licenses, he said. The move was one of the department’s top priorities when Guerrera and Commissioner Sibongile Magubane were appointed, he said. State Sen. Matt Lesser said Saturday that it would be important for people who identify as nonbinary and revenue-neutral for everyone else.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The public needs to keep a safe distance from the seals that will be present along beaches and other waterways through April, according to the state’s official marine mammal and sea turtle stranding response organization. The MERR Institute recommends the public stay at least 150 feet from seals and always keep pets on a leash and at a safe distance because seals are wild animals that can bite if they feel threatened. It is common at this time of the year to see seals on area beaches, docks and other locations where they can rest, the Delaware State News reports. Four species of seals may visit Delaware. Oftentimes these animals are healthy, but at other times they may be suffering from illness or injury and in need of veterinary care, officials said. Anyone who encounters a seal is asked to contact MERR as soon as possible at (302) 228-5029. More information can be found on MERR’s website.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The public is invited to the coronation ceremony for the newly crowned Miss Black D.C. USA this Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The pageant’s new titleholder, Amini Bonane, is a Harvard graduate student who says one of the reasons she competed for the crown was to expand her platform on mentoring and efforts to find missing women of color. She has a campaign called Find My Sister that’s dedicated to raising awareness. Her coronation ceremony will be coupled with a charity fundraiser for the cause. According to Black and Missing in America Inc., nearly 40% of missing people are persons of color. Bonane’s coronation ceremony and charity fundraiser will be held Saturday from 7:30 to 10 p.m. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other D.C. government officials and professionals are expected to attend the evening of networking, performances and philanthropy.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Eighty Burmese pythons were caught during a 10-day pre-Super Bowl hunt, designed to raise awareness about the invasive species decimating the Everglades. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Saturday that 80 pythons were caught during the competition. Pro grand prize winner Mike Kimmel won an ATV for capturing eight pythons, and rookie grand prize winner Kristian Hernandez removed six pythons and also won an ATV. Pro grand prize winner Tom Rahill won $2,000 for bagging a 62-pound python. Several other cash prizes were also awarded. The game’s organizing committee worked with Florida to promote the Python Bowl. The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet, are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. Wildlife officials estimate the population may exceed 100,000. The big serpents have been devouring native mammal and bird populations.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Hundreds of people have shown their support for an armless street artist whose artwork, supplies and donation box were stolen near the University of Georgia. Nearly $42,000 had been raised online as of late Sunday for Michael Davenport, who is known in Athens for sketching the university’s bulldog mascot. He holds a pen in his mouth to create his art because he lost his arms as a child. Davenport, 53, said his belongings were stolen Jan. 15 when he took a break to use the restroom at a nearby business. Athens-Clarke police said detectives were looking to identify the suspect, seen on surveillance video in what appears to be a gold-colored minivan. Stephen Frazier, the general manager at Budget Host Inn in Athens, said he set up the online fundraising account in Davenport’s name. Davenport told WAGA-TV he plans to use the money for a truck to carry his supplies and for medical treatment for his leg, injured in an attack last year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Honolulu Medical Examiner’s Office has identified the remains of two people found in a burnt-out home where a man allegedly shot and killed two Honolulu police officers and attacked a neighbor before setting the house ablaze last weekend. Officials on Friday released a statement identifying the homeowner, Lois Ann Cain, 77, as one of the two people found in the house that was destroyed by fire in an upscale neighborhood near Waikiki Beach. A tenant, Jaroslav “Jerry” Hanel, is accused of shooting police who were responding to the home after he allegedly attacked and stabbed a woman who also lived in the house. Cain was in the process of evicting Hanel when the violence erupted Sunday. The medical examiner also identified the second set of remains but withheld a name pending notification of next of kin.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The number of residents who have signed up for Medicaid under the state’s voter-approved expanded coverage has passed 60,000. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare posted updated numbers Thursday. The agency estimates 91,000 residents meet requirements. Coverage started Jan. 1, but enrollment is year-round. Those who sign up for Medicaid will be covered for doctor visits that occurred earlier in the same month. Voters authorized Medicaid expansion in 2018 with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote after years of inaction by state lawmakers. But legislators in 2019 added restrictions requiring five waivers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Waivers are required when states want to deviate from Medicaid rules. Federal officials have yet to approve any of Idaho’s requested waivers.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Marijuana was stolen last week from a box placed at Chicago’s Midway International Airport for travelers who dispose of their marijuana before they board a plane, police said Friday. The “marijuana amnesty boxes” were placed at Midway and O’Hare International Airport after it became legal this year to possess marijuana in Illinois. The boxes, owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police, were installed so air travelers can be in compliance with federal law as well as the local laws at their destination. Police officers regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana. “Tampering with them, or attempting to remove anything placed inside, is a crime,” said Chicago police spokesman Antony Gugliemi, who added that an investigation is underway.\n\nIndiana\n\nTaswell: The state’s newest nature preserve features dramatic limestone outcrops and a cave inhabited by rare animals adapted to life in total darkness. The Natural Resources Commission recently approved the creation of the Patoka Hills Nature Preserve, which spans nearly 27 acres in southern Indiana’s Crawford County. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources said the new preserve contains one of Indiana’s finest paleontological sites in a small cave that the agency calls “highly significant.” Staff from the Indiana State Museum have been excavating inside that cave since 1987, and their discoveries have shed light on Indiana’s past climate, plants and animals during the latter part of the last ice age. The DNR said the cave is also home to a springtail insect and a cave millipede, both of which lack eyes and pigmentation and are rare worldwide.\n\nIowa\n\nCouncil Bluffs: Leaders in western Iowa say lingering floodwaters and damage from last year’s Missouri River flooding have led them to again cancel Loessfest. The Council Bluffs City Council said Friday in a news release that restoration work on Tom Hanafan River’s Edge Park, which connects to neighboring Omaha, Nebraska, via the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge, can’t begin until after the spring thaw. There isn’t enough time between the thaw and the Memorial Day weekend event to get the work done, the council said. Loessfest was established in 2013 and has become the community’s traditional kick-off to summer. Last year, Loessfest was initially postponed to Labor Day weekend, then canceled altogether due to ongoing flooding. Other locations were considered before canceling this year’s festival, officials said. But it was ultimately decided that a critical component of Loessfest was its easy proximity to Omaha.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Local police are looking into using genetic genealogy databases to help solve cold murder and rape cases. Capt. Jeff Weible said the department isn’t ready to decide whether it will use the technique, which has revolutionized cold-case investigations across the U.S. while also raising legal and privacy concerns. But to help find out how the technique could be used, the department co-hosted a two-day training conference on it last week. The Wichita Eagle reports it drew more than 60 people from law enforcement agencies and other organizations across the state and nation to downtown Wichita. The conference’s co-host, Gene by Gene, is allowing law enforcement agencies to submit DNA samples and lab data files from certain kinds of cold cases. Gene by Gene then queries its DNA database, Family Tree DNA, for any matches that investigators can use to track down suspects or identify remains.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State colleges and universities will ask for their first funding increase since the 2007-08 budget, lawmakers have been told. Aaron Thompson, president of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, said public colleges will seek a 6.2% increase next fiscal year and an 8.8% increase in the 2022 fiscal year over current base funding levels. Thompson said he is not sure whether the budget Gov. Andy Beshear presents to the General Assembly on Tuesday will include the request but is optimistic. Kentucky has cut higher education funding in each two-year budget since 2008, leaving colleges and universities to increase tuition rates. Thompson told legislators that after more than a decade of higher education cuts, “we are down to the point where we are cutting into the bone.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Dozens of protesters marched from the site of the partially collapsed Hard Rock Hotel on the edge of the French Quarter to City Hall on Friday, demanding that something be done about the hotel and that the two bodies still inside be recovered. The Hard Rock Hotel was under construction when it partially collapsed Oct. 12, sending plumes of dust into the air, killing three people and injuring dozens. The bodies of two of the three workers who died are still inside what is left of the building, which city officials have decided to take down through implosion in March. People in the city were outraged last week when a tarp at the site shifted, exposing the remains of one of the workers who died. The tarp has since been replaced, but it sparked cries for greater accountability. City Council member Jason Williams addressed the crowd, specifically questioning why a worker who had been in the building when it collapsed was later deported.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine home sales surged at the end of 2019, which was a record-breaking year for real estate in the state. The Pine Tree State set records for sales volume and median sales price, the Portland Press Herald reports. Home buyers finished strong at the end of the year, as December sales increased 23% compared with the same month the previous year. Total sales for 2019 reached 18,140 homes, which was a 1.5% increase from the previous year, according to the Maine Association of Realtors. The median sales price increase 4.7% from the previous record of $215,000 to $225,000, the association said. One of the factors helping spur the increase in price is a lack of inventory in Maine. Houses also aren’t staying on the market very long.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Lawmakers hope to repeal “archaic” provisions in the state’s spousal defense for sex crimes and sodomy laws with the reintroduction of legislation this session. Lawmakers on Thursday expect to hear a Senate bill that would repeal the use of marriage as a defense to prosecution of some sex crimes, and last week the House introduced a bill that would repeal the crimes of sodomy and unnatural or perverted sexual practice. Under current state law, a person may not be prosecuted for first- or second-degree rape or third- or fourth-degree sexual offenses if the victim is the legal spouse of the assailant at the time of the offense. The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Susan Lee, D-Montgomery, told Capital News Service she thinks current law treats a spouse as property. “It’s really disrespectful, it’s wrong, and it’s antiquated,” Lee said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Lawmakers are planning to hold a public hearing this week for a sweeping bill filed by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker that would overhaul the state’s health care system. Baker said the bill would cut down the hidden costs that currently blindside consumers and would require walk-in clinics to treat low-income patients on Medicaid. He said the bill would also hold drug companies accountable for excessive prices and unjustified price increases, as well as support distressed community hospitals and community health centers. The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at the Statehouse. When he unveiled the legislation in October, Baker said it would “address the challenges associated with supporting an aging population, individuals with a chronic illness, or those in need of behavioral health services.” The proposal would outlaw “surprise” bills for emergency room care and rein in certain hospital fees.\n\nMichigan\n\nGanges Township: The owners of a home along Lake Michigan decided to demolish it before nature did the job. Relentless waves and high water have scoured the lakeshore, destroying or threatening properties that have been in families for generations. Helen Curtis-Foster and family members decided to bring their house down in Allegan County’s Ganges Township, between Saugatuck and South Haven. The house was just feet away from the edge of a collapsing dune. “We really felt we were in the fight against time,” Curtis-Foster told MLive.com. “It was getting scary.” The demolition was completed last week, leaving only a cement pad. The job cost less than $20,000, Curtis-Foster said, compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars necessary to move the house or recover the pieces if it collapsed into the lake. The family plans to put a gazebo on the site.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRobbinsdale: A man scaled a fence at a hospital last month and shut off oxygen to the entire facility, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in Hennepin County. No charges have been filed in the Dec. 27 incident at North Memorial Hospital, and the search warrant affidavit filed Friday makes no mention of injuries. But the Star Tribune reports the document says the situation could have been deadly under different circumstances. Hospital spokeswoman Katy Sullivan says hospital officials quickly identified the issue and resolved it without harm to patients. According to the affidavit, after the oxygen was shut off, engineers detected a pressure drop in the hospital’s oxygen levels and discovered the vandalism. A 39-year-old man has been identified as a possible suspect. He was also seen inside the hospital the previous month unplugging computers and televisions.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Protesters outside the Capitol on Friday condemned conditions in state prisons where inmates have died violently in the past month. People with relatives in the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman said at a rally that some prison cells have no working lights or toilets, and inmates are given sparse meals sometimes served with cockroaches on the trays. “Parchman is a prison farm plantation,” said Jaribu Hill, a longtime Mississippi human-rights attorney. “Shut it down!” A few hundred protesters responded: “Shut it down! Shut it down!” Their voices echoed in downtown Jackson, but many of the state’s top policymakers were not in town to hear it. Most members of the Legislature left the Capitol on Thursday and won’t return until Monday. At least 10 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December – most of them at Parchman. The rally Friday was organized by Team Roc, the charity affiliated with entertainment mogul Jay-Z’s company Roc Nation.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri is tracking all new students on campus this semester through a cellphone app to learn whether they’re attending class. It’s a test expansion of a program the university has used for four years to track class attendance of freshmen student athletes and athletes in academic trouble. Supporters of the program say it helps attendance, which in turn improves students’ academic performance. Critics worry the university could someday add uses for the program that will violate student privacy, The Kansas City Star reports. The expanded use of the program began Tuesday on a test basis. Faculty volunteered to use the program in their classes, but students won’t have a choice about participating. Every student in the program will be told attendance is being monitored, said Jim Spain, vice provost for undergraduate studies. The university will help students who don’t have a phone participate.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana is working to learn from criticism after four white students won an essay contest about Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy, the school said. A majority of the 1,000 comments posted on social media were critical of selecting only white students, The Missoulian reports. The contest sought submissions from students, faculty and staff on how they had worked to implement King’s legacy at the university. Only six submissions were received, all from white students, the university said. The university deleted the photos and names of the contest winners out of concern they could be targets of harassment, the school said. Many commenters noted the lack of people of color entering the contest may have indicated they did not believe it was a productive use of their time or energy. African-American Studies program head Tobin Miller Shearer and Murray Pierce, special assistant to the provost and adviser to the Black Student Union, speculated that many of the union members were likely busy planning the Black Solidarity Summit, the group’s upcoming keystone event.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The mayor wants voters to decide whether they’re willing to raise their property taxes to fund a long-term plan for improving city streets – often the objects of residents’ wrath and complaints. Mayor Jean Stothert announced Thursday that she will ask the City Council to put a $200 million bond issue on the May 12 ballot. It would cost owners $35 more a year in property taxes for every $100,000 in valuation. “We can stop the deterioration of our infrastructure,” Stothert said. “But it will take all of us to agree that it’s worth the expense.” The city spends $41 million a year on street repairs, she said, but needs to be spending at least $75 million a year. The $200 million in bond funding would cover only part of what’s needed, and Omaha would need a series of voter-approved bond issues to keep the initiative going, Stothert said. Councilman Pete Festersen said he thinks the street repairs need to be part of a comprehensive plan that improves public transit and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Silver Dollar Club, an iconic bar dating to the Prohibition era in one of the city’s oldest buildings, is closing after 86 years of stories and songs rooted in the Wild West days. Sam Horvitz, the club proprietor, told the Elko Daily Free Press he’s closing Jan. 30. “I’ve been waiting to buy the building for years now,” Horvitz posted Jan. 3 on his Facebook page, “and my faith and patience have finally run out.” The brick building was Elko’s first bank, founded in 1880. Henderson Bank moved in 1929 to a four-story building across the railroad tracks, and the old bank became a grocery store. Local historian Jan Petersen, director of the nearby Cowboy Arts and Gear Museum, said the building became a “soft drink” parlor during the Prohibition era of the 1920s. Robert “Doby Doc” Caudill, anticipating constitutional approval for the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition in December 1933, opened the Silver Dollar Club a month earlier, in November 1933.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLangdon: A meeting house originally built in the early 1800s has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Georgian-style Langdon Meeting House was a two-story space that served both town and church functions. In order to comply with New Hampshire’s Toleration Act of 1819, which called for physical and financial separation of religious and government public spaces, the town sold 10 feet at the west end of the building and the second-story gallery space to the Universalist Society of Langdon in 1851. That year, a renovation partitioned the spaces and added a three-story Greek Revival steeple over the church entrance that included a belfry with louvered shutters and a 5-foot weathervane. Langdon residents have held their annual town meeting on the first floor from 1803 to the present, the longest-running record in the country.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A former top aide to Gov. Phil Murphy alerted him to allegedly inappropriate behavior by his former campaign manager, including “rank misogyny” and retaliation, according to documents released Sunday. The campaign manager, Brendan Gill, who is now one of Murphy’s closest advisers, also notified Murphy directly that he apologized to that aide for losing his temper and using “language and tone” he regretted, according to an email. The documents appear to contradict Murphy’s own words in an interview last year. When asked if he was personally aware of any incident of sexual harassment or complaints of a toxic work environment during the campaign, Murphy said: “Not that I know of. No.” Murphy was included on at least two emails that showed Gill had acted inappropriately. The campaign said it conducted an investigation and found that the behavior happened only once with the woman who made the allegation, Julie Roginsky, who left the campaign in July 2017.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Trappers now have to complete an education course, and new restrictions will be imposed on setting wildlife traps and snares around designated trailheads and on select tracts of public lands in New Mexico, under a measure adopted by the state Game Commission. State wildlife managers suggested they tried to strike a balance, but trappers argued that the changes will be burdensome, requiring them in some instances to walk a mile roundtrip to set a trap. Environmentalists also were displeased with the decision, calling the practice inhumane and indiscriminate. They had pushed for the commission to end trapping all together, saying pets and endangered species such as the Mexican gray wolf have been inadvertently caught. Trapping and snaring triggered emotionally charged debates during last year’s legislative session.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Some 85,000 artifacts that tell the story of the Chinese migration to the United States may have been lost in a fire that struck a building in the heart of Manhattan’s Chinatown, a museum official said Friday. The president of the Museum of Chinese in America told The New York Times most of the thousands of historic and artistic items in its collection were probably lost in the fire that started Thursday night and tore through a building where the museum’s acquisitions were stored. “One hundred percent of the museum’s collection, other than what is on view,” said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the president of the museum. She said the collection was one of a kind, and she was “just distraught” after receiving the news. The fire started in a former school that more recently housed a senior center, the Chen Dance Center and a number of community groups. The museum is nearby and stored its collection in the structure that was hit by fire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBakersville: The “world’s worst cat” is available for adoption at the Mitchell County Animal Rescue organization. The shelter about 55 miles northeast of Asheville is waiving adoption fees in the hope that someone will take the cat named Perdita off its hands. The group says on its Facebook page, “We thought she was sick. Turns out she’s just a jerk.” A tongue-in-cheek profile of the foul-tempered feline says her dislikes include “dogs, children, the Dixie Chicks, Disney movies, Christmas and last but NOT least … HUGS.” It says she likes lurking, pretending to be sick and “staring into your soul until you feel as if you may never be cheerful again … She’s single and ready to be socially awkward with a socially awkward human who understands personal space.” Her Facebook post has drawn thousands of “likes” – and a follow-up post indicated more than 50 applications to adopt her had already been submitted.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State officials say it’s time for property owners in flood-prone areas of the Red River Valley to think about buying flood insurance. The push comes as early signs suggest a heightened risk of flooding this spring. The Red River Basin in eastern North Dakota has seen record precipitation totals for the fall and winter period starting Sept. 1, National Weather Service spokesman Greg Gust said Friday after the agency released its first flood outlook of the season. This year’s flood could be a top five event, although it’s still too early to predict hard numbers, and “much is left to be determined,” Gust said. The state Water Commission and Department of Emergency Services have scheduled flood preparation meetings this week in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown that will focus on insuring homes and other structures.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state prison system wants to replace or renovate some of its high-security prisons in the near future, saying its current facilities for violent inmates are “functionally obsolete” and creating security risks for the agency, the Associated Press has learned. More low-security inmates are now being housed at community facilities instead of prisons at the same time more violent inmates are being housed in state prisons, and for longer terms, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said in its capital budget request to Gov. Mike DeWine. “Furthermore, this population is particularly violent and disruptive while in prison and requires unique programming needs,” the agency said in its budget documents. The agency wants approval for a two-year design study of its options, with construction possible by mid-2023.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Leaders in this conservative state say they are looking for more legislative progress for LGBTQ people this year after notable strides in 2019. Tulsa and Oklahoma City updated their personnel policies to ban discrimination against city employees based on gender identity or expression, The Oklahoman reports. Norman went further and became the first in the state to amend its civil rights ordinance to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in housing, employment or public accommodations. Oklahoma City also elected its first openly gay council member, and the mayor declared the city’s first official Pride Week to celebrate LBGTQ accomplishments. Allie Shinn, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, said 2019 was a “landmark year.” A top priority in the upcoming legislative session is pushing for a ban on the widely discredited practice of “conversion therapy.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: U.S. Justice Department lawyers said Friday that they’ve found the Portland Police Bureau in substantial compliance with 190 reforms required as part of a city settlement adopted six years ago. The settlement came after a federal investigation determined officers used excessive force against people with mental illness. Now that a community oversight group is staffed and has met regularly for more than a year, the Justice Department said the city meets the settlement’s accountability requirements. The bureau also has instituted needed changes to its use-of-force policies, training, crisis intervention tactics and employee information system developed to identify officers with excessive complaints or uses of force, the Justice Department said in court documents. The community oversight group will discuss the Justice Department’s findings at a Tuesday meeting, according to the group’s co-chair Lakayana Drury.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMount Carbon: A 44-acre community with fewer than 90 residents may soon end up absorbed by an adjacent city because there isn’t enough citizen interest to keep its government functioning. No one except the newly elected mayor of Mount Carbon showed up this month for a reorganizational meeting, The Morning Call of Allentown reports. The Schuylkill County borough’s fate has hung in the balance since last year, when all three council members quit and the borough secretary resigned. Retired railroad worker John Raess was elected mayor in November with two write-in votes. The newspaper said it is possible Mount Carbon might end up as part of the 15,000-resident city of Pottsville, a merger both communities would have to OK. Merging with Pottsville would mean higher taxes for Mount Carbon’s residents.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawmaker proposed letting legislators and other officials tint their windshields to shield them from unhappy constituents. Rep. Anastasia Williams, a Providence Democrat, introduced a bill Thursday that would carve out an exception for the state’s lawmakers and officials to travel around behind tinted glass, The Boston Globe reports. The bill would allow members of the General Assembly, state and municipal police officers, firefighters and state judges to be exempt from state law that says most car windows must allow 70% of the light in. “We have a lot of disgruntled individuals,” Williams said. “In the court system, law enforcement, and the General Assembly, we tend to get a bum rap, and we can face retaliation when we least expect it. When folks are on personal time, we are targeted.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nIsle of Palms: The owner of an island home is suing Airbnb, claiming it only reimbursed him for a “fraction” of the damages that a guest who threw a big party did to his home. In a federal lawsuit filed this week, Scott Shaw said the party left his home smelling of a mixture of marijuana, cigarettes, beer and vomit. Blood and vomit were found on the walls, towels and bedding, the lawsuit states. Shaw says he believes he is owed about $150,000 in both property and punitive damages. He did not say what the company paid him. He said Airbnb claims in its marketing materials that it guarantees up to $1 million reimbursement for property damage. “Airbnb’s ‘host guarantee’ is nothing close to any type of ‘guarantee’ and in fact it is false, misleading and deceptive,” the lawsuit says. The company says it plans to “vigorously defend against these allegations.” Shaw says aside from the smell, the guests also left holes in the walls and broke a staircase railing, door and countertop, among other things.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem says she has “concerns” about a bill in the House that would make it illegal for physicians to administer gender-change treatments to children under 16. But she declined Friday to offer full support or disapproval. The bill would allow for physicians who perform surgeries, administer hormone therapy or prescribe puberty-blocking medication to minors to be prosecuted with a misdemeanor. The Republican-dominated House will debate the bill this week. “When you take public policy and try to fill parenting gaps with more government, you have to be very careful about the precedent you’re setting,” Noem told reporters. Democrats and LGBT activists say the bill targets transgender children and could lead to an increase in suicides. Supporters, including many Republicans in the House, say the bill would prevent children from receiving ideologically motivated treatment that harms them.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state has become the latest to assure continued taxpayer funding of faith-based foster care and adoption agencies even if those organizations exclude LGBT families and others based on religious beliefs. Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill Friday without fanfare or an official announcement, making it the first law to be implemented in Tennessee this year. Previously, Lee said he endorsed the law because he believed defending religious liberty “is very important.” The Republican has often cited his Christian faith throughout his first term as governor. The protections afforded to religious agencies have sparked criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, which has raised legal concerns surrounding the proposal because it authorized the use of a “religious test to participate in a government program.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The mayor and others say they will work to provide assistance to residents whose homes were damaged after a massive explosion at a warehouse that killed two workers and injured 20 others. Mayor Sylvester Turner on Saturday walked through the impacted neighborhoods in northwest Houston and spoke with residents who were cleaning up after Friday’s explosion. Cleanup and repair efforts continued Sunday. The explosion happened about 4:30 a.m. Friday inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal-spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. Employees Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena were killed. More than 200 homes in surrounding neighborhoods were damaged as the force of the blast shattered windows, knocked down ceilings, bent garage doors and moved some homes off their foundations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s unemployment rate is now the lowest ever recorded at 2.3%, which also ties for lowest among U.S. states, state officials said Friday. The milestone comes in December data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. “The job market is humming along at a feverish pace and is absorbing as much labor as possible,” said Mark Knold, chief economist at the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Utah was also a leader in job creation for 2019, up about 3%. The fastest growth by percentage occurred in construction, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality services. Washington County had the biggest job growth, followed by Rich and Iron counties. The national unemployment rate was 3.5% in December. Utah tied Vermont and South Carolina for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bill in the state would take vanity license plates into new territory with the introduction of emojis. State Rep. Rebecca White, a Democrat from Windsor, introduced the proposal to let drivers add one of six available emojis to their license plate, MyNBC5 reports. Her bill went before the Committee on Transportation last week. The symbols would not replace letters or numbers assigned by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, nor those selected by a vehicle’s owner. At this point, it’s unclear what the new plates would would look like or what emojis would be allowed. Of the state’s current vanity plates, the most expensive for cars and trucks is the state conservation series, which carry a $26 annual fee.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: With a newly empowered Democratic majority at the General Assembly, abortion-rights advocates say the state has a chance to roll back decades of restrictions and become a “safe haven” for women in neighboring conservative states. Abortion-rights groups laid out their legislative priorities last week, emphasizing a measure to undo Republican-backed laws including a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, as well a requirement that women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and counseling. A Senate committee passed that bill Thursday morning, a day after a House committee advanced that chamber’s version. The bills, which are part of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s legislative agenda, would also roll back the requirement that an abortion be provided by a physician, allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform them, and undo strict building code requirements on facilities where abortions are performed.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools has agreed to pay almost half a million dollars to resolve a claim involving a former student who said he was hospitalized after his elementary school released him to the wrong parent in 2010. The former student, then 8, was picked up by his father following an “incident” at the school and “seriously assaulted,” according to the settlement authorization document, which was unanimously approved by the Seattle School Board this week. The father was criminally charged and convicted after the incident, the document said. The former student and his mother filed a claim against the district in March, The Seattle Times reports. The district said the mother and former student will drop the claim in exchange for a $475,000 settlement, pending approval by King County Superior Court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is investigating three separate incidents of “hate graffiti” on its campus. A statement from the school said its police department is trying to identify who wrote the graffiti. Disciplinary action up to expulsion or dismissal could be taken if the incidents are linked back to a student or employee, the school said. The college didn’t specify what exactly was written but said two of the markings were found Thursday, and one was reported earlier this month. All three were found in restrooms on the Huntington campus. School staffers have since removed the graffiti. “This hate speech is against everything we stand for. We will do everything we can to identify the perpetrators,” President Jerome Gilbert said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nThree Lakes: A school district in northern Wisconsin has refurbished an old photography dark room into a place where the basic needs of its students are met. Teachers at the Three Lakes School District raised money to furnish the room with a washer and dryer to help students who might not have access to one at home. WJFW-TV reports special education teacher Nicole Lewis makes sure the room is stocked with personal essentials such as shampoo, soap, deodorant and toothbrushes. “Not many students, or adults for that matter, are able to concentrate and learn if those basic needs aren’t met,” Lewis said. “I think it’s one of those things that’s a necessity in a school.” The room is also stocked with spare clothing.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Grand Teton National Park stayed near its highest visitation levels in 2019, while Yellowstone National Park had its slowest tourism year since 2014, officials said. Grand Teton’s 2019 attendance trailed only 2018 for tourists visiting the park, The Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. A Grand Teton park spokeswoman credited increased visits during historically slow shoulder seasons, the periods between peak and off-peak seasons. Grand Teton attracted 3.4 million recreational visitors, a category excluding people who only passed through, such as commercial truckers, officials said. July was Grand Teton’s busiest month, with 776,000 visitors, while February, November and December saw fewer than 50,000 recreational visits each, officials said. Yellowstone, also in Wyoming, attracted slightly more than 4 million recreational visitors last year, a 2.3% decrease since 2018 and 5.6% decrease from the all-time high in 2016.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession/index.html", "title": "The British royal family line of succession explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCharles has become Britain’s new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

Council member Kristi Hill says it seemed modern. But the Decatur Daily reports the public reaction was so negative that leaders voted this week for the company to try again. Hill says the town isn’t ready for something as edgy as “A little different.” Decatur is on the Tennessee River, and it has long been called the “River City.” Council member Chuck Ard says residents need to speak up if they don’t want to lose that identity.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Country musician Zac Brown has lost a bid to limit snoopers on his private property in the state, the latest case in which the desires of the wealthy or celebrity for privacy have been at odds with public access. The lead singer for the multi-platinum, Grammy-winning Southern rock group that bears his name had sought to remove easements allowing access along his property, but the bid was rejected by a planning commission on the Kenai Peninsula, south of Anchorage, KSRM-AM reports. “I’m not interested in the public coming up to my home, people snooping, walking up to my windows,” Brown told the commission. “I’ve had to sell property for this reason.” Brown’s log home in Homer overlooks scenic Kachemak Bay.

Arpaio was convicted of misdemeanor contempt of court for disobeying a court order to stop his immigration patrols. A judge who had refused to expunge the conviction says that pardons don’t erase convictions or the facts of cases and that Arpaio’s clemency only mooted his possible punishments. Arpaio’s lawyers argued their client was deprived of his opportunity to appeal his conviction because the pardon came before he was sentenced and final judgment was entered, so the conviction must be erased. A special prosecutor says Arpaio relinquished his right to appeal his conviction when he accepted the pardon.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A plant-based food producer has asked a federal court to temporarily stop the state from enforcing a law that bans labeling vegetarian and vegan products as meat and advertising them as such while litigation is underway. Hood River, Oregon-based Tofurky Co. told courts Wednesday that complying with the law would have a “severe detrimental impact” because of the cost to change marketing and packaging. It’s not clear if the law has been enforced since taking effect three weeks ago. The law’s authors say it’s designed to protect consumers.

That’s about the size of a softball, although it’s more oblong. Measurements taken by the family that recovered the hail stone after it was safe to go outside show it was initially a little bigger.

The Early Screening and Intervention Initiative asks specially trained prosecutors to screen for low-level offenses – such as fourth-degree larceny or second-degree assault – and work with counselors in the courthouse to get the defendants treatment. If the person completes treatment, prosecutors then can decide not to pursue the case. The Division of Criminal Justice says the goal is to reduce the burden on the courts and find more appropriate, and often cheaper, outcomes for people struggling with addiction or other mental health issues in a state where police often file charges directly rather than working through prosecutors.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Big Brother wants to keep a closer eye on big rigs in the state. Gov. John Carney was expected to sign legislation Thursday that authorizes state and local governments to install vehicle height monitoring systems. The systems use camera technology to record images of motor vehicles whose heights exceed specified size limits. The legislation is aimed at making sure tractor-trailer drivers aren’t using roads on which trucks are prohibited. State transportation officials will have one year from enactment of the legislation to identify roads as potential candidates for the monitoring systems and conduct an analysis to determine the appropriateness of each location. State officials could then install monitoring systems on state-maintained roads, and local governments could adopt ordinances authorizing monitoring systems on locally maintained roads after notifying the public.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has defended its plan to house unaccompanied migrant children in the city.

It says its wards have beds and access to meals, legal services, games and classes. It says it awarded Dynamic Service Solutions a $20.5 million contract this month to operate a 200-bed D.C. facility for kids ages 12 to 17. The Maryland-based contractor has applied for a permit to open the shelter and posted jobs for people to work with “unaccompanied alien” children there.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says its studies show there is no more significant threat to the deer and has set a public forum Aug. 22 in the Keys on removing the deer from the Endangered Species List. Environmental groups say stripping the deer of endangered status would leave it at the mercy of further development. The deer, which grows to about 30 inches at the shoulder, have become a tourist attraction.

But she foreshadowed a looming fight over the state’s new system, writing that “it may be ‘like ‘deja vu all over again.’ ” U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg’s order Thursday prohibits the state from using its antiquated paperless touchscreen machines and election management system beyond this year.

The plan to start construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on the Big Island has been thwarted for weeks by a group of Native Hawaiian activists who say the construction will further desecrate a mountain that already has more than a dozen observatories. A list of more than 200 courses students can take either online or via distance learning has become available, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The majority of the remote classes for student demonstrators are offered through UH-Manoa, while others are offered by the UH-Hilo and Hawaii Community College.

Scott Pugrud, Idaho Office of Species Conservation administrator, says his office is reviewing the regulatory changes. “We’ve got all our staff kind of digging in and seeing what they are and what the impacts will be on Idaho,” Pugrud told the Idaho Press. Idaho is home to six endangered and 13 threatened species, including sockeye salmon and Kootenai River white sturgeon. Threatened species include Canada lynx and grizzly bears. Idaho’s Office of Species Conservation was established in 2000, one year after the peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list. The bird bounced back with a successful captive-breeding effort led by the Peregrine Fund, now based in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to the Illinois State Fair can see a plot of newly legalized industrial hemp growing. The Illinois Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday that 100 industrial hemp and eight CBD plants were planted next to the U of I Master Gardner’s land on 8th Street. Hemp production was legalized last summer, and officials in April made applications available to would-be growers. Agriculture Director John Sullivan says the two varieties of the cash crop are easy to differentiate. CBD plants need to branch out to produce buds for oils. Industrial strains are planted close together so they will grow tall with long, straight stems for production of fiber or hurd – dense, absorbent material. An agriculture official will be giving presentations at the hemp plot daily from 1 to 3 p.m.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The cemetery where 1930s gangster John Dillinger is buried is objecting to his body’s planned exhumation as part of a television documentary. Crown Hill Cemetery said in a statement Wednesday that it objects to the exhumation in part because it’s concerned that “the complex and commercial nature of this exhumation could cause disruption to the peaceful tranquility of the Cemetery” and people visiting loved ones’ graves. Dillinger was fatally shot by FBI agents in Chicago in 1934. WXIN-TV reports that Dillinger’s nephew, Michael C. Thompson, sued the cemetery Wednesday, arguing it should allow him and his family to exhume Dillinger’s remains for a forensic examination to determine if it’s in fact Dillinger’s body. That exhumation would be part of a Dillinger documentary for The History Channel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A full weekend of international food and music is in store next month, with the 15th annual World Food & Music Festival set to be held at Western Gateway Park in downtown Des Moines on Sept.20-22.

U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson in a 188-page decision handed down late Tuesday also held the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas in contempt of court, saying she would impose monetary sanctions against the government as punishment for violating orders to preserve evidence and turn over documents to the court-appointed special master investigating prosecutors’ use of video and phone recordings at the privately run Corrections Corporation of America detention center in Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new state law requires public schools to display the motto “In God We Trust,” and one school district has responded with framed copies of a $1 bill. Fayette Superintendent Manny Caulk told the Lexington Herald-Leader on Wednesday that all schools in the district have been provided the framed copy to display. Parent Brittany Pike posted a message on Facebook saying she was pleased to see the back of the dollar bill framed at an elementary school last week and said her children “don’t feel awkward or excluded for not believing in any God.” Republican state Rep. Brandon Reed of Hodgenville filed the legislation that created the new law. He says he’s disappointed to see schools “spend time searching for silly loopholes,” noting the law passed with broad support.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The iconic Superdome, home to the Saints football team and a symbol of the city’s revival after Hurricane Katrina, will undergo a $450 million facelift, under a financing plan approved Thursday that is aimed at keeping the NFL team in Louisiana for decades. The 44-year-old domed stadium, which has hosted seven Super Bowls, will see its ramp system removed and replaced with elevators and escalators, club and suite levels expanded, new entry gates erected, concession stands added and access for people with disabilities improved. Construction is expected to take four years, working around football and other event schedules, but will be completed before the Superdome hosts its next Super Bowl in 2024, says Doug Thornton, a New Orleans-based executive for SMG, which manages the facility.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: Pop artist Robert Indiana had $13 million in the bank even as his house sank into disrepair before his death, with pigeons living in the roof, water damaging books, rotting wood and the stench of cat urine, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Documents filed by Indiana’s estate allege that aide Jamie Thomas was not a selfless caregiver, contending he “improperly lined his pockets,” claimed as gifts more than 100 of Indiana’s works, and allowed Indiana to live in “squalor and filth.” Indiana, whose “LOVE” series is instantly recognizable worldwide, died at his home on Vinalhaven Island on May 19, 2018. He was 89. The documents, filed in Superior Court, accuse Thomas of violating his duties to Indiana. In the end, it took more than 1,000 hours of cleanup and the disposal of 8.6 tons of ruined, waterlogged paper to get the home in order, the documents say.\n\nMaryland\n\nOwings Mills: An African American school principal says he was degraded by a white Baltimore County police officer while he and his son watched an arrest. The Baltimore Sun reports police are investigating the claim made by Patterson High School Principal Vance Benton, who says he and his 15-year-old son were observing an arrest last month when the officer began “baiting” him, making belittling comments, such as asking Benton if he could read and insinuating that Benton’s son would be arrested someday. His letter to county officials says he’d never experienced such “degradation, disrespect and humiliation.” He wrote that innocent lives are in jeopardy from this kind of racial bias. Police Chief Melissa Hyatt says they’re taking the complaint seriously. The department denied the paper’s request for the officer’s body camera recording.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: An increase in the number of great white sharks around Cape Cod has forced a longtime charity swim race to be rerouted. The Cape Cod Times reports that Cape Cod National Seashore officials have denied a permit for the 32nd annual Swim for Life & Paddler Flotilla. The race was originally slated to start off Long Point Beach in Provincetown Harbor. Agency superintendent Brian Carlstrom says starting the race there isn’t in line with the organization’s “shark-smart” principles. Carlstrom says the agency made the decision out of an abundance of caution. The rerouted Sept. 7 race will be closer to shore. The state’s first fatal shark attack in 80 years occurred last September off Cape Cod. Another man was seriously injured in an attack last August.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: More than half of the state’s inmates who are eligible for resentencing following a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on so-called juvenile lifers still are waiting to learn their fate. An analysis found nearly 200 inmates, or about 55% of those eligible, haven’t gotten new sentencing hearings. As of early July, 86 of the state’s 354 juvenile lifers have been released. “We are not resolving cases at the rate that you would hope, given that the United States Supreme Court said these sentences should be rare,” says Tina Olson, an attorney with the Michigan State Appellate Defender Office. Her office is representing roughly two-thirds of the state’s cases. Prosecutors defend the process and say they’re thoughtfully weighing each case.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A conservative law center is suing state Attorney General Keith Ellison, alleging that a lawyer working in his office on climate issues is an improper political plant. Attorney Pete Surdo is working for Ellison under a fellowship with the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University’s School of Law. Minnesota Public Radio reports the center was funded by billionaire donor Michael Bloomberg to address climate issues. Doug Seaton of the Upper Midwest Law Center says the connection is improper and unethical. He also says the arrangement violates a state law requiring all lawyers in the attorney general’s office to be state-paid. But Ellison says the arrangement is legal. He says Minnesotans expect an attorney general who enforces environmental law, and he’s happy to accept the help.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s largest city will stop curbside recycling collections by month’s end. Public Works Director Bob Miller says the program is indefinitely suspended, in part because China’s demand for recycled materials has fallen. Officials say more than 300 cities nationwide have stopped curbside collections. Jackson is referring residents to private collectors and says it’s seeking drop-off alternatives. Residents will get at least one more curbside collection before Sept. 1. Miller says while the city has been spending $1.15 million annually for curbside pickup, less than a third of residents participate. He says Jackson will consider restarting curbside recycling when the marketplace “reorganizes itself.” Waste Management, which collects Jackson’s garbage and recycling, argues the city can’t cut recycling from its contract. Jackson officials disagree and haven’t paid for months.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state Department of Natural Resources and Missouri Central Railroad have more time to negotiate over a proposed 144-mile bike trail that would stretch across the state. Missouri State Parks said Wednesday that the U.S. Surface Transportation Board approved a request for another 133 days to negotiate an agreement for the Rock Island Trail, which would run from Windsor in western Missouri to Beaufort in eastern Missouri. The trail would run along a former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad path. The Jefferson City News-Tribune reports Mike Sunderland, of the Missouri State Parks, says the extension will allow the Missouri State Park Foundation to develop potential partnerships to support the project.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A federal land agency has purchased a large area of land from a state conservation organization, increasing the amount of public ownership in the region. The Missoulian reports the Bureau of Land Management signed paperwork this week to purchase 20 square miles in the Lower Blackfoot River corridor just east of Missoula. Federal officials say money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund was used to purchase the land, with future plans to acquire additional areas by the end of 2020. Officials say the goal is to reach 94 square miles in the Blackfoot drainage and return formerly public lands that were given away decades ago. Officials say any additional purchases will have to go through a federal review process.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials say hunters may begin donating deer to the Hunters Helping the Hungry program beginning Sept. 1 at 11 processor locations around the state. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says two more will accept deer for the program starting Nov. 1 and Nov. 16. Hunters pay no processing costs for the processing. The program is funded solely by tax-deductible contributions. Ground venison is distributed by charitable organizations to Nebraskans in need. Processors accept only whole deer in good condition to ensure a good yield of pure ground venison. Learn more about the program and how to support it at the commission website, or contact program coordinator Teresa Lombard at 402 471-5430 or teresa.lombard@nebraska.gov.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Federal Highway Administration has issued an environmental excellence award to state wildlife and transportation officials for creating wildlife safety crossings on special highway overpasses in northeast Nevada. The award recognizes nine safety crossings installed on Interstate 80 in Elko County between Wendover and Wells and U.S. Highway 93 north of Wells to reduce potentially dangerous vehicle-animal collisions. The overpasses are covered with native soil and vegetation to replicate the natural environment and encourage crossing by mule deer, elk and other animals. Nevada’s departments of transportation and wildlife worked together to identify the most critical deer migration and roadway-crossing points, including GPS collars to track the migratory movements of hundreds of deer.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The police department says it will install surveillance cameras despite a judge’s warning they could violate privacy laws. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire sued the city of Manchester over the cameras in June. A judge’s preliminary order Tuesday said reviewing the footage and using it to identify someone is illegal, though installing the cameras isn’t. Manchester police want to install the three cameras near City Hall because of complaints about crime, panhandling and loitering. A live feed would be transmitted to the dispatch office. While not intended for traffic, the cameras on Elm Street could capture a driver’s identifying information, such as their face or license plate, which the ACLU says is against the law.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge has put a temporary hold on a new state law allowing terminally ill patients to seek life-ending drugs. Judge Paul Innes of Superior Court in Mercer County signed the temporary order Wednesday blocking the law and set a hearing for October. Brought by Dr. Yosef Glassman, the suit seeking to block the law argues it violates constitutional rights as well as common law barring suicide. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the bill in April, making New Jersey the seventh state allowing the practice. Maine enacted a similar law in June, becoming the eighth. New Jersey’s law went into effect this month. Murphy said at an unrelated event Thursday that he will fight the suit, and the attorney general will put out guidance.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nUpham: Virgin Galactic has unveiled its digs at Spaceport America. The once-empty hangar in a remote spot in the New Mexico desert that anchors the taxpayer-financed launch and landing facility has been transformed into a custom-tailored headquarters where Virgin Galactic will run its commercial flight operations. Two levels within the spaceport include mission control, a preparation area for pilots, and a lounge for paying customers and their friends and families, with each element of the fit and finish paying homage to either the desert landscape that surrounds the futuristic outpost or the promise of traveling to the edge of space. Billionaire Richard Branson, who is behind Virgin Galactic, and former Gov. Bill Richardson first pitched the plan for the spaceport nearly 15 years ago, but there were plenty of construction delays and cost overruns.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: Visitors may now get a look at two rare leopard cubs at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo. Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon announced that the little Amur leopards made their public debut Wednesday at the Syracuse zoo. The male and female cubs gradually ventured out from private quarters into their exhibit. It’s a temporary one while the zoo works toward a new, more complex $400,000 outdoor space for the leopard family. The cubs were born June 19 to parents Tria and Rafferty. The cubs don’t yet have names. The zoo plans a vote soon. Amur leopards are considered critically endangered. They are found in far eastern Russia, where an estimated 84 remain in the wild, up from about 30 in 2012. About 250 Amur leopards live under human care.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMocksville: The police department is evicting its pet cat named Sgt. Butters, and some residents are mounting a campaign to bring him back. The Winston-Salem Journal reports the Mocksville Police Department’s resident feline needed a new home after concerns were raised about a pregnant woman who worked in the building and said she couldn’t be around cats. Officers had rescued the cat last year after it was seen hanging around the department. A Save Sarge Butters petition on Change.org was nearing its goal late Thursday. Sgt. Butters has been credited with helping to restore the department’s tarnished image after a jury awarded $4.1 million in damages to three former officers who said two town officials fired them in 2011 for reporting allegations of corruptions to state officials.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: North Dakota State Fair officials have decided against holding a tobacco-free day at next year’s event. The state Health Department and Bismarck tobacco prevention coalition had asked the fair board to designate Family-Military Day as smoke-free at the 2020 event. Fair Board President Gary Knell says it would be difficult to make a fairgrounds ban work. The board decided to continue following state guidelines regarding tobacco in public places. State law prohibits smoking in enclosed public spaces oe within 20 feet of doors, windows or ventilation systems of public buildings. The Minot Daily News reports Knell says even though the board denied a tobacco-free day, advocacy groups could set up booths at the fair to encourage people to go tobacco-free on the grounds.\n\nOhio\n\nPortsmouth: A man is crediting his dog for saving him after the man suffered a bad fall. WSAZ-TV reports Jimmy Hale fell off a flood wall in Portsmouth last week while walking Taco. Hale ended up passing out after falling 15 feet and didn’t wake up until the next day. Hale says he screamed for help, but no one answered. That’s when Hale says he heard a lawnmower and then footsteps. Portsmouth city worker Mark Puckett says he only noticed Hale because of Taco, who stayed on the wall until someone showed up. Hale was flown to St. Mary’s Medical Center, where he was still recovering Wednesday from pelvic and wrist injuries. Hale was reunited with Taco in the hospital Wednesday, and the two had an emotional reunion.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin has agreed to provide access to propriety research and other data to researchers at Oklahoma State University to help them find causes and treatments for drug addiction. Purdue Pharma announced the agreement Thursday in a joint statement with OSU. Purdue said it will provide OSU’s new National Center for Wellness & Recovery access to “research molecules and certain associated data” that will help with research into addiction. The company and its controlling family, the Sacklers, agreed earlier this year to pay Oklahoma $270 million to settle allegations they helped create the nation’s deadly opioid crisis with their aggressive marketing campaign. That money is being used to establish the research center at OSU.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The governor has signed a bill requiring eggs produced by commercial farms to eventually be cage-free. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Gov. Kate Brown approved the new law mandating all eggs produced or sold in Oregon must come from cage-free hens by 2024. The measure signed Monday applies to commercial farms with 3,000 or more chickens. The state requirements will give about 4 million birds added space and perches. The Humane Society of the United States called the law a “monumental win for hens confined in tiny cages in the egg industry.” Oregon joins a handful of other states with similar laws including California, Washington and Massachusetts. The newspaper cites reports that say cage-free laws provide an improvement for chickens, but most remain held in small spaces and cages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMechanicsburg: A man is accused of putting people at risk by placing unidentified substances into consumer product packaging and returning the items to retail stores. Police on Wednesday charged 58-year-old Robert Keith Burns of Mechanicsburg with reckless endangerment, theft by deception and criminal mischief through tampering. The arrest affidavit says Burns wouldn’t tell investigators what materials were put inside of packaging for beauty aids and medication returned to stores or recovered from his home. He’s in jail, unable to post $50,000 bail. Burns doesn’t have a lawyer listed in court records. Authorities seized packaging, glue, jars and white cream from a search of Burns’ home last week. Police have said they are trying to determine what substances were used and haven’t fielded any reports of people being sickened.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The state’s attorney general and state police launched investigations Thursday after a truck drove through a group protesting federal immigration policies at a detention center, which has since placed an employee on leave. At least two people were injured, one seriously, Wednesday night outside the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, according to the Jewish youth movement Never Again Action. The center is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A video posted by the group on social media shows a black pickup that protesters say was operated by a uniformed corrections officer driving up to an entrance blocked by demonstrators. The vehicle stops before again moving forward. Protesters surround the truck, screaming and chanting: “The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBeaufort: A former commercial helicopter pilot has become the first female Marine to pilot the F-35, a next-generation joint strike fighter aircraft. The Island Packet reports Capt. Anneliese Satz completed her fighter jet training this summer at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort. Satz trained in Mississippi, Florida and Texas over the past four years before arriving in Beaufort last summer to train in the F-35B Lightning II. A station statement says Satz’s aircraft is a supersonic stealth vessel designed to operate from short-field bases and near front-line combat zones. The statement says the 29-year-old Satz credits her history as a commercial helicopter pilot as what prepared her for a career in military aviation. She’s now headed to Iwakuni, Japan, to join a unit called the Green Knights.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrandon: The state Department of Health and city officials are trying to assure residents the quality of the city’s drinking water is just fine. Concerns were raised after a doctored water quality report surfaced online that indicated unsafe radium levels. The report had redacted information about the company that conducted the testing, as well as the identity of the customer who hired the water quality assessment done. The state and city investigated and found the report posted online July 28 had been altered. The city of Brandon held a press conference Wednesday afternoon to address the issue and assure residents Brandon’s drinking water meets Environmental Protection Agency safety standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A local startup aims to use honey to help heal wounds, and Regional One Health is putting its unique product to the test. Apis is a dissolvable patch made of manuka honey from New Zealand and the structural protein collagen that protects wounds during the healing process. It’s the first product by SweetBio, a company with four full-time employees based out of the University of Memphis’ CommuniTech Research Park. SweetBio wants to figure out where exactly its product fits in the health care industry, a question Regional One’s health system is suited to answer thanks to the variety of patient scenarios it encounters. Regional Medical Center in Memphis, an acute-care hospital, is in that system. The partnership is the next step in Apis’ journey to becoming a commercial product, following its FDA clearance for wound management in May.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Area voters will be asked this fall to approve up to $3.5 billion in bonds to expand public transportation that supporters say could benefit more than a dozen communities. Metropolitan Transit Authority board members on Tuesday agreed to place the issue on the Nov. 5 ballot. The bonds would be repaid by future sales tax revenues. Federal money will also be sought for the anticipated $7.5 billion in projects that could extend three light rail lines, expand use of bus rapid transit in dedicated lanes and create high-occupancy vehicle lanes along most of Houston’s freeways. Houston-area voters in 1978 created METRO and approved a one-cent sales tax to support operations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah plans to spend about $925,000 to improve safety following the killing of a student track athlete on the Salt Lake City campus. University President Ruth Watkins had called for a task force to evaluate safety after 21-year-old Lauren McCluskey was gunned down in October by a man she briefly dated. The task force made two dozen recommendations, including improving building alarms, adding police patrol outside of night classes and hiring a chief security officer. The university is also rolling out a campus ride-hailing service. Students hired to be drivers will transport students and staff across campus. The university plans to have most of the security measures in place before classes start next week.\n\nVermont\n\nWilmington: A nonprofit created in response to Tropical Storm Irene is dissolving and donating its funds for local trail upgrades. The Wilmington Selectboard voted this week to accept more than $176,000 of remaining assets from the Wilmington Fund to be used for renovations of the Valley Trail system. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the money is meant to be used to enhance, upgrade and build the trail system with “family friendly” biking and hiking. The designated area spans about 5.6 miles between Wilmington and Dover. Town Manager Scott Tucker says the board’s next step is to plan the design for the trail system. He did not give a cost or exact time estimate for the project. Tucker says they hope to begin construction by next spring.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The widows of two state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while monitoring a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville are suing the state and others, blaming their husbands’ deaths on a “maintenance nightmare.” Amanda Bates and Karen Cullen filed wrongful death lawsuits Monday against Virginia, the Secretariat of Public Safety and Homeland Security and state police. Berke M.M. Bates and H. Jay Cullen had been monitoring the “Unite the Right” rally Aug. 12, 2017, before their helicopter crashed. The lawsuits say the helicopter was a “maintenance nightmare” with a history of malfunctions. Federal transportation safety investigators expect to issue a final report on the crash next year. A preliminary report did not offer a likely cause. Spokeswomen for the defendants said they couldn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Newly leaked emails show conservative state Rep. Matt Shea has had close ties with a group in the state that trained children and young men for religious combat. The Spokesman-Review reports the emails were first revealed in The Guardian on Wednesday, while Shea’s ties with Team Rugged also showed up in a video on Shea’s public Facebook page. “The entire purpose behind Team Rugged is to provide patriotic and biblical training on war for young men,” a man identified as the group’s leader, Patrick Caughran, wrote in a 2016 email to Shea, R-Spokane Valley. “Everything about it is both politically incorrect and what would be considered shocking truth to most modern christians,” Caughran wrote. “There will be scenarios where every participant will have to fight against one of the most barbaric enemies that are invading our country, Muslims terrorists.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFort Gay: The town has received a grant that’s expected to help transform a lock house into a community historical site. The Herald-Dispatch reports the FOCUS WV Brownfields Grant check was presented last week to leaders in Fort Gay. The $5,000 grant will allow the town to get an environmental assessment, which is the first step in transforming the Lock Masters House at the Big Sandy Lock and Dam #3. The town hopes to turn the lock house into a welcome center and community museum. Leaders also want to add a public river walk. Construction of the dam was completed in 1897 but abandoned in 1925. Currently, the locks are mainly used by a few fishers, but Mayor Joetta Hatfield says she hopes the site attracts more anglers in the future.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos accused a paralyzed Democratic lawmaker of trying to sabotage a new national role for the Republican legislative leader by publicly seeking accommodations for his disability. This “does not seem like an accident to me,” Vos told a conservative radio show host Thursday. “Everything they do is political and trying to make the other side look bad.” Vos earlier this year rejected Rep. Jimmy Anderson’s request to be able to call into meetings he cannot attend because of his disability and to bar overnight floor sessions. Vos told WISN’s Jay Weber he believes the timing of Anderson’s public appeal was meant to undermine the announcement of Vos taking over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. But Democratic leaders made the request in February, and Anderson reached out to a reporter in May. Vos took over the new role 10 days after the story was published.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A new state park at a former launch command center for one of the world’s most powerful nuclear missiles has opened to the public this week. KGAB-AM reports the Quebec 1 Wyoming Historic Site north of Cheyenne opened for tours Tuesday. An official grand opening is set for this weekend. The former Peacekeeper missile site is located off Interstate 25 about 25 miles north of Cheyenne. Tourists will be able to go underground to the steel-reinforced concrete capsule. The site also features a museum. It’s estimated that the site will attract 50,000-60,000 visitors a year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/26/food-stamp-cuts-holidays-stress-food-banks/3751445/", "title": "Food stamp cuts, holidays stress food banks", "text": "Jake Grovum\n\nPew/Stateline Staff Writer\n\nThe %245 billion cut in food stamp benefits will affect about 48 million Americans\n\nFor those who help the hungry%2C 2013 is looking a lot like the years since the recession began\n\n15%25 of all Americans are considered %22food insecure%2C%22 and many of those people don%27t use food stamps\n\nFood banks across the country are bracing for what has become an annual occurrence during this season: a spike in demand as millions of Americans struggle to put holiday meals on their tables.\n\nFor those who help the hungry, 2013 is looking a lot like the years since the recession began—with the added challenge of a $5 billion cut in food stamp benefits, which took effect Nov. 1. About 48 million Americans will be hit by the reduction in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), which will subtract $36 per month for a family of four. Total benefit amounts vary by state.\n\n\"Nobody's been able to catch their breath,\" said Ross Fraser of Feeding America, a nationwide network of 200 food banks that supplies 63,000 agencies around the country. \"Everyone's scared to death about these SNAP cuts.\"\n\nBad timing\n\nAs advocates for the hungry tell it, the reduction in food stamp benefits — the result of an expiration of a temporary boost enacted in 2009 — couldn't have come at worse time.\n\nThe Great Recession has already stretched food banks' ability to help the 15% of all Americans who are considered \"food insecure,\" according to an Agriculture Department report. Many of those people do not use food stamps.\n\nMany food banks are holding extra food drives, or asking companies to make special seasonal donations – turkeys, for example. Others food banks just buy more food; one reported buying 50% more this month compared to October.\n\nThe cut in food stamp benefits will only increase the demand.\n\nEnrollment in food stamps is almost three times what it was in 2000, but that hasn't lessened the dependence on food banks. Since 2006, the number of Americans receiving aid from food pantries and similar services is up almost 50%, according to Feeding America.\n\nA survey by the nonprofit Food Bank for New York City found that almost half of its food pantries and soup kitchens were forced to turn visitors away at some point last year, with 83% blaming a lack of food. At the same time, the group said their ranks shrank during the recession, with 247 of its partners closing since 2007.\n\nIn Indiana this year, lawmakers approved using state funds to pay for the processing of deer meat donated by hunters across the state. This was the first year the state chipped in to pay for the processing in an attempt to boost donations. In the past, hunters or processors covered the cost.\n\nThat led to a welcome infusion of meat donations to the state's food banks, supplementing the normal fare comprised largely of canned vegetables and other non-perishables, said Jake Bruner of the Hoosier Hills Food Bank in Bloomington, Ind.\n\nThose additional donations were well-timed. Hoosier Hills has already distributed more than 3.2 million pounds of food this year, Bruner said, more than in 2011 or 2012.\n\n\"Some pantries are serving thousands of people a week,\" he said.\n\nPerishables move\n\nThe spike in demand has led to an unexpected benefit: In the past, fresh food and produce often lingered on shelves so long it went bad. Now, that's not a concern.\n\n\"A lot of those are fairly rural counties,\" Bruner said of the areas his food bank serves. \"We're seeing agencies, a mom-and-pop food pantry, being able to take full bins of bananas and distribute them quickly.\"\n\nIn Fort Smith, Ark., near the Oklahoma border, the River Valley Food Bank is nearing the end of its own record-setting year, having distributed more than 8 million pounds of food in 2013, compared to 6.7 million last year.\n\nThe reason for the jump is a mix of still-increasing demand and the bank's ability to store more food, said its director, Ted Clemons. \"When you can distribute 8 million pounds and the pantries are still taking that food, that shows there is a demand,\" he said.\n\nUnlike past years, the food bank didn't receive any donated turkeys this year. So River Valley held a one-day \"turkey drive\" last week. Halfway through Friday's effort, Clemons, reached by phone while out collecting turkeys, said they'd already collected more than 300, with a goal of 800 for the day.\n\nStill not enough\n\nBut even the most robust food banks aren't able to fill the need, a fact that was true even before the recent food stamp cuts. By Feeding America's estimate, the benefit cuts will cost 1.9 million meals for low-income Americans next year—more than half the number of meals the organization distributes in a given year.\n\nEven at Washington, D.C.'s Capital Area Food Bank, which moves 45 million pounds of food each year from its 100,000-square-foot facility a few miles from the U.S. Capitol, organizers know they can't feed everybody who is hungry.\n\nThe facility covers parts of Virginia and Maryland, along with the nation's capital itself, where almost one in four residents is on food stamps. In preparation for the holidays, the food bank bought 50% more food this month than it did in October. Two weeks ago, it received a donation of 1,000 turkeys from a grocer.\n\n\"It would be great to put ourselves out of business,\" Page Crosland, director of media and events at the food bank, said last week. \"But I don't see that happening.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/19/lorax-tree-legend-butter-elmo-meth-squirrel-news-around-states/39602013/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAthens: Investigators say a man kept a caged “attack squirrel” in his apartment and fed it methamphetamine to ensure it stayed aggressive. The News Courier reports authorities are seeking 35-year-old Mickey Paulk on multiple charges including possession of a controlled substance. Law enforcement was warned of the animal prior to executing a search warrant of the Athens home Monday. It’s illegal in Alabama to have a pet squirrel. Officials from the state’s Department of Conservation recommended releasing the animal, which deputies did successfully. A spokesman for the Limestone County Sherriff’s Office says there was no safe way to test the squirrel for meth.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A major earthquake that rocked the state proved to be a trial run in its largest city for a new national wireless network dedicated to first responders. Anchorage Police Chief Justin Doll and other commanders had just signed on to test the FirstNet network on their personal cellphones when the 7.1 magnitude quake struck last year. After it caused widespread damage and knocked out phone lines, Doll says officials with FirstNet were the only ones who could communicate without problems. Public safety agencies nationwide are tapped into the network established by Congress in 2012 after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It launched last year. The network is secure, encrypted and off limits to the public. It’s raised concerns among media advocates that the secrecy shields police from scrutiny.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The city is the largest in the nation that hasn’t yet issued body cameras to its police officers. The City Council voted in February to fund 2,000 body-worn cameras for patrol officers, but the cameras haven’t yet been rolled out. The controversial May 27 arrest of a couple at whom police yelled, cursed and pointed guns in front of their young children prompted a public apology from Mayor Kate Gallego and an assurance that the city would take measures to prevent similar encounters from occurring again. It also led to incorrect comments by other politicians and media outlets that the officers had turned off their cameras. Gallego said the city will distribute the body-worn cameras by the end of the summer.\n\nArkansas\n\nVendor: A Newton County hog farm operating in the Buffalo River watershed has agreed to cease operations, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced last week. C&H Hog Farms of Vendor will close its doors later this year under a $6.2 million buyout agreement that was negotiated by Hutchinson and Department of Arkansas Heritage Director Stacy Hurst. The farm’s owners will retain ownership of the property but will grant the state a conservation easement, which will limit its future usage. Money for the $6.2 million buyout will come from the state and from nonprofit conservation group The Nature Conservancy. Hutchinson said Thursday that The Nature Conservancy will not pay more than $1 million toward the buyout, likely just about $600,000.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A century-old tree with a long trunk and bushy branches that some believe was the inspiration for fictional Truffula trees in Dr. Seuss’ “The Lorax” has fallen in a coastal park. Officials are investigating why the wind-swept Monterey cypress toppled in Ellen Browning Scripps Park last week, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. According to local legend, the tree inspired the “The Lorax” by Theodor “Dr. Seuss” Geisel, who lived nearby and worked in an office with a sweeping view of the coastline. But there are no facts to back up the lore. His wife told the La Jolla Village News in 2012 that the idea for Truffula trees in the 1971 environmental fable came from an Africa trip. “He looked up at one of the (local) trees, and said, ‘That’s my tree. They’ve stolen my tree.’ So that’s where that came from,” Audrey Geisel said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court says proponents of a ballot initiative to eliminate constitutional limits on taxation and spending can proceed. The court ruled 5-2 in an opinion released Monday that elections officials erred in rejecting the proposed 2020 ballot initiative. The liberal Colorado Fiscal Institute wants to ask voters whether the 1992 Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights should be eliminated. TABOR is a voter-approved constitutional amendment that strictly limits the ability of Colorado government to raise taxes, issue bonds and increase spending without a vote of the people. The court ordered elections officials to certify the proposed repeal question so proponents can begin collecting voter signatures to put the question on the ballot.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An effort is underway to identify the remains of two unknown victims of a massive fire at a circus 75 years ago. The Hartford Courant reports that a judge hearing an exhumation request Monday asked for additional information and ordered public service announcements to be placed in two media outlets to make sure anyone with an interest in the exhumations has an opportunity to be heard. The July 6, 1944, fire in Hartford killed 168 and injured 682. Five victims remain unidentified and buried in a Windsor cemetery. State Chief Medical Examiner James Gill wants to compare the unknown victims’ DNA to that of Sandra Sumrow, the granddaughter of 47-year-old Grace Fifield, who was at the circus the day of the fire but was never seen again.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Clifford Brown Jazz Festival will fill Rodney Square with live music for its 31st year starting Wednesday. The festival, an annual tribute to the late Wilmington jazz artist Clifford Brown, kicks off at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday with performances by Philadelphia trombonist Jeff Bradshaw, jazz drummer Jamison Ross and trumpeter Etienne Charles. Thursday will see Cuban jazz pianist Alfredo Rodriguez’s trio headlining. Friday’s lineup features the Philadelphia/New York-based Jenkins Project and New Orleans-born trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. The concert will be followed by a downtown block party from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. On Saturday, performances include a headlining set by Grammy Award-winner (and former “Tonight Show” bandleader) Branford Marsalis. The free music festival wraps up Sunday. Go to cliffordbrownjazzfest.org for complete details.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metro is launching a two-year study of the transit system’s blue, orange and silver lines in order to meet the demands of a growing region, WUSA-TV reports. Metro is limited in terms of what it can do to meet ridership demands because of the lines’ configuration. All three lines merge onto one set of tracks at the Rosslyn tunnel, creating an hourglass design that limits the number of trains that can pass through at a given time. Any disruption in one line can create trouble for another, causing a cascade of delays and service issues across all BOS lines. Over the next two years, Metro is asking its riders, workers and community to get involved in the study and provide their feedback on its BOS lines.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Port Richey: A stretch of road on the Gulf Coast that was adopted by the Ku Klux Klan 25 years ago is now being sponsored by a gay rights group. Pasco Pride recently adopted the stretch of Moon Lake Road in New Port Richey. WUSF in Tampa reports that the KKK adopted the 1-mile stretch of the road back in 1993. Pasco Pride President Nina Borders says she was unaware of the KKK’s previous sponsorship. As sponsors, Pasco Pride will clear trash from the stretch of road four times a year. Border says the change in sponsorship reflects how much the community located northwest of Tampa has changed in a quarter-century.\n\nGeorgia\n\nFort Valley: The idea behind The Peach Truck involved selling Georgia peaches from the farm directly to the consumer. The Telegraph reports that the truck now travels around the nation selling peaches in parking lots. Stephen Rose says he now sells about two semitrailer loads of peaches a day. All of the peaches come from Georgia growers. Rose says that social media marketing has been a key driver of the business. He says people go online to follow where the truck will be and line up by the hundreds to get 25-pound boxes of peaches. He says the peaches sold from The Peach Truck go from the orchard to the customer in two days or less.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua: A local company hopes to build an underwater farm that can produce large quantities of edible seaweed. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Kampachi Farms LLC is working to establish a farm to grow limu more than a mile off Kaiwi Point near Kailua on Hawaii Island. Limu is an ingredient in poke, a traditional Hawaiian dish of diced raw fish. Kampachi Farms is seeking state and federal permits to test growth of four native limu species on submerged lines by supplying the plants with nutrient-rich water from depths between 600 and 2,000 feet. An official says the operation 33 feet below the surface could potentially farm limu in quantities large enough for use as animal feed and biofuel.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal wildfire forecaster says the state’s wet spring and below-average temperatures the past three months will likely mean a later start to forest fires, but rangeland fires could be a problem as grasses dry out. Bryan Henry of the National Interagency Fire Center said in a presentation before the Idaho Land Board on Tuesday that the state is mostly looking good at the moment. Idaho Gov. Brad Little and other Land Board members also received an update from state officials on how state firefighting equipment is being deployed, with much of it in the north to protect forests. The state also works collaboratively with Rangeland Fire Protection Associations that involve private ranchers. The state now has nine of them helping protect some 14,000 square miles.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: An exhibit of unique typewriters, including one used by the founder of Playboy, has opened at the University of Illinois. The university’s Rare Book & Manuscript Library will feature typewriters used by Hugh Hefner and Roger Ebert. Both men were alumni of the university. Hefner’s Underwood Standard portable typewriter that he used in college and to write for Playboy is one of the main exhibits. It is on loan to the library after being sold at auction in December for $162,500. The typewriters used by poet Carl Sandburg and novelist James Jones are also featured. The exhibit “Writers & Their Tools: Parchment-Paper-Processors” opened Monday and ends in August.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A national report says opioid prescriptions in the state have decreased by 35.1% over five years. The American Medical Association Opioid Task Force 2019 Progress Report shows Indiana’s reduction in opioid prescriptions from 2013 to 2018 is 2 percentage points higher than the national average of 33%. Indiana Hospital Association President Brian Tabor said last week that the opioid epidemic has damaged “individuals, families and entire communities” in Indiana. “It’s encouraging to see tangible results of the collective efforts of the state, the Indiana General Assembly and the medical community” in encouraging responsible prescriptions of opioids, he said. A 2017 law passed by the General Assembly requires medical providers to write prescriptions for no more than a seven-day supply of an opioid when first prescribing to a patient.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: This year’s Iowa State Fair butter sculpture will likely be a hit with the kids. Elmo and his friends from “Sesame Street” will be visiting the 2019 fair. Butter versions of characters from the iconic children’s show will be appearing next to the butter cow, fair officials said in a news release Monday. The show is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. The butter sculptures will be on display in the John Deere Agriculture Building throughout the fair, which runs Aug. 8-18. The butter cow has been sculpted at the Iowa State Fair since 1911, according to the news release. Various companion sculptures have joined the butter cow since 1996, including the “American Gothic” couple, Elvis Presley, Harry Potter and other characters.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The city is gearing up for a major music festival that had to be moved here because of flooding. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that the 24th annual Kicker Country Stampede will be held Thursday through Saturday at Heartland Motorsports Park in Topeka. It typically is held at Manhattan’s Tuttle Creek State Park, but water levels have been high this spring. Plans for one Topeka-area road project and one highway project have been revised to ensure they don’t conflict with the expected rush of visitors. The event typically draws more than 170,000 people. Meanwhile, Shawnee County Sheriff’s Sgt. Todd Stallbaumer says the sheriff’s office is working with event staff on personnel needed for staffing the event. This year’s performers include Old Dominion, Jason Aldean and Jake Owen.\n\nKentucky\n\nOwensboro: Part of a bourbon warehouse in western Kentucky collapsed during a thunderstorm. The partial collapse of the O.Z. Tyler Distillery rickhouse was reported early Monday, according to news outlets. Master Distiller Jacob Call says about 20,000 barrels are stored at the location, and it appears that about 4,000 were affected. He says most barrels seemed intact. Call said engineers were heading out to try to determine what caused the collapse. It’s unclear if weather played a role. Officials say no one was hurt. A nearby road is closed while the cleanup continues. Another Kentucky bourbon barrel warehouse collapsed last year. Half of a warehouse collapsed at the Barton 1792 Distillery in Bardstown on June 22, 2018, and the other half came down two weeks later.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Some state archaeologists are spending three weeks with students at the Louisiana School for the Visually Impaired, including a mock dig for 26 students. Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser said in a news release Wednesday that the program runs through June 28. It also includes pottery making and a field trip to the Louisiana Museum of Natural Sciences. The students range from first through 12th grade. Archaeologists generally use stakes and string to mark off a grid for digging. The students’ grid was made of wood. They put dirt from inside the grid into buckets, then sieved the dirt to find whether they’d turned up anything. The three-week program is a partnership between the school and the Louisiana Office of Cultural Development’s Division of Archaeology.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Single-use plastic bags will be banned in grocery stores statewide by 2020, according to legislation signed by the governor Monday. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed the bill with the goal of limiting plastic pollution, House Democrats said. The ban will come into effect by April 22, 2020, which is Earth Day. Maine’s bill comes as municipalities and legislatures in many states have considered such bans. Maine will allow stores to charge at least 5 cents for recyclable paper or reusable plastic bags. In order to be permitted, plastic bags would have to withstand 75 repeated uses and be made from heavier plastic. The fee wouldn’t apply to restaurants. Plastic bag manufacturers say such bans will only lead to thicker, reusable bags in landfills.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: This beach town’s favorite cat is continuing to grow in popularity with the release of a self-published book. Within the past year, Pip the Beach Cat has made a name for himself during his adventures in the resort town, garnering more than 15,000 followers on Facebook. When Pip wasn’t trekking the beaches, riding a paddle board or taking a dip in the ocean in recent months, he was working on a children’s book about things to do in Ocean City. “Pip’s Guide to Ocean City Vol. I,” narrated by none other than Pip himself, focuses on the favorite locations and activities of Pip’s owner Emily Meadows and her family. She says the book includes locations she wants the new generation of children to know about while still providing a nostalgia factor for adults who grew up in or visited Ocean City.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing with a new app that helps users relive the 1969 launch of the Apollo 11 mission. The free app available now uses videos, images and audio recordings from the mission that on July 20, 1969, led to Neil Armstrong’s moonwalk. The JFK Moonshot app will take users from July 16 until July 20 on an augmented reality journey from the Earth to the moon, providing people anywhere in the world the opportunity to view 120 hours of real-time tracking simulation. The app also highlights Kennedy’s inspiration for the mission. In a landmark speech at Rice University in 1962, he challenged the nation to land a man on the moon within a decade.\n\nMichigan\n\nHell: A comedian and rapper boasted on Twitter on Monday that he purchased the town and renamed it “Gay Hell.” Elijah Daniel, in a stint as Hell’s “mayor,” said the move was sparked by U.S. embassies not being allowed to fly pride flags during Pride Month, an annual celebration of the LGBTQ community. Daniel tweeted: “ahead of pride month Trump’s administration put a ban on embassy’s flying pride flags. so as of today, I am now the owner of Hell, Michigan. I bought the whole town. And my first act as owner, I have renamed my town to Gay Hell, MI. The only flags allowed to fly are pride.” Hell is an unincorporated hamlet whose devilish name has made it a popular tourist attraction. Daniel reportedly paid $100 a day to become temporary “mayor” for three days. He also became the temporary mayor in 2017 and promptly banned all straight people from entering Hell.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Eleven nursing homes in the state are on a list of facilities cited by federal officials for patterns of health and safety violations. The U.S. Senate Committee on Aging released a list of 400 nursing homes across the country that are in need of tighter oversight. The facilities were identified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The St. Paul Pioneer Press says two nursing homes in Rochester and Red Wing already receive twice the normal amount of inspections and risk losing federal funding if problems are not addressed. The 11 facilities identified for stricter oversight are just 3% of Minnesota’s nursing homes. The state has about 375 nursing facilities that serve 40,000 residents.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: A grant will buy a tract of land to help preserve a Civil War battlefield. The Vicksburg Post reports that the Mississippi Department of Archives and History is receiving nearly $110,000 from the National Park Service. The money from the American Battlefield Trust will purchase 58 acres at the Champion Hill Battlefield, about halfway between Vicksburg and Jackson. Vicksburg National Military Park Superintendent Bill Justice says the land is along a section of road that connected the parts of the Confederate line and later two parts of the Union line. The Battle of Champion Hill was part of U.S. Gen. Ulysses Grant’s successful effort to take Vicksburg. About 32,000 Union soldiers fought 23,000 Confederates on May 16, 1863. Confederate forces were crushed and retreated to Vicksburg.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Dickerson Park Zoo is welcoming a new 8-year-old Asian elephant. The elephant, named Hugo, arrived Friday from the Endangered Ark Foundation, a private nonprofit and circus elephant retirement ranch in Hugo, Oklahoma. Hugo will be in quarantine for at least a month. He will then be introduced to Patience, a female elephant, and the zoo hopes they will someday be on exhibit together. Asian elephants are critically endangered. The zoo said in a news release that Hugo came to the zoo to increase the genetic diversity of the U.S. elephant population. Also this month, the zoo also welcomed a male baby giraffe and a black-and-white colobus monkey. A ring-tailed lemur was born April 10.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal data shows that ranchers in the state lost more than 37,000 cattle last winter when heavy snow piled up and lingered. The Billings Gazette reports the federal Livestock Indemnity Program paid out $11.1 million for the loss of 37,352 cattle in Montana in 2018. The U.S. Farm Service Agency says that’s more than four times the amount paid out for losses in the previous four years combined. Half of the deaths were in a swath of Montana across six counties blanketed by snow up to 30 inches deep. Ranchers and the Farm Service Agency acknowledge that there were more weather-related livestock deaths that didn’t qualify for compensation. The losses for this past winter, which included historically cold temperatures, haven’t been calculated yet.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Schoolteacher Nancy Monen had an unusual guest come to her residence earlier this year hoping to see the “little room” off the upstairs master bedroom. The famous man and his adult children were enchanted by the small sunroom and the rest of the 101-year-old house where they’d lived six decades ago. And before he left, the dad scribbled something on the arched door of the little room: “The birthplace of Buffett Associates May 1956.” He signed his name, Warren E. Buffett. It paid off for Monen – who, for the first time a few months later, rented her residence to a trio attending the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, often called the Woodstock of Capitalism. Monen reaped $3,000 and is considering hiking the fee next year to spread the wealth to a charity, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “I’m crazy not to capitalize on that,” Monen said. “Warren would want me to.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city is launching a reality show on streaming services that will tell behind-the-scenes stories about how the government navigates local issues. Las Vegas officials announced Monday that the show “Inside Vegas” will premiere Thursday and be available on Roku, Amazon Fire, Apple TV and the city’s GoVegas app. The show’s first season includes three episodes detailing a massage parlor suspected of prostitution, a nonprofit in trouble with police, and the city’s grappling with party houses and short-term rentals. The show will be produced by the city’s communications office.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state isn’t ready to legalize recreational marijuana use, but it is close to expanding options for those who use it for medical reasons. Several bills related to the therapeutic use of cannabis have been sent to Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. One would allow physician assistants to authorize the use of the drug for patients. Another would allow patients and designated caregivers to grow marijuana plants at home. The House passed a bill legalizing recreational use in April, but the Senate later voted to delay action on it. Other bills that would expand the qualifying conditions for medical use also were retained in committee.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: This borough’s council unanimously passed a resolution Monday stating that Freehold and Peralejos de las Truches, a town of about 175 in Spain, are now “twin” cities. The Spanish locale is heavy on fans of Bruce Springsteen, a native of Freehold. “His message is received across the globe, and we’re happy that this little town has reached out to Freehold Borough,” Mayor Nolan Higgins says. A representative for the Spanish town contacted Higgins via email in April requesting a “twinning” designation. It named Springsteen an “Adopted Son” of Peralejos in 2014 and gave the Boss a plaque stating the recognition at a 2016 E Street Band concert in Madrid, Jose Maria of Peralejos said in his communications with Freehold. The Spanish town hosts the annual “Greetings from Peralejos” Springsteen festival in August.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: Federal officials will be offering tours of portions of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park next month. The National Park Service has teamed up with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Nuclear Security Administration to organize tours during a weekend in July. Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis. Each day will consist of two tours of 25 people each, each lasting three hours. Not all sites that make up the park are open to the public. Visitors will see Pond Cabin, which served as an office for the scientists who were studying plutonium; a bunker used to protect equipment and staff during explosives testing; and the building where a deadly plutonium accident took place. Officials say more tours will be planned later this year.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Officials say they’re assigning an extra 500 police officers to the city’s transit system amid a jump in fare evasion and assaults on workers. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday that officers will be deployed to high-ridership subway stations and bus routes, as well as locations with increased levels of staff assaults. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority says assaults reported by employees increased by 15.2% from 2013 to 2017. The agency says lost revenue from fare evasion jumped from $105 million in 2015 to $225 million in 2018. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr., who stopped prosecuting most subway fare evasion cases last year, says his office will contribute $40 million to the policing effort. Under a revised policy, the NYPD now issues summonses to most fare evasion suspects instead of arresting them.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nStatesville: The city has voted against the flying of really big flags, holding its ground against a reality TV star’s huge Stars and Stripes. News outlets report the Statesville City Council voted down changes to the flag ordinance Monday night. That means flags in Statesville must be no larger than 25 feet by 40 feet, roughly half the size of the American flag that Marcus Lemonis has unfurled outside his Gander RV company. Statesville has asked a court to order Gander RV to comply or pay a $50-per-day fine. Lemonis runs Camping World and stars on “The Profit” on CNBC. He says the flag is staying. He’s said he’ll go to jail for contempt of court to protect his constitutional rights.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Some north Bismarck residents are complaining about calcium deposits in water from their faucets at home. Bismarck’s director of utility operations, Michelle Klose, says the problem has been identified in at least 64 mainly newer homes on the outskirts of the city. The Bismarck Tribune reports that Klose says the residue does not present a health risk. Greg Wavra, administrator of the North Dakota Drinking Water Program, says that Bismarck’s water meets the requirements of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and that calcium buildup should not be a cause for alarm. The city says magnesium heating rods may cause the deposits and suggests that homeowners switch to aluminum heating rods and lower the temperature of water heaters to mitigate the problem.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A state lawmaker has introduced legislation that would require school districts to name a valedictorian and a salutatorian. The House bill introduced by Republican state Rep. Niraj Antani, of Miamisburg, comes after Mason High School in southwestern Ohio decided it will stop awarding those academic honors. Many schools traditionally have bestowed the valedictorian title on the graduating student with the highest cumulative grade-point average. The salutatorian title has often gone to the student with the second-highest average. The Columbus Dispatch reports Antani says the gist of the legislation is that “academic competition is good.” The bill allows districts to set criteria for selecting valedictorians and salutatorians. Some Ohio education groups oppose any state bill mandating decisions they say should be made at the local level.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Pardon and Parole Board says nearly 750 prisoners applied in the first four months of the year for their sentences to be commuted. Justin Wolf, the board’s general counsel, says this is about twice the number of applications submitted by the end of April last year. Wolf tells The Oklahoman that more than 560 inmates applied for commutations last month alone. Commutation is a form of clemency intended to correct an unjust or excessive sentence. A measure that took effect in 2017 made some drug and property crimes misdemeanors, not felonies. Agency officials say the bump in applications might be because Gov. Kevin Stitt last month signed legislation directing the board to speed up commutations for those whose crimes have been reclassified as misdemeanors.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: All seven of the state’s public universities will raise tuition for the 2019-2020 school year, with officials citing increased costs and less money than expected from legislators. The hikes range from 2.33% at Western Oregon University in Monmouth to 9.9% at Ashland’s Southern Oregon University. Gov. Kate Brown had made education a priority of this session, repeatedly saying that she wanted to create a “seamless system of education from cradle to career.” The Democrat expressed disappointment that higher education wasn’t involved in a $2 billion increase for K-12 schools that legislators approved earlier this year, and she has continued to push the Legislature to increase university budgets to avoid tuition increases higher than 5%. Legislators recommended a two-year higher education budget of $836.9 million. That is $100 million more than last biennium, though schools like the University of Oregon said they needed at least $120 million more to keep tuition increases below 5%. The University of Oregon, one of the state’s largest public universities, will raise tuition 6.91% next school year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf is vetoing budget-season legislation to substantially ramp up taxpayer support for private and religious schools. In Wolf’s veto message Tuesday, he questioned why Pennsylvania should expand a tax credit that subsidizes private institutions while the state’s public school system remains underfunded. The Democratic governor also criticized the tax credit program as lacking accountability, saying little is known about its educational quality or the middleman groups that can withhold 20% of the money. The Republican-controlled Legislature passed the bill over Wolf’s objections amid budget discussions. Just four Democrats voted for it. It would have nearly doubled the Educational Improvement Tax Credit to $210 million annually. The program effectively lets corporations and business people direct tens of millions in tax dollars to favored private and religious schools.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has received a $2.8 million federal grant to boost efforts to bring an Amtrak stop to Rhode Island’s main airport. The Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements grant was announced by U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Reps. Jim Langevin and David Cicilline, all Democrats. The state Department of Transportation will use it to pay for further planning efforts between the state and Amtrak. Currently, T.F. Green Airport is connected to Providence and Boston by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s commuter rail line. Amtrak stops in Providence, Kingston and Westerly, Rhode Island. The delegation says adding Amtrak service to the airport in Warwick could position the state to attract new investment, create jobs, and enhance transportation options for residents and visitors.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFlorence: Civil War cannons that sat on the bottom of the Pee Dee River for 150 years are now restored and on display at a veterans center in Florence. The cannons are from the Confederate ship Peedee, which was built to break the Union blockade of the South, but its cannons were tossed into the river in 1865 and the ship scuttled as Union troops approached. University of South Carolina archaeologists recovered the cannons in 2015, and scientists at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in North Charleston have spent four years restoring the cannons. The cannons belong to the U.S. government. The Florence County Museum agreed to display them at the Florence County Veterans Center to honor how all veterans’ sacrifice to serve in wars.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The murder of a pharmacist who was raped and strangled in her home in a South Dakota city more than half a century ago has been solved with the use of DNA technology and genealogy databases, police said. Investigators believe Eugene Carroll Field killed 60-year-old Gwen Miller in 1968 when he was a 25-year-old living in Rapid City, Detective Wayne Keefe said at a news conference Monday. He said there was enough evidence to charge Field with first-degree murder, but he died in 2009. It is “a little surreal” to finally identify the killer after 51 years and up to 5,000 hours of work, Keefe said. The motive remains unknown. “Today, there’s a slight celebratory mood because the case has been solved,” Police Chief Karl Jegeris said. “But I assure you, the fact of how horrific this crime was wears heavy on each and every one of our hearts.”\n\nTennessee\n\nManchester: A group that partners with musicians on voter registration efforts says the 1,390 voters it signed up at Bonnaroo represent its all-time high for one festival. A news release from HeadCount says it has registered almost 600,000 voters at 7,500 concerts and music festivals since 2004. Bonnaroo ran from Thursday through Sunday. HeadCount says it wants to register more than 200,000 voters by the 2020 presidential election. A new Tennessee law set to take effect in October allows fines and potentially jail time for voter registration workers who don’t follow new rules. Tennessee will likely be the first state imposing fines for submitting too many incomplete registration forms. HeadCount Director of Engagement Tappan Vickery says she hopes the group can keep providing its services without risking fines or prosecution.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: High school and college students can get their feet wet in marine animal care with a new career exploration program at the Texas State Aquarium. The Animal Science Exploration Program for high school students is set for June 27, from 5 to 7 p.m., and the college-oriented event will take place July 25, from 5 to 7 p.m. Each program is $120 per participant, or $60 for aquarium members. A parental escort is required for participants 17 and younger. Admission for an escort is $10 each, or free for one member. During both events, students will learn about potential aquarium jobs, including careers as a marine biologist, aquarist, animal nutritionist, water quality specialist, professional diver and enrichment specialist. The students will then move on to hands-on activities, including helping to feed sea turtles.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A government watchdog will investigate whether the U.S. Interior Department broke the law by making plans to open lands cut from a national monument in the state by President Donald Trump to leasing for oil, gas and coal development, a pair of Democratic congressmembers said Monday. The Government Accountability Office’s investigation into whether Interior violated the appropriations law by using funds to assess potential resource extraction in the lands cut from the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is the latest chapter in a long-running saga over the sprawling monument created in 1996 on lands home to scenic cliffs, canyons, dinosaur fossils and coal reserves. Trump slashed the monument by nearly half in 2017 following a contentious review by former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke of monuments around the country.\n\nVermont\n\nJohnson: A nonprofit group trying to fight opioid addiction plans to turn a former Catholic church into a recovery center. Vermont Public Radio reports that Greg and Dawn Tatro recently purchased the closed St. John the Apostle Church on behalf of Jenna’s Promise, an organization named for their daughter who died of an overdose in February. Greg Tatro said he plans to build a full-service health care center on the site and will host “sober parties” there to bring together people in recovery and families from the local community. He said the next steps are to talk with the neighbors, work on fundraising and start developing plans for a sober house.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A three-dimensional “LOVE” artwork will be traveling around the state this summer to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the “Virginia is for Lovers” slogan. The artwork unveiled Thursday in Richmond will travel to Virginia Welcome Centers for “50 Years of Love” events so travelers can take their photos with it. It was created by artist Melanie Stimmell Van Latum and unveiled by the Virginia Tourism Corporation. The slogan was created in 1969 by the Richmond-based advertising agency Martin & Woltz Inc., now known as The Martin Agency. Other events planned to mark the anniversary include a 50-mile bike ride on the Virginia Capital Trail on Sunday. Additional events will be held at breweries, wineries and parks throughout Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Members of the Lummi Tribe, along with activists and scientists, launched the Salish Sea Campaign this weekend to save the southern resident orcas and restore their home. KCPQ-TV reports the campaign calls for an impact study on stressors to the Salish Sea caused by humans. It also wants to end new stressors like Navy underwater weapons tests until the Salish Sea is healthier. The tribe says it will measure the sea’s health by the number of salmon using 1985 levels as a baseline. Lummi Nation elder Raynell Morris says that “our relatives under the sea are telling us they need help.” The Lummi Nation’s plan to bring back Lolita the orca was also showcased. The killer whale was captured off Puget Sound in 1970 and taken into captivity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia House of Delegates has pushed a sweeping Republican education proposal one step closer to passage. Lawmakers on Tuesday advanced the plan to allow the state’s first charter schools, setting it up for a full vote in the GOP-controlled chamber Wednesday. If approved, the bill would then head to the Senate for consideration. Education unions and Democrats oppose the measure. They argue that it’s similar to a wide-ranging Senate bill that has led to massive teacher protests at the Capitol. The House bill, among other things, would cap the number at charter schools at 10. The legislature is currently in a special session after failing to agree on education measures before the regular session ended in March. Teachers are packing the statehouse to rally against the House bill.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A new group is forming to push for ending a University of Wisconsin System tuition freeze and more state funding for UW-Madison. Badgers United launched Monday. The board of directors includes former Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, a UW-Madison alumnus. John and Tashia Morgridge, alumni who have donated millions of dollars to the campus, also sit on the board. Republican lawmakers have kept tuition rates for in-state students frozen since 2013. The GOP-controlled Joint Finance Committee in May approved a proposal in Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ budget that extends the freeze for another two years. Evers’ budget called for $127 million in additional state aid for the system, but the committee cut that back to $58 million. System President Ray Cross called the reduction a “kick in the shins.”\n\nWyoming\n\nRiverton: The Wyoming Department of Health has released details on its plan for affordable air ambulance services in the state. The department’s Franz Fuchs says the proposal seeks to decrease the cost of air ambulance services and increase the availability of the service in Wyoming. Under the agency’s proposed plan, the state would determine the number and location of air ambulance bases with the goal of providing the best coverage and response time. Companies would bid to become the state’s Medicaid provider for the service. An attorney for one air ambulance company criticized the proposal, asking how many patients will be required to take ground ambulances. The plan met with mixed reactions from state lawmakers on the Interim Labor, Health and Social Services Committee last week.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/12/22/year-in-review-biggest-stories-2015/77361602/", "title": "Year in Review: 50 stories from 50 states", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBefore we usher in the new year, it's time for a retrospective of 2015.\n\nHere's our roundup of some of the biggest stories across the country, events that influenced national conversations on issues from police brutality to gay marriage, tragedies that shook our psyche and acts of heroism that showed Americans at their best.\n\nAlabama: Despite U.S. ruling legalizing gay marriage, gay adoption still a battle in the states\n\nIt’s a story chock-full of contention. Two lesbian mothers fight for custody of their three children. Two state courts are at odds over adoption rights for same-sex couples — or at least until the Supreme Court stepped in. But first, some background: When the women — identified only as “E.L.” and “V.L.” in court documents — were still together, they temporarily moved to Georgia to sidestep Alabama law, which wouldn’t allow V.L. to legally adopt the children (E.L. was their birth mother). Georgia, on the other hand, was fine with it. But when the couple split up, things got messy. E.L. decided Alabama had the right idea after all and denied V.L. parental rights. And V.L. wasn't having it. She took things all the way up to the Supreme Court, which blocked Alabama’s ruling on Dec. 14. If you need an explainer (we bet you do), we've got that here.\n\nAlaska: You may have to say goodbye to one of the biggest perks of living in Alaska\n\nBlame it on the oil. This December, Alaska Gov. Bill Walker called for the state's first income tax in 35 years. Alaska's the only state that has neither a state-level sales tax nor a personal income tax. For decades, it has been dependent on income from oil, but crude oil prices have been hovering at seven-year lows. So while you've been doing your happy dance at the pump, Alaska has been sinking further into debt. Walker's proposal is part of the state's New Sustainable Alaska Plan, which, paired with a budget proposal, is meant to close the state's $3.5 billion deficit.\n\nArizona: Just how low can Lake Mead go?\n\nLake Mead shrank to a historic low this year. The reservoir, on the Colorado River, stores water for parts of Arizona, Southern California, southern Nevada and northern Mexico — all of which have endured a 15-year drought. The record low signals that users are consuming more than the river provides. In other words, check-engine light.\n\nArkansas: The Duggars' 19 problems and counting\n\nIt was a year of turmoil for Arkansas' Duggar clan. TLC pulled the plug on the family's hit series, 19 Kids and Counting, following the revelation that Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's son Josh sexually molested five young girls, including his own sisters. Other things Josh Duggar admitted to this year: having an Ashley Madison account. Being unfaithful to his wife. Other things that happened to Josh Duggar this year: rehab. Getting sued by a porn star.\n\nCalifornia: Nightmare in San Bernardino\n\nIt was a reminder that Islamist terrorism isn't just a boys' club. In San Bernardino, Calif., this December, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 29, burst into a social services center and opened fire, killing 14 people and setting off an intense manhunt that ended with their deaths. On the surface, they had all the makings of the American dream — he had a secure job, they lived in a nice neighborhood in a prosperous community, and they had a new baby girl. But apparently in their off hours, police say the couple, who authorities believe had been radicalized, stockpiled guns, ammunition and bombs in preparation for an attack aimed at killing as many people as possible.\n\nColorado: 'A warrior for the babies'\n\nPlanned Parenthood found itself in a firestorm of controversy this year after a militant anti-abortion group released secretly filmed videos showing Planned Parenthood doctors discussing how best to collect fetal tissue and organs for research. Abortion-rights groups said the footage led to a surge in violence against abortion clinics. Fast-forward to November, when a gunman killed three people at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs (none of the victims actually worked there). Authorities said that after the five-hour standoff, Robert Lewis Dear, 57, mentioned \"no more baby parts.\" When Dear was in court to be formally advised of the 179 charges against him, he hollered, \"I’m a warrior for the babies.\"\n\nConnecticut: Syrian family finds home in America — just not where they planned\n\nThe family of refugees was destined for Indiana, but politics derailed that. Connecticut Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy welcomed to his state in November a family of Syrian refugees diverted from Indiana because of security concerns raised by Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence. Pence was among dozens of governors who said they wouldn't allow Syrian refugees to settle in their states because of fears about terrorism. \"It is the right thing, the humane thing to do,\" Malloy said about welcoming the Syrian family. \"Quite frankly, if you believe in God, it’s the morally correct thing to do.\"\n\nDelaware: 'Beau Biden was, quite simply, the finest man any of us have ever known'\n\nFormer Delaware attorney general Beau Biden might have been the son of a larger-than-life politician, but in his own way, he was a quiet force of nature. Biden was diagnosed in August 2013 with brain cancer and died in May. His father, Vice President Biden, said in a statement: \"Beau Biden was, quite simply, the finest man any of us have ever known.\" In October, the vice president ended months of intense speculation when he announced he wouldn't seek the presidency: \"As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I've said all along what I've said time and again to others. It may very well be that that process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president. ... I've concluded it has closed.\"\n\nFlorida: Search efforts for two teens lost at sea hit dead ends\n\nThe deepest fears of two Florida families came to fruition on July 24 when their 14-year-old sons, Perry Cohen and Austin Stephanos, went missing at sea. The Coast Guard found their capsized 19-foot boat 67 miles off the coast of Daytona Beach two days later and spent a week scanning hundreds of miles of water before calling off the search. The families refused to give up hope that their sons survived and continued their private search funded through crowdsourced donations. Weeks later, when no credible evidence surfaced, the families were forced to end their search but vowed to \"never stop looking for our boys.\"\n\nGeorgia: Bobbi Kristina Brown dies after she was found unconscious in a bathtub, a demise eerily similar to that of mother Whitney Houston\n\nBobbi Kristina Brown, daughter of the legendary Whitney Houston, died in July in an Atlanta-area hospice, nearly six months after she was found unconscious in her Georgia home. She was 22. She never regained consciousness to explain what happened before she was found Jan. 31, facedown and unresponsive in her bathtub. Her death came three years after her mother's eerily similar demise, and sordid details about Brown's death unfolded throughout the year, including that a woman in charge of her care is charged with impersonating a nurse, accusations that Brown smoked pot and possibly crack, and documents that allege boyfriend Nick Gordon injected her with a \"toxic mixture\" before putting her, unconscious, into the bathtub. The double tragedy of Bobbi Kristina Brown and Whitney Houston is easily one of the most heartbreaking of the celebrity world.\n\nHawaii: Flying on sun power\n\nWe'll call this one down but not out. It's a solar-powered airplane that uses no fuel, can remain in the air indefinitely and which this year attempted a nearly 22,000-mile, round-the-world voyage — until it fried its batteries. Solar Impluse 2's journey, which began March 9 with a flight from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, included various stops around the world with the mission of showcasing what can be done using nothing but renewable energy. The plane landed in Hawaii in July after the longest, most dangerous leg, the eighth of 13. It'll be housed at the University of Hawaii hangar at the Kalaeloa airport on Oahu while repairs are made. It's due to continue its journey come April.\n\nIdaho: An injured hunter’s harrowing tale of survival\n\nJohn Sain thought he would die alone. While on a solo hunting trip in the Idaho wilderness, the 50-year-old snapped two bones in his right leg after an unlucky misstep. In pain and miles from the nearest trail, he considered ending his life. He even penned goodbye letters to his wife and two children. But he decided to fight. After almost four days of dragging himself through the dense wilderness toward the trail with little food or water, two men found him and called for help. Life Flight took Sain to a nearby hospital, where he reunited with his family and started his road to recovery.\n\nIllinois: Laquan McDonald and The Chicago Way\n\nSeventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by police officer Jason Van Dyke on Oct. 20, 2014 — thirteen of those shots were fired while McDonald was on the ground. You're reading about this story in 2015 because that's when explosive video of the shooting was made public. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration was forced by court order to release it. The city sat on the dashcam video, which is at odds with the narrative pushed by the Chicago Police Department, for more than a year. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder hours before the footage was released. USA TODAY reporter Aamer Madhani wrote in a column this year that the McDonald case shows \"The Chicago Way — the city’s shorthand for its politics in which corruption, patronage and ineptitude have long been part of the landscape — is alive and well.\"\n\nWarning: This video has graphic content.\n\nIndiana: A 'religious freedom' law and a governor's regrets\n\nAt the end of March, Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed a law that allows businesses to assert a religious defense if they decline to provide services to a customer. These \"religious freedom\" laws have been described as necessary to allow, for example, a baker who has strong religious beliefs to say no to baking a cake for a gay wedding. But after the bill was signed, several large companies announced they wouldn't do business with Indiana because it was discriminating against gays. The state quickly passed an amendment to clarify the bill cannot be used to discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity. With a little hindsight, Pence said in May, \"If I have a regret, I regret that we didn’t spend more time listening before the bill got to my desk. My ambition is to be a better listener.\"\n\nIowa: Center of the political universe\n\nFrom the moment a campaign kicks off until the time the caucus winners are declared, there is no state more important to choosing our next president than Iowa — and that was never more true than in 2015. It was Hillary Clinton’s first destination after she kicked off her White House bid in the spring. Iowa made campaigns (see Scott Walker’s rise and Ted Cruz’s recent surge) and helped end them (see Walker’s fall after his Iowa numbers plummeted). And, of course, the state was the site of some of Donald Trump’s most memorable moments — from the free rides on his helicopter he gave kids at the Iowa State Fair in August to his controversial comments about John McCain in July. We’re a long way from knowing how it will end, but Iowa helped lay the foundation for what promises to be a presidential campaign we won’t soon forget.\n\nUSA TODAY's 2016 Presidential Poll Tracker\n\nKansas: Where is the water?\n\nGroundwater is disappearing beneath cornfields in Kansas. An investigation by USA TODAY and The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun reveals time is running out for portions of the High Plains Aquifer, which lies beneath eight states from South Dakota to Texas and is the lifeblood of one of the world’s most productive farming economies. The aquifer, also known as the Ogallala, makes possible about one-fifth of the country’s output of corn, wheat and cattle. But its levels have been rapidly declining, and with each passing year, more wells are running dry.\n\nKentucky: How a county clerk broke the law, miffed Jennifer Lawrence, got compared to Rosa Parks, met the pope\n\nShe was this year's Christian hero. Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis made national news after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, claiming it conflicted with her Christian beliefs. She spent five nights in jail and was allowed to return to work when she agreed not to interfere with the issuance of licenses. Jennifer Lawrence said Davis made her \"embarrassed to be from Kentucky.\" Syndicated Christian columnist Bryan Fischer wrote she's \"our Rosa Parks.\" Davis even met with Pope Francis during his U.S. visit. “I never thought I would meet the pope,” Davis said. “Who am I to have this rare opportunity? I am just a county clerk who loves Jesus and desires with all my heart to serve him.\"\n\nLouisiana: The gloves came off in the gubernatorial campaign\n\nDemocratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards was elected governor of Louisiana, defeating two-term U.S. Sen. David Vitter, a Republican, in an almost unthinkable upset in the ruby-red state. Edwards emphasized his conservative views, leveraged his appointment to West Point and used a TV ad to call out Vitter's involvement in a prostitution scandal. The ad shows Edwards \"answering his country's call\" in his Army Ranger uniform. Then it shows Vitter, on a cellphone, \"who answered a prostitute's call.\" The ad launched just in time for early voting. Edwards takes office Jan. 11.\n\nMaine: Man + dog + kindness of strangers = happiest ending\n\nNow that's puppy love. Joel Carpenter lives in Portland, Maine, and found the dog of his dreams on petfinder.com. The only problem was she was across the country in a Minnesota shelter. Carpenter could afford to get to Minnesota, but he didn't have enough money for the ticket home. It didn't matter. He flew to Minneapolis and rescued his girl, Sadie. \"I was just kind of following my heart,\" Carpenter said. Next began his odyssey to get back to Portland. That's when strangers, following their hearts, raised enough money for the two to return home.\n\nMaryland: Freddie Gray dies while in police custody; riots ensue; officers face trial\n\nOn April 12, a black man was taken into custody in Baltimore. A week later, his spinal cord nearly severed, he was dead. Freddie Gray, 25, died of a \"high-energy injury\" that likely occurred when the police van he was riding in suddenly slowed down, an autopsy showed. His death sparked \"Justice for Freddie\" protests in Baltimore, which later turned violent; a curfew was instituted, and the National Guard was brought in. Despite the riots, protesters had some significant defenders, including Orioles COO John Angelos. The six police officers involved in the arrest were charged in Gray's death. The first of their trials, of officer William Porter, ended in mistrial in December.\n\nMassachusetts: Deflategate dethrones Tom Brady\n\nHours after the New England Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts in January to reach Super Bowl XLIV, the Deflategate scandal broke. The NFL investigated whether Patriots employees — with the knowledge of quarterback Tom Brady — had lowered the air pressure of balls used by the team during the game. The scandal hung over the Patriots as they beat the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later to win their fourth title. Brady was eventually suspended four games by the league. That punishment was vacated by a federal judge before the start of the 2015-16 season. The case still lives on as the NFL has appealed the decision.\n\nMichigan: The Syrian refugee who moved Edward Norton, Obama and pretty much everyone else in America with his desire to do good\n\nA Michigan-bound Syrian refugee who lost his wife and daughter in a deadly attack became a worldwide viral sensation in December after sharing his story with Brandon Stanton, the creator of the popular photo blog Humans of New York. Among the thousands (President Obama included!) who followed the Facebook photo series about the unnamed scientist bound for a fresh start in Michigan: actor and filmmaker Edward Norton. He used his celebrity powers for good by launching an aptly named fundraising campaign for the man and his family called The Scientist, which has raised more than $455,000 and counting. That’s the power of social media for you, folks.\n\nMinnesota: The hunter becomes the hunted\n\nThat's what happens when you kill one of the world's most beloved animals. Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer is a big-game hunter who shot and killed Cecil the lion in July. Cecil was one of the most famous animals at Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park. People flipped. Like, taping signs to Palmer's office door that read \"Killer\" and \"ROT IN HELL.\" Then people flipped some more because people were flipping out about a lion and not about other things, like Black Lives Mattering. More on that here. Palmer said he thought he was acting legally and deeply regretted taking Cecil's life. He returned to work in September. You can imagine what that looked like.\n\nMississippi: 17 arrested in case of burned-alive teen — but none charged yet in her death\n\nThe mystery of 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, found on a rural road, burned alive, unraveled throughout 2015. Chambers was doused with gasoline and set afire on Dec. 6, 2014, near Courtland, Miss., and officials spent the ensuing months interviewing more than 150 people and sorting through more than 20,000 phone records trying to find her assailant(s). That's when investigators turned up evidence of other suspected illegal activity ranging from narcotics sales, possession of stolen firearms and possession of counterfeit currency. FBI agents targeted suspected gang members and arrested 17 men on Dec. 15, though none is charged with killing Chambers. “This is not over by any stretch of the imagination,” said District Attorney John Champion.\n\nMissouri: About the First Amendment ...\n\nThe good news: Students were protesting racism at the University of Missouri, and their efforts led to the ouster of University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe and University of Missouri-Columbia Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. The bad news: Students and two university employees — one a communications professor — blocked student journalists from covering the protests. Why was this a big deal? Just a little thing called the First Amendment, which protects the right to report in the same way it protects the right to protest.\n\nMontana: Listen to your grandma when it comes to bear attacks\n\nOne way to survive a grizzly bear attack? Shove your arm down the bear's throat. That was Chase Dellwo's technique when a bear, just as startled as he was, thrashed the elk hunter around in the Montana woods. \"I remembered an article that my grandmother gave me a long time ago that said large animals have bad gag reflexes,\" Dellwo said. The technique worked, and Dellwo, with bites on his head and leg, lived to tell his story.\n\nNebraska: This is what happens when your neighbor (state) smokes pot\n\nNebraska and Oklahoma are not fans of Colorado's legal marijuana system, saying it has created a flood of modern-day bootleggers who are buying pot in Colorado and then illegally crossing state lines. They sued Colorado, asking the Supreme Court to block Colorado's legal-marijuana system. The federal government asked the Supreme Court to stay out of it. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. argued that the Supreme Court generally avoids disputes between states, unless it's the states themselves at odds. In this case, Nebraska and Oklahoma sued Colorado over the actions of private citizens.\n\nNevada: High hopes dashed by Mayweather-Pacquiao fight\n\nWhat cost $99.95, lasted 36 minutes and probably put you to sleep? The pay-per-view battle royale in Las Vegas between boxing legends Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao on May 2. What was supposed to be an epic fight turned out to be more of an epic failure — it was all about the payout at best, For The Win’s Chris Chase reported. We hoped for a fight that would evoke the memories of Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Sugar Ray, The Hitman and Hagler. What we got? Glorified sparring. Fingers crossed, their next rematch — if there is, in fact, one in the works — will be more a brawl and less of a bummer.\n\nNew Hampshire: Ben Carson made a map of the U.S. and put a bunch of states in the wrong place\n\nBeing president of the United States comes with a number of incredibly important responsibilities. Serving as commander in chief of our nation’s armed forces, navigating the tricky waters of foreign policy and, hey, knowing where the states are on a map. Unfortunately, Ben Carson can’t tick off that last box quite yet. The GOP presidential candidate’s campaign shared a map in November that misplaced five New England states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. His campaign deleted the Twitter and Facebook posts with the graphic.\n\nNew Jersey: Family terrorized by stalker called 'The Watcher'\n\nIn a story that sounds more like the plot of a twisted horror film than reality, a family was forced to forgo living in their New Jersey dream home after receiving threatening letters from a stalker called \"The Watcher.\" The individual wrote that the Westfield, N.J., home the family recently purchased has been \"the subject of my family for decades,\" and that he or she was \"put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming.\" The letters taunt the new owners and their children to the point that the family did not move in and is seeking damages for fraud and breach of contract. The family said the previous owners should have told them that the home was being watched before they purchased the property.\n\nNew Mexico: The knockout seen 'round the world\n\nNew Mexico native Holly Holm became an overnight sensation after doling out a devastating roundhouse kick to UFC superstar Ronda Rousey’s face. It was the knockout seen ‘round the world, and it left the previously undefeated Rousey seriously messed up. She won’t be able to eat an apple for three to six months. No, really — we're not kidding. Adding more drama to the mix, the stakes of the two powerhouse fighters' inevitable rematch are high. Rousey told ESPN the Magazine, \"either I’ll win and keep going or I won’t and I’ll be done with everything.” The Mayweather-Pacquiao rematch in May may have been a bust, but odds are the Rousey-Holms rematch will be epic.\n\nNew York: The prison break that wasn't 'Shawshank' that everyone was dying to call 'Shawshank'\n\nThe escape of two convicted murderers from a maximum-security facility in New York had all the plot points of a hit movie: a seemingly impossible getaway, insider help and few concrete leads on the escapees' whereabouts. So obviously it didn't take long for The Shawshank Redemption references to drop. But we were cautioned that these guys were no Andy and Red (good guys wronged who — spoiler alert — eventually got to live as BFFs forever on a beach in Mexico). Richard Matt and David Sweat, who escaped from Clinton Correctional Facility in June, were murderers who wouldn't hesitate to kill to get away. Nearly three weeks later, Matt was fatally shot. Two days after that, Sweat was shot and taken into custody.\n\nNorth Carolina: Santa Claus can speak in any language\n\nEven sign. This holiday season, 70 deaf and hard-of-hearing children from the Charlotte region got to tell Santa everything on their lists. Bicycles. Dolls. Video game systems. The usual. What was unusual was that they were able to talk to Santa themselves. \"It will be a memory they'll always remember for the rest of their lives,\" said Donna Katic with Deaf Services.\n\nNorth Dakota: U.S. Supreme Court will take up case on ‘deep-lung’ breath tests\n\nCan states charge motorists with a crime for refusing to take a breath test on suspicion of driving drunk when police lack a warrant? The Supreme Court will decide, after it said in December it would hear cases out of Minnesota and North Dakota in which drivers were charged with a crime after they refused to take \"deep-lung\" breath tests. Thirteen states make it a crime to refuse blood-alcohol tests. The Supreme Court has ruled in general that police cannot search a driver or vehicle upon arrest without a warrant unless it's for their personal safety or to preserve evidence. The court ruled in 2013 that police could not conduct blood tests for drunken driving without a warrant. Based on that, the challengers in the Minnesota and North Dakota cases said, refusing such tests should not constitute a separate crime.\n\nOhio: 'I didn't even do nothing'\n\nSamuel DuBose's final words echoed across the country as a national conversation about race and police brutality churned on: \"I didn't even do nothing.\" White University of Cincinnati Police officer Ray Tensing said he shot 43-year-old DuBose, an unarmed black man, during a traffic stop after being dragged by DuBose's vehicle. Then the video changed everything. Footage from Tensing's body camera showed a calm exchange. Tensing was fired and indicted on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter. More examples of how video is becoming the new smoking gun in police shootings.\n\nOklahoma: Cop found guilty of serial rape\n\nA former Oklahoma City police officer was convicted in December of sexually assaulting women he preyed upon in a low-income neighborhood he patrolled. A jury convicted Daniel Holtzclaw of four charges of first-degree rape and 14 other counts. He sobbed while hearing the verdicts on his 29th birthday. Holtzclaw could spend the rest of his life in prison: The jury's recommendation is that he serve 263 years.\n\nOregon: Terror strikes Oregon community college\n\nBefore opening fire, Chris Harper Mercer asked students in a classroom whether they were Christians. He targeted those who said yes. The 26-year-old was described as a bitter loner who acted \"like he was playing a video game and showed no emotion” as he gunned down nine people and injured nine more on Oct. 1 at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., before turning his gun on himself. From the chaos rose a hero. Army veteran Chris Mintz sprinted through the campus to warn others and physically blocked the door to a classroom of terrified students so Mercer couldn’t gain entry, getting shot five times in the process. More on him here.\n\nPennsylvania: Deadly Amtrak derailment snarls Northeast train traffic\n\nThe cause of a catastrophic Amtrak crash in Philadelphia that killed eight and injured 200 people on May 12 remains under investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board determined Amtrak Northeast Regional Train 188 was traveling 106 mph through a curve with a 50-mph speed limit when it jumped the tracks. The engineer, Brandon Bostian, has told investigators he cannot recall what happened. The incident snarled traffic between New York and Philadelphia, one of the most heavily traveled train routes in the nation.\n\nRhode Island: Be thankful you don't have gonorrhea\n\nWatch where you Tinder. A recent rise in sexually transmitted diseases in Rhode Island could be, in part, due to social apps, the state’s Department of Health said this year. In a press release on the state’s website, the department states that “using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters” has contributed to the recent rise.\n\nSouth Carolina: A massacre in Charleston; an outcry against hate across the state\n\nOn June 19, hate walked into a Bible study at the historic black Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., and opened fire. Nine people were killed, including the church's pastor, a state senator. Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man who flaunted symbols of white supremacy and was linked to hate groups, was arrested a day later. Roof joined the Bible study for an hour before shooting the parishioners, prosecutors say. Roof was indicted on 33 federal charges, as well as on federal hate-crimes charges and will be tried in July. As a direct response to the massacre, South Carolinians took up the issue of the Confederate battle flag on its Statehouse grounds; in July, state legislators passed the measure, and the flag, seen by many as a symbol of hatred and racism, was removed.\n\nSouth Dakota: A controversial peak\n\nIt's one of the nation's biggest naming controversies (now that Denali's name is settled once and for all). Harney Peak is a 7,244-foot-high South Dakota summit (once considered for the famous mountain carving of presidents that went to Mount Rushmore). Lakota Indians and their allies are fighting to get the federal government to change the name, which they find offensive. William S. Harney, its namesake, was a brutal Army general whom Lakota tribes blame for massacring 86 people — including women and children — under Chief Little Thunder's flag of truce in the Battle of Ash Hollow in 1855. The South Dakota Board on Geographic Names this year voted to retain the name. A final decision from the federal board probably won't come until next year.\n\nTennessee: N.J. man adopts Tennessee school after email mix-up and gives everyone the best feels\n\nIt's a tremendous story about kindness. Thad Livingston had never been to Mount Juliet (Tenn.) Elementary School. He had never even met anybody there. And he lives about 800 miles away. But the kids call him their “New Jersey grandfather.” An email blast from the school mistakenly went to Livingston in Eastampton Township, N.J., at the start of the school year. Instead of ignoring it, he started to help with small things he learned the school needed, and his charity helped launch a Random Acts of Kindness Challenge among students. \"When someone makes a big impression on you,” Mount Juliet fifth-grader Andrew Romer said, “it makes you want to do a lot of good in the world.” Livingston estimated he still gets one to two emails per week from the school, though nobody has been able to figure out why.\n\nTexas: The mysterious death of Sandra Bland\n\nJust what happened to Sandra Bland? It's the question her family has been asking since her death in a Texas jail cell in July. If you haven't heard of her, it may be useful to know that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders used her name in the same breath as Eric Garner and Freddie Gray. Authorities say she was arrested for getting confrontational during a traffic stop, went to jail and committed suicide in her cell a few days later. Her family doesn't believe it. A Texas grand jury hearing in December ruled it would not indict anyone in connection with the incident.\n\nUtah: A 100-year weather event\n\nUtah weather officials declared it the deadliest flooding in recorded state history. It was enough to qualify as a 100-year flood event — a flood that would have a 100-to-1 chance of happening in any given year. On Sept. 14, a seasonal storm system dropped heavy rains on mountains between the Grand Canyon and Zion national parks, prompting flash flooding that claimed several lives. Members of the polygamous community on both sides of the Utah-Arizona state line referred to the tragedy as their personal 9/11 because of its proximity to the anniversary of the deadly terrorist attacks.\n\nVermont: Bernie Sanders has a big 2015\n\nIf you aren't from the Green Mountain State, you might not have heard of Bernie Sanders until this year. The Vermont senator, a 74-year-old known for his halo of white hair and thick Brooklyn accent, has had a big 2015. The self-described Democratic socialist proved himself a heavy-hitting contender for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 presidential race, going toe-to-toe with front-runner Hillary Clinton. Millennials love him. Scores of others #FeelTheBern. And Time magazine put him in the running for their \"Person of the Year” cover. Although he didn't win, 2015 has been good to Bernie. And if he’s voted into the White House, 2016 will be even better.\n\nVirginia: On-air killing of TV journalists leaves nation stunned\n\nA horror story unfolded the morning of Aug. 26 as two young journalists at Roanoke’s WDBJ 7-TV were fatally shot on live television by a disgruntled former colleague, who then posted video footage of the crime from his perspective to social media. Making Alison Parker and Adam Ward's murders all the more devastating, both were in serious relationships with colleagues. Ward's fiancée, a WDBJ producer, watched his murder live from the control room, while Parker's boyfriend, an anchor for the station, later revealed the couple had planned to get married. Despite the darkness of the day, it was not without a shining light: The newsroom endured and continued to broadcast amid tears, showing strength in the face of tragedy.\n\nWashington: A white woman identifies as black and baffles the nation on race\n\nThis is the saga of Rachel Dolezal, who resigned in June as president of the Spokane, Wash., chapter of the NAACP after it was revealed she lied about her racial identity. Dolezal publicly claims she's black. Her parents say she's white. The questions we were forced to ask: What constitutes race? And do you have the right to adopt a new identity if you haven't lived the experience? Bonus: Maya Rudolph's Dolezal impression.\n\nWest Virginia: Want to combat gender inequality online? Hire your own 'Wikipedian-in-residence'\n\nWest Virginia University wants to close Wikipedia’s gender gap. Since its founding in 2001, the free and openly editable encyclopedia has attracted more than 25 million registered users and more than 1,000 editors. But, according to a 2011 survey conducted by Wikipedia, only 8.5% of these editors are women. The ubiquity of Wikipedia use makes this gender disparity an issue of quality control. The university wants to help correct the imbalance with a one-year Wikipedian-in-residence position, designed to increase the number of Wikipedia articles about West Virginian women and gender studies by 25%, according to a press release issued by the university.\n\nWisconsin: Man plants 4-mile stretch of sunflowers and becomes 2015's biggest romantic\n\nDon Jaquish lost his wife, Babbette, to cancer last year, just before Thanksgiving. \"Her and I, what we had is as good as it gets,\" he said. Sunflowers were Babbette's favorite. In her memory, Don planted a 4½-mile ribbon of them along both sides of Wisconsin State Road 85. A gift to his wife, but also to a world of romantics. Millions of people saw Babbette's flowers — in person, online and on the news. Erin Renz, Babbette's daughter, on why the tale of the sunflowers captivated so many people: \"Who doesn't love a love story?\"\n\nWyoming: Town where Matthew Shepard was killed passes LGBT law, 17 years later\n\nIn 1998, 21-year-old University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime in Laramie. Seventeen years later, the town where he died adopted a non-discrimination ordinance declaring discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in housing, employment and public facilities illegal in the city. The Laramie mayor said Shepard's death didn't influence the ordinance but he believes it will help alleviate perceptions people developed of Laramie as a result of Shepard’s murder. Earlier this year, the state tried to pass a non-discrimination act, but it failed. Judy Shepard, Matthew’s mother, told the Associated Press: “I’m thrilled that Laramie’s doing it, at the same time sort of saddened that the state of Wyoming can’t see fit to do that as well. Maybe the rest of Wyoming will understand this is about fellow human beings and not something that’s other than what they are.\"\n\nCompiled by Alia E. Dastagir.

Johnson survived a confidence vote on June 6.\n\nHowever, so deep is the current crisis that it’s possible the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench Members of Parliament could rewrite the rules in order to get rid of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe committee met on Wednesday and decided to hold an election for a new leadership on Monday. Once elected, the new executive of the committee will decide whether to change the rules and move forward with yet another confidence vote – one that Johnson would be much more likely to lose.\n\nUntil that point, the question is one of how much public humiliation Johnson can take. Dozens of lawmakers have now quit the government and on Wednesday evening a delegation of cabinet members descended on Downing Street to ask the Prime Minister to resign.\n\nOne of them – UK Home Secretary Priti Patel – informed Johnson that the general view of the party was that he had to go, a source close to Patel told CNN.\n\nMore government ministers will almost certainly quit and opposition sources are talking up the prospect of defections.\n\nWhat happens if Johnson resigns?\n\nIn the UK, the resignation of a Prime Minister doesn’t automatically trigger a general election.\n\nIf Johnson were to step down, the Conservative Party would hold an internal election to choose a new leader, who would then become Prime Minister.\n\nJohnson would probably remain in post until his successor had been chosen, as did his predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron when they resigned in May 2019 and June 2016, respectively.\n\nBarring another resignation or an early election, the new Prime Minister would then lead the UK until the next scheduled election in 2024.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/business/russia-ruble-banks-sanctions/index.html", "title": "Sanctions slam Russian economy | CNN Business", "text": "London/Moscow CNN Business —\n\nRussia was scrambling to prevent financial meltdown Monday as its economy was slammed by a broadside of crushing Western sanctions imposed over the weekend in response to the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin held crisis talks with his top economic advisers after the ruble crashed to a record low against the US dollar, the Russian central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20%, and the Moscow stock exchange was shuttered for the day. It will stay closed Tuesday, the central bank announced.\n\nThe European subsidiary of Russia’s biggest bank was on the brink of collapse as savers rushed to withdraw their deposits. Economists warned that the Russian economy could shrink by 5%.\n\nThe ruble lost about 25% of its value to trade at 104 to the dollar at 12:15 p.m. ET after earlier plummeting as much as 40%. The start of trading on the Russian stock market was delayed, and then canceled entirely, according to a statement from the country’s central bank.\n\nThe latest barrage of sanctions came Saturday, when the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\n“The ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,” wrote Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, in a note on Monday.\n\nFreezing reserves\n\nPutin’s government has spent the past eight years preparing Russia for tough sanctions by building up a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves including currencies and gold, but at least some of that financial firepower is now frozen and his “fortress” economy is under unprecedented assault.\n\n“We will … ban the transactions of Russia’s central bank and freeze all its assets, to prevent it from financing Putin’s war,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe United States also banned US dollar transactions with the Russian central bank in a move designed to prevent it accessing its “rainy day fund,” senior US administration officials said.\n\n“Our strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,” a senior administration official said.\n\nPeach at Capital Economics estimates that at least 50% of Russia’s reserves are now off limits to Moscow.\n\n“External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,” the Russian central bank said, announcing its dramatic rate hike and series of other emergency measures. “This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation,” the bank added.\n\nRussia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they will become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\nThe crackdown on its leading banks, and the exclusion of some of them from the SWIFT secure messaging system that connects financial institutions around the world will also make it harder for it to sell exports — including oil and gas despite the fact that Russia’s vital energy trade has not yet been directly targeted with sanctions.\n\nFinnish oil refiner Neste said it had mostly replaced Russian crude oil with other supplies.\n\n“For a long time, Russia has been methodically preparing for the event of possible sanctions, including the most severe sanctions we are currently facing,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “So there are response plans, and they are being implemented now as problems arise.”\n\nA run on the banks\n\nBut analysts warned that the turmoil could lead to a run on Russian banks, as savers try to secure their deposits and hoard cash.\n\n“The sanctions target Russia’s domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia’s central bank to continue hiking rates and/or to use its foreign exchange reserves,” the Institute of International Finance said in a report published Monday.\n\n“Furthermore, we believe that the [central bank] will have to institute strict capital controls and possibly declare a bank holiday as bank runs accelerate and demand for foreign exchange continues to rise sharply,” it added.\n\nPeople stand in line to use an ATM money machine in Saint Petersburg, Russia February 27, 2022. ANTON VAGANOV/REUTERS\n\nOne early casualty was the European subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender that has been sanctioned by Western allies. The European Central Bank said Sberbank Europe, including its Austrian and Croatian branches, was failing, or likely to fail, because of “significant deposit outflows” triggered by the Ukraine crisis.\n\n“This led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position,” the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSberbank (SBRCY) shares listed in London fell by nearly 70%. Other Russian companies with foreign listings were also hammered. Gas giant Gazprom (GZPFY) dropped 37% in London trading. Shares in internet service provider Yandex (YNDX) were suspended from trade on the Nasdaq, alongside seven other Russian companies listed in New York.\n\nNasdaq declined to comment. But a person familiar with the matter told CNN that the exchange was asking Russian companies whether they need to make material disclosures following the sanctions announced in recent days by the United States and other nations.\n\nThe Russian central bank last week intervened in the currency markets to try to prop up the ruble. And on Friday, it said it was increasing the supply of bills to ATMs to meet increased demand for cash. On Monday, the Russian government ordered exporters to exchange 80% of their foreign currency revenues for rubles — a measure analysts said was aimed at relieving pressure on the Russian currency.\n\nThe central bank also temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, although it did not specify which assets. The government had also ordered a ban on foreign exchange loans and bank transfers by Russian residents outside of Russia from March 1, Reuters reported.\n\n— Charles Riley, Laura He and Chris Liakos contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Mark Thompson Anna Chernova Vasco Cotovio", "Mark Thompson", "Anna Chernova", "Vasco Cotovio"], "publish_date": "2022/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/business/food-crisis-ukraine-russia/index.html", "title": "War has brought the world to the brink of a food crisis | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nSvein Tore Holsether says the world is careening toward a food crisis that could affect millions of people.\n\nRecord high natural gas prices have forced the company he runs, fertilizer producer Yara International, to curtail its production of ammonia and urea in Europe to 45% of capacity. With less of those two essential agricultural ingredients, he expects knock-on effects for global food supplies.\n\n“It’s not whether we are going to have a food crisis. It’s how large that crisis will be,” Holsether told CNN Business.\n\nTwo weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of key agricultural products produced in the region have skyrocketed. The biggest problem is wheat, a pantry staple. Supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for almost 30% of global wheat trade, are now at risk. Global wheat prices hit an all-time high earlier this week.\n\nAnother major problem is access to fertilizer. Essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, it’s never been more expensive, as exports from Russia grind to a halt. Output in Europe has also plunged thanks to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.\n\nThe situation is ringing alarm bells for global health experts. The cost of corn, soybeans and vegetable oils has been jumping, too.\n\nAgriculture ministers from the G7 countries said Friday they “remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to a food crisis.”\n\nBut fearing shortages, countries are already turning inward, which could ultimately leave less food for those in need.\n\nEgypt just banned the export of wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world’s most populous state. Indonesia has also tightened export restrictions on palm oil, which is a component in cooking oil as well as in cosmetics and some packaged goods like chocolate. It’s the world’s top producer of the product.\n\nThe G7 ministers called on countries to “keep their food and agricultural markets open and to guard against any unjustified restrictive measures on their exports.”\n\n“Any further increase in food price levels and volatility in international markets could threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among the most vulnerable living in environments of low food security,” they said in a statement.\n\nWestern countries with more access to agriculture will be hurt, too. Consumers there have already been stung by higher prices, and the situation is poised to deteriorate further.\n\nRussia, Ukraine and global food supplies\n\nEven before Russia launched a war in Ukraine, the global food system was strained. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.\n\nThe number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN’s World Food Programme said this month.\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which both play crucial roles in the carefully calibrated system of global food production, stands to make the situation worse.\n\nGlobal wheat prices have fallen from record highs in recent days, but remain elevated. They’re expected to stay that way for some time, according to Rabobank commodity analyst Carlos Mera.\n\nThe wheat planting season, which is about to begin in Ukraine, will be disrupted by fighting. It’s not clear there will be enough farmers to till the land, as people in the country take up arms — or whether they’ll be able to access machinery and other essential products that would typically arrive through Black Sea ports.\n\n“It’s anyone’s guess if Ukraine will be able to export anything for the rest of this year, or next year, or in the foreseeable future,” Mera said. The country also accounts for half of all exports of sunflower oil.\n\nGetting products from Russia onto the world market has also gotten more difficult, because businesses don’t want to risk running afoul of sanctions or deal with the logistics of traveling near a war zone.\n\nRussia and Ukraine serve as the breadbasket for countries in the Middle East and North Africa that depend on imports. Many will be hit hard as a result. The United States and Europe will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market.\n\n“Any serious disruption of production and exports from these suppliers will no doubt drive up prices further and erode food security for millions of people,” the Agricultural Market Information System said in a recent report.\n\nFertilizer costs soar\n\nThe brewing crisis goes beyond wheat and oils. Russia, along with its ally Belarus, is also a major exporter of the fertilizers needed to plant a wide range of crops. But right now, everyone is shunning their stock.\n\n“Nobody wants to touch a Russian product right now,” said Deepika Thapliyal, a fertilizer expert at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. “If you look at all of the traders, all of the buyers, they’re very scared.”\n\nThe price of natural gas is exacerbating the issue. Fertilizer producers outside of Russia and Belarus need gas to make nitrogen-based products like urea, which is used when sowing crops to boost yield and even promotes their deep-green color.\n\nBut Holsether, the CEO of Yara, said costs have gotten too high to keep operations running at scale. He’s not sure when European production will be at full capacity again.\n\n“There’s a large part of the industry that’s at risk of not being able to deliver products to the farmers, and that will have an impact on the crop yields quite rapidly,” he said.\n\nFarmers have the incentive right now to pay what they need to get fertilizer, since prices for their products are going up, too. Not everyone has this option, however. Urea has been trading near $1,000 per metric ton, about four times the price at the start of 2021, according to Chris Lawson, the head of fertilizers at CRU Group, a market intelligence firm.\n\nCountries without domestic fertilizer production may also struggle to access it, with huge consequences for the global food system.\n\n“You can’t grow massive fields of wheat, barley or soy without fertilizer,” said Johanna Mendelson Forman, a professor at American University who specializes in war and food. Farmers in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil are already worried about shortages, she added.\n\nThe consequences\n\nOn Monday, Russian fertilizer and coal billionaire Andrey Melnichenko broke with President Vladimir Putin and called for peace in Ukraine, noting that a global food crisis looms.\n\nThe war “has already led to soaring prices in fertilizers which are no longer affordable to farmers,” Melnichenko told Reuters. “Now it will lead to even higher food inflation in Europe and likely food shortages in the world’s poorest countries,” he added.\n\nThe G7 agriculture ministers said Friday that their countries would leverage humanitarian aid where they can to mitigate fallout from the war. But they may also be hamstrung by a dearth of supplies and rising prices.\n\n“If Ukrainian fields lie fallow this year, aid agencies such as ours will be forced to source new markets to compensate for the loss of some of the world’s best wheat,” David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, said in an op-ed published in the Washington Post this week. “Doing so will come at a vastly inflated cost.”\n\nBeasley noted that Ukrainian wheat has also been essential to feeding populations in other countries facing conflict, including Afghanistan, Sudan and Yemen.\n\n“The vast majority of wheat is used for human consumption, and that’s irreplaceable,” Rabobank’s Mera said.\n\nAnd it won’t just be countries grappling with famine or war that feel the effects.\n\nThe affordability of food is a problem for lower-income shoppers everywhere, Mendelson Forman emphasized. In April 2021, about one in seven American adults experienced food insecurity over the past 30 days, according to the Urban Institute.\n\n“We’re used to a globalized system of trade to get all kinds of varieties of food,” she said. “People will see it in their pocketbooks, and they’ll see it in the grocery stores.”\n\n— Mostafa Salem contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/business/russia-economy-sanctions/index.html", "title": "The West's $1 trillion bid to collapse Russia's economy | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe West has responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with round after round of punishing sanctions. The latest salvo is designed to spark a banking crisis, overwhelm Moscow’s financial defenses and tip the Russian economy into a deep recession.\n\nNever before has an economy with the global importance of Russia’s been targeted with sanctions at this level, according to analysts, who say there is now a high risk that Russia will face a financial crisis that pushes its largest banks to the brink of collapse.\n\nWestern officials have described their campaign as an economic war meant to punish President Vladimir Putin and turn the country he leads into an international pariah — even if it takes years for sanctions to destroy the defenses of Russia’s “fortress economy.”\n\n“We will provoke the collapse of the Russian economy,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a local news channel on Tuesday.\n\nRussia’s status as a global energy supplier will make that mission all the more difficult. Europe gets nearly 40% of its natural gas and 25% of its oil from Russia, and any disruptions to those exports would cause already elevated global prices to rise even further.\n\nHow the West is fighting\n\nPutin’s invasion of Ukraine has been met with an unprecedented response from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia and other countries. Even Switzerland, famous for its neutrality and banking secrecy, has pledged to impose sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe West has cut off Russia’s two largest banks, Sberbank (SBRCY) and VTB, from direct access to the US dollar. It has also taken steps to remove some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global messaging service that connects financial institutions and facilitates rapid and secure payments.\n\nThe coalition is trying to prevent Russia’s central bank from selling dollars and other foreign currencies to defend the ruble and its economy. In total, nearly $1 trillion worth of Russian assets have now been frozen by sanctions, according to Le Maire.\n\n“Western democracies have surprised many by pursuing a strategy of exerting intense economic pressure on Russia through effectively cutting it off from global financial markets,” Oliver Allen, markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.\n\n“If Russia continues on its current path, it is quite easy to see how the latest sanctions could be just the first steps in a severe and enduring severing of Russia’s financial and economic ties with the rest of the world,” he added.\n\nWestern countries have ruled out sending troops to fight in Ukraine, leaving sanctions as the primary means of challenging Russia. The measures could wipe as much as 6% off Russia’s gross domestic product, according to Oxford Economics.\n\n“Our strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,” a senior US administration official told reporters.\n\nRussia’s ‘fortress’ economy\n\nSince 2014, when the United States and its Western allies imposed sanctions on Moscow following the annexation of Crimea and the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, Putin has been trying to sanction-proof Russia’s $1.5 trillion economy, the 11th largest in the world.\n\nMoscow has attempted to wean its oil-dependent economy off the dollar, limited government spending and stockpiled foreign currencies.\n\nPutin’s economic planners have also sought to boost domestic production of certain goods by blocking equivalent products from abroad. Russia’s central bank has meanwhile amassed a war chest of $630 billion in reserves including foreign currencies and gold — a huge sum compared to most other countries.\n\nThose defenses are now being severely tested.\n\nThe sanctions have rendered roughly 50% of Russia’s foreign reserve stockpile useless, according to Capital Economics.\n\n“External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,” the Russian central bank said Monday, announcing that it would roughly double interest rates to 20%. “This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation,” the bank added.\n\nRussia is also imposing capital controls. The central bank ordered companies to sell foreign currencies on Monday to prop up the ruble as it plunged to a record low against the US dollar. And Putin is planning a decree that would temporarily ban foreign companies and investors from selling Russian assets — which have become toxic for many since the invasion.\n\n“The $600 billion-plus war chest of Russia’s foreign reserves is only powerful if Putin can use it,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nAll eyes are on the Russian financial system.\n\nThere were reports over the weekend that Russians were standing in long lines to withdraw cash from ATMs, raising the prospect of a run on the country’s banks. Already the main target of sanctions, Russian banks could come under even greater pressure if borrowers are unable to repay loans as the inevitable recession hits businesses and households.\n\nLiam Peach, an emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that Russian banks could be forced to respond by selling assets — probably on the cheap. Credit could become scarce, making the economic pain from sanctions even worse.\n\n“The ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,” said Peach.\n\nOne early casualty was the European subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender that has been sanctioned by Western allies. The European Central Bank said Monday that Sberbank Europe, including its Austrian and Croatian branches, was failing, or likely to fail, because of “significant deposit outflows” triggered by the crisis.\n\nAnother problem is that Russian banks only have enough foreign cash on hand to cover roughly 15% of the foreign currency deposits on their books. The central bank would normally supply banks with foreign currency, but with half its war chest out of bounds it may not be able to do that, and defend the ruble at the same time.\n\nThe central bank could be under pressure for months or even years.\n\nThanks to oil and gas, the value of Russia’s exports far exceeds imports, and payments into the country are a major source of foreign currency. But investors and businesses could try to move large amounts of foreign cash outside the country as the ruble falls, forcing the central bank to spend up to $100 billion of its available reserves this year, according to Capital Economics.\n\nAt the same time, the West could crack down even harder. The United States and its allies could remove more Russian banks from SWIFT and further restrict their access to dollars and euros, according to the Institute of International Finance. They could also cut off Russian energy exports, although that would cause prices to spike.\n\nFurther escalation of the economic conflict could have major consequences.\n\n“Don’t forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones,” former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Thursday in response to Le Maire’s comments.", "authors": ["Charles Riley"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/economy/recession-inflation-economy/index.html", "title": "'Recession shock' is coming, Bank of America warns | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nBank of America is warning that high inflation poses a credible threat to the economic recovery that began just two years ago.\n\n“‘Inflation shock’ worsening, ‘rate shock’ just beginning, ‘recession shock’ coming,” Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nThe warning came ahead of a new government report on Tuesday that showed consumer prices surged by 8.5% in March, the fastest pace since December 1981. There were record year-over-year price spikes on everything from new vehicles and men’s apparel to baby food and salad dressing.\n\nInflation is “out of control,” Hartnett wrote, adding: “Inflation causes recessions.”\n\nAlthough the last recession was sparked by a pandemic, economic expansions are often ended by the Federal Reserve slamming on the brakes to fight rising inflation.\n\nMarkets are bracing for the Fed to rapidly raise interest rates, at the fastest pace in decades, to get prices under control. The risk is that the central bank will do too much, sinking the economy in the process.\n\n‘Recessionary’ price moves in markets\n\nBank of America is not outright calling for a recession in the United States. But the bank is raising the specter of a slowdown and pointing to recession signals on Wall Street.\n\nHartnett noted that price action in financial markets has been very “recessionary,” citing steep declines for economically sensitive home builders, semiconductor manufacturers, small caps, retail and private equity.\n\nGlobal growth expectations plunged to record lows in April among investment fund managers surveyed by Bank of America, according to a separate report published Monday.\n\nThat survey also showed profit expectations among investors tumbled to their weakest level since March 2020, closing in on levels seen during other scares including the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the 2001 bursting of the dot-com bubble.\n\nLast week, Deutsche Bank became the first major bank to forecast a recession. The bank expects the Fed will push the economy into a “mild” downturn that begins in late 2023.\n\nCooling off the jobs market\n\nBut others think the Fed may be able to tame inflation without causing a recession.\n\nTo get inflation under control, Goldman Sachs said in a report Monday night that economic growth must soften to a “modestly below-trend pace – enough to persuade firms to shelve some of their expansion plans, but not by so much to trigger sharp cuts in current output and employment.”\n\nWhen labor demand falls significantly, downturns tend to follow. There has never been an increase in the unemployment rate of more than 0.35 percentage points on a three-month average basis that wasn’t associated with a recession, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nAlthough the overheating jobs market has “raised the risk of recession meaningfully,” the bank is not currently forecasting a recession in the United States.\n\nGoldman Sachs said its relative optimism is based on the strong balance sheets of businesses and families and its belief that cooling off the jobs market should be made easier by the post-Covid normalization process that will let more workers come off the sidelines.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/09/business/food-fuel-prices-political-instability/index.html", "title": "Soaring food and fuel prices are destabilizing countries on the brink ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nWhen people took to the streets in Egypt in 2011, protesters chanted about freedom and social justice — but also bread.

Then came Russia’s war in Ukraine, making the situation much worse — while also triggering a spike in the cost of the other daily essential, fuel.\n\nThe combination could generate a wave of political instability, as people who were already frustrated with government leaders are pushed over the edge by rising costs.\n\n“It is extremely worrisome,” said Rabah Arezki, a senior fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and former chief economist at the African Development Bank.\n\nUnrest in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Peru over the past week highlights the risks. In Sri Lanka, protests have erupted over shortages of gas and other basic goods. Double-digit inflation in Pakistan has eroded support for Prime Minister Imran Khan, forcing him from office. At least six people have died in recent anti-government protests in Peru sparked by rising fuel prices. But political conflict isn’t expected to be limited to these countries.\n\n“I don’t think people have felt the full impact of rising prices just yet,” said Hamish Kinnear, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk consultancy.\n\nLessons from the Arab Spring\n\nIn the run-up to the anti-government protests that became known as the Arab Spring — which began in Tunisia in late 2010 and spread through the Middle East and North Africa in 2011 — food prices were climbing sharply. The Food Price Index from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization reached 106.7 in 2010 and jumped to 131.9 in 2011, then a record.\n\n“Mohamed Bouazizi didn’t set himself on fire because he couldn’t blog or vote,” an Emirati commentator wrote in January 2011, referring to the street vendor whose protest act helped launch the revolution in Tunisia and, ultimately, the Arab world. “People set themselves on fire because they can’t stand seeing their family wither away slowly, not of sorrow, but of cold stark hunger.”\n\nCircumstances in individual countries differed, but the bigger picture was clear. Surging wheat prices were a major part of the problem.\n\nThe situation now is even worse than it was then. Global food prices have just hit a new record high. The FAO Food Price Index published Friday hit 159.3 in March, up almost 13% from February. The war in Ukraine, a major exporter of wheat, corn and vegetable oils, as well as harsh sanctions on Russia — a key producer of wheat and fertilizer — is expected to spur further price increases in the coming months.\n\n“Forty percent of wheat and corn exports from Ukraine go to the Middle East and Africa, which are already grappling with hunger issues, and where further food shortages or price increases could stoke social unrest,” Gilbert Houngbo, head of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said last month.\n\nAdding to the pain is the surge in energy prices. Global oil prices are almost 60% higher than they were a year ago. The cost of coal and natural gas has spiked, too.\n\nMany governments are struggling to protect their citizens, but fragile economies that borrowed heavily to make it through the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic are most vulnerable. As growth slows, hurting their currencies and making it harder to keep up with debt payments, maintaining subsidies for food and fuel will be difficult, especially if prices keep climbing.\n\n“We are now in a situation where countries are indebted,” Arezki said. “As a result, they have no buffers to try to contain the tensions that will emerge from such high prices.”\n\nAccording to the World Bank, close to 60% of the poorest countries were “already in debt distress or at high risk of it” on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhere tensions are simmering\n\nAsia: In Sri Lanka, an island nation of 22 million, an economic and political crisis is already boiling over, with protesters taking to the streets in defiance of curfews and government ministers stepping down en masse.\n\nGrappling with high debt levels and a weak economy reliant on tourism, Sri Lanka was forced to run down its reserves of foreign currency. That prevented the government from making payments for key imports such as energy, creating devastating shortages and forcing people to spend hours lining up for fuel.\n\nIts leaders have also devalued its currency, the Sri Lankan rupee, as they try to secure a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. But that just made inflation worse at home. In January, it reached 14%, almost double the rate of price increases in the United States.\n\nPakistan’s parliament issued a vote of no confidence in Khan on Sunday, ousting him from power and upending his government. While his political problems date back years, claims of economic mismanagement as the cost of food and fuel leaped, as well as the depletion of foreign exchange reserves, made matters worse.\n\n“The extent of economic chaos has united opposition to Imran Khan,” Kinnear of Verisk Maplecroft said.\n\nMiddle East and Africa: Experts are also watching for signs of political distress in other countries in the Middle East that are heavily dependent on food imports from the Black Sea region, and often provide generous subsidies to the public.\n\nIn Lebanon, where nearly three-quarters of the population was living in poverty last year as the result of a political and economic collapse, between 70% and 80% of imported wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. Key grain silos were also destroyed during the 2020 explosion at the Beirut port.\n\nAnd Egypt, the world’s largest buyer of wheat, is already seeing enormous pressure on its huge subsidy program for bread. The country recently set a fixed price for unsubsidized bread after prices spiked, and is trying to secure wheat imports from countries like India and Argentina instead.\n\nWith an estimated 70% of the world’s poor living in Africa, the continent will also be “very exposed” to rising food and energy prices, Arezki said.\n\nDroughts and conflict in countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Burkina Faso have created a food security crisis for more than a quarter of the continent’s population, the International Committee of the Red Cross said this week. The situation risks getting worse in the coming months, it continued.\n\nPolitical instability has already been building in parts of the continent. A series of coups have taken place in West and Central Africa since the start of 2021.\n\nEurope: Even countries with more developed economies, which have greater buffers to shield citizens from painful price increases, won’t have the tools to fully cushion the blow.\n\nThousands of protesters gathered in cities across Greece this week to demand higher wages to counter inflation, while France’s presidential election is narrowing as far-right candidate Marine Le Pen plays up her plans to reduce the cost of living. President Emmanuel Macron’s government said last month it was considering issuing food vouchers so that middle and low-income families could afford to eat.\n\n— Jessie Yeung, Rhea Mogul and Sophia Saifi contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "(CNN) Russia's multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia's side of the border, Ukraine's 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday.\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia's attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a \"special military operation\" and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow's intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia's larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow's attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been \"stiffer than expected\" and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin's move. NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a \"grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.\"\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia's economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a \"hostile act\" -- a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine's aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015 , the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create \"a pretext for an invasion.\"\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as \"one people,\" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a \"forced change of identity.\"\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's \"puppet.\"\n\nIn fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. \"It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,\" he said at his annual news conference late last year. \"Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.\"\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a \"genocide\" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements \"no longer exist,\" adding: \"What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?\"\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords , which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. \"Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,\" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: \"We are not his.\"\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n\"Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we've been building, everything we are living for,\" Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst -- packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists\n\nUkraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. \"Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted \"urgently\" to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin's invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. \"I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,\" he said Sunday,\n\nPhotos: The world rallies in support of Ukraine People in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline -- connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany -- as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea -- in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin's decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky's government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/business/ruble-russia-central-bank/index.html", "title": "How Putin 'destroyed' the ruble and brought Russia to the brink of ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nRussia has banned its citizens from buying US dollars, completing the isolation of an economy that once had ambitions to join the global club of financial powers.\n\nAs recently as the 2008 global financial crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his lieutenants had promoted the ruble as a potential alternative to the US dollar, arguing that it should be an integral part of the global financial system. Russia would become one of the world’s five biggest economies, they claimed.\n\nPutin’s quest to dominate his neighbors, starting with his assault on Georgia in 2008, and continuing with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and last month’s invasion of Ukraine, has shredded what remained of the authoritarian leader’s economic dreams.\n\nIn early 2008, one US dollar would buy roughly 25 rubles. The Russian currency has depreciated significantly since then, and Western sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine have pushed it into freefall. On Wednesday, one US dollar could buy 117 rubles in Moscow after the currency fell 10% and hit a new record low. The ruble has been even weaker in the offshore market this week.\n\nThe latest slide came after Russia’s central bank banned Russians from buying hard currencies and ordered banks to cap withdrawals from foreign currency accounts at $10,000 for the next six months, moves that could help preserve some of the country’s dollar reserves and support the ruble.\n\nSergey Aleksashenko, a former Russian finance ministry and central bank official, described the strategy as “incredible foolishness” that could lead to a run on the banks.\n\n“Apparently, the outflow of foreign currency deposits from Russian banks has exceeded the Bank of Russia’s forecasts and put under question the banks’ ability to meet their obligations,” he wrote in a newsletter.\n\n“The biggest mistake monetary authority may make in Russia is to touch private savings — if there was no bank run until now, it’s going to happen,” added Aleksashenko.\n\nRussia has been scrambling to prevent financial meltdown since the United States, European Union and other Western allies imposed sanctions on much of the country’s banking system, including freezing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of reserves Moscow had been stockpiling for years to shield the economy. Analysts estimate that more than half of Russia’s reserves of foreign currency and gold are now off limits.\n\nThe central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20%, and temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners. The government has ordered exporters to exchange 80% of their foreign currency revenues for rubles, and banned Russian residents from making bank transfers outside Russia.\n\nThe ruble has come under intense pressure, and Moscow’s failure to defend the currency will translate to economic pain. Russia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they will become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\nFitch Ratings slashed Russia’s credit rating on Tuesday and warned that a default was “imminent.”\n\n“The further ratcheting up of sanctions, and proposals that could limit trade in energy, increase the probability of a policy response by Russia that includes at least selective non-payment of its sovereign debt obligations,” the ratings agency said in a statement.\n\nEven with Russia on the brink of default, Western countries are continuing to unleash punishing restrictions designed to further isolate Moscow. The United States and the United Kingdom banned Russian energy imports on Tuesday, and the European Union said it would attempt to reduce natural gas imports by 66% this year.\n\nFor Moscow, the costs are adding up. The central bank’s decision to prevent Russians from buying US dollars marks the end of the ruble, according to Anders Åslund, an economist and former adviser to the Russian government.\n\n“All ruble convertibility is over. Putin has destroyed the ruble,” Åslund said on Twitter.\n\n— Mark Thompson contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Charles Riley"], "publish_date": "2022/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Wall Street's go-to recession indicator is starting to ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

But a traditional recession signal is still catching Wall Street’s attention.\n\nWhat’s happening: The US government bond market sold off on Thursday alongside stocks following the news that inflation reached 7.5% in January — its highest level in four decades. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury, which moves opposite prices, shot above 2% for the first time since 2019. It was close to 1.5% at the end of last year.\n\nInvestors were particularly worried, however, about the yield on shorter-term US bonds like the two-year note, which has been rising even more dramatically. It’s now above 1.5%, gaining about 110% so far in 2022.\n\nWhy this matters: Typically, investors demand higher payouts for longer-dated bonds, since it’s harder to predict risk and economic conditions over extended periods.\n\nBut if yields on shorter-dated bonds jump above the 10-year — producing an “inverted yield curve” — that’s a sign that investors expect a deterioration in near-term economic conditions and aggressive intervention from the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco published research that found a yield curve inversion preceded every recession since 1955, producing a “false positive” just one time. (It looked specifically at the yield on one-year Treasuries.)\n\nInvestors indicated on Friday that they’re watching to see if this happens again. Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, called the run-up in the yield on the two-year Treasury an “ominous sign.”\n\nThe worry is that because the Fed is now playing catch-up on inflation, it may make a mistake and pull back support for the economy too quickly, causing a recession.\n\nGoldman Sachs said Thursday that it now expects the Fed to hike interest rates at every meeting left this year. And Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told Bloomberg that he now supports a rapid increase of rates by July.\n\nBullard implied he’d back one supersize hike of 0.5 percentage points before then. The central bank hasn’t executed a half-point hike since 2000.\n\nBut Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told me a yield curve inversion is “not necessarily a reliable indicator.” He noted that the curve inverted in 2019 and that didn’t seem to predict anything. There was a recession in 2020, but that was triggered by Covid-19.\n\nDespite higher inflation, the International Monetary Fund expects the US economy to grow by 4% this year, down from 5.6% in 2021.\n\nHewson said that the curve may be a “warning to the Fed that maybe if they tighten too quickly they could cause more damage than they intend.”\n\nYet he sees “stagflation” — rampant inflation and weak economic growth — as a larger risk than a recession.\n\n“That’s the bigger concern right now — that inflation starts to outweigh GDP,” Hewson said.\n\nZillow tries to put its rough year behind it\n\nZillow’s announcement that it was exiting the home flipping business dealt a massive blow to the company. Now, it’s trying to prove it can move on.\n\nThe latest: Shares of Zillow (Z) are up 13% in premarket trading on Friday after it reported $3.9 billion in revenue for its most recent quarter, beating Wall Street’s expectations.\n\n“Zillow has a rock-solid financial foundation,” CEO Rich Barton said in a statement, adding that about one quarter of US homebuyers used Zillow as they shopped last year.\n\nRemember: Zillow’s shares collapsed after it said that it would shut down its Zillow Offers unit, which used algorithms to buy up thousands of homes that it would then renovate and try to quickly resell, a process known as “iBuying.”\n\nBut the company later disclosed this approach wasn’t working, pointing to “the unpredictability in forecasting home prices.”\n\nThe failure of the business led to a $528 million loss last year, Zillow said Thursday.\n\nYet the company is making good progress selling the homes still in its portfolio, offloading about 8,350 last quarter.\n\n“We’ve made significant progress in our efforts to wind down our iBuying business — selling homes faster than we anticipated at better unit economics than we projected,” Zillow told shareholders. “We feel even more confident today that exiting iBuying and eliminating the housing market balance sheet risk to our company and our shareholders was the right decision.”\n\nNever tweet? Accidental post scrambles Affirm shares\n\nBuy now, pay later has been booming. But that’s not why people are talking about Affirm, one of the industry’s top players.\n\nThe company’s shares rallied as much as 12% on Thursday. The company, which went public early last year, accidentally shared some results from its latest quarter early on Twitter.\n\nIt later deleted the post and said it was shared “due to human error.” Oops.\n\nWall Street was less happy with the full picture, which showed ballooning losses for the last three months of 2021. Affirm said this was due to stock-based compensation tied to its initial public offering.\n\nInvestor insight: Both tweets and earnings have consequences. Shares ended the day 21% lower, and they’re down another 10% in premarket trading Friday.\n\nWhile the company’s stock is still trading above its initial public offering price of $49, it’s going through a rough patch — shedding more than 60% after peaking above $176 in November last year.\n\nUp next\n\nGoodyear Tire (GT), Newell Brands (NWL) and Under Armour (UA) report results before US markets open.\n\nAlso today: The latest University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment arrives at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nComing next week: Earnings season continues with Marriott (MAR), Airbnb, Hilton (HLT), Kraft Heinz (KHC), DoorDash, Nvidia (NVDA) and Walmart (WMT).", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/15/asia/sri-lanka-crisis-economy-fix-gotabaya-rajapaksa-saturday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Sri Lanka crisis: How do you fix a broken country? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor years it had been one of Sri Lanka’s grandest and most heavily guarded buildings, serving as the official residence and state office of the President.\n\nBut all that changed on July 9, when protesters stormed in and took control, demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa before turning the palace upside down.\n\n“That was the home of the most powerful man in the country,” said Sri Lankan author and analyst Asanga Abeyagoonasekera. “It had never been opened to the public.”\n\nIt’s now become a novelty attraction – all traces of its exclusivity and prestige gone. Each day for the past five days, thousands have lined-up up for hours just for a glimpse of Rajapaksa’s luxurious lifestyle. The neatly manicured lawns have become picnic spots and protesters swim and party in his private pool.\n\nProtestors gather at the Presidential Palace in Colombo. AFP/Getty Images\n\nRajapaksa fled the crisis-hit country on Wednesday, boarding a military plane to Maldives and naming Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as Acting President.\n\nHe has since moved on to Singapore, arriving on a “private visit” confirmed by the authorities. On Friday, Sri Lanka’s parliamentary speaker accepted Rajapaksa’s resignation, bringing an end to his nearly three years in office.\n\n“Resignation was really the only option he had,” Abeyagoonasekera said. “People are tired, hungry and angry … And they are demanding change and accountability because they are sick of seeing the same faces in charge.”\n\n‘We can’t afford to pick or choose’\n\nRajapaksa may be gone, but Sri Lanka is still struggling with a ruinous financial crisis, and experts said things are likely to get worse before they get better.\n\nProtests over daily power cuts, rising fuel prices and severe shortages of basics like food and medicines kicked off in March and showed few signs of abating.\n\n“There is zero political stability,” said Abeyagoonasekera. “We’ve seen three cabinets in two months, with a fourth coming up. Urgent change is needed to restore the country.”\n\nDespite a raft of government-implemented crisis control measures, the situation remains desperate for millions across the country. “We are still short on food, medicine and fuel,” said Colombo-based political analyst Amita Arudpragasam. “Policies have also been inefficient and confusing.”\n\nAnalysts said the crisis started around 2019. But for many Sri Lankans, the warning signs were apparent even back in 2010, when Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s brother Mahinda was re-elected President for a second term.\n\n“It was a ticking time bomb,” Arudpragasam said of the Rajapksa era. “The government was giving huge cuts to the wealthy elite as well as corporations when they should have been increasing taxes. Money that could have been reinvested in the population was used to repay debt obligations – and none of this helped to address the many weaknesses in our economy.”\n\nGotabaya Rajapaksa took power in late 2019, having previously only held the unelected post of defense secretary in his brother’s administration.\n\nCritics contend he mismanaged the economy, investing vast amounts in the military while implementing sweeping tax cuts, despite international warnings, causing government revenue to plummet.\n\n“Rajapaksa didn’t heed anyone’s advice and was supported by people who did not understand how an economy likes ours needed to work” said Arudpragasam. “(The government) refused to admit that the economy was in crisis until it was too late.”\n\nUrgent humanitarian assistance is now needed, she said. “We are in a crisis situation where we can’t afford to pick or choose.”\n\nIn 2020, the World Bank reclassified Sri Lanka as a lower middle income country amid currency collapses and rising inflation rates.\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe declared the country “bankrupt.” “Our economy has faced a complete collapse,” he said.\n\nSri Lankans wait in line for gas cylinders in Colombo. Tharaka Basnayaka/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n‘One of the best places in the world’\n\nThe crisis has shocked many in the international community, who recall a different Sri Lanka.\n\n“In many ways, Sri Lanka is a development success story,” said Philippe Le Houérou, formerly the South Asia vice president of the World Bank. “It stands out as a lower middle-income country in a region that hosts the world’s greatest concentration of poor.”\n\nFollowing the end of Sri Lanka’s bloody civil war in 2009, the country entered a period of peace and stability. Trade flourished and international tourists returned to the country’s beaches, resorts and tea plantations.\n\nLe Houérou highlighted Sri Lanka’s “impressive” post-war social achievements. “Economic growth has been robust and prosperity has been spread widely,” he said, adding that life expectancy was also among the highest in the region.\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) once called Sri Lanka South Asia’s richest economy. “The island reaps the benefits of early investments in higher education and training … and needs to concentrate on areas that are most important to trigger the efficiencies that will drive further growth,” WEF said in a 2016 report.\n\nExperts said that tourism, one of Sri Lanka’s most lucrative industries, never had the chance to recover after the 2019 Easter terror attacks followed by the pandemic, which hit the year after.\n\n“We had a strong agriculture base and one of the most exciting tourism industries in the world,” said Abeyagoonasekera, the author. “With the absence of proper governance, we moved from being a fragile state to a crisis state and now a failed one.”\n\nBut, he added: “Sri Lanka was one of the best places in the world to be and I believe with the right directives and functioning institutions, it can become that place again.”\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Sri Lanka’s ambassador to Beijing said the country was in discussions with China for approximately $4 billion worth of financial assistance.\n\nThe sum includes a $1 billion loan to meet existing Chinese loan repayments, a $1.5 billion swap facility and $1.5 billion in credit for purchasing goods from China, Ambassador Palitha Kohona said.\n\nMeanwhile, all eyes are on a bailout plan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has been “closely monitoring” developments in the country since talks ended in June without a deal. Government mismanagement has also further complicated recovery, analysts said.\n\n“The IMF isn’t going to grant us financial support without political stability, not when the country is still on knife’s edge,” said research fellow Sanjana Hattotuwa. He added that while protesters had achieved early goals of getting Rajapaksa to resign, the country now faced a great deal of uncertainty. “There is no easy fix for a broken economy,” he said. “But the first step would be a new government and elections are needed.”\n\nTea leaves at a plantation estate in Bogawantalawa, Sri Lanka. Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters\n\n‘It is time for change’\n\nWith Gotabaya Rajapaksa now out of the country, public fury has turned to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, current Acting President.\n\n“Wickremesinghe was Rajapaksa’s pick for prime minister, that’s the problem,” said Abeyagoonasekera, the author.\n\n“He is politically connected to the Rajapaksas and his interest (has always been) in protecting them.”\n\nOthers reiterated the call for elections. “The protest movement isn’t slowing down and many Sri Lankans have realized the importance of their roles as citizens in holding those in power accountable,” said Ambika Satkunanathan, a human rights lawyer who once served with the United Nations and the Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\nShe also said she wouldn’t rule out the Rajapaksas returning to power. “They might have abandoned ship while it was sinking but they are savvy and have been in the political game for decades,” she said.\n\n“But there is a window now and it is time for change. The government needs to call elections sooner rather than later.”\n\nWickmenesinghe will remain Acting President until Parliament elects a new President. No date has been set yet for the vote, but under the constitution Wickremesinghe will only be allowed to hold the office for a maximum of 30 days.\n\nParliament will accept nominations for a new President on Monday, the speaker said on Saturday.\n\nOnce elected, the new President will serve the remaining two years initially allocated for Rajapaksa’s term.\n\nParliamentary elections were last held in 2020 and the Presidential election in 2019 – months after the Easter church bombings took place. Gotabaya Rajapaksa won after a closely fought race against then-ruling party candidate Sajith Premadasa.\n\nThe scene at St Sebastian's Church in Negombo following the bomb attacks on April 21, 2019. AFP/Getty Images\n\nWickremesinghe’s appointment on Wednesday did not go down well with protesters who stormed his office demanding he step down. Police fired tear gas and water cannons at protesters and a nationwide state of emergency was declared.\n\nOn Friday, Sri Lanka’s ruling party confirmed that Wickremesinghe is its nominee for President in the upcoming election.\n\nBut Sri Lankans remain determined, analysts said, and want to see new people and faces in government. “The interim President will be (the one) tasked to stabilize the economy for a few months,” said Abeyagoonasekera. “But he wouldn’t be a leader elected by the people and that is an obstacle.”\n\n‘Lack of accountability’\n\nThe Rajapaksas drew much of their power from the “war hero” status afforded them by the majority population, following then-president Mahinda’s 2009 declaration of victory in the 26-year civil war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels – a campaign overseen by then-defense secretary Gotabaya.\n\nAccording to a 2011 United Nations report, Sri Lankan government troops were responsible for abuses including the intentional shelling of civilians, summary executions, rape, and blocking food and medicine from reaching affected communities. The UN report said “a number of credible sources have estimated there could have been as many as 40,000 civilian deaths.”\n\nThe Rajapaksas have always vehemently denied such allegations.\n\nSatkunanathan, the human rights lawyer, said Sri Lanka’s next long-term leader must “tackle entrenched problems like ethnic conflict, accountability for human rights violations, as well as possess the commitment and integrity to rebuild public trust.”\n\n“Because we simply can’t afford to slip back yet again into a crisis like the one we face today,” she said.\n\nGlobal rights groups like Human Rights Watch (HRW) also said the UN mandate to investigate alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka must be maintained.\n\n“Gotabaya Rajapaksa and others accused should also be investigated and appropriately prosecuted,” said Elaine Pearson, HRW acting Asia director.\n\nIndependent investigations and prosecutions were also needed into Sri Lanka’s economic mismanagement, she added.\n\n“There should be investigations into alleged corruption which has contributed to this crisis, including any efforts to hide assets abroad,” she said. “Foreign governments should investigate assets and freeze them if appropriate.”\n\nPearson also reiterated the urgency for elections.\n\n“The urgent priority is for a peaceful transition of power that respects rights and addresses the root causes of the political and economic crisis which is ultimately about a lack of accountability, corruption and the weakening of institutions that were meant to provide a check on power,” she said.\n\n“If a more stable government … cannot be established, the risks are of a humanitarian crisis as well as greater violence and repression.”", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}]}

Pfizer and BioNTech said there has been \"no clinical evidence to date” their vaccine is not effective against that variant, but they are working on an update or booster shot anyway.\n\n\"It is unclear what effect a reduction in neutralization by approximately two thirds would have on (vaccine)-elicited protection from Covid-19 caused by the B.1.351 lineage of SARS-CoV-2,'' says the report, authored by researchers from Pfizer, BioNTech and the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\nHowever, presidential advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a CNN interview Wednesday night that even though \"the efficacy of the vaccines induced by both the Moderna and the Pfizer are diminished multiple-fold, there's such a cushion of efficacy at the level of antibodies that are induced'' that they both protect against most disease and especially against severe disease from the variant.\n\nAs NHL deals with COVID-19 issues, is on-ice transmission among players to blame?\n\nThe signs that COVID-19 would wreak havoc on the 2021 NHL season were there before the first puck even dropped. Five days prior to opening night on Jan. 13, the league announced the defending Western Conference champion Dallas Stars would not open the season as scheduled because 17 players had contracted COVID-19 during training camp.\n\nSince then, seven more teams have been sidelined because of COVID-19. The toll so far has been 35 games postponed and at least 124 players landing on the NHL's COVID-19 list. Players are put on the list for several reasons, from testing positive for COVD-19 to high-risk close contact to quarantining following a trade.\n\nThe NHL is now acknowledging that COVID-19 may be spreading around the league as a result of on-ice contact and because the more contagious strains have infiltrated the league.

Here are the highlights:\n\nA $650 million investment to expand testing opportunities for K-8 schools and underserved congregate settings, such as homeless shelters.\n\nEstablishment of regional coordinating centers to organize the distribution of testing supplies and partner with laboratories across the country, including universities and commercial labs, to collect specimens, perform tests and report results to the public health agencies.\n\nAn investment of $815 million to increase domestic manufacturing of testing supplies and materials that have created shortage issues.\n\nA nearly $200 million plan by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify and track emerging strains, increasing the agency's sequencing capacity from about 7,000 samples per week to approximately 25,000.\n\nThe White House said in a press release that the investments are \"only the beginning\" of what is needed to expand testing nationwide. Biden's American Rescue Plan, which he wants Congress to pass in the coming weeks, would invest $50 billion to expand and support testing.\n\nResearch starting to show vaccines prevent transmission, Fauci says\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci cited early data Wednesday that suggests vaccines may be effective in diminishing or preventing transmission.\n\n\"Does vaccine prevent transmission?\" Fauci said. \"There have been some studies that are pointing into a very favorable direction, that will have to be verified and corroborated by other studies.\"\n\nCiting data from Spain and Israel, Fauci said research is \"starting to point to the fact\" that vaccines not only protect people from disease – including that caused by the variants – but also from becoming contagious.\n\n\"When your turn to get vaccinated comes up, get vaccinated,\" Fauci said. \"It's not only good for you and your family and your community, it will have a very important impact on the dynamics of the outbreak in our country.\"\n\nAsh Wednesday, Mardi Gras upended by pandemic\n\nAmerica marked Ash Wednesday in alternative ways as the threat of spreading COVID-19 takes its toll on religious traditions on the first day of the Lenten season.\n\nCatholic priests have been told by the Vatican to skip making the traditional sign of the cross with ashes on worshipper's foreheads. Some churches are offering drive-thru ashes and do-it-yourself, bagged ashes. The Vatican asks that priests sprinkle the ashes upon the heads of their congregants, a customary practice at the Vatican and in Italy.\n\n\"You never see the pope with ashes on his forehead,\" said the Rev. Steven B. Giuliano. at Our Lady of Lourdes in Wilmington, Delaware. \"They are always placed atop his head.\"\n\nAsh Wednesday comes one day after \"Fat Tuesday\" – Mardi Gras – which also saw big changes this year.

Asked how he would return students to classrooms, Biden said, \"We should be vaccinating teachers.\n\nHe also said that \"by next Christmas I think we'll be in a very different circumstance [in terms of normalcy than we are today.\"\n\nSAT testing for students ramping up for spring\n\nThe SATs will go on this spring in pandemic or in health. The College Board, which owns and oversees the exam many colleges use for admissions, has directed school hosts to \"make their own decisions about the test and safety standards based on local restrictions,\" according to its website.\n\nHosts can close sites up to the day of testing, but no closures were posted to the College Board closures page. SAT sites, often hosted by high schools, are working to update exam security and COVID-19 safety protocols to accommodate thousands of students. Hundreds of test sites across the nation were shuttered last spring and fall due to the pandemic.\n\n\"While College Board can't directly control capacity and test center availability, we're working to ensure that as many students as possible are able to test safely,\" the not-for-profit group said in a statement.\n\n– Carly Q.

Have you heard these stories?\" asks one Feb. 19 Instagram post depicting the \"I Guess I'll Die\" meme – an image of a man in a red turtleneck shrugging – surrounded by nine different headlines from various news outlets reporting post-vaccination deaths.\n\nThree of the headlines involve deaths in Portugal, Brazil and Norway; the other six involve two health workers in California, a Florida doctor, a Virginia woman in her 40s and New York man in his 70s.\n\nWhile not explicit in its messaging, the juxtaposition of the headlines around the central meme, often used to convey resignation to death, suggests the vaccine may be the culprit. Many of the post's comments echo the sentiment, likening the vaccine to the infamously unethical Tuskegee syphilis study on Black men, which falsely advertised treatment for \"bad blood,\" a term commonly used for a garden variety of ailments.\n\n\"If people get (the vaccine) they are insane: Tuskegee Experiment with a twist,\" wrote one commentator.\n\n\"Hard pass ... I urge you all to research the Tuskegee experiment if you haven't already,\" another wrote. \"We are guinea pigs. Don't play yourself.\"\n\nUSA TODAY was unable to reach the Instagram user for further comment.\n\nMore:Fact check: CDC is not inflating the COVID-19 death count\n\nDeaths among elderly in Norway ruled unrelated to vaccine\n\nOne of the nine headlines is a Jan. 15 article published in the New York Post that details the deaths of 23 people in Norway — all over age 75 and 13 of whom were nursing home residents — within a week of vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOn social media, news of these deaths quickly morphed into the claim that Pfizer's vaccine was singularly responsible. This allegation was further compounded by the death of 86-year-old former Atlanta Braves athlete Hank Aaron nearly three weeks after his first vaccine dose on Jan. 22.\n\nAaron's death is not believed associated with the vaccine. Similarly, an ongoing investigation by the Norwegian Medicines Agency and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has not found any evidence to suggest the deaths among the 23 severely frail and elderly people were associated with the vaccine.\n\n\"So far, there are no statistical analyses that indicate that coronavirus vaccination has had an increased risk of death among those vaccinated,\" said Dr. Sara Viksmoen Watle of the NIPH in a Jan. 18 statement.\n\nThe World Health Organization also conducted its own review and did not find \"any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine).\"\n\nFact check: Trump surgeon general initially dismissed mask-wearing, but then endorsed\n\nDeaths in Portugal and Brazil\n\nOn Jan. 4, the British Daily Mail reported 41-year-old Portuguese health worker Sonia Acevedo had died on Jan. 1, \"two days after getting the Pfizer covid vaccine.\" The article was among many others suggesting a correlation between the timing of her death and the vaccine.\n\nIn a Jan. 5 press release, the Portuguese Ministry of Justice stated preliminary autopsy findings did not indicate \"evidence of a causal relationship between (Acevedo's) death and the vaccine she received.\" No cause of death was provided, the ministry citing the \"secrecy of justice\" as the reason why. USA TODAY used Google Translate and other translation services to interpret Portuguese into English.\n\nPrior to Acevedo's death, a volunteer in the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial in Brazil died, CNN reported in October. Because AstraZeneca had not discontinued or paused the trial, as it had done in the past due to an \"unexplained illness\" among one of its U.K. Phase III trial volunteers, it appeared the volunteer's demise was not vaccine related.\n\n\"All significant medical incidents, whether participants are in the control group or the Covid-19 vaccine group, are independently reviewed. Following careful assessment of this case in Brazil, there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial and the independent review in addition to the Brazilian regulator have recommended that the trial should continue,\" said the University of Oxford, AstraZeneca's collaborator, in an emailed statement to CNN.\n\nWhile no additional details on the death have been released because of \"medical confidentiality and clinical trial regulations,\" an AstraZeneca spokesperson told CNN, Bloomberg reported the volunteer who died was not among the vaccine arm, per an insider source.\n\nMore:Fact check: Long-term face mask use will not cause lung cancer\n\nDeaths of 2 California health workers\n\nThree of the nine headlines in the Instagram post refer to deaths in Orange and Placer counties in California.\n\nTim Zook, an X-ray technologist at South Coast Global Medical Center in Santa Ana, received his second coronavirus vaccine dose on Jan. 5, according to both local FOX and CBS News affiliates. He was hospitalized after experiencing abdominal pain and difficulty breathing hours later, subsequently placed in a medically induced coma on Jan. 7 and died on Jan. 9.\n\nZook's death has been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a national monitoring system co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nNo cause of death has been identified; further investigation is underway.\n\n\"The Orange County Coroner has an open death investigation into Zook’s death and will be conducting additional tests within its autopsy protocol ... it will use those findings, along with autopsy findings, to make a final determination into the cause and manner of death which will not likely occur for 3-4 months,\" said the Orange County Coroner's office in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nIf the death is ruled vaccine-related, the office stated it would immediately notify the Orange County Health Care Agency.\n\nIn Placer County, an unnamed health worker died on Jan. 21 several hours after being vaccinated, NBC News Wisconsin affiliate reported.\n\nThe 64-year-old male had tested positive for the novel coronavirus in late December; at the time of his death, health officials did not indicate whether this factored into his health or demise.\n\nThe Placer County Sheriff-Coroner Division ruled out the vaccine as a cause of death in an updated statement released Jan. 30 on its Facebook page.\n\n\"Through our investigation, we have learned more details about the individual. We have learned that not only had he recently been diagnosed with COVID-19, he also had underlying health issues, and had been exhibiting symptoms of illness at the time the vaccine was administered. Clinical examination and lab results have determined the COVID-19 vaccine has been ruled out as a contributing factor in the individual's death.\"\n\nMore:Fact check: Post distorts WHO's COVID-19 PCR testing guidelines\n\nFlorida doctor's death still under investigation\n\nObstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Gregory Michael died from complications of immune thrombocytopenia, or ITP – poor blood clotting due to a lack of platelets – in early January.\n\nThe 56-year-old received Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 18 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, where he practiced, and died 16 days later from a brain hemorrhage after multiple treatments for his ITP failed, The New York Times reported.\n\nPfizer told the Times it was \"actively investigating\" the doctor's death \"but we don't believe at this time that there is any direct connection to the vaccine.\"\n\nThirty-six other similar cases of ITP have been reported to VAERS, the Times reported in early February, but it is unknown whether these events are causally related to the vaccine.\n\nIt is worth noting ITP was not observed in either Moderna or Pfizer's large clinical trials of combined over 70,000 participants.\n\nMore:Fact check: Amish communities have been affected by COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDeath of Virginia woman believed not due to vaccine, investigation underway for death of New York man\n\nEarlier in February, Drene Keyes of Gloucester, Virginia, and an unnamed New York City resident in his 70s were reported to have died shortly after vaccination.\n\nNBC news reported Keyes, 58, was vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Feb. 5. She remained in the clinic for the recommended 15-minute observation period to monitor for any allergic reaction before being discharged. Keyes later returned with complaints of vomiting and trouble breathing, at which point she was rushed to Virginia Commonwealth University Health Tappahannock Hospital. She died the next day.\n\nAccording to Dr. M. Norman Oliver, Virginia state health commissioner, Keyes' death did not appear connected to any vaccine-related allergic reaction.\n\n\"Preliminary findings indicate that the cause of death was not anaphylaxis, but it will take several weeks for additional information to become available,\" he said in a statement on Feb. 5. \"We can confirm that the death occurred within hours of having received the vaccine, but that is not evidence of it being related. We are currently investigating and do not yet know the cause of death.\"\n\nThe unnamed New York City man died on Feb. 7 after collapsing outside of Manhattan's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where he received his vaccine 25 minutes earlier, the New York Post reported.\n\nIn a statement, New York state health commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said the man \"exhibited no adverse reactions or any distress\" during the 15-minute observation period.\n\nNo official cause of death has been concluded but a medical investigation is underway, reported local CBS News affiliate CBS 2.\n\nMore:Fact check: Merck discontinues COVID-19 vaccine work over weak immune response\n\nCorrelation is not causation\n\nWhile reports of deaths following COVID-19 vaccination may sound alarming, health care experts are reminding the public there is no conclusive association between the two.\n\n\"These vaccines have had incredible safety profiles in the trials and post-authorization. So far, there has been nothing to confirm these awful events,\" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, to ABC News in February.\n\n\"These medical events occur every single day, including unexplained illnesses,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, also to ABC News. \"The question really is, do they occur at a greater rate in the vaccinated population than they do in the general population?\"\n\nSo far according to a recent CDC report, nearly 90% of VAERS reports were \"nonserious events and involved local and systemic symptoms.\" The CDC estimated out of a million people, allergic reactions happened in roughly five, a number within range of what has been reported with other vaccines for the flu, meningitis and shingles.\n\nThe data analyzed was collected between Dec. 14, 2020, and Jan. 13, a time period that saw 13.8 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines administered.\n\nA total of 113 deaths were reported, including from death certificates and autopsy reports, but no causal link between coronavirus vaccination and death was found, according to the CDC.\n\nOur ruling: Missing context\n\nWe rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT because without additional context it might be misleading. The deaths of various individuals across the U.S. and elsewhere following COVID-19 vaccination did occur, but the vaccine has not been identified as a cause of death. A recent CDC report found that of the 113 death reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System between Dec. 14 and Jan. 13 — a time period which saw 13.8 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines administered — no causal link between vaccination and death was found.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release. As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

Eight hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,096 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n76,581 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nNOTE: The Free Press noticed the numbers regarding new and total case counts didn't align from July 11 to July 13 and subsequently reached out to the Health Department. Ben Truman with the department said in an email that this is why there is a notice that this data is preliminary. He provided an example: A person who tested positive might no longer get counted if it is learned that they don't live in Vermont.\n\n_________\n\nSunday, July 12, 2020\n\nFourteen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,296.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day.

Those interested in receiving assistance can begin applying online starting Monday July 13 for the rental assistance program or mortgage assistance program.\n\nRenters' assistance money could be used for rent or security deposits as well as make up for landlord losses from the period starting March 1, 2020. Funding can be re-applied for and is given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Proof of payment delinquency will be required.\n\nThe mortgage assistance program prioritizes the lowest income, highest risk of foreclosure homeowners who have missed at least two payments. Homeowners could apply for up to three missed mortgage payments; funds will be paid directly to the mortgage lender.\n\n__________\n\nKinney Drugs and a Walgreens in Essex will soon begin COVID-19 testing at their pharmacies.\n\nGov. Phil Scott asked other local companies to join the effort. Health Commissioner Mark Levine said having testing locations at local pharmacies takes some of the burden off the health department so they can focus on outbreaks and vulnerable populations.\n\n___________\n\nFive new cases of COVID-19 were reported Friday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,277.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — down one from yesterday.

The airport has added thermal imaging that can pick up abnormally high body temperatures, indicating a fever, in groups of up to 20 people. Richards said if someone is “running warm” a red square shows up on her image rather than a green square.\n\nRichards explained that a person who possibly has a fever is notified and advised to check with a physician, but no further steps are taken. “We don’t want to get into people’s personal business at this point,” Richards said. “It’s very voluntary.”\n\nRichards said about 4,000 people are passing through the airport weekly, up from a low of 800 at the start of the pandemic. Normally, Burlington International Airport would be seeing as many as 17,000 people passing through weekly at this time of year, before the coronavirus struck the nation.\n\nThursday, July 9, 2020\n\nThe Vermont Cheesemakers Festival announced it is canceling the 12th annual event planned for Sunday, Aug. 9 at Shelburne Farms.\n\n\"We have been pondering what to do – postpone the festival, offer alternative events, etc. – and found is that there really is no alternative to the festival given the current conditions and our interest in keeping both our vendors’ and attendees’ safety prioritized,\" reads a note on the festival's website.\n\nThe Vermont Cheese Council, which plans the event, has had to focus in recent months \"trying to help cheesemakers keep their doors open, helping them find grant and other emergency funds, redirecting and identifying new sales strategies to try to make up for the 25-75% losses most of them have experienced, helping them navigate the changing regulations related to operating within our industry at this time, and marketing their products as widely as possible,\" according to the website.\n\n_________\n\nVermont Humanities and the Vermont Arts Council have wrapped up their Cultural Relief Grant Program that distributed nearly $750,000 in emergency relief grants to 122 Vermont cultural organizations, including museums, libraries, performing-arts venues and other cultural centers, the council announced in a news release.\n\nThe program, which concluded May 31, supported humanities and arts organizations struggling to survive through resulting economic fallout from the pandemic. The grants are for general operating expenses of $5,000 to $10,000 depending on organization size.\n\nThe program was seeded by more than $700,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020.\n\nThe Opera Company of Middlebury canceled its planned June production of Tchaikovkiy's \"Maid of Orleans,\" causing nearly 60 Vermont singers, musicians and staff members to go without a paycheck.\n\n“This grant supports our plan to produce an innovative, socially-distanced video production this fall, putting these talented people back to work, and bringing opera once again to the Vermont audience,” artistic director Douglas Anderson said in a news release.\n\n_________\n\nThe Shelburne Museum will re-open to the public July 30.\n\nFree admission will be offered to patrons visiting by September 6.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W.

Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

On a case-by-case basis, in-person appearance may be required for certain essential proceedings if no technological workaround is possible.\n\nThe order specifies that parties and their lawyers can request a hearing on scheduling, which must be done telephonically or by video. Some lawyers had complained that some judges were insisting they appear in person last week for simple scheduling conferences.\n\n\"This order is intended to be interpreted broadly for protection of the public, court staff and judges from the risks associated with COVID-19.\"\n\n— Bruce Vielmetti\n\n8:15 p.m.: Milwaukee closes three early-voting sites\n\nOne week after opening three early voting sites in the city of Milwaukee, officials are closing them because of concerns of spreading the coronavirus.\n\nCity of Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Neil Albrecht issued the order Sunday night to immediately close three locations where people could vote in person before the April 7 primary.\n\nBecause of the risk of exposure to coronavirus to poll workers, early voting sites at these locations will not be open for the next two weeks as originally scheduled:\n\nZablocki Library, 3501 W. Oklahoma Ave.\n\nZeidler Municipal Building, 841 N Broadway\n\nMidtown Center, 5700 W.

Those sites were open Monday through Friday last week.\n\nRelated:How to get an absentee ballot in Wisconsin\n\n“Given the city’s longstanding dedication to fair and equitable elections, the decision to end early voting in Milwaukee has been exceptionally difficult for all involved,” Albrecht said Sunday night in a release.\n\nMilwaukee residents may still request an absentee ballot online at myvote.wi.gov or by calling 414-286-VOTE.

Tony Evers’ action on Sunday suspends the amount of instructional time required for the school year. He also suspended licensing requirements to allow student teachers the ability to graduate.\n\nBefore he was elected governor in 2018, Evers was the state superintendent of schools in Wisconsin. Evers was also a schoolteacher, a principal and a district superintendent.\n\n“As we continue to face challenges surrounding COVID-19 in Wisconsin, it’s critically important that school district administrators, educators, students, and parents have the peace of mind knowing we’re working to address concerns about hours of instruction, making sure our student teachers will graduate on time, and ensuring the department has flexibility as we move forward to do what’s best for our kids, educators, and schools across our state,” said Evers said in a release.\n\n— Meg Jones\n\n5:47 p.m.: Lenard Wells, longtime advocate for African Americans in MPD, died from coronavirus complications\n\nLenard Wells, who worked for decades to increase African American representation in all ranks of the Milwaukee Police Department and served as president of the League of Martin, has died.\n\nThe Milwaukee County medical examiner's office confirmed Sunday it is investigating his death as complications of COVID-19. Wells, 69, died Saturday.\n\n\"Much of the progress in law enforcement by people of color and women can be attributed to the sheer force of his personality,\" Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas said in a statement released Sunday.\n\n\"Lenny spoke truth to power in ways only few people could, and he even showed compassion for those who displayed little or no concern for others,\" Lucas said. \"He was a force to be reckoned with who kindled the fire in me and others to continue to persevere through the struggle and the storm.\"\n\nAfter his police career, Wells served on the Wisconsin Parole Commission. He has taught criminal justice at the University of Memphis since 2013.\n\n\"He was well known for his compassion and dedication to the impartation of knowledge and providing guidance to his students regarding their future careers and life,\" wrote KB Turner, chairman of the Department of Criminology & Criminal Justice, in a message to staff and students.\n\n\"His untimely passing will leave an indelible void for some time to come.

Tony Evers.\n\n“It is critically important to give people flexibility during this emergency, when paychecks might be disrupted, to keep the lights and heat on and water flowing,” Evers said in a news release. “We’re making sure that folks don’t have to make the critical choice between keeping their utilities on and paying for other essentials.”\n\nEvers already had given a similar order for residential homes in the state.\n\nUnder the order, the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, also asked utility providers to stop assessing late fees for customer accounts, stop requiring deposits from customers to reconnect service and allow deferred payment agreements for all customers who request them.\n\n“I want to thank the governor for his prompt action on this and our utility providers for their continued efforts to keep our homes and businesses supplied with light, heat, and water,” said Rebecca Cameron Valcq, the commission’s chairwoman.\n\n“This is a difficult time for many,” she said. We’re asking that those who are able to pay their utility bills, please continue to do so. For those who can’t, today’s order allows them to remain connected.”\n\n3:53 p.m.: National guard assists senior living facility in Grafton\n\nA team of six Wisconsin National Guard medics were deployed to a Grafton senior living facility to help with a deadly coronavirus outbreak that has sickened several residents and staff.\n\nFour Army and two Air Force medics arrived at Village Pointe Common late Saturday to help staff while the facility works out a long-term solution. The guardsmen are expected to be at the facility for three days, according to a Wisconsin National Guard spokesman.\n\nRobert Blackbird, 91, died Thursday at Village Pointe Common and several other residents and one caregiver have also tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nThe National Guard medics are using their military-issued personal protective equipment because of a shortage of equipment such as masks, gloves and gowns used by civilian medical personnel. That will help preserve the limited supply of equipment for civilian health care workers.\n\nCapt. Heather Schaller, a nurse assigned to the Wisconsin Army National Guard’s Medical Detachment in Camp Douglas is the officer in charge of the mission in Grafton. In her civilian job, she’s a nurse at a Milwaukee hospital.\n\n“It’s cool that my job could give me up in order to do something like this and support the National Guard as well,” Schaller said in a release. “It’s rewarding, and it’s the reason why I put on the uniform, and why I joined the Guard.”\n\nThe medics are part of a group of around 300 guardsmen who volunteered to help with the coronavirus pandemic. While the soldiers and airmen prepare for the possibility of collecting specimens at mobile testing sites and transporting supplies or equipment, Wisconsin National Guard members have also driven Wisconsin residents returning home on two flights to Volk Field from quarantining on a cruise ship in California.\n\n—Meg Jones\n\n2:32 p.m.: Uline Inc. responds to New York Times story\n\nUline Inc. is pushing back against a national story suggesting the Wisconsin packaging company is one a few major businesses around the country declining to take important steps aimed at curbing the coronavirus.\n\n“Uline has been a leader in the nationwide fight to defeat the coronavirus,” Uline said in a lengthy statement Sunday.\n\nThe New York Times reported Sunday that Pleasant Prairie-based company required its employees to report for work throughout the past week, including staffers working in cramped call centers.\n\nThe report said the manager at one call center sent a memo encouraging Uline employees to keep it to themselves if they were not feeling well.\n\n“If you, or family members, are under the weather with cold/allergies — or anything aside from Covid-19,” the memo said, “please do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms & your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.”\n\nAsked about the Times report, which was part of a bigger story on coronavirus deniers and disbelievers, a spokesman responded with a detailed statement describing the company’s role in helping to fight the virus.\n\nThe statement said all “non-essential workers” at Uline are working from home. Customer service and warehouse employees, it said, continue to fill orders, many of which are related to the global pandemic.\n\nUline is working closely with the federal government to respond to the emergency, the statement continued. At the direct request of the Trump administration, it said, Uline has made many overnight deliveries to pharmacies, health providers and hospitals.\n\nThe goods being shipped include protective clothing, specimen bags, cleaning supplies, wipes, masks, and insulated shipping products.\n\nThe major packaging and industrial supply company — which has opened multiple facilities in Kenosha County since moving its headquarters from Waukegan, Ill., to Pleasant Prairie in 2010 — is owned by Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein.\n\nThe two are among the biggest GOP donors in the nation. In recent years, they have given tens of millions of dollars to various conservative groups, including a $10 million gift to Club for Growth this year, and to such Republican politicians as unsuccessful U.S. Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson of Wisconsin.\n\nUline officials did not respond to questions about the Uihleins’ personal beliefs about the virus.\n\n— Daniel Bice\n\n2:13 p.m.: Wisconsin reports 381 confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Health Services is now reporting 381 cases of COVID-19 statewide and four deaths.

They were tested after another resident, a 91-year-old man, died Thursday.\n\nThe man tested positive for coronavirus after his death.\n\nVillage Pointe Commons is now being partially staffed with a medical unit from the National Guard, according to Bailey Murph, a spokesperson for the health department.\n\nThe order issued Saturday also stipulates additional safety measures for staff at long-term care facilities to mitigate the spread of the virus, which has proven to be more dangerous towards elderly populations and those with compromised immune systems.\n\n- Elliot Hughes\n\n4:58 p.m.: State unemployment claims continue skyrocketing\n\nNearly 63,000 Wisconsinites filed unemployment claims this week after the coronavirus outbreak forced scores of bars, restaurants and other businesses to temporarily close.\n\nFrom Sunday through Friday, a total of 62,828 claims were filed, according to preliminary figures by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.\n\nThat's 12 times the number of claims the state received during the same time period in 2019, when 5,190 claims were filed.\n\nAbout 15,000 claims have been filed every day since Wednesday, according to the data.\n\n- Elliot Hughes\n\n3:55 p.m.: Family of Fond du Lac man who died from COVID-19 speaks\n\nThe family of a 55-year-old Fond du Lac man who died from coronavirus has asked that people take COVID-19 seriously, but not panic, and has appealed for compassion and understanding.\n\nDale Joseph Witkowski contracted the virus while in Egypt with one of his sisters. He celebrated his 55th birthday there Feb. 25th and died Thursday at St. Agnes Hospital in Fond du Lac.\n\n“We ask you to be serious about COVID-19. Please do not panic, rather educate yourself and your family. Please do not blame or shun, rather be supportive and compassionate, especially with the people who have tested positive for this virus,” his family wrote in an online obituary.\n\n“We responded too slowly as a country and now we are seeing devastating effects in our country, state and community, and for us, our family. Knowledge and mindful, safe practices are what is needed now,” they added.\n\nWitkowski worked for many years at outboard engine maker at Mercury Marine where he was manager of MercNET product protection and warranty service.\n\n“His work at Merc was very important to him and he was passionate about the company, its product and its history,” his family said.\n\nWhile the family said they will honor and celebrate Dale, there will not be a funeral service at this time due to the COVID-19 crisis. Instead, they plan to schedule a service this summer.\n\n“Dale deeply respected and appreciated those who serve our country in the military, protective services and as first responders. … Remember Dale as you knew him, larger than life, a big teddy bear of a man with a gift for laughter and hugging and a caring heart that knew no limits,” they wrote.\n\nThe family has asked that they be allowed to grieve in private.

Tony Evers said in a statement.\n\nTax filers do not have to file any extension forms and there is no limit on the amount of payment to be postponed, nor income exclusions, according to the department. The extension applies to individuals, trusts, estates, partnerships, associations and companies or corporations.\n\nDOR Secretary Peter Barca said roughly half of Wisconsin taxpayers have already filed their tax returns.\n\n- Molly Beck\n\n1:59 p.m.: 281 have tested positive for the virus in Wisconsin, state says\n\nNearly 300 people have now tested positive for coronavirus and four people have died after contracting it, according to newly released data from the state Department of Health Services.\n\nAbout 6% of the total number of people who have been tested for coronavirus are positive, according to the latest batch of test results released Saturday by the health department.\n\nAmong the 281 people who tested positive, nearly half live in Milwaukee County. Dane County has 49 positive cases of the virus and Waukesha County has 20 cases.\n\nFour people have died after contracting the virus: two in Milwaukee County, one in Fond du Lac County and one in Ozaukee County.\n\nDHS Secretary Andrea Palm on Friday in a call with reporters warned of more deaths to come.\n\n- Molly Beck\n\n1:09 p.m.: Wisconsin farmers to feel the pain as ethanol plants slash production\n\nWisconsin ethanol producers and grain farmers are feeling the pain from coronavirus as plummeting demand for gasoline reduces the need for the fuel additive made from corn.\n\nLast week, oil prices hit an 18-year low of $20 a barrel.\n\nAnalysts say it’s only a matter of time before ethanol plants slash production or close. And it will affect grain farmers since 40% of the U.S. corn crop goes to make the fuel additive.\n\n“This is crushing refineries and ethanol producers,” said Alex Breitinger with Breitinger & Sons, a commodities futures brokerage firm based in Indiana.\n\n- Rick Barrett\n\n12:47 p.m.: New child-care launch targets health care, emergency workers\n\nA coalition of partners, including the YMCA of Greater Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Health Department, local health care providers and others are launching a new initiative to provide child-care services for emergency responders and essential medical personnel, the YMCA said Saturday.\n\nDetails of the program, which if successful could be replicated statewide, will be announced at a news conference at 11 a.m. Monday.\n\nA spokesman for the YMCA said a pilot center would be set up at Aurora St. Luke’s Medical Center at 2900 W. Oklahoma Ave. in Milwaukee, and other area sites are in the works.

For the safety and well-being of our staffs, our team has come to a difficult decision in closing the business temporarily until further notice. Thank you for understanding and we hope that everyone will rise out of the pandemic strong. Stay safe and healthy.”\n\nA state mandate has shut down all restaurants except for takeout and delivery.\n\n— Carol Deptolla\n\n12:16 p.m.: GE, union agree to emergency contract to build ventilators in Madison\n\nAddressing an urgent need to produce ventilators in the fight against coronavirus, the International Association of Machinists union has agreed to an emergency contract extension to manufacture as many ventilators as possible in the next 90 days at the GE Datex-Ohmeda plant in Madison.\n\nThe plant employs more than 340 machinists who build anesthesia, respiratory and infant-care machines and are now working day and night to meet the sudden demand for ventilators.\n\nThe union and GE management had scheduled contract negotiations beginning next month but instead agreed to the emergency one-year extension of the current agreement which was to expire in June.\n\n“This extension allows the company and union to work together to produce lifesaving equipment that will be used around the world. Both union members and salaried workers will be working on the shop floor side-by-side in order to meet the unprecedented demands of this crisis,” said Joe Terlisner, District 10 Business Representative for the union.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\n11:15 a.m.: Oak Creek Woodman's initially limits number of customers allowed in store\n\nEmployees at Woodman’s Market in Oak Creek were only letting 10 people in at a time to limit the number of people in the store early Saturday morning. The line was at roughly 100 customers, but those at the front said they had only been waiting less than 10 minutes and the line was moving fast.\n\nBut about 11:15 a.m., the line was gone. Customers were allowed to enter the store.\n\nSigns were posted on doors saying the store will be closing at 9 p.m. to restock for the next day. There were also signs with a list of items that were limited to one per customer.\n\nAt Sam’s Club in Franklin, the line for the self-checkout reached almost to the back of the store. Sam’s Club was able to restock on bottled water, but paper towels and toilet paper were gone.\n\nMost of the employees at Sam’s Club wore rubber or plastic gloves. The same could be said of employees at Walmart next door.\n\nThe Walmart in Franklin had a hand sanitizer dispenser at the main entrance that had been working all week. By Saturday morning, the only thing it was dispensing was air. It was completely out of sanitizer.\n\nWalmart was also out of bottled water, paper towels and toilet paper. Many shelves in the grocery store and pharmacy were barren from the run the store absorbed last weekend.\n\nAt each store, there were a few customers that wore gloves or masks, and sometimes both.\n\nAt the Grafton Costco, shoppers were urged to practice social distancing, cover their coughs and let associates manage “member flow” into the store. The store had a steady stream of customers who were stocking up for on a variety of items but especially paper products. The store had had a stock of toilet paper for a brief time Saturday, an associate said, but it quickly sold out. Associates were wiping down carts for shoppers to use.\n\nAt the Salvation Army Family Store and Donation Center on 27th Street and College Avenue, the parking lot was closed off but that didn’t stop people from leaving donations. Dozens of bags of donated items lined the entrance to the parking lot.\n\n— Ricardo Torres and David D. Haynes\n\n10:28 a.m.: Wisconsin's U.S. senators adjust to the new normal in Washington\n\nWith the House in recess, it's the U.S. Senate that is experiencing the new realities of congressional working life in Washington amid the coronavirus crisis.\n\nWisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin spoke with a reporter by phone Thursday from her D.C. apartment, which now doubles as her D.C. office, since neither she nor her staff are operating out of their Senate work spaces.\n\n“I am sheltering in place,” said Baldwin.\n\n“We’re all tele-working now, so my life is a series of conference calls,” she said, including for the first time this week, virtual (phone-in) caucuses of Senate Democrats, which she described as “quite orderly.”\n\nRon Johnson spoke with a reporter by phone earlier this past week from his Senate office, in the company of only his chief of staff, since his aides are also working from home. Johnson described the Capitol as a “ghost town.”\n\nRoll call votes are being conducted over a longer period of time, so smaller numbers of senators are occupying the chamber at any one time. Baldwin said there is a placard in the chamber asking members to exercise their responsibility to socially distance.\n\n“I think we’re all adapting, as best we can, to recognizing the responsibility to keep on serving our constituents under very new circumstances.”\n\nWith both parties trying to hammer out a massive stimulus package, senators are convening over the weekend in the hopes of passing legislation early this coming week.\n\n— Craig Gilbert\n\n10:20 a.m.: Low-interest disaster loans available for Wisconsin businesses\n\nSmall businesses in Wisconsin affected by the coronavirus pandemic will have access to low-interest federal disaster loans, Gov. Tony Evers’ office announced Saturday.\n\nEvers’ office said the U.S. Small Business Administration has approved his administration’s request to make the loans available in Wisconsin. But it said processing of the loans could be delayed because of the likely deluge of requests.\n\n“This is very good news for Wisconsin businesses that have already suffered financial losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak,” Evers said in a statement.\n\n“With the SBA loans now available to our state, small businesses and their employees have a little more certainty over their financial futures.\"\n\nUnder the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, businesses and nonprofits may qualify for up to $2 million in loans to cover losses resulting from the pandemic, according to the state. The interest rates are 3.75% for for-profit businesses and 2.75% for nonprofits, and payments can be extended to 30 years.\n\nApplicants can get started at www.sba.gov/disaster.

He was then tested for COVID-19 and the test results were positive.\n\n— Annysa Johnson and Ricardo Torres\n\nFRIDAY, MARCH 20\n\n10:14 p.m.: Evers announces federal OK of loans for small businesses\n\nGov. Tony Evers announced Friday that the U.S. Small Business Administration has approved Wisconsin’s request for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to access low-interest federal disaster loans.\n\n“This is very good news for Wisconsin businesses that have already suffered financial losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak,” he said. “With the SBA loans now available to our state, small businesses and their employees have a little more certainty over their financial futures. This is another step in providing much-needed assistance to Wisconsin's small businesses.”\n\nWith unprecedented demand for the loans nationwide, processing of the applications may be delayed.\n\n10:10 p.m.: Judge revives Wisconsin's online voter registration\n\nA federal judge reinstated Wisconsin's online voter registration system late Friday to help people find ways to participate in the April 7 presidential election.\n\nWisconsin stopped allowing people to use the state's online voter registration system Wednesday in accordance with a state law that limits online registration just ahead of an election. But U.S. District Judge William Conley ruled that the online portal must be put back in place because of the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted everyday activities around the globe.\n\n7:30 p.m.: Milwaukee bus driver tests positive\n\nMilwaukee County Transit System officials confirmed Friday that a bus driver tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n“We cooperated with the Milwaukee Health Department to identify other bus operators that may have shared a bus with that individual,” said Dan Boehm, director of MCTS. “Meaning that operator drove for eight hours, pulled the bus over and somebody else got in.”\n\nBoehm said the Milwaukee County Health Department is not concerned about passengers contracting the virus because of a Plexiglas security shield that separates drivers and passengers.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\n6:45 p.m.: Milwaukee police ask for donations of medical supplies\n\nThe Milwaukee Police Department is asking for donations of N-95 masks, coverall safety suits, isolation gowns, goggles, hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes for officers.\n\n\"Each day our officers respond to thousands of calls for service which significantly exposes them to contracting this virus,\" Chief Alfonso Morales said in a video released Friday by the department.\n\n\"We have taken an oath to protect and serve and we take that oath very seriously,\" he said. \"We will not run or hide but we'll be there with you every step of the way.\"\n\nThe department ordered a \"surplus\" of protective equipment last week, but shipments likely will not arrive for several months, Morales said, adding he wanted officers to have the protection they need to continue protecting city residents.\n\nAnyone willing to donate supplies is asked to email supportmpd@milwaukee.gov.\n\n— Ashley Luthern\n\n5:50 p.m.: UW-Eau Claire student tests positive after studying abroad\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Chancellor Jim Schmidt told the campus Friday that a study abroad student tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe student is now \"is in self-isolation and doing well at home with family.\" The university has contacted two other students who were in contact with the student who tested positive. Both are also in self-isolation at home.\n\nNone of the three students came to Eau Claire County after coming back from studying abroad and they did not come into contact with anyone else from campus, Schmidt said.\n\n\"As COVID-19 continues to spread across Wisconsin and more people are tested, we realize there is a chance other Blugolds may be affected by this virus,\" Schmidt said in a message to campus. \"Please know that we are here to support everyone in our community, our students, faculty, staff and alumni. We will get through this together.\"\n\n— Devi Shastri\n\n5:45 p.m.: Officials urge public to report coronavirus fraud\n\nFederal prosecutors on Friday urged the public to report any suspected fraud related to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n“Anyone trying to exploit this national emergency for private gain should know that they will be pursued,” said Matthew Krueger, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n\nHe appointed Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Watzka to coordinate anti-fraud efforts.\n\nKrueger said people with concerns should call the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) hotline, (866) 720-5721, or email NCDF at disaster@leo.gov.\n\nSome examples of what prosecutors expect include: Sales of fake cures, phishing e-mails from entities posing as legitimate public health groups like the CDC or World Health Organization, solicitations for illegitimate charities and malware or ransomware that appears to provide COVID-19 information. The NCDF coordinates complaints with 16 federal agencies, state attorneys general and local authorities.

We appreciate your understanding of this difficult decision.\"\n\nThe university also announced it would close its dorms with the exception of students who have no where else to go. More details on the move-out process were to be sent to students Friday.\n\nUWM, along with all other UW System schools, will provide prorated reimbursements for the cost of housing and food for students who leave.

It said the employee was at home on self-quarantine.\n\nPiatt declined to provide any information about the individual, including the person’s age or job, citing health care privacy laws. He said the individual has not been in the building since March 12 and that he has received no reports of other cases. He said families were provided information from the health department on how to minimize the spread of the virus and what symptoms to look for.\n\nPiatt said the school, which serves about 425 students, was just wrapping up its regularly scheduled spring break and would begin meal distributions on Monday and academic packets starting on March 30.\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n4:40 p.m.: Milwaukee County counts 95 confirmed cases\n\nMilwaukee County had 95 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Friday afternoon, according to an online dashboard.

The concern is to protect against the system being overwhelmed and unable to handle medical emergencies, Weston told the Journal Sentinel Friday.\n\n“We need to be ready to continue to provide that day in, day out rapid response to people in need for these life-threatening conditions that are going to happen,” said Weston, who also is an emergency medicine doctor at Froedtert Hospital. “COVID is here no doubt but heart attacks are here, strokes are here, serious car crashes are here. Those are all still happening.”\n\nWeston said people who have been exposed to COVID but are not showing symptoms should not be tested. He said there have been cases of false negatives where people who actually did have COVID but their “viral load” was not high enough to trigger a positive. Conversely, there have been false positives too, causing unnecessary concern for people who actually don’t have COVID.\n\nWeston said the people who are young and healthy but showing mild symptoms also should not be tested but stay at home to recover.\n\n“What would you normally do with mild flu-like symptoms? Normally you would call into work, sit home, watch a movie. Instead now people are worried about this. The natural reaction is, ‘Oh my gosh, I have COVID, I need to get to the emergency department.'\n\n“With this going on people are scared and it is understandable. This is new. This is unknown.”\n\nAt this time, it is important to remind people that the 911 system and hospitals are reserved for emergencies and the sickest patients, Weston said.\n\n— John Diedrich\n\n3:45 p.m.: Unemployment claims continue to pour in\n\nMore than 45,700 new unemployment claims have been filed in Wisconsin this week as the coronavirus pandemic shut down daily life, according to preliminary data from the state's Department of Workforce Development.\n\nMore than 16,200 people filed new unemployment claims in the state just on Thursday. The numbers of new claims have steadily increased all week as bars, restaurants, malls and other businesses were forced to close in a social-distancing effort to slow the spread of the new disease.\n\nThe 16,200 new claims filed Thursday are more than three times as many were filed in the entire previous week.

Tony Evers urged people to \"only leave your home if it is absolutely necessary,\" but stopped short of issuing a shelter-in-place order, as governors have in Illinois and California. He said he thought Wisconsin could avoid doing so.\n\nBrown, Dane, Milwaukee, Kenosha, Columbia and Walworth counties have now had documented instances of community transmission.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Madeline Heim\n\n3 p.m.: Wisconsin students may not take standardized tests\n\nWisconsin students may get a reprieve from the annual Forward Exams this spring after U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced Friday that her agency would not be enforcing the mandate on assessments as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDeVos said in a statement that her office would grant a waiver to any state unable to assess its students due to the ongoing national emergency.\n\nWisconsin’s Department of Public Instruction said Tuesday that it was “aggressively pursuing” such a waiver. DPI spokesman Chris Bucher said the agency was in the process of submitting waivers related to student assessments, report cards and other federal requirements and that it would keep local districts apprised of any new development.\n\n\"This is obviously a fluid situation with many factors and states involved,\" he said.\n\nIn announcing the decision, DeVos said, students would be unlikely to be able to perform their best in the current environment.\n\n\"Students need to be focused on staying healthy and continuing to learn. Teachers need to be able to focus on remote learning and other adaptations. Neither students nor teachers need to be focused on high-stakes tests during this difficult time,” she said.\n\n- Annysa Johnson\n\n12:05 p.m.: Wisconsin clerks are running out of ballot envelopes as absentee voting surges\n\nWisconsin is running out of the envelopes used for absentee ballots as municipal clerks face a surge of requests to vote by mail in next month’s election because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission estimates clerks are short about 600,000 envelopes for the fast-approaching election. A million envelopes are on their way so clerks can overcome the issue, according to the commission.\n\nClerks are dealing with the issue because absentee voting is skyrocketing as the world wrestles with the pandemic. Health officials have advised people to work from home and Gov. Tony Evers has closed schools, bars and malls to curb the spread of the disease. He has banned gatherings of 10 people or more, though that edict does not apply to polling place.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Patrick Marley and Craig Gilbert\n\n10:59 a.m.: Baldwin, Democrats criticize McConnell stimulus plan as doing too little for workers\n\nWASHINGTON – As the two parties prepared to sit down to negotiate a massive coronavirus stimulus plan, Democrats argued the GOP plan outlined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does too little for affected workers.\n\n“This proposal falls far short of what workers, families, small businesses and our health care system need in direct economic support to get through this crisis,” said Senate Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.\n\nMcConnell’s plan, regarded as an opening offer ahead of talks with the House and the administration, would give individual taxpayers up to $1,200 with additional payments of $500 per child. Lower-income adults who paid no taxes in 2018 would receive smaller payments. Individuals who made more than $99,000 won’t be eligible. The plan also defers tax payments for businesses and individuals.\n\nBaldwin is among at least 18 Democrats backing a plan that would send much larger payments — checks of up to $4,500 this year — to individual Americans. The first payment, of $2,000, would go out this month. Additional payments of $1,500 and $1,000 would go out in subsequent quarters of the year, if certain “triggers” are met, such as an increase in unemployment.\n\nThe payments would be phased out for higher-income Americans.\n\nWisconsin Republican Ron Johnson has not yet weighed in on the McConnell plan.\n\n- Craig Gilbert\n\n10:25 a.m.: Lawyers say a patchwork of court procedures poses risk\n\nWhile courts in Wisconsin's largest counties moved last weekend or sooner to cancel, postpone or limit in-person events, others changed little or adopted a patchwork of differing approaches.\n\nCriminal defense lawyers say that has put them and some clients at unnecessary risk for exposure to or spreading of the COVID-19 virus, and have asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court and Director of State Courts to impose consistent, statewide procedures for all circuit courts, as many other states' Supreme Courts have done.\n\n\"The absence of a coherent common statewide set of procedures is dangerous,\" reads a letter from the Wisconsin Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\n\n\"The lack of such furthers the potential spread of the coronavirus, potentially and needlessly exposing judges, clerks, bailiffs, prosecutors, court reporters, defense attorneys, defendants, jurors and witnesses,\" reads the letter, addressed to Chief Justice Patience Roggensack and Director of State Court Randy Koshnick.\n\nWACDL says most of its members work in multiple counties, often on the same day.\n\nOne unnamed judge, according to the letter, responded to a lawyer's concerns that COVID-19 \"is no worse than the flu,\" and insisted lawyers come to court in person.\n\nIt's not only defense lawyers who have concerns concern. Portage County District Attorney Louis Molepske, president of the state's DA association, told Wisconsin Public Radio that the \"lack of a clear directive from the director of state courts\" has been a big challenge for prosecutors.\n\nThe state court system on March 11 announced it was monitoring the situation.\n\n— Bruce Vielmetti\n\n9:33 a.m.: AmFam, gener8tor to offer emergency program for small businesses\n\nThe venture capital arm of American Family Insurance and Milwaukee-based startup accelerator gener8tor are partnering to offer free one-week emergency programs for small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSmall businesses will be helped to identify, understand and secure resources to withstand the pandemic.

The money announced by Gov. Kay Ivey’s office will help fund four weeks of virtual group therapy for people in 11 counties. Veterans will have virtual, hourlong meetings three times a week to help them deal with PTSD and stresses from the pandemic. Sixty veterans already are enrolled in the program, which is run by Priority Soldier, a nonprofit group that assists veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Services are available in counties including Calhoun, Coffee, Dallas, Lauderdale, Lowndes, Macon, Madison, Montgomery, Talladega, Tuscaloosa and Walker.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A female clinician not known to have allergies had a probable severe allergic reaction shortly after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, a Fairbanks health system reported Friday. The woman began experiencing “a probable anaphylactic reaction” about 10 minutes after receiving the shot Thursday, the health care system Foundation Health Partners said. Symptoms included tongue swelling, hoarse voice and difficulty breathing – “traditional anaphylactic symptoms,” it said. She received two doses of epinephrine at the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital emergency department and was discharged about six hours later, a statement from the health system said. An email seeking comment on the case was sent to Clinton Bennett, a state health department spokesperson. On Tuesday, a female health care worker at Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau was hospitalized for what officials determined was anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist, on Thursday said reports of reactions should be kept in context with the number of people being vaccinated.\n\nArizona\n\nYuma:A warden at a prison that is in the midst of the largest coronavirus outbreak within the state's prison system, has died after being hospitalized over the weekend, the Department of Corrections said. Edwin Jensen was a warden at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Yuma, which houses more than 4,400 incarcerated people near the U.S.-Mexico border. The Yuma County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed Jensen’s death but said it would not be determining the cause of death or making a report because of federal privacy rules. Yuma County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Sam Pavlak said Jensen was hospitalized at Yuma Regional Medical Center over the weekend. More than 600 inmates at the prison tested positive for the virus last week, officials said. More than 1,500 employees have also self-reported contracting the virus since the pandemic began in March and most of the employees at the Yuma prison have said they believe most of the staff had been infected. No official numbers are publicly available.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: More than 4,000 health care workers have been vaccinated with the state’s initial allotment of the vaccine to combat the coronavirus pandemic, according to Gov. Asa Hutchinson. During his weekly radio address Friday, Hutchinson said he expects the number of people who can be vaccinated will increase now that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a second vaccine, this one created by Moderna Inc. Arkansas expected to have the first shipments of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, Hutchinson said. The state received about 25,000 doses of its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine, which were sent to 18 larger hospitals, the Department of Health, and several pharmacies. “We are well on our way to vaccinating thousands of Arkansans, which is the only way we are ever going to beat this virus,” Hutchinson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: California hospitals are fighting to find beds to house patients amid fears the increase of coronavirus cases will exhaust staffing resources. As of Saturday, nearly 17,400 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections – more than double the previous peak reached in July – and a state model that uses current data to forecast future trends shows the number could reach 75,000 by mid-January. More than 3,600 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients were in intensive care units. All of Southern California and the 12-county San Joaquin Valley to the north have exhausted their regular intensive care unit capacity, and some hospitals have begun using “surge” space. Overall, the state’s ICU capacity was just 2% on Saturday. The enormous crush of cases in the last six weeks has California’s death toll spiraling ever higher. Another 272 fatalities were reported Saturday and in the last week nearly 1,600 people died. In hard-hit Los Angeles County, Director of Public Health Barbara Ferrer implored people to stay home as much as possible, not mingle with others outside their household and wear a mask and social distance when around others.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s economic outlook is brighter than previously anticipated in part because of the arrival of coronavirus vaccines, new job creation and strong online sales tax revenue, officials said, potentially providing lawmakers some wiggle room when they craft a state budget during the 2021 legislative session. Two economic forecasts presented to the powerful Joint Budget Committee suggest Colorado’s budget will rebound to prepandemic levels during the next fiscal year that starts July 1, The Colorado Sun reported. Lawmakers might see a surplus of up to $3.8 billion in the next fiscal year, according to forecasts. But the revenue forecasts don’t account for increased demand in government support for residents, businesses and services impacted by the pandemic. The quarterly forecasts from the governor’s office and legislative economists also show Colorado’s key restaurant and tourism industries and low-wage workers are getting left behind, the Sun reported. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has proposed a $1.3 billion stimulus plan that includes checks sent in December to more than 400,000 unemployed residents, future infrastructure spending, and restoring drastic cuts made this year to state spending and to reserves for the general fund, the discretionary portion of the state budget.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Overdose deaths from opioids are on the rise in Connecticut as the coronavirus pandemic has compounded social stressors and increased isolation. Health officials said Friday the state is projected to record more than 1,300 overdose deaths by the end of the year, the Hartford Courant reported. That compares to 1,200 fatal overdoses in 2019. Through October, the state had seen a 13% increase in drug overdose deaths compared to the same period last year. Connecticut has recorded a 300% increase in opioid overdose deaths since 2012, said Dr. James Gill, the state’s chief medical examiner. The data reflected a national trend, the Courant reported. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this week that about 81,000 people fatally overdosed on drugs between June 2019 and May 2020 – a record for a 12-month period. Fentanyl, a highly dangerous synthetic opioid, has been involved in about 85% of Connecticut’s overdose deaths this year, Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, commissioner of the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said at a virtual roundtable discussion. The horse tranquilizer Xylazine also is increasingly showing up in overdose deaths.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:New Castle County plans to use $136 million from its CARES Act allocation to help fund six statewide programs that benefit county residents, County Executive Matt Meyer said. The county will contribute $67.5 million) to the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. Based on actual unemployment claims through mid-September and estimates through the rest of the year, the total statewide amount of COVID-19 unemployment claims paid from March 15 to Dec. 30 will be $273 million. Approximately 55% of the statewide claims are from residents in New Castle County, the county said. The Essential Childcare Program, which provides benefits to child care centers during the pandemic, will get $38 million. Also, the Statewide Testing Program, which provides access to coronavirus testing regardless of symptoms to all residents of Delaware, will get $20.6 million. The Statewide Contract Tracing Program is expected to get $3.1 million, the Enhanced Rent & Utility Program $4.7 million and the Hospitality Emergency Loan Program $1.8 million.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After a shortfall hit the local allotment of new COVID-19 vaccine doses, Washington’s neighboring states pitched in to help make up the difference. In a heartening demonstration of interstate collectivism, Maryland and Virginia are each sending 8,000 vaccine doses, more than tripling the amount available for health care workers in the nation’s capital. D.C. health officials have complained for weeks that the initial allotment formula followed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided Washington with just under 7,000 doses – less than one-tenth of what would be needed for local health care workers. The dosage allotments were based on population, but many of Washington’s health care workers live in the intertwined neighboring communities of Maryland and northern Virginia. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser had sent a letter to U.S. health officials claiming the “one-size-fits-all formula for distribution” would prove “woefully insufficient.” Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Ralph Northam of Virginia apparently agreed, and each state will send 8,000 vaccine doses to D.C. The donations are just the latest indication of the close informal partnership Bowser, Northam and Hogan have pursued for the region since the early days of the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nCocoa Beach:Brevard County residents extracted maximum Christmas bang for the buck by getting trees early to enjoy them for as long as possible to soothe any blues from the coronavirus pandemic. Many told vendors that in 2020, an artificial tree just wasn't as appealing given that they weren't dashing off anywhere, and that that extra bit of cheer and Alpine fragrance seemed so much more necessary this Christmas. The upshot is that trees are in short supply this year. The Christmas tree industry is still reeling from the Great Recession in 2008, when demand sank. It can take a decade to raise a mature 6-foot Christmas tree, and fewer growers have been planting trees in recent years. On Merritt Island, Dustin Grutzik, owner of Wisconsin Christmas Trees, ran out of all but his smallest trees two weekends ago and sold out of his stock on Friday. He had trouble acquiring large trees, he said, because of a slump in tree planting more than a decade ago.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An 18-year-old college student from Loganville was sentenced to four months in a Cayman Islands prison after pleading guilty to violating a strict COVID-19 quarantine mandate in the Caribbean territory, according to several news reports. Skylar Mack and her 24-year-old boyfriend Vanjae Ramgeet were sent to prison last Tuesday after a judge set aside an earlier sentence by a lower court that entailed a $2,600 fine and 40 hours of community service. An attorney representing the couple criticized the punishment as too harsh, although the four months to serve was reduced from 15 months because of the guilty pleas, Cayman News Service reported. “There is no way that it can be right that a custodial sentence is imposed for a first-time offense on an 18-year-old defendant, who entered an early guilty plea,” said Jonathan Hughes, who attributed their actions to “youthful ignorance and selfishness.” The Cayman Islands, a British territory in the Caribbean south of Cuba, are a popular destination for vacationing Americans because of the pristine waters, lavish beach resorts and aquatic activities such as scuba diving, snorkeling and deep-sea fishing. Mack arrived there Nov. 27, reports said. Caymanian guidelines required her to quarantine-in-residence for a minimum of 14 days, according to the country’s Director of Public Prosecutions Patrick Moran. Instead, she went out after only two days and removed a location tracking device from her wrist in order to attend a water sports competition for Ramgeet, who is a professional jet-ski racer. Local police arrested Mack and Ramgeet at the event after observing the couple mingling among the crowd for more than seven hours without masks or social distancing, according to the island newspaper The Cayman Compass and later confirmed in a report by People magazine. In addition to the jail sentence, Ramgeet, who won the jet ski event, was ordered to return the trophy and cash prize and will be banned from competing in several races planned for early 2021. Authorities also required him to write a formal apology to the Cayman Islands Watercraft Association.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Public Safety said an additional 55 inmates and eight employees have tested positive for the coronavirus at the Halawa Correctional Facility, the state’s largest prison. The total number of active cases in the prison now encompasses 325 inmates and 43 staffers, KITV-TV reported. The Department of Public Safety had announced a lockdown and other measures to try to control the outbreak, which initially infected three inmates and 10 staffers last week.The outbreak at Halawa is the third major correctional facility in the state to face coronavirus issues since the pandemic began. The Oahu Community Correctional Center has 450 inmates who test positive and the Waiawa Community Correctional Center in Waipahu has reported 213 cases among inmates. More than 600 inmates from Hawaii have tested positive for the virus at a privately owned prison in Arizona. The state public safety agency said there were still three ongoing cases at the Oahu Community Correctional Center, six at the Waipahu correctional center and four at the private prison in Arizona as of Saturday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An unexpected cut in the number of coronavirus vaccine doses Idaho will receive this week will disrupt distribution plans, a state immunization official said. State Department of Health and Welfare Immunization Program Manager Sarah Leeds said that the state had expected 17,550 but will only get 9,750. “That has some pretty significant implications for our vaccination program,” Leeds said during a meeting of the Idaho COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee. State officials have detailed plans for distributing the vaccine, and will now have to recalibrate. Health officials said the reason for the reduced amount isn’t known. Leeds said the state has received all 13,950 doses they expected last week. Nearly 1,000 people have been vaccinated so far. Health care workers who have direct contact with COVID-19 patients are receiving the initial doses. The vaccine Idaho has received so far is from Pfizer-BioNTech. Officials during the meeting said the state could get another 28,000 doses from Moderna Inc. this week.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A record number of Illinois nursing home residents with COVID-19 died in the past week as people in long-term care try to hold out until they can get vaccinated against the virus. An unprecedented 605 resident deaths were attributed to COVID-19 in the past seven days, state figures showed Friday – far more than the previous high of 480 two weeks ago. The number of recorded new infections in the state’s long-term care facilities also set a record with 5,063, surpassing the previous high of 4,536 from two weeks earlier. This second surge of the virus again exceeds the worst trends of the first wave of cases and deaths in the spring. The toll fell markedly in the summer but has risen again since November, following increases seen in the broader population. The Health Care Council of Illinois, which represents long-term care facilities, issued a statement looking forward to a “turning point” when vaccinations are scheduled to begin in nursing homes Dec. 28.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s daily rate of COVID-19 deaths has continued growing even as coronavirus-related hospitalizations have dropped to its lowest level in a month. The Department of Health’s daily update on Saturday added 73 coronavirus deaths that occurred over the past several days to the state’s toll. Those boosted the state’s seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 deaths to 77 per day after that average was in the low 40s in mid-November and below 10 a day during July. Indiana’s coronavirus hospitalizations and new confirmed infections have slowed in recent weeks following steep increases that began in September and raised worries among health officials about hospitals becoming overwhelmed. Indiana hospitals had 2,932 coronavirus patients as of Friday, the first day below the 3,000 mark since Nov. 16, according to the state health department’s online dashboard. The COVID-19 hospitalizations have declined about 15% since peaking Nov. 30 but remain nearly four times higher than in September.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: Last year, Pastor Brian King delivered his sermon to 3,500 worshippers at Christmas Eve services at Nazareth Lutheran Church. This year, there will be seven live services, with attendance capped at 250 preregistered people per service. Masks are mandatory, and everyone is expected to maintain appropriate physical distancing. A variety of online and televised services also will be offered for members who are uncomfortable attending in person, King said. Doors are still closed to congregations at some Cedar Valley churches, and other churches are open but limiting the number of people at live services. Most churches will livestream or offer prerecorded Christmas Eve services at their websites, and may offer recordings of last year’s cantatas, concerts, celebrations and other sermons to view or download.\n\nKansas\n\nQuinter: The sheriff in Gove County, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, has died of the virus. The Gove County Sheriff’s Office described Sheriff Allan Weber as an “extraordinary public servant” in a Facebook post Friday announcing that he had died. He was transported to the Swedish Medical Center in Denver on Oct. 18 for COVID-19 respiratory complications. The county of 2,636 has recorded 18 deaths, for a rate of about 6.82 deaths per 1,000 residents, which is the highest rate in the state. The county’s emergency management director, the hospital CEO and more than 50 medical staff also tested positive. Shortly before Weber was taken to Colorado, he spoke to a reporter with the Associated Press. Occasionally coughing, he said he had been hospitalized in the past for asthma attacks, but the coronavirus symptoms were more pronounced. “You got body aches and headaches. The tightness in my chest is different,” he said. The county commission imposed a mask mandate starting Aug. 6, when only a handful of cases had been reported, but repealed it 11 days later. Officials subsequently issued a new mandate requiring masks.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said he is using $51.5 million in federal coronavirus funding to provide relief from unemployment costs for more than 1,500 employers. In a news release Friday, the Democrat said those impacted will be public schools, universities, government entities and nearly 1,000 nonprofits. Beshear’s Labor Cabinet said that during the pandemic, the federal government has let states provide relief to employers that reimburse the state 100% on employment claims paid on their behalf, bringing their share down to 50%. Beshear’s action Friday covers the other half owed by the employers. Unemployment charges will resume to contributing and reimbursing employers starting Jan. 1, the news release said. Since the pandemic began, Kentucky has seen more than 1.3 million unemployment insurance claims.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe:Louisiana’s newest member of Congress was admitted to a hospital for monitoring on Saturday, a day after announcing that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Republican Rep.-elect Luke Letlow was admitted as a precaution, spokesman Andrew Bautsch told The News-Star. Bautsch also is fighting the disease, the newspaper said. Letlow, who is from the northeast Louisiana town of Start, was elected earlier this month to the 5th District seat representing northeast and central Louisiana. He is scheduled to be sworn in next month. He had announced Friday that he had been infected by the coronavirus and was in quarantine at home. Letlow was the third high-profile Louisiana politician in two days to say he had been infected. Democratic U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is leaving to become a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s White House staff, and Republican Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser said Thursday that they had tested positive for the virus. Richmond will be a senior adviser to the president and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Two Republicans in Louisiana’s congressional delegation – U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy and U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson – have publicly said they have recovered from the disease.\n\nMaine\n\nSaco: The coronavirus pandemic has been a struggle for much of American seafood, but at least one sector of the industry has found a way to grow during the crisis – the seaweed business. Seaweed harvesting and farming, based largely along the rocky and chilly coast of Maine, has grown for several years as interest in foods and nutritional products made with the gooey marine algae have risen in popularity. Like many pieces of the seafood industry, seaweed is highly dependent on the restaurant sector, which made the pandemic a potentially major setback. But that hasn’t been the case, according to state records and members of the industry. Representatives for Atlantic Sea Farms, a Saco company that works with two dozen seaweed farmers and accounts for most of the seaweed aquaculture in the state, said it nearly doubled its harvest this year to 450,000 pounds. Other growers said they continued harvesting seaweed through the pandemic, though finding workers and buyers was more complicated than a typical year. The industry was able to pivot to selling more of its products via retail locations than restaurants, and that meant it avoided the trouble that befell other seafood industries, such as the hard-hit oyster business, said Tollef Olson, president of the Maine Seaweed Council. The statewide harvest of farm-raised seaweed in Maine grew from about 50,000 pounds in 2018 to about 275,000 pounds last year, state records showed. Atlantic Sea Farms alone thinks its farmers will harvest more than 800,000 pounds in 2021. The seaweed is processed into products such as seaweed sauerkraut and frozen kelp cubes for smoothies. The state’s seaweed industry also includes a wild harvest of rockweed, which is used for livestock feed and fertilizers.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A trade group for Maryland restaurants is suing to challenge local bans on indoor dining during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Restaurant Association of Maryland on Friday filed requests for court orders to have indoor dining restored “as soon as possible” in Baltimore, and Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, the group’s president and CEO, Marshall Weston, said at a news conference. The association also wants to overturn Baltimore’s ban on outdoor dining. Weston said restaurant owners face an “impossible task” of trying to stay open with only carryout service, the Baltimore Sun reported. The association sued two days after an Anne Arundel County judge issued a temporary restraining order lifting that jurisdiction’s ban on indoor dining. Association attorneys claim there is insufficient evidence that restaurants carry a greater risk for COVID-19 transmission than other types of businesses. But public health experts said there are differences that make indoor dining riskier, such as customers removing masks to eat. Gov. Larry Hogan has limited restaurants statewide to 50% of their capacity for indoor dining, but local governments can impose stricter measures.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts expects to receive 20% fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine this year after the federal government reduced its allotment, state officials said. The state joins more than a dozen others that have been told their vaccine shipments will be smaller than planned in coming weeks. Instead of receiving 180,000, Massachusetts now expects to get 145,000. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said he hasn’t received an explanation for the cutback. “We’re certainly frustrated,” Baker said. “We’re working to get clarity on what this means, what happened and how that bump will be dealt with along the way.” Baker said he expects to get more answers during a call with federal officials this week. Despite the reduced allotment, Baker said he expects the state to have “more than enough” doses in the first months of 2021. Vaccine cutbacks in some states have raised concerns about potential delays in shots for health care workers and long-term care residents.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing:Veterinary students at Michigan State University are pleading for a tuition rebate after months of online instruction. The students said they expected a mix of in-person and online courses, but in-person classes were quickly dropped when the fall term began, the Lansing State Journal reported. Lauren Phillip and Breanna Demaline, on behalf of the classes of 2023 and 2024, spoke to the MSU Board of Trustees on Friday, requesting a 30% refund. “We strongly believe our tuition must reflect our current circumstances we are facing and will continue to face if we receive doctorate degrees online,” Phillip said. Students pay more than $100,000 in tuition, she said. Students from outside Michigan pay more. “Even with time to plan, the online course structure has been less than ideal and seemingly very disorganized,” Phillip said. President Samuel Stanley Jr. said a partial refund isn’t practical, noting the university still has fixed costs. He said the change in instruction is “one of the unfortunate casualties of the pandemic.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:A state senator from St. Cloud has died of complications related to COVID-19. Jerry Relph, 76, was the first Minnesota lawmaker to succumb to the virus. Relph was among a number of Republican legislators who contracted COVID-19 after contact with colleagues in mid-November. At the time, Rachel Aplikowski, the Senate GOP spokeswoman, said Relph tested positive after having had close contact with someone in the chamber who had the virus. Relph started quarantine on Nov. 10 and did not attend that week’s special session. He was also excused from a special session this week. In a statement confirming the news of Relph’s death late Friday, his wife, Pegi Broker-Relph, said her husband “dedicated his life to service.” First elected in 2016, Relph recently lost in a close race for reelection against DFLer Aric Putnam. Before serving in the Senate, Relph had a career as a small-business owner and attorney, and previously worked for 3M. Relph served in the Marine Corps in Vietnam. Shortly after the virus hit in March, Relph authored a $21 million COVID-19 response bill to buffer the state’s public health emergency response resources.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The State Department of Health reported1,700 new cases of the coronavirus and 36 additional deaths on Saturday. The numbers come after a week of milestones for the state. On Dec. 8, the number of deaths related to the virus since the beginning of the outbreak in March topped 4,000. On Dec. 9 a record single-day total of cases 2,746 was reported. To date, the state has reported a total of 192,111 cases and 4,390 deaths. Residents, the health department said, should avoid social gatherings that include individuals outside the nuclear family or household. That includes weddings, funerals, sporting events and in-person church services. The rise in cases in Mississippi is part of a trend in new infections sweeping the nation.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A top St. Louis-area health official is warning that doctors and nurses are becoming exhausted as the coronavirus surges and that the tempo gives them “little room to maneuver.” Dr. Alex Garza, who leads a pandemic task force of 22 hospitals, said an average of more than 100 COVID-19 patients have been admitted every day to those hospitals for more than a month. He said they are filling 20% of general hospital beds and 30% of ICU beds, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The hospitals’ intensive care and medical units are about 85% full on average. More than 20 COVID-19 patients are dying every day. “You just can’t maintain this sort of operations tempo at this rate, because it gives us very little room to maneuver. Even the slightest uptick in admissions above what we are seeing as normal now can really tip us into crisis management,” he said. “Beyond that, we can’t keep up this tempo because we are burning our staff out.” Crisis management means doctors have to make difficult decisions on who gets the best care and who doesn’t. “Make no mistake,” Garza said, “we continue to be in the most serious and deadly part of the pandemic.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: More than two dozen people have gathered to protest against COVID-19 restrictions, then said the Pledge of Allegiance and prayed outside Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock’s office in Helena, officials said. Conrad Evarts and the Montana Liberty Coalition organized “The Great Escalation” event and posted it on Facebook, the Independent Record reported Friday. Thirty-two people showed up at Memorial Park on Thursday to peacefully protest before moving up to the state Capitol building. All of the protestors who were approached by the Independent Record declined to be interviewed.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska will get 11,900 additional doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine this week that will be used to treat residents and employees at the state’s long-term care facilities, Gov. Pete Ricketts said. The announcement at a news conference came just days after state officials said they weren’t expecting any shipments from the company this week because of unspecified “logistical hiccups.” Other states have reported similar problems, but Pfizer issued a statement saying it wasn’t having any production or distribution issues. Ricketts said state officials still expect to receive about 32,000 doses of a separate vaccine developed by Moderna, as previously announced. Because of that, he said state officials will hold off on distributing the Pfizer vaccines until the last week of December so they can combine those doses with another expected shipment of 11,900 for use in Nebraska’s hard-hit long-term care facilities. “What we’re going to do is bank them,” he said at a news conference. State officials have identified front-line medical workers and people tied to the long-term care industry as the first groups that need to receive the vaccine. Other groups, such as teachers and meatpacking workers, will also get priority. State officials have predicted that the vaccine will be available to the general public in Nebraska by April.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Restaurants and bars are turning to individual dining tents, food trucks and contactless takeout to survive extended coronavirus restrictions limiting indoor dining. The hospitality industry has been especially hurt by the pandemic, first seeing total shutdowns and then shifting restrictions on capacity and other operations. Amid a surge of reported coronavirus cases hospitalizations and deaths in Nevada, Gov. Steve Sisolak in late November tightened restrictions on casinos and restaurants, which had been operating generally at 50% capacity since the summer. Sisolak ordered them to reduce capacity to 25% or 50 people, whichever is less, and extended the limits until at least Jan. 15. To cope with the new rules as chilly weather has made its way to southern Nevada, one Las Vegas restaurant, Esther’s Kitchen, has expanded into its parking lot in the city’s Arts District with eight cabana-style structures. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported each individual dining tent has floor coverings, lighting, a sound system and a heater. The tents are arranged around a fire pit sitting on artificial turf.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The Currier Museum of Art is planning to close for a month during the coronavirus pandemic, but it will hold its traditional “Noon Year’s Eve” event for children online this year. The museum is closed until mid-January, when it will evaluate whether it’s safe to reopen. “Our region has recently experienced an alarming spike in cases and the Currier Museum is doing all it can to contain the spread of COVID-19 and avoid burdening local health resources,” museum officials said in a news release. “Many museums in Massachusetts and Maine have also temporarily shut their doors as a precaution.” The museum usually has more than 600 guests for its Noon Year’s Eve celebration. Participants in the virtual program this year will get a guided tour of an exhibit called “Open World: Video Games in Contemporary Art,” with performances. Participants also will get art kits to make a pixilation-inspired collage, party hats, festive masks, and bubble wrap fireworks.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The federal government is telling New Jersey to expect thousands fewer COVID-19 vaccines next week and for the rest of the month, though it’s not known why, the state’s health commissioner said. Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said that New Jersey expected to get about 87,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine for this week but instead will get about 54,000, a reduction of 38%. She added that New Jersey was told it would get 273,000 doses for the month but instead will get just 183,000, down 33%. Murphy said he expects there will be an explanation during a video meeting with the White House set for Monday. “I don’t think we’ve gotten a satisfactory reason why,” Murphy said. “It’s nothing personal. Apparently, every American state has received an expectation of a smaller allocation.” Several states have reported smaller allocations. Pfizer, the co-maker of the first vaccine approved for emergency use, has said as far as production goes, nothing has changed. “Pfizer has not had any production issues with our COVID-19 vaccine, and no shipments containing the vaccine are on hold or delayed,” spokesperson Eamonn Nolan said in an email. “We are continuing to dispatch our orders to the locations specified by the U.S. government.” The vaccine was first administered last week in New Jersey on Tuesday. A second vaccine, made by Moderna, was approved for an emergency roll-out Friday night. There have been 2,149 health care workers vaccinated in New Jersey, Persichilli said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Labor officials said local governments have shed thousands of jobs in New Mexico amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Workforce Solutions said the overall statewide unemployment rate has fallen to 7.5% in November, down from 8.1% in October. Payroll employment is down by 58,300 jobs since November 2019, excluding agriculture. Most employment losses are in the hospitality and petroleum sectors, but local government also reduced employment by 6,500 jobs, mostly in public education. New Mexico is delivering relief payments of $1,200 to at least 120,000 unemployed people and offering $100 million in small business grants tied to federal relief money received by the state. An emergency health order continues to require face masks, ban gatherings of more than five people, forbid indoor dining at restaurants and restrict capacity at most businesses to 25% or less.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The number of New Yorkers hospitalized with the coronavirus has risen to the highest level since mid-May, according to state figures released Saturday. Officials said 6,208 people were hospitalized with the virus as of Friday – the largest number in the state since May 15. The state on Saturday also reported 127 new deaths and 9,919 new cases. Still, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York “can see the light at the end of the tunnel” with the arrival of the first vaccines. “If we stay tough and be smart by socially distancing and wearing masks, we can avoid the holiday surge the experts are predicting and finally win this war,” the governor said in a news release. The numbers were announced as Cuomo sent a letter to President Donald Trump calling on the Republican to ensure Congress passes an “urgently needed” relief package with support for not only families but state and local governments. Also Saturday, Cuomo signed an executive order lifting the requirement that low-income senior citizens and people with disabilities must appear in person to renew their property tax exemptions. To claim or renew benefits, eligible seniors and people with disabilities typically line up at city and town halls across New York to file the required documentation, raising concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19.Cuomo’s order allows local governments to automatically renew 2021 benefits for all property owners who received the benefit in 2020 unless local officials believe the person is no longer eligible.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: Judges in North Carolina have announced new procedures for reporters to access hearings less than two weeks after a newspaper publisher was handcuffed and ordered out of a courtroom. The News & Observer reported that Alamance County judges announced the policy after the newspaper and two other news outlets, the Alamance News and Triad City Beat, asked the North Carolina Court of Appeals to force the courts to let in journalists. Friday’s order by the judges said reporters must request permission in advance to attend hearings, and up to five journalists will be allowed in a courtroom. Journalists have been barred from attending recent Alamance County court hearings, even when they requested permission in advance. Courthouse staff cited COVID-19 as the reason for limiting access to victims and defendants. District Court Judge Fred Wilkins barred reporters from attending a plea hearing for Sandra Warren Brazee, a white woman accused of driving her pickup truck at two 12-year-old Black girls. Tom Boney Jr., publisher of The Alamance News, was handcuffed and ordered out of a courtroom as he objected. He was then released. The news outlets’ petition to the Court of Appeals is pending.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Nearly 200 nursing and pharmacy students at North Dakota State University are helping administer the coronavirus vaccine to front-line health care workers over the next several months. The upper-level students have received training to administer the shots at health care systems in the region and are being supervised by faculty members in the clinics, the university said. NDSU Nursing at Sanford Health students were the first to assist in administering the COVID-19 vaccination to front-line workers in Bismarck. In Fargo, NDSU pharmacy and nursing students are assisting Essentia Health and Sanford Health in providing vaccinations to front-line health care workers.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:The state’s supply of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine will be less in the second full week of delivery than initial estimates, the Department of Health said. Previous estimates were about 123,000 doses, but the current allocation is actually 70,200 doses, said Melanie Amato, a Health Department spokesperson. The “allocation for the second Pfizer shipment was lower than previously estimated by our federal partners,” Amato said. Ohio received about 98,000 vaccines last week for hospital workers and nursing home residents. Several other states said this week they have been told to expect far fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in its second week of distribution. The federal government has said there is confusion among the states between planning and training numbers provided in mid-November, and actual allocations, which are only provided the week prior to shipment. Ohio began vaccinating front-line medical workers at 10 hospitals across the state Monday and Tuesday. Vaccinations of nursing home caregivers and residents started Friday at 10 facilities across the state.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Bars and restaurants have effectively won a temporary reprieve from a curfew that has been forcing them to close early since November to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. A state judge sided with a group of bar owners Friday, granting them a 12-day stay on Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt’s order that bars and restaurants not serve food or alcohol on their premises after 11 p.m. “It’s 12 days of freedom,” Daniel Capps, the owner of Redneck Yacht Club and a plaintiff in the case, told The Oklahoman. “It’s the 12 days of Christmas.” Stitt said in a statement that he looks forward to a hearing on the issue and that his order “maintains the right balance between protecting public health and keeping businesses open safely.” District Judge Susan Stallings said the stay only applied to the six plaintiffs in the case, according to The Oklahoman. But Keith Burt, the state’s director of the Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission, told the paper the agency would not enforce the curfew at any bars or restraints until there’s a hearing on the issue Dec. 30.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Multnomah County commissioners have voted to extend the county’s residential eviction ban until July 2, providing assurance that tenants won’t lose their homes even if Oregon doesn’t extend its statewide eviction moratorium past the end of the year. The commissioners voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the ban until July 2, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Friday. State lawmakers are set to meet in a one-day special session this week to consider extending the statewide moratorium and provide aid to landlords whose tenants are behind on rent. Commissioners in Multnomah County – which includes Portland – said they acted urgently because it remains unknown whether the statewide measure will pass this week. The extension retains a six-month grace period for paying back rent, beginning July 2. Oregon’s largest county issued its eviction moratorium in March, at the pandemic’s outset, and extended it in September. The moratorium would have expired on Jan. 8 had the commissioners not acted. As many as 150,000 Oregonians could be behind on rental payments by January, according to a report from the National Council of State Housing Finance Agencies.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh:Local hospitals received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and have begun administering it to front-line workers. UPMC Jameson and Passavant received the vaccine Thursday and began inoculating priority hospital staff by Friday. Heritage Valley Health System also received doses of the vaccine for its front-line workers at the Beaver and Sewickley locations. According to a press release, 975 doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine were received Thursday. Heritage Valley has developed an automated tool that allows individuals to schedule their first and follow-up dose and copy the appointments to their calendars. At UPMC's Jameson location in New Castle, as well as its two Passavant locations in Cranberry and McCandless townships, vaccines were administered first to hospital staff who will be giving out the vaccines to others. Early this week, mass vaccinations are expected for other hospital employees, according to Lisa Lombardo.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A 66-year-old inmate with COVID-19 has died, the state Department of Corrections said late Saturday. The inmate, whose name was not released, died at Rhode Island Hospital, the department said. He “had other complicating comorbidities that likely contributed to his death,” the department said. The man was serving a sentence of life without parole in the maximum security facility at Adult Correctional Institutions since 1988 for the sexual assault and resulting death of a 73-year-old woman, the department said. The department said Friday that there had been 390 confirmed coronavirus cases at the facility, including 331 among inmates and 59 among staff, the Providence Journal reported.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Homeless people infected with the coronavirus or showing symptoms will soon be offered a new place to stay in upstate South Carolina. A 32-bed quarantine shelter will open Dec. 28 near Greenville, United Housing Connections and the Upstate Continuum of Care told the Greenville News. Tim Brown of homeless service ministry Miracle Hill said people have no place to go. “They have no shelter and when they’re starting to feel symptoms, they don’t know what to do,” Brown said. “There’s nobody to care for them. That’s what this facility is all about.” United Housing Connections CEO Lorain Crowl said last week that her group and the continuum were awarded $2 million in grants to develop the shelter. That includes $157,000 in federal coronavirus relief from Greenville County that can be used immediately to start buying supplies. A $1.7 million state grant will pay for staff salaries, support services, food and more. The shelter is a joint effort between United Housing Connections and others. PRISMA Health will provide medical care, oxygen, protective gear and testing. Telehealth consultations will also be available.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of COVID-19 cases in South Dakota over the last two weeks continued to fall compared to the rest of the country. State health officials on Sunday reported 391 cases in the last day, for a total of 94,727 infections since the start of the pandemic. The state that had been among the worst in the country for the coronarius in late summer and fall now ranks 16th for new cases per capita over the last two weeks, according to The COVID Tracking Project. The update showed 11 deaths in the last day, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1,361, of which 415 have been in December. The state is ranked No. 7 per capita at 153 deaths per 100,000 people, Johns Hopkins University researchers reported. Three of the deaths reported Sunday were in Minnehaha County and two came from Lincoln and Union counties. There was one fatality each confirmed in Beadle, Brown, Day and Yankton counties. South Dakota had vaccinated 6,311 residents with the Pfizer vaccine as of Sunday morning.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Gov. Bill Lee disclosed Saturday afternoon that his wife has tested positive for the coronavirus and has mild symptoms and he has tested negative. Lee tweeted that the positive test for his wife Maria was confirmed in the afternoon. “I am feeling well with no symptoms and have tested negative for COVID-19,” the Republican governor wrote, adding, “Out of an abundance of caution, I will be quarantining at the Governor’s Residence and still plan to address Tennesseans about the COVID-19 surge” on Sunday night. Lee wasd scheduled to make a rare prime-time address on Sunday night about the COVID-19 surge.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Texas on Saturday surpassed 25,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, the second-highest total in the country. State health officials reported 272 new deaths, bringing Texas’ death toll to 25,226. Cases of COVID-19 and virus-related hospitalizations continue to rise in the state. On Saturday, the state reported 9,796 people hospitalized with the virus, an increase of nearly 23% over the last month. Officials reported 12,914 new cases on Saturday. That comes two days after the state set its one-day record of new cases – 16,864 – on Thursday. One in every 262 people in Texas tested positive for the virus in the past week, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The increase in cases and hospitalizations comes as state health officials announced Friday that Texas will receive 620,000 more doses of COVID-19 vaccines over the next week. More than 224,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been delivered in Texas. The new round of vaccines will go mainly to front-line health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah is one of more than a dozen states that have been told to expect far fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in its second week of distribution, the state’s health department said Friday. Instead of receiving the expected 23,400 doses, Utah will instead receive 16,575 – 30% fewer doses. The health department said it learned of the lowered allocation Friday afternoon and is working to determine the cause. The federal government has said there is confusion among the states between planning and training numbers and actual allocations, which are only provided the week before shipment. Pfizer has said it has not had any production issues and no vaccine shipments are on hold or delayed. The company said in a written statement that last week it “successfully shipped all 2.9 million doses that we were asked to ship by the U.S. Government to the locations specified by them. We have millions more doses sitting in our warehouse but, as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses.” Utah hospitals began administering vaccinations on Tuesday to front-line health care workers with the highest risk of exposure. There have been 1,347 doses administered this week, according to state data.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont officials are again asking residents to avoid holiday gatherings to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Vermont avoided a feared spike of new cases after Thanksgiving because people largely followed the recommendations to keep celebrations within residents’ immediate households. Although much higher than it was several months ago, the number of new infections being reported in Vermont has largely plateaued, but there is not enough evidence yet that would allow the state to loosen the restrictions, Gov. Phil Scott said Friday during his regular virus briefing. “I understand the emotional need here, but at the same time, we have to take care of ourselves, take care of our families, take care of others surrounding us,” Scott said. For people who do gather, the events should be kept as small as possible, people should wear masks and keep a 6-foot distance from others. People who gather and travel should get tested immediately after and then again seven days later, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said earlier in the briefing. “The fact is we need to acknowledge that some people will choose these higher risk activities,” Levine said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Scientists said that tests of sewage in the Hampton Roads region indicate that coronavirus cases in the area will continue to rise. Raul Gonzalez, an environmental scientist with the Hampton Roads Sanitation District, told WAVY-TV that “wastewater signals right now are higher than they were during our last wave in July.” WAVY reported Friday that samples of sewage are taken each week at local wastewater treatment plants in parts of Hampton Roads and tested for the presence of the virus. The samples are taken to laboratories where genetic material is extracted. “We’re sampling the entire community at once,” Gonzalez said. “We get an idea of whether the COVID-19 are increasing, whether they’re going down, whether they are just plateauing. Right now by the way, we’re definitely increasing.” The findings are passed off to local health departments, as well as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data can also be used to warn officials and medical providers that there could be an influx of patients. “That’s really where some of the strength of this work comes in,” Gonzalez said. Studies are also occurring in Charlottesville, Stafford County and in other parts of the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: As Boeing scrambles to conserve cash in the dramatic aviation downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, CEO Dave Calhoun told nonunion employees last week the company has this month given them shares of company stock instead of pay raises. Boeing said it awarded the stock to about 82,000 employees, excluding executives and those engineers, machinists and others whose pay is determined by union contracts. The stock will vest in three years, on Dec. 14, 2023, provided the employee doesn’t leave the company through that date. However, according to an internal company memo, if an employee is laid off or accepts a voluntary buyout in that period, they will keep a proportion of the allocated shares: one-third if leaving in the first year, two-thirds in the second year and all of the shares in the third year. The amount of shares granted depends on the employment level. According to the internal memo, managers will get 100 shares, which today are valued at about $226 each. Senior nonmanagerial employees get 75 shares, worth almost $17,000; lower-level salaried employees will get 50 shares, worth just over $11,000; and nonunion hourly employees will get 25 shares, worth about $5,600.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Officials said the state will receive about 44% fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this week than initially expected, in line with several other states.“They had some hiccup,” said Gov. Jim Justice about the federal government’s distribution of the vaccine. “I don’t really know what it is. Hiccups are not really permissible when people are dying.” The state expects about 11,700 doses to come in this week, down from 21,000. Pfizer has said its production levels have not changed and the Trump administration has downplayed the risk of delays. Several states have said they are receiving a smaller allotment of doses than first projected, with little explanation for the shift. West Virginia officials said they were informed of their allocation on Thursday. Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, head of the West Virginia National Guard, said he was still optimistic in the state’s drive to vaccinate all long-term care centers within three weeks. An expected 32,600 doses of a second vaccine from Moderna are expected to ship to the state. By Saturday morning the state planned to have administered about 8,000 shots at 50 nursing homes and assisted-living communities. Justice said that about 85% to 95% of residents at homes are taking the shots. But participation drops to about 60% among staff. “That’s not good enough,” he said. “But as far as the residents, we’re doing well.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: The Green Bay Packers honored workers who have been on the front lines caring for coronavirus patients during Saturday night’s 24-16 victory over the Carolina Panthers at Lambeau Field. The team said it welcomed about 250 health care employees, first responders and their families to Lambeau Field. The honorees sat in socially distanced pods, in compliance with Lambeau Field's COVID-19 protocols, the team said. “We are so thankful and appreciative of all they have done for our community during this challenging time,” Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said in a statement. “While we cannot invite large numbers of these special guests due to the pandemic, we want to express our community’s collective appreciation for all their great work.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Some bars in northwestern Wyoming are defying a statewide public health order to close earlier than usual to discourage spread of the coronavirus. They include the Elkhorn Bar and Grill in Meeteetse and Red Zone Sports Bar and Grill in Powell, the Cody Enterprise reported. Public health orders announced by Gov. Mark Gordon on Dec. 7 require bars and restaurants to close from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. through at least Jan. 8. The goal is to discourage people from gathering in situations that make virus spread more likely while stopping short of closing bars and restaurants completely. “This is not an anti-authority grab here for us. This is nothing to do with the local town council, or sheriff deputies, or the Park County sheriff or anything – we respect all those people,” Elkhorn co-owner Magnum Faust said. “This is about this ridiculous mandate.\" The Elkhorn also wasn't enforcing a statewide mask mandate Gordon announced on the same day as the overnight-hours restriction, the newspaper said. Red Zone Sports Bar and Grill, meanwhile, has begun claiming to be a “travel center” in an attempt to be exempted from the health restrictions. “We’ve been charging electric vehicles all summer,” owner James Andrews said. Law enforcement officers have visited both establishments but said they will focus on public education rather than citations to get people to follow the public health orders.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/04/17/police-honor-slain-comrade-nola-jazz-festival-canceled-fedex-delivers-wedding-ring-news-from-arou/111561684/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Gold’s Gym has been temporarily closed during the coronavirus pandemic, but the company announced this week that its three Alabama locations will not reopen after it’s over. The gym at 2300 Berryhill Road in east Montgomery is one of about 30 company-owned locations that the chain plans to shutter. Others include two locations in Birmingham. Gold’s Gym posted a statement on its social media sites that said the closings were related to financial problems caused by the pandemic. “While the COVID-19-related closures have caused us to reassess the viability of some company-owned locations and make the difficult decision to permanently close about 30 gyms, we know that we will emerge from this stronger and ready to grow. This decision affects only company-owned gyms, mainly in our St. Louis, Alabama and Colorado Springs markets, and does not have an impact on any of our franchise-owned gyms,” the company said in a statement. Gold’s Gym has nearly 700 locations in 29 countries. The company posted more information about the closures on its website at www.goldsgym.com/brand-faq.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Nearly half of the 1.4 million cruise ship passengers projected to visit Alaska have seen their plans canceled this year, with the biggest blow occurring this week when two industry giants all but set aside their Alaska seasons over concerns with the new coronavirus. The announcement by Holland America Line and Princess Cruises will leave hotels and motels flashing vacancy signs and owners hoping locals will fill empty tables in restaurants during the height of the summer tourist season. Each passenger spends on average $624 in Alaska during their cruise, according to state estimates, meaning Alaska businesses that survive on the tourism trade will be missing out on more than $433 million this summer. Princess Cruises canceled all Alaska gulf cruises and tours, and said its five wilderness lodges wouldn’t open. Trains and buses also won’t operate this summer. It said round-trip sailings from Seattle to Alaska on two ships, the Emerald Princess and Ruby Princess, would continue. Holland America Line canceled all Alaska sailings for the summer on five large cruise ships and axed overland journeys to Denali and the Yukon. In addition, it will not operate its McKinley Chalet Resort, its rail car or motor coaches. Before the virus changed everything, Ketchikan was expecting 608 port calls this summer from 52 vessels, said Patti Mackey, president and CEO of Ketchikan Visitors Bureau. Now, that count is down to 277 port calls.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe:The Fashion and Business Resource Innovation Center is producing reusable protective gowns for health care facilities throughout the state with material delivered by the Arizona Air National Guard. The Arizona National Guard announced the completion of the mission in a Facebook post on April 10, a day after 20,000 pounds of material arrived on a flight from North Carolina. FABRIC traditionally provides resources for fashion designers and entrepreneurs to make products locally, but recently pivoted to mitigating the shortage of personal protective equipment. The organization obtained certification from the Food and Drug Administration to produce gowns for local health care facilities, and the expedited delivery of materials allowed the production of thousands of gowns to begin earlier than expected. The FDA recognizes four levels of isolation gowns, according to its website, from “Level 1” gowns that are for minimal-risk situations to “Level 4” gowns for high-risk situations. FABRIC is certified to make the first two levels of gowns, and is awaiting approval of a “Level 3” design created with the help of Dr. Ronald Gagliano, the chairman of the department of surgery for Dignity Health in Arizona and a former former Army surgeon.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The federal government has approved Arkansas’ plan to use Medicaid funds to pay bonuses to health workers at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. Officials said more that 26,000 nonphysician direct-care workers at facilities, including registered nurses and home health aides, will be eligible for the payments. “This is extraordinarily good news for those who have been on the front line,” Hutchinson said The governor said he will ask a state panel to approve using some of the money Arkansas is receiving in federal coronavirus relief for similar bonuses for direct-care workers at hospitals and nondirect-care workers at hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRedding:The California Fish and Game Commission unanimously approved emergency measures to allow counties to self-regulate recreational and sport fishing in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The measures from the commission will allow for “surgical and narrow implementation” in helping counties decide fishing regulations, according to California Fish and Game Commission President Eric Sklar and Director Charlton Bonham. Members of the Shasta County Board of Supervisors and Sheriff Eric Magrini were unavailable for comment on the commission’s action. Magrini issued a letter last week to the commission’s Executive Director Melissa Miller-Henson voicing support for the fishing community. He also stated in the letter that law enforcement would be difficult because “it would be almost impossible to differentiate between recreational fishing versus someone seeking a source of food.” Issues have been raised about out-of-state anglers going to Lake Shasta. Oregon has closed fishing and hunting to nonresidents. NorCal Junior Bass Club President Scott Alexander said fishing is needed to fight mental fatigue that has come through the state’s stay-at-home order.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis urged residents to prepare for social distancing as a fixture of life even after restrictions on business activities are eased – at least until a vaccine or cure is found for the new coronavirus. In addition, any easing of stay-at-home orders, crowd gathering bans, business closures and other measures will be gradual, Polis said at a news briefing. To prepare, businesses should consider continued telecommuting where possible, staggered work shifts, barriers between work stations and other ways to contain the virus, he said. Before any rollbacks occur, Polis stressed that more data is needed to determine how effective social distancing has been in Colorado, where at least 357 people have died. Lacking a vaccine – which experts said could take 12 to 18 months to develop – there is no going back to life-as-normal in prepandemic times, the governor said. Polis also emphasized, however, that current restrictions on people’s movements can’t be sustained economically, socially or psychologically.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Soldiers with the Connecticut National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve have begun caring for COVID-19 patients at Stamford Hospital as part of a military effort to support medical staff across the country during the coronavirus outbreak. The soldiers are working in a recently reopened building, which had been scheduled for demolition, on the campus of the 305-bed hospital, said Capt. David Pytlik, a spokesman for the Connecticut National Guard. The medical crews include 85 Army reservists and nine state guardsmen, he said. The Army has deployed about 15 medical units to help with patient care nationwide, including in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. Last week, Connecticut National Guard soldiers and airmen set up 200 beds at Stamford Hospital and tents outside for a triage area. Stamford has been the hardest-hit municipality in Connecticut, with nearly 1,600 of the state’s 14,755 confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The pace at which Delawareans are filing unemployment claim eased significantly last week but was still at record levels. The Delaware Department of Labor reported Thursday that more than 13,250 unemployment claims were filed last week. That’s down from more than 18,800 in the previous week and almost 19,000 in the final week of March. More than 60,000 Delawareans have filed for unemployment benefits since March 15, including more than 30,000 in March. The previous monthly record for unemployment claim filings in Delaware over the past three decades was a little more than 9,600 in January 2002. The huge spike in unemployment claims comes after hundreds of Delaware businesses including restaurants, bars, theaters and fitness centers, were forced to close or severely restrict operations under an emergency declaration by Democratic Gov. John Carney.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:All five of the Whole Foods stores within the city’s limits have employees who have tested positive for the new coronavirus, a company spokesperson confirmed, WUSA-TV reported. WUSA-TV was able to independently confirm six of the cases at the store, which include employees who were last in the store on the following dates: March 27, April 1, April 3 (at least two cases), April 8 and April 9. After asking a Whole Foods spokesperson if “there any other Whole Foods locations in the D.C. metropolitan area that the company is aware has had any employees test positive for COVID-19,” it was revealed all five locations in D.C. proper have employees with positive results. According to a Whole Foods spokesperson, the following stores have “team Members who have been diagnosed with COVID-19”: P Street (Logan Circle); H Street; Foggy Bottom; South Capitol Hill; and Tenleytown.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: More than 180,000 workers in Florida filed claims with the state’s overwhelmed and struggling unemployment system last week, raising the state’s total seeking jobless benefits to more than 500,000 since many parts of the Sunshine State went under lockdown last month. The U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday almost 181,300 Floridians filed for jobless claims, raising the total number of Floridians seeking unemployment benefits over the past three weeks to more than 520,000. And that only counts the out-of-work employees who were able to file for claims. Many of the state’s hundreds of thousands of newly jobless have reported problems with filing applications or getting help from hotlines. They have seen their online applications disappear in front of their eyes when the computer refreshes or they were bumped out of the system while filling out the forms, forcing them to start over. Gov. Ron DeSantis named Management Services Secretary Jonathan Satter to oversee the unemployment payment system after weeks of saying it was turning the corner only to find most progress to be a mirage. “His mission is very simple: Get assistance out as quickly as you can,” DeSantis said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: People who are spring cleaning while at home amid the coronavirus outbreak will soon be blocked from donating to a nonprofit organization in Georgia. Goodwill of North Georgia will stop accepting donations after Saturday, according to a statement on its website. The organization’s 65 stores across 45 counties have been overwhelmed with secondhand items, The Gainesville Times reported. The planned shutdown comes shortly after the group closed its stores last month for two weeks, according to news outlets. That closure was due to public safety concerns from the virus. Stores had since partially reopened and encouraged contactless donations, in which donors would pop their trunks, workers would take out items to be donated and then leave a receipt. Donors who insisted on unloading their own items could do so in a designated area, The Times reported.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State worker unions pushed back at what they said was a proposal from Gov. David Ige to cut employee pay by 20% to cope with a sharp drop in tax revenue brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Ige said at a news conference he was in discussions with unions and lawmakers about potential cuts but no decision has been made. He said the tax shortfalls meant the state needed to cut $1.5 billion from the state budget over the next 15 months. He noted the state has essentially shut down the tourism industry to slow the spread of the virus, which has hammered two major sources of state income: the hotel tax and the general excise tax. Ige said tax increases weren’t under consideration “at this point in time.” The governor said he and members of his cabinet would take a similar pay cut to any taken by employees. Hawaii State Teachers Association President Corey Rosenlee told his fellow union members in an emailed message Tuesday night that it was unclear if the governor intended to implement the cuts as furloughs or as across-the board salary decreases. The reductions could come as early as May 1, he said. He said the proposal was unacceptable. The union represents 13,700 public school teachers statewide. The Hawaii Government Employees Association, which represents 40,000 state and county employees, objected to cuts, especially when workers are on the front lines in the fight against the virus. Senate President Ron Kouchi and House Speaker Scott Saiki issued a joint statement opposing a 20% cut. They urged Ige to obtain better data and analysis before he makes such a decision. Both unions urged the governor to find money elsewhere.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho’s statewide stay-at-home order has been extended through the end of April, Gov. Brad Little said. Little said the extension was necessary to ensure the state continued to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, prevent health care facilities from being overwhelmed and hopefully hasten the end of the pandemic. He said some businesses that were previously considered nonessential, such as flower, jewelry and other retail shops, can reopen as long as they can offer curbside service and ensure social distancing. Little issued an emergency declaration on March 13 and followed with the 21-day statewide stay-home order on March 25. At the time of the order, Idaho had at least 91 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and two known instances of community spread, which means the source of a person’s infection can’t be determined.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: Twenty-two residents and one staff member at a nursing home in Joliet have died of the new coronavirus, a spokeswoman for the facility said. Symphony of Joliet, which reported a total of three deaths as recently as last week, became among the latest nursing homes across the United States to report a spike in the number of COVID-19 deaths. Since a widely reported outbreak at a nursing home in a Seattle suburb gained national attention – an outbreak that has claimed at least 43 lives – the Associated Press has found that more than 3,600 deaths across the country have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Symphony spokeswoman Lauryn Allison said staffing has been adequate and the employees have been following government guidelines for minimizing the spread of the virus. She said they began moving healthy residents from the facility to other locations in its network earlier this month. But a brother and sister of a 65-year-old woman who was one of the 23 to die said the care at the facility was inadequate. “She was complaining that she was in constant pain,” Michael Brooks told the Chicago Tribune after his sister, Diane, died. “Sometimes she would defecate herself without them changing her. We’d come visit her, and who knows how long she was like that.” Brooks and his other sister, Dorisell, said they also saw that Diane Brooks, who needed around-the-clock care after suffering an aneurysm and stroke, also had bed sores. They said that they were never told by anyone at Symphony that their sister had contracted the virus. A call to Symphony of Joliet by the Associated Press on Thursday morning went unanswered.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An Indianapolis Metropolitan Police officer who was fatally shot while responding to a domestic violence call was remembered Thursday during her funeral as a dedicated, compassionate officer and a devoted young mother, with a police chaplain calling her “a beautiful flower that was picked way too soon.” Numerous speakers, including Gov. Eric Holcomb, spoke during the service for Officer Breann “Bre” Leath, 24, which was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in adherence with pandemic social distancing rules that limited Leath’s family and guests to no more than 10 people per speedway suite. Hundreds of police cars lined the track as officers watched a livestream of the service on cellphones and laptops. Officers wearing face masks later stood next to their vehicles, lights flashing, and saluted during a playing of taps that preceded a planned procession through downtown Indianapolis. A funeral procession was scheduled to leave the speedway and travel past police headquarters, the Marion County Sheriff’s Department headquarters, downtown Indianapolis’ Monument Circle and the Indianapolis police East District headquarters before proceeding to Crown Hill Cemetery for burial. Leath was shot to death through an apartment’s door while responding with three other officers to a domestic violence call, police said. Elliahs Dorsey, 27, is charged with murder, criminal confinement and four counts of attempted murder.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City:Gov. Kim Reynolds is ordering residents in northeastern Iowa to stay home for everything but work and essential errands amid growing concern about coronavirus outbreaks at meatpacking plants and nursing homes. Reynolds said Thursday that she is banning nearly all gatherings for social, community, recreational and leisure purposes in the region that includes Cedar Rapids, Waterloo and Dubuque. Previously, the governor banned gatherings larger than 10 people statewide while recommending even stricter voluntary social distancing. Under the new order, Reynolds said residents in the region can only gather with household members, with few exceptions, and must do everything possible to socially distance in public. Violating the order is a simple misdemeanor. The move came after the region’s score increased to 10 on a data tool that the Iowa Department of Public Health is using to guide the state’s response. Reynolds said the region is seeing an “increase of virus activity,” including outbreaks at long-term care facilities and higher hospitalization rates. She confirmed the state suspected an outbreak at a second large Tyson Foods meatpacking plant. She said the state was sending supplies to test workers at the Waterloo facility. Tyson said Wednesday that two workers have died following an outbreak at its Columbus Junction plant, where at least 148 have become infected.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly faced increased pressure from the Republican-controlled Legislature to outline plans for reopening the state’s economy even as she extended a statewide stay-at-home order and prepared to send money to hospitals struggling in the coronavirus pandemic. Kelly is keeping her shelter-in-place directive active for all 2.9 million Kansas residents until May 3, an additional two weeks. It initially took effect March 30 and was to stay in place until Sunday, but Kelly said the coronavirus outbreak might not peak until April 29. Kelly called a teleconference meeting with top legislative leaders to get their permission to purchase another $10 million in personal protective equipment. She also informed lawmakers of plans to provide $17 million in state funds to hospitals to offset losses until aid promised by the U.S. government starts flowing. But more than 40 Republican legislators demanded in a letter that she provide a detailed plan for allowing businesses to reopen, saying “there is no excuse for us not to be prepared to rebuild.” And House Majority Leader Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, admonished Kelly that the aid to hospitals helps only one segment of the economy. Kelly already faces strong criticism from Republicans for limiting in-person worship services and religious gatherings to 10 or fewer people, which GOP leaders see as restricting religious freedom.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A donation fund run by the state that offers help during the coronavirus outbreak has raised nearly $2 million, with more than half coming from a Kentucky Colonels contribution. The Team Kentucky Fund has received funding from about 7,000 donors, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The fund offers financial aid for people adversely affected by the pandemic. The Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels’ commanding general, Hal Sullivan, said the group’s board of trustees approved an immediate $1 million contribution to the fund this week. “Just think how many that’s going to help,” Beshear said during a daily briefing announcing the gift this week. The Colonels are a charitable giving group. “Demands are great and the time is now to step forward,” Sullivan said in a release. The Team Kentucky Fund has a website for donations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The 2020 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival was officially canceled Thursday, the latest economic and entertainment industry casualty in Louisiana’s fight to halt the spread of the new coronavirus. Festival organizers had postponed the festival, which usually spans two spring weekends, until the fall. But they announced on the festival’s website that they would not attempt this year to hold the event. The festival, which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, draws more than 400,000 visitors to the Fair Grounds Race Course for music on multiple stages, a variety of cuisines at dozens of food booths and an arts and crafts fair. The plan now is to hold the 2021 festival during its traditional time, the last weekend in April and the first weekend in May.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two licensing boards that govern Maine doctors are warning that prescribing drugs touted by President Donald Trump for themselves or for family members is considered “unprofessional conduct.” The boards also warned that the combination of one of two malaria drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, along with the antibiotic azithromycin, should not be prescribed as a preventative measure for anyone. A joint statement by the Board of Licensure in Medicine and the Board of Osteopathic Licensure said improper prescribing can harm the supply of drugs needed for COVID-19 patients “and may lead to improper use which can cause patient harm.” The statement comes just days after the Maine Board of Pharmacy issued similar guidance to pharmacists, the Portland Press Herald reported. For weeks, Trump and others have touted the benefits of the drugs to treat symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. There have been anecdotal reports that the drugs are helpful, but there are also serious side effects, officials said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan said the state is beginning to transition more from containment and mitigation of the coronavirus to planning for a gradual reopening of the state and its businesses. Although the number of cases are still rising in Maryland, the Republican governor said there are signs to be cautiously optimistic. For example, the number of hospitalizations appear to be stabilizing and the state has increased its stock of protective equipment and the state’s capacity to care for the sick. Hogan emphasized that people must remain vigilant and continue staying at home and practicing social distancing for now. To drive home the point, the governor said he signed an executive order to require people to wear face coverings in stores and on public transportation. It will be effective 7 a.m. Saturday. He said people might have to become more accustomed to wearing masks in order to safely reopen the state. Hogan said experts have been working on a road map for reopening the state for several weeks. Maryland’s recovery plan will have four critical building blocks, Hogan said. They include the need to expand the state’s testing capability, which already has increased greatly in the past month, he said, as Maryland is on track to more than triple its current capacity up to 10,000 tests per day.. The governor said Maryland also will need to increase its hospital surge capacity by 6,000 beds. Third, the state will need to build on its rising supply of personal protection equipment. Hogan also said the state needs to build a robust contact tracing operation to enable the state to investigate every single positive case of the virus. He said about 250 people are focused on tracing cases, and the state plans to increase that force to at least 1,000 people.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLongmeadow: A World War II veteran and his wife of nearly eight decades who had tested positive for COVID-19 died together on the same day. David and Muriel Cohen died within hours of each other at a Longmeadow nursing home on April 10. Muriel, 97, had tested positive for the virus and David, 102, had been sick but his test results came back negative. The couple decided to remain together even as the Jewish Nursing Home tried to transfer residents who were infected to a separate unit. Fran Grosnick, their daughter, gave the nursing home permission to let her parents stay together. “The only time they’d ever been separated was when my father served in World War II, and when my sister and I were born,” she told The Boston Globe. “Otherwise they were always together.” David Cohen served as a radio operator in the Army during World War II. He was also a liberator at the Ohrdruf concentration camp in Germany. Photos he took during the liberation are displayed at the United State Holocaust Museum in Washington. When he returned to the U.S. after fufilling his service, David became a history teacher in Queens, New York, where he and Muriel raised their two daughters. The couple moved to Longmeadow after retirement to be closer to their children and grandchildren. Grosnick said the last time she saw her parents in person was on March 12, when the facility halted visiting hours. “They did not suffer, and they were together,” she said. “I take comfort in that.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the state’s revenue could drop by $7 billion over the next 18 months, as she urged President Donald Trump to work quickly with Congress to send more federal aid to states and municipalities. In a letter announced late Wednesday, written with other Democratic governors in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, she said revenue could drop by $3 billion this fiscal year and $4 billion the next budget year. State and local governments are being hit with a double-whammy: reduced revenue caused by the coronavirus pandemic’s economic havoc and additional costs of fighting it. They received a total of $150 billion in a federal rescue law, along with added federal payments for state Medicaid budgets, but advocates for states and cities have said it will not be sufficient. Without additional aid, the governors wrote, “the damage to our state economies will be exacerbated by the cuts we know we will be forced to make.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoose Lake: The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota is suing to release inmates endangered by COVID-19 at Moose Lake prison in northern Minnesota. The organization filed a petition Wednesday against the state Department of Corrections. According to a DOC database, 12 inmates in Moose Lake are confirmed positive for the coronavirus and another 31 inmates are presumed positive. The ACLU-MN said at least 11 correctional staff reportedly also have COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The petition alleged the prison is not fulfilling its constitutional duty to keep people in custody safe. The ACLU-MN alleged the prison is still holding as many as eight men in a cell and permitting unrestricted access to showers, communal phones, vending machines and other facilities. The organization said there is no way for people in the prison to practice social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The ACLU-MN is asking a court to immediately release inmates who are bringing the petition, and those like them, to safe locations where they can isolate and get medical treatment, if needed. The Department of Corrections said it has received the lawsuit and is reviewing it. State Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell has said the release of some state prisoners because of the coronavirus could happen as early as this week.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:University of Mississippi Medical Center leaders said physicians and researchers there will conduct several clinical trials on potential treatment options for people infected with the new coronavirus. The clinical trials are in partnership with other institutions and with the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes for Health. The medical center will be one of 44 sites to test hydroxychloroquine, a drug that modulates the immune system and has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. “The goal is to determine if it prevents death and respiratory failure from patients who have COVID-19 if it is instituted early in their course,” said Dr. Richard Summers, associate vice chancellor for research at UMMC. Mississippi remains under Gov. Tate Reeves’s statewide stay-at-home order until at least early next week. Many businesses are closed, and tens of thousands have applied for state unemployment benefits.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said the city’s stay-at-home mandate will remain effective until May 15. Meanwhile, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page said on Twitter that he is extending the county’s order indefinitely but will revisit it in mid-May. Both orders require residents to stay home except for essential activities such as purchasing groceries or supplies or seeking medical care. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said in a Facebook video Wednesday that the city’s order will be extended but a date hasn’t been determined. Jackson County Executive Frank White Jr. was expected to announce Thursday whether his order will be extended. A leader of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force said the St. Louis region has had success in “bending the curve.” But Dr. Alex Garza, during a Wednesday afternoon news conference, warned that relaxing social distancing restrictions too early could cause a second wave of infections, and he said stay-at-home orders should remain in place for at least another month.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Montana hospitals have canceled or reduced elective surgeries to make room for coronavirus patients, cutting revenue and triggering furloughs and layoffs at medical facilities across the state. The Montana Hospital Association, which includes 88 hospitals and other medical facilities statewide, has estimated that canceling prescheduled procedures could cost state hospitals up to $100 million after the first three weeks of the pandemic, the Missoulian reported. “Everything that we did right to prepare our state for a surge pays off in the fact that we have lower mortality than many other states, we have lower hospitalizations,” association CEO Rich Rasmussen said. “But the costs for doing that certainly will be borne out by the hospitals for this period and for some time to come.” A 2019 study found that Montana hospitals contribute $4.7 billion annually to the state economy.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A central Nebraska county with a major meatpacking plant and a lot of nursing homes and manufacturing facilities now has more coronavirus cases than any other county in the state, according to new public health data. Hall County confirmed 278 cases on Wednesday, surpassing the 263 known cases in Omaha’s Douglas County, even though Douglas County has nearly nine times as many residents. Hall County, which includes Grand Island, has seen a spike in cases at the JBS USA meatpacking plant, the McCain Foods frozen appetizer factory, nursing homes and a health clinic. Last week, the farm equipment manufacturer Case New Holland temporarily halted production to protect line workers who work in close proximity. The actual number of Hall County cases is likely much higher because the county has a “very limited” number of tests available, said Central District Health Department Director Teresa Anderson. The Nebraska National Guard helped test people last week, and Gov. Pete Ricketts said members will continue that work this weekend.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Following a last-minute sweep cancellation, the Nevada Department of Transportation has also suspended any major cleanups at homeless encampments until further notice during the coronavirus outbreak. The city of Reno had stopped doing cleanups March 11, citing Centers for Disease Control guidelines. And more than a month after the pandemic was declared a national emergency, NDOT was set to conduct a clean-up Wednesday morning at a bridge on Kietzke Lane, near Fisherman’s Park. The agency issued notices to people camping in the area that they needed to relocate. The notice also warned those who needed to relocate that any items left behind would be disposed of. According to NDOT spokeswoman Meg Ragonese, notices are handed out 48 to 72 hours ahead of the cleaning. But the sweep, which was scheduled at 9 a.m. Wednesday, was canceled at the last minute. Ragonese said NDOT received a request from the Washoe County Emergency Operation Center within the past two days to cease clean-ups. “Clearing encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers,” the CDC said on its website. “This increases the potential for infectious disease spread.” Instead, individuals camping outside should be encouraged to sleep in tents that are at least 12 feet apart.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The impact of the coronavirus in housing, transportation, agriculture and more will be explored by a new subcommittee of the Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery. A stakeholder advisory board will meet by phone Thursday to begin discussing recommendations on relief efforts across New Hampshire’s communities and private industries. The group’s initial members include those representing farms, hospitals, community action programs, ski areas and other industries. Meanwhile, a hearing’s scheduled Monday in a lawsuit filed by Democratic lawmakers who insist the Legislature’s fiscal committee must approve how the state spends $1.25 billion in federal aid.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:New Jersey schools will remain closed through at least May 15 in order to keep people apart to slow the transmission of the new coronavirus, Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday. “I know this is hard. This is hard on all of us,” Murphy said. “But if we all keep working and pulling together, I hope that it will put me in a position in a month’s time to make a different announcement.” Murphy’s decision to keep schools closed for another month came as he named two members of a regional council that will determine how New Jersey and six other Northeastern states will reopen. Jeh Johnson, a former secretary of homeland security, and Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will serve on the council with Murphy’s chief of staff, George Helmy. The May 15 date for school closures should not be read as a possible statewide reopening, Murphy said. Instead, it is what Murphy and his education commissioner “feel is a comfortable enough window for us to be able to get one more shot to reassess” before schools let out for the year in June.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRio Rancho: A Roman Catholic diocese said it will reopen churches and allow a small number of people to attend public celebrations of Mass in what could be the first move to alter a diocese-declared ban on public services in the U.S. Priests were encouraged to hold public Mass at Las Cruces Diocese parishes while having parishioners abide by social distancing restrictions ordered by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, diocese spokesman Christopher Velasquez said. That means churches can only hold Mass with five or less people in attendance and they must stay 6 feet apart, Velasquez said. “If you show up to your parish without calling first, you might be turned away,” Velasquez said. The diocese also announced it would allow priests to hold outdoor Mass services while people stay in their cars. The Santa Fe Archdiocese and Gallup Diocese – New Mexico’s other Catholic dioceses – are continuing a ban on gatherings and in-person Mass services. Las Cruces Bishop Peter Baldacchino made the decision about the limited opening of churches after hearing news reports about the spread of COVID-19 in southern New Mexico, Velasquez said. “We are hearing reports about divorces, drug abuse and now people losing their jobs,” Velasquez said. “The church is here to offer hope.” The Catholic News Agency reported Baldacchino is the first in the nation to modify a declared diocesan ban on public Masses.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state will extend its stay-at-home restrictions at least through May 15 amid signs the initial wave of the coronavirus outbreak is slowing. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that transmission rates still need to be tamed as he prolonged the restrictions that have left most New Yorkers housebound. The number of people hospitalized statewide has ticked down to around 17,000, far below initial projections. But there are still close to 2,000 newly diagnosed people coming into hospitals daily, Cuomo said. New York recorded 606 COVID-19-related deaths Wednesday, the lowest daily number in more than a week. “This is still continuing at a really tragic, tragic rate,” Cuomo said at a press briefing. The governor said the requirement for New Yorkers to wear face coverings when people are out and close by other people starting Friday will also help fight the outbreak.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A delivery driver arrived just in the nick of time to a beach wedding with a crucial piece of the ceremony. Savannah Kulenic and Dylan Perkins planned to get married April 10 in Hawaii, but their dream wedding was curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic, WNCN-TV reported. So, the lovebirds organized a last-minute beach ceremony with a total of five people on the special day last week. The company making the groom’s wedding band had been shuttered by the virus outbreak, but said the day before the wedding that it could overnight the ring, Kulenic said. One problem: The wedding was scheduled for 3 p.m., but the ring wasn’t expected to show up until 4:30. The bride had the photographer, Amy Shores, leave a note on her door for the delivery driver telling him to come down to the beach, saying: “You have the ring.” FedEx driver Joe Engel answered the call of duty, marching down the sand to hand deliver the package during the ceremony. The handoff was captured on camera by Shores, owner of Seaside Topsail Photography, and shared in a Facebook post. “You know with all of the bad going on, there are still good people in the world, and in the end, love wins,” Shores said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Federal officials said they are prohibiting recreational use of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. The closure comes as the state reported 28 new coronavirus cases, bringing the state total to 393. The number of cases reported Thursday was the most since the first case was confirmed on March 11. The National Park Service said the park is closed to visitors until further notice. The park is the state’s top tourist attraction, drawing more than 700,000 visitors annually. The park closure comes a day after Gov. Doug Burgum extended an order to keep most businesses closed until at least the end of the month.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Some Ohio businesses could begin reopening after May 1 as long as proper precautions are taken amid the pandemic, Gov. Mike DeWine said. Social distancing, the cleaning of surfaces, frequent hand-washing and mask wearing must continue, he said. DeWine said he understands the importance of getting the economy moving again, but Ohio must be careful to avoid problems such as future COVID-19 spikes after society has reopened. The state will keep a close eye on supplies of personal protective equipment like gowns, masks and face shields, and also on testing, the governor said. “If we don’t do it right, the consequences are horrendous,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt said he is looking to reopen shuttered businesses as the curve is flattening in the number of coronavirus cases in the state. A ban on elective surgeries will be lifted April 24, Stitt said, and his Safer at Home order that shut down nonessential businesses and banned gatherings of more than 10 people expires six days later, although he is extending the order to the elderly and those most vulnerable to the virus.“We are working on plans to reopen our state, but let me be clear, we’re not out of the woods yet,” Stitt said. Social distancing and safety measures such as frequent hand washing should continue, Stitt said, and that he is conferring with state health officials on reopening businesses such as restaurants, barber shops and museums. Stitt said he is basing his decision on a decline in the number of hospitalizations during the past two weeks.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Weekday traffic on the four major interstates in the Portland area is down 46% from levels last year, according to a report compiled by the state Department of Transportation. Interstates 5, 405, 84 and 205 are seeing significant traffic declines, and the freeways are only becoming less congested as the weeks stretch on amid a stay-home order issued by Gov. Kate Brown to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Traffic on weekends is down even more precipitously, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. According to Oregon Department of Transportation’s first COVID-19 monitoring report, released April 10, the largest decreases occurred initially on highways and freeways to the coast and mountains. The report looked at the change in traffic patterns in the past month, starting with the week schools closed, then subsequent weeks under the stay-home order as well. I-5 is seeing the most significant declines of metro-area freeways. The average weekend traffic was down 64% for the most recent full week of data available (March 30-April 5).\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Many commercial buildings that serve the public will be required to make sure customers wear masks – and deny entry to anyone who refuses without a medically valid reason – under an order signed Wednesday by the state health secretary. Employees will have to wear face coverings, too, including those who work in warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other places that remain in business but aren’t open to the public. The mask mandate was included in a wide-ranging order that will govern many aspects of how a business operates – from how it arranges its break room to how many patrons it can allow inside at any one time – as the administration of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf confronts a pandemic that has killed at least 647 in Pennsylvania and sickened thousands more. Wolf said the latest order is meant to protect supermarket cashiers, power plant operators and other critical workers who can’t stay home and are at heightened risk of contracting the new coronavirus. Wolf is ratcheting up pressure on retailers, warehouses and other establishments to enforce social distancing guidelines and minimize the virus’ spread just as majority Republicans in the state Legislature seek to ease his administration’s shutdown of businesses it doesn’t consider “life sustaining.” Wolf previously closed schools and nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A 19-year-old man has set up a program to help coronavirus patients who aren’t allowed to receive visitors while in the hospital stay connected to their loved ones. Kaya Suner helped establish the covidconnectors.org website that collects donated iPads, tablets and other devices that are distributed to patients. Suner got the idea from his parents, both emergency physicians, who told him of the need for devices to helped patients stay in touch with family. Suner’s effort drew a shoutout from Gov. Gina Raimondo, who called him a “superstar”at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday. Raimondo said her son donated an iPad to the program and Amazon has donated more than 500 tablets. The devices have been used for last rites, celebrating an anniversary, meeting a newborn grandchild, a goodbye to a family member and church services.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAnderson:Gov. Henry McMaster said he believes the risks from the coronavirus pandemic will diminish enough by late June so that businesses and activities “may be safely resumed and conducted using personal safety precautions.” The Republican governor offered that assessment in a letter to leaders of the GOP-controlled General Assembly. In the letter, McMaster offered to call legislators into a special session before the fiscal year ends on June 30 so that they can pass a stop-gap budget measure to keep state government operating. Senate President Harvey Peeler said he is looking for a faster return. “I, like most South Carolinians, hope that our state and our legislature can be back at work much sooner,” Peeler said in an email statement. McMaster is facing mounting pressure from lawmakers in both parties to curtail some of the steps that he has taken during the pandemic that led to soaring unemployment claims in South Carolina. Three Republican legislators from the Upstate sent McMaster a letter last week urging him to let shuttered businesses reopen. This week the top Democrat in the state House of Representatives called for elective surgeries to resume at hospitals and the reopening of public boat ramps.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Federal health officials hope to take the first steps toward getting a Sioux Falls pork processing plant and coronavirus hot spot back up and running. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has staff in Sioux Falls touring the Smithfield Foods, Inc. plant. They are assessing conditions and developing an action plan needed to safely reopen the hog harvesting facility that has been shut down for nearly a week, according to Gov. Kristi Noem’s office. Noem said Thursday that the state expects to have a report from the CDC in the coming days, and that will be released to the public. The governor also said she has been in close contact with the plant’s CEO, as well as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. Smithfield Foods did not grant a request by the Argus Leader to join the tour, saying nonessential visitors are barred from entering the plant during the shutdown. “Nearly 600 Smithfield employees in Sioux Falls have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic started, with an additional 135 confirmed cases tied directly to the plant. That prompted the company last week to announce a three-day closure to clean the plant. However, after cases continued to surge there, Noem and Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken called for the plant to be shut down for 14 days. On Sunday, Smithfield said it was closing the plant indefinitely. That has caused worry among public officials as well as farmers and food consumers as the closure will choke the nation’s meat supply.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee has ended months of work setting up its rules for an online-only sports betting law that passed last year and has yet to see its first wager. The Tennessee Lottery board’s vote Wednesday via teleconference because of the coronavirus pandemic highlights a bigger question: Will there be any games to bet on once sportsbooks are ready to go? “I believe today that we’re ready to finally adopt all of the rules, regulations and processes so that we can be ready for sports wagering in Tennessee, when sports resume in Tennessee,” lottery board chairwoman Susan Lanigan said before Wednesday’s vote. Although there still isn’t a clear picture of when pro and college sports could restart after the global pandemic subsides, Tennessee’s sports betting timeline isn’t set in stone yet, either. Sports betting operators and other vendors now need to go through the licensing application process, among other administrative check-offs.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A federal judge has reluctantly denied a motion to allow Harris County judges to release some county jail inmates on no-cost bonds as officials try to reduce jail populations because social distancing is nearly impossible behind bars. Attorneys for inmates had wanted relief from an executive order by Gov. Greg Abbott that prevented state and county judges from releasing people accused or previously convicted of violent crimes on no-cost bonds. The attorneys said they want to lower the jail population to protect inmates and staff during the coronavirus outbreak emergency, calling it “a matter of life and death.” U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal clearly wrestled with the case.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Dozens of residents gathered Wednesday for a walk to protest the state’s closures of businesses and facilities because of the coronavirus crisis. St. George resident Larry Meyers created a Facebook group to organize the event to “assert our God-given, Constitutionally-protected rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, religious freedom, the right to contract, and the right to use our property as we see fit so long as we do not harm others” according to Meyers’ original post in the group. Meyers said he has received input from members of the community who felt that their rights have been taken away and that Gov. Gary Herbert and local officials should lift the coronavirus-related restrictions on businesses and other organizations. Meyers said the goal of the walk was not to cause conflict but to signal to Herbert that the economic impact of the coronavirus restrictions is stark enough that Utahns want to see the rules lifted so they can continue to support their families and exert their freedoms.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Vermont’s congressional delegation said the state’s 10 airports will share more than $9 million in grants to support them during the COVID-19 outbreak. U.S. Sens. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, an independent, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch said the flight cancellations caused by COVID-19 are having a severe impact on the state’s airports. The bulk of the money, $8.7 million, will go to the Burlington International Airport in South Burlington. Other grants range from $20,000 to $69,000 and will help the airports to meet operating expenses, continue current construction projects and fulfill ongoing needs.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A shipbuilding company will start running two shifts instead of three to fight the spread of the coronavirus, officials said. Newport News Shipbuilding announced the shift change Wednesday, news outlets reported. Spokesman Duane Bourne said the change doesn’t involve layoffs and will take effect on May 4. The shipyard is also extending its liberal leave policy until May 18. Shipyard President Jennifer Boykin said the policy change was a safety measure to reduce “close personal contact” with workers, which would make social-distancing easier while continuing to run operations. The shifts will be from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. In between the shifts, the shipyard will clean high-traffic and high touch-point areas as another effort to reduce spreading the new coronavirus. A total of 23 people who work at the shipyard have the virus and are now in quarantine, The Daily Press reported.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia:Gov. Jay Inslee said that social distancing efforts in the state have been successful in “flattening the curve” of the coronavirus outbreak and that if the trend continues, the state should be able to transition away from the broad restrictions that have been imposed since last month to more targeted efforts to protect vulnerable populations. He said for industries like construction, it was possible they can be phased back in sooner if the curve continues going down dramatically. Several groups, including the Washington State Building and Construction Trades Council, and the Associated General Contractors of Washington, sent Inslee a letter this week asking for the resumption of projects that had started before governor’s stay-at-home order was put in place last month. Inslee said they were working with the construction industry “to figure out protocols to get back to full construction” but said he couldn’t give a time frame on when that will happen. The stay-at-home order, which has been extended once, is in place through May 4, though Inslee has warned that it is possible the order might have to be extended again. Part of the equation is if the necessary testing and contact tracing is in place by then.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University will be holding all of its summer classes online because of the coronavirus crisis. The college said it was also lowering fees for the online summer courses to help students who might be struggling financially. “We hope students who may be on the fence about summer school will decide that this is the time to take advantage of a cost savings and the convenience of online courses,” said Jaime Taylor, provost and senior vice president of academic affairs. The online courses will be held from May through August. The only classes that will be offered are those that can be held entirely online.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers closed all K-12 schools for the remainder of the academic year and extended Wisconsin’s stay-at-home order to May 26, keeping most nonessential businesses shuttered until after the Memorial Day holiday weekend to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Evers said the effort to date has saved between an estimated 300 and 1,400 lives, but it wasn’t safe to reopen everything in the state. He did loosen some restrictions, including allowing golf courses to reopen as of 8 a.m. April 24. “Folks, we’ve saved lives together,” Evers said. “At the end of the day, my bottom line is keeping people safe and we’re not out of the clear just yet.” News of the extension comes amid growing criticism from conservatives who are pushing Evers and some other governors to loosen restrictions. Opponents of the order planned a rally at the state Capitol on April 24, the end date of the original order. “Extremely disappointed with the governor’s extension,” tweeted Republican state Rep. John Jagler, of Watertown. “Its effects on our economy will be crippling. You don’t have to be unemployed to be safe.” Other Republicans were more harsh. Rep. Barb Dittrich, of Oconomowoc, called Evers a “tyrant” and Rep. Shae Sortwell, of Gibson, said he had crossed “the boundary from chaotic and arbitrary to lawlessness” and said Evers would be sued. Before the order can be lifted, there needs to be a “massive” expansion of testing, more contact tracing to determine the spread of the virus and additional public health measures to prevent another wave, Evers said. Evers also loosened restrictions starting April 24 on nonessential businesses, allowing them to make deliveries and have curbside pickup available. That includes arts and crafts stores making material available to produce face masks and other personal protective equipment. Libraries will be able to make books available for curbside pickup. Lawn care services are allowed, as long as the work is done by just one person.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: An international competition to capture carbon dioxide from a Gillette-area power plant and put it to profitable use has been suspended because of the coronavirus crisis, the Gillette News Record reported. Like much of Campbell County, the state and nation, the Integrated Test Center has been closed while travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have stymied teams of researchers, said Jason Begger, executive director for the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority, which manages the ITC. Finalists in the $20 million NRG COSIA Carbon XPrize competition are in a crucial phase of the contest where they were either moving their research modules or preparing to move them to the ITC at the Dry Fork Station power plant north of Gillette, Begger said. After years of research, development and construction for most was finally to begin as they tested their technologies using flue gas from the plant this spring and summer. Now that research is on hold for however long before coronavirus-related restrictions are lifted, said Marcius Extavour, executive director for the Carbon XPrize.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/12/reformed-hermit-seized-tiles-fuming-superintendent-news-around-states/118141068/", "title": "Reformed hermit, seized tiles: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state expert on infectious diseases in children is urging school systems to listen to health organizations regarding masks in schools, saying he fears what lies ahead with the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus. Dr. David Kimberlin, co-director of UAB and Children’s of Alabama’s Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, told reporters Tuesday that the delta strain is highly contagious and spreading at the same time students are returning to classrooms. Kimberlin said he supports in-person learning, and the “best practice is undoubtedly to have mandatory masking in schools.” He urged people to take the recommended precautions including wearing masks indoors and getting vaccinated against COVID-19 if eligible. “The delta variant has changed the game,” Kimberlin said. “This virus is the real deal. It does cause severe disease in children. We are ill-advised to take it lightly.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Alabama Department of Public Health and others have recommended mandatory masks in schools. Alabama is leaving the decision to local districts. A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey last month said the Republican has been clear there will be no statewide mandates and trusts “school officials to make the best decision possible.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State law enforcement agencies failed to collect DNA samples from more than 21,000 people arrested for or convicted of certain crimes over the past 25 years, in part because of confusion caused by changes to Alaska law, officials said. The state Department of Public Safety identified 21,577 individuals who were required to have a DNA sample on file but did not. Of those, 1,555 are dead, the report says. Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Tuesday announced plans for the state to pursue samples in the remaining cases. It’s not clear, though, how long that process might take or how many might successfully be gathered. The state plans to begin with those convicted of a class of felonies that includes violent crimes and sex crimes. That group is smaller than 600 people, KTOO Public Media reports. A 1995 law first required the collection of DNA samples from people convicted of these felonies. The law has been changed eight times, expanding those covered. Deputy Attorney General John Skidmore said the revisions have contributed to the failures. Skidmore said there had been confusion over who should be involved in the DNA collection. And changes to the law added challenges “in terms of trying to figure out what’s supposed to be collected when,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Arizona State University on Wednesday announced the school will require masks in certain indoor settings such as classrooms and labs regardless of vaccination status to combat the spread of COVID-19. An ASU policy statement said other settings where masks will be required include “close-quarter environments where physical distancing may not be possible,” such as facilities that serve the general public, meeting rooms, workshops, production and design studios, and any indoor areas designated by posted signage. “Additionally, consistent with CDC guidance, face covers may be required in some crowded outdoor settings or activities that involve sustained close contact with other people,” the policy statement said. The school continues to recommend that students and others wear masks at all times indoors. While state budget legislation enacted last June and signed by Gov. Doug Ducey bars schools districts from requiring mask-wearing, a separate provision dealing with higher education does not include a broad ban. Instead, that provision only prohibits universities and community colleges from issuing mask-wearing requirements affecting only unvaccinated students.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations hit a new record high for the second day in a row Tuesday as a surge in coronavirus cases continued to overwhelm its health system. The state Department of Health said there were only 12 intensive care unit beds available in the entire state. “Everybody has to realize, this is not a good time to get sick because space is limited,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said at his weekly news conference. Arkansas, where the vaccination rate is low, ranks third in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to numbers compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. Hutchinson said the state is working with the state hospital association to free up space and noted that lawmakers approved a plan to use $129 million in federal virus relief funds to aid hospitals. The Republican said the state is also looking at suggestions from a federal “surge response team.” Project Manager Jeff Tabor of COVIDComm, the state’s system for matching COVID-19 patients with hospitals, said the latest surge is worse than over the winter “because we don’t get the sense that it’s letting up.” The surge has been straining health care workers. University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson said some nurses have walked off in the middle of their shifts because they can’t take it anymore.\n\nCalifornia\n\nGreenville: The state’s largest single wildfire in recorded history continued to grow Wednesday after destroying more than 1,000 buildings, nearly half of them homes, as historic drought conditions have left lands parched and ripe for ignition. Burning through bone-dry trees, brush and grass, the Dixie Fire has destroyed at least 1,045 buildings, including 550 homes, in the northern Sierra Nevada. Newly released satellite imagery showed the scale of the destruction in the small community of Greenville that was incinerated last week during an explosive run of flames. By Wednesday morning the Dixie Fire, named after the road where it started July 14, covered 783 square miles and was 30% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. At least 14,000 remote homes were still threatened. The Dixie Fire – the biggest single fire in California history and the largest currently burning in the U.S. – is about half the size of the August Complex, a series of lightning-caused 2020 fires across seven counties that were fought together and that state officials consider California’s largest wildfire overall. The fire’s cause was under investigation. Pacific Gas & Electric has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Several of the city’s trendiest restaurants are joining other dining establishments and bars in requiring employees and customers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. KUSA-TV reports the latest include the Bonanno Concepts group of eateries, which will impose the requirement Sept. 30. The group operates Mizuna, Luca, Osteria Marco and other establishments. Chef and proprietor Frank Bonanno noted that masks were required and that customers had to sign health declarations when his restaurants reopened last year after a temporary closure. “For our restaurants that are mostly reservations, you sign a health declaration, and if you want to lie to us and come in, yeah, you could be that person. We’re not going to fight you; we’re not going to be the police on this,” he said. “It just seems like it’s the right thing to do.” The Triangle Denver bar, Bar Max and To the Wind Bistro are implementing or have implemented similar policies, asking patrons to present vaccination cards, KUSA reports. With delta variant cases surging and hospitalizations rising, Denver is mandating that all city employees and private-sector workers in high-risk settings be fully vaccinated Sept. 30.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, a top Democrat in the General Assembly, is calling for all state and municipal employees – including teachers, professors and police officers – to be required to get COVID-19 shots. Refusing to get vaccinated is not a right under public workers’ union contracts, Duff said. “There’s no bargaining in my opinion,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s the right thing to do.” Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has said he’s willing to consider requiring state employees to get vaccinated or possibly face weekly testing, saying it’s an issue he wants to discuss with state employee union representatives and the General Assembly. “It’s really important for us to continue to beat the drum of people getting their vaccines, to continue to educate folks, but also have a firm hand and say, ‘Yes, we need to mandate these vaccinations,’ ” Duff said. “Because without that, it continues to put our state and country in harm’s way.” Duff, who lives in Norwalk, said he also believes day care staff and all health care workers should be required to be vaccinated, while medical offices should disclose whether their staff members have gotten their shots. Last week, Lamont directed that all employees of long-term care facilities receive at least the first dose of a vaccine by Sept. 7.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic Gov. John Carney is imposing a mask mandate for all public and private school students and staff in the state effective next Monday. The indoor mask requirement announced Tuesday applies to everyone kindergarten-age or older, regardless of vaccination status. The mandate also extends to child care homes and centers for everyone kindergarten-age and older. Child care centers and homes are strongly encouraged to require masks for children as young as 2 years old. Carney’s office said the mask requirement will be formalized later this week and is consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Carney also said state employees and visitors to Delaware government facilities must wear masks indoors starting Monday. Additional COVID-19 vaccination and coronavirus testing requirements for state employees and others are expected to be announced in the coming days. While the mask mandates apply regardless of inoculation status, Carney said that “vaccination remains the best way to finally put an end to this pandemic.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Several area venues will start requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to attend events later this month, WUSA-TV reports. According to posts on the venues’ Facebook pages, anyone attending events at The Anthem, Merriweather Post Pavilion, Lincoln Theater or 9:30 Club will be required to show proof of inoculation against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test from 72 hours prior to the event. Attendees must also bring a photo ID. Accepted proof of vaccination includes showing a physical vaccine card or a photo of the card. The requirement will start Sunday. “We can’t wait to enjoy the return of live events with you shortly,” the venues said in a shared graphic on social media.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Doctors say they’re seeing many more coronavirus infections among children just as students begin to return to classrooms. There has been “an enormous increase” in COVID-19 cases among kids in July and August at Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ronald Ford said. Most of those children have been treated in emergency rooms and sent home, but “those that are admitted are sicker than what we’ve seen before, and many of them are requiring care in our intensive care units,” Ford said. About 20 coronavirus-positive children sought treatment at the South Florida hospital’s emergency department in June, he said. “That number went to well over 200 in July, and, even at this point in the month of August, we are already up to over 160. So we’re well on the way to breaking July’s record,” Ford said. On Tuesday, the hospital had nine patients admitted with COVID-19, with five in the ICU, Ford said. Ford’s advice to parents sending their children back to school: Get information from authoritative sources. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there about COVID-19, about testing, about the vaccine,” Ford said. “The best thing you can do to protect your child is to keep them away from the virus.” Masking works, reducing the incidence of transmission and chance of children getting the virus, he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is telling business leaders that crime is “the most significant threat” to the state’s future, keeping up his emphasis on the issue as he seeks reelection in 2022. The Republican, speaking to the Georgia Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday in Columbus, said chamber members have a responsibility to publicly advocate against crime and for ways to decrease it. “Simply put, if crime is rampant on the streets of your local community, businesses will look elsewhere, workforces will leave, visitors won’t show up, and investment will stop,” Kemp said in a speech broadcast by video. The governor has used Atlanta as a frequent target in his discourse about crime but acknowledged Tuesday that “it is a also a challenge facing many of our communities across Georgia.” Ahead of 2022 elections, many Republicans are trying to make the case that voters shouldn’t trust Democrats on crime, a continued reaction to efforts by a few Georgia Democrats to limit police funding as part of the Black Lives Matter protests and an increase in deadly shootings in Georgia and many other states. Georgia state government has traditionally had a limited role in fighting crime, with most of the responsibility falling to local sheriffs, police departments and district attorneys.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Big Island residents whose homes were destroyed or damaged during a 2018 eruption of the Kilauea volcano are selling their properties to the county. The first phase of Hawaii County’s Voluntary Housing Buyout Program saw 284 applicants out of 294 eligible residences identified by the program, Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The county will pay the 2017 value of the property up to $230,000. No one has received a payout yet, and the process for each applicant should take about six months, said Doug Le, Kilauea recovery officer. The program is funded by $83.8 million in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Community Development Block Grants. An additional $23.7 million in HUD grant funds is pending and will be directed toward the project.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An emergency trap-and-truck operation of Idaho-bound endangered sockeye salmon because of high water temperatures in the Snake and Salmon rivers netted enough fish at an eastern Washington dam to sustain an elaborate hatchery program, wildlife officials said Tuesday. Idaho Fish and Game officials captured 201 salmon at Lower Granite Dam last month that are now at the Eagle Fish Hatchery in southwestern Idaho. In all, more than 600 sockeye salmon reached Lower Granite Dam this year. More than 400 passed the dam to attempt the final leg of the journey to central Idaho unaided – a 45-day trip on average. About 100 are expected to survive. Two have arrived so far, the first on Saturday. “I’ve been really pleased with the success that we’ve seen through trap and haul,” said John Powell, a fisheries research biologist with Fish and Game. “It’s really amazing that we also have fish that are able to make it all the way back (to central Idaho) given the temperature and flow conditions that they experienced this year.” Water temperatures in some areas have surpassed 75 degrees, lethal for salmon. Fish arriving in central Idaho will also be taken to the Eagle Fish Hatchery to join the 201 trapped at the dam. Some will be spawned at the hatchery, and others will be released into Redfish and Pettit lakes in central Idaho to spawn naturally.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: More than 90,000 Chicago-area homes and businesses remained without power Wednesday morning following severe overnight thunderstorms that came one day after at least seven tornadoes touched down in parts of northern Illinois. As of 7 a.m. CDT, about 96,000 Commonwealth Edison customers remained without power – with most of those in Cook, Lake, McHenry and Kane counties – after a Tuesday storm raked the area with wind gusts of up to 70 mph, according to the utility. Residents in Evanston and Plainfield reported extensive tree damage, while about 6,000 customers lost power in Evanston, where there were reports of malfunctioning street lights, traffic signals and street flooding, National Weather Service meteorologist Ricky Castro told the Chicago Sun-Times. The weather service said a survey crew had confirmed Tuesday that at least seven tornadoes touched down Monday in northern Illinois, with three of those storms given preliminary ratings as EF-1 tornadoes, which produce winds between 86 and 110 mph. Three of the other tornadoes were weaker, and the strength of the seventh storm had not yet been determined, according to the weather service, which said Monday’s storms damaged trees and some structures in portions of Ogle, DeKalb, and Kane Counties.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal judge ruled Tuesday that several of the state’s laws restricting abortion are unconstitutional, including a ban on telemedicine consultations between doctors and women seeking abortions. The judge’s ruling also upheld other state abortion limits that were challenged in a broad lawsuit filed by Virginia-based Whole Woman’s Health Alliance in 2018 as it fought the denial of a license to open an abortion clinic in South Bend. U.S. District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker issued a permanent injunction against the telemedicine ban, along with state laws requiring in-person examinations by a doctor before medication abortions and the prohibition on second-trimester abortions outside hospitals or surgery centers. Barker also ruled against state laws requiring that women seeking abortions be told that human life begins when the egg is fertilized and that a fetus might feel pain at or before 20 weeks. The state attorney general, whose office has been defending those laws in court, said Barker’s ruling contradicted higher court decisions and pointed toward a possible appeal to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. “We will continue to fight to defend Indiana’s commonsense abortion laws and to build a culture of life in Indiana,” Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A group of animal rights and public interest groups filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the latest Iowa law designed to criminalize investigations into animal treatment on livestock farms. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, alleges violations of First Amendment free speech rights. It asks the court to declare the law unconstitutional and issue an order preventing officials from enforcing it. It is the third attempt by Republican lawmakers in the state to outlaw farm investigations. The law signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds in June makes trespassing at a food operation an aggravated misdemeanor that carries up to two years in prison and a fine of $8,540. A second offense is a felony that carries up to five years behind bars. Those are far harsher penalties than trespassing elsewhere, a simple misdemeanor that carries up to 30 days in jail and a fine of $855. Lawmakers say they increased the penalties for trespassing at livestock operations to protect farmers from harassment and deter intrusions that threaten the safety of the state’s multibillion-dollar agriculture industry. A law passed in 2012 was struck down as unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2019, and the state appealed that decision.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state has committed to expanding mental health services to help move more than 600 people from adult care homes into their communities, advocates and state officials announced Tuesday. The promises to improve services over the next eight years result from a 13-page agreement among two state agencies and five organizations. The agreement heads off a potential lawsuit by the organizations and follows a Disability Rights Center of Kansas report in 2019 alleging that the state violated the federal Americans with Disabilities Act by keeping people in adult care homes unnecessarily. “They have known this has been a problem for decades,” said Rocky Nichols, the center’s executive director. The agreement involves 10 homes known as Nursing Facilities for Mental Health. The state denies that the homes’ operations violate Kansas or federal law, but advocates said a lack of services and case workers prevents people from leaving them for less restrictive living. The state expects to spend $450,000 a year on additional staff and training, but advocates said it’s not clear how much more it will spend on services. Laura Howard, the state’s top disability services official, on Tuesday hailed the agreement as “progress for individuals” living in the homes.\n\nKentucky\n\nScience Hill: Parents in Pulaski County received an earful Tuesday, when they began receiving voicemails calling Gov. Andy Beshear a “liberal lunatic” for enacting a mask mandate in the state’s schools amid the coronavirus’ latest concerning surge. A voicemail reportedly sent by Science Hill Independent School District Superintendent Jimmy Dyehouse said: “As you already know and probably have already heard, this liberal lunatic that we have up in Frankfort has signed another executive order mandating masks for all students and adults in school. What this means is the professional opinion of your superintendent doesn’t matter. The opinion of your school board doesn’t matter.” The comments came in response to Beshear’s announcement Tuesday that he was enacting the mask requirement for all Kentucky schools. The voicemail continued: “And you as parents, your opinion doesn’t matter because I know exactly how you all feel about your children wearing masks. And believe me, I’m as frustrated as you are over this. Starting in the morning, all students will have to wear masks on the bus and inside the building, as well as adults inside of our buildings will have to be masked tomorrow. We’re hoping this will be fought in court this week, and we’ll get this overturned. I’ll let you know as soon as I hear something further. I’m sorry. Thank you.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: An English professor and folklorist at a historically Black private university will become Louisiana’s poet laureate Saturday. “It is such an honor to represent my home state. It is something I never thought would happen,” Dillard University professor Mona Lisa Saloy said in an interview Tuesday, after Gov. John Bel Edwards and the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities announced her appointment. She succeeds John Warner Smith, who was on the endowment’s nominating panel. “Dr. Mona Lisa Saloy beautifully captures the culture and essence of Louisiana in her mesmerizing poetry,” Edwards said in a news release. “She understands the importance of using art to preserve our stories and pass them down for generations.” Saloy has taught at Dillard since 1991, working in the city where she grew up. Her students have included Jericho Brown, who won last year’s Pulitzer Prize for poetry. “He would laugh. He would pen me what he thought was trash, but I could see the gems. I hope I encouraged him to believe in his creativity,” Saloy said. “And he took off. He was going to be a lawyer. I asked him, ‘What are you going to do with this gift?’ It was unmistakable and moving.” Saloy also has brought in major grants for and expanded Dillard’s English and creative writing programs, according to the news release.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Retailers in the state sold $9.4 million in adult-use cannabis products in July – 45% more than the previous month. Business owners credit the boom to summer tourism, the July Fourth holiday, a larger array of products and falling prices, the Portland Press Herald reports. Sales for recreational marijuana have increased each month since the market first opened in the state last October. The average price of smokable marijuana, called flower, has fallen from $16.68 per gram at market launch to $12.90 per gram, the newspaper reports. That is largely because more growers and manufacturers have been licensed, leading to greater supply and more diverse products. Also for the first time, July sales in recreational marijuana essentially matched sales of medical marijuana in the state. The Maine Office of Marijuana Policy said it collected $943,500 in sales tax revenue from recreational marijuana sales in July and about $3.8 million total since the market opened.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The groundwater of at least nine military installations near the Chesapeake Bay is contaminated with high levels of toxic fluorinated “forever chemicals,” according to a report Wednesday by an environmental group that cites Defense Department records. The Environmental Working Group’s report focuses on installations along the bay and concerns about contamination mostly from chemicals in firefighting foam containing PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. They are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down in the environment. The group said it’s the first time an analysis of the concerns has been conducted publicly at military sites across the nation’s largest estuary, whose large watershed includes the six states of Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York. The bay also is troubled by pollution from nitrogen fertilizer runoff and other pollutants. The EWG report notes that records show PFAS may be present in groundwater at several other installations near the bay, where the Defense Department has not tested to confirm the presence of chemicals. For years, the military used a film-forming foam in training to fight aircraft fires. The department no longer uses foam with the chemicals for firefighting training, unless it can be contained.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is getting nearly $860 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to help maintain services and jobs as the pandemic drags on, federal transportation officials said Wednesday. The funding for the Boston-area public transit system is part of more than $30 billion for public transportation included in the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in March. “Public transportation has been a lifeline for communities and the American people throughout this pandemic,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. The T will use the ARP funds, along with previous COVID-19 relief funds, to balance its operating budgets into the beginning of the 2024 fiscal year, a T spokesperson said. “The funds are necessary to plug the massive revenue shortfalls due to significantly lower ridership (and lower fare collections),” the T said in a statement. Ridership on public transit systems across the nation has plummeted during the pandemic as people either lost their jobs or were asked to work from home.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Former U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Tuesday that she will not run for governor in 2022, putting an end to speculation about the former Trump administration Cabinet member and partner in one of the state’s most influential Republican couples. “I am not running for governor,” DeVos told The Detroit News, which reported the announcement first. “It’s not going to be me. I appreciate that some folks are interested in that, but I think the rumor and interest really only serves to highlight how desperate Michiganders are for new leadership.” Advisers to DeVos, 63, said she never weighed a campaign to challenge Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, despite weeks of chatter in Michigan’s political class. Though a billionaire able to finance a campaign and former state party chairwoman with key connections, DeVos would have faced complications in a Republican primary and the general election. Despite four years on former President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, DeVos quit her post a day after the deadly U.S. Capitol siege in January, blaming the defeated president’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen for inflaming tensions as Congress prepared to certify the 2020 presidential election. DeVos would also be the face of her husband Dick’s decadelong effort to curb union power in the manufacturing state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A judge ordered Tuesday that jurors should remain anonymous for the case against a former suburban Minneapolis police officer charged in Daunte Wright’s death. Former Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter, who is white, fatally shot Wright, a 20-year-old Black motorist, on April 11. She’s scheduled to go on trial Nov. 30 on a charge of second-degree manslaughter. The city’s former police chief said he believed Potter meant to use her Taser instead of her handgun. Hennepin County Judge Regina Chu ruled Tuesday that court personnel and attorneys involved in the case shall not divulge the names or other identifying information about the jurors and alternates except to a very limited number of people. She said the court won’t release the jurors’ names and contact information until sometime after the trial. Jurors will be referred to in court only by their numbers. Under Chu’s order, deputies will keep people away from the jury during the trial during the day, and they’ll be fully sequestered during deliberations. Leita Walker, an attorney for a coalition of news media organizations, said the anonymity restrictions are similar to those imposed by Judge Peter Cahill during this year’s murder trial of ex-Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted in the death of George Floyd.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: This month’s Mississippi Book Festival has been canceled amid concerns of contagion from the latest surge in coronavirus infections. “Authors were very uncomfortable traveling, and we didn’t want to take any chances,” the festival’s executive director, Holly Lange, said Wednesday. “We did not want to be a superspreader event and put any more stress on the hospital system.” The free event was to have been held Aug. 21 inside and outside the state Capitol and at nearby Galloway United Methodist Church in downtown Jackson, with than 180 authors signed up to speak during 48 panel discussions. Scheduled speakers had included novelists Kiese Laymon and Ellen Gilchrist; historian Lonnie G. Bunch, who is secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; and former Time magazine editor Walter Isaacson, who is now a history professor at Tulane University. Among the topics this year were panels on civil rights, the Gulf South, Afrofuturism, cooking and young adult fiction. Lange said some author panels will have online presentations instead. The 2020 festival was also canceled because of the pandemic, but past festivals have attracted thousands of people.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Only 35 of the more than 70,000 people who attended Garth Brooks’ concert in the city Saturday took advantage of a chance to get a COVID-19 vaccine, the Kansas City Health Department said. The mobile vaccination clinic operated for four hours in the Arrowhead parking lot before the concert, and fans were offered a chance to get upgraded floor seats to the concert if they were inoculated. Brooks, who has said he is fully vaccinated, had encouraged his fans to get the shots. Maggie Green, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City manager’s office, said the 35 people vaccinated Saturday were in addition to 333 shots the health department administered at events and clinics last week, KCUR reports. She said the health department will continue to partner with community events to increase vaccinations, including at the upcoming Planet Comicon Kansas City, scheduled for Aug. 20-22.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: All state employees will be required to return to work in person Sept. 7, even as Montana faces a surge in coronavirus infections. The Department of Administration announced the return-to-work mandate in an email to government workers Friday, the Montana State News Bureau reports. It came as health officials reported 493 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, the highest number tallied in a single day since January. The seven-day average – just above 200 cases per day – is similar to that seen last February. The email from department director Misty Ann Giles encouraged employees to get vaccinated and to stay home if they’re feeling sick. The memo also noted that rapid testing will be available, although it doesn’t specify any requirements for testing. Most state employees are not required to wear masks at work. COVID-19 vaccinations are not required of state employees, and vaccination rates in Montana remain below the national average. Less than half of eligible residents are fully inoculated. Of those hospitalized with the virus in June and July, nearly 90% were unvaccinated.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s largest public school district will require students to wear masks indoors when they return to classrooms next week. The Omaha Public Schools board voted 8-1 Monday to require all people to wear masks indoors at school, effective Tuesday. The resolution made note of recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending universal masking for all teachers staff, students and visitors to K-12 schools in an effort to fight the growing spread of COVID-19 cases, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The resolution won’t require masks to be worn outdoors or while eating and drinking. Teachers and staff may also shuck the mask if they’re alone in their classrooms or offices. “We have an issue in this country with a variant,” board member Tracy Casady said during the Monday meeting. “Until we can get a handle on it, I think this is the best possible solution we can do in our community to try to get our kids back in school and keep them there.” Board member Spencer Head was the lone vote against the mask resolution and tried unsuccessfully to have the mask mandate sunset Oct. 18 unless the board took action before then to extend it. Districts including Lincoln, Grand Island, Ralston and Westside are also requiring face masks when school starts this fall.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Taxable room revenue generated by hotels and motels in Washoe County has rebounded to pre-COVID-19 levels. In fact, the Reno-Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority said the $45.2 million reported in June is the second-highest total monthly total ever recorded. It was topped only by $46.7 million reported in August 2019. “Seeing the destination thrive during a challenging time speaks volumes about where Reno-Tahoe is headed,” said authority President and CEO Charles Harris. “The most significant indicator from June is the fact that we had more occupied rooms in Reno-Tahoe than we did in June of 2019.” KOLO-TV reports that due to the March 2020 pandemic shutdown of Reno-Tahoe’s major resort hotels, the RSCVA is emphasizing statistical comparisons to 2019. Prior to the record monthly total in August 2019, the previous highs were $44.4 million in August 2018 and $44 million in August 2017.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: An off-the-grid man’s days living as a hermit appear to be over amid an outpouring of support from people in the community and across the country. “River Dave,” whose cabin in the woods burned down last week after nearly three decades on property that he was ordered to leave, says he doesn’t think he can return to his lifestyle. “I don’t see how I can go back to being a hermit because society is not going to allow it,” David Lidstone, 81, said in an interview Tuesday. He said even if he could rebuild his cabin, “I would have people coming every weekend. … I’ve hidden too many years, and I’ve built relationships, and those relationships have continued to expand.” A logger by trade who chopped his firewood and grew his food in the woods along the Merrimack River in the town of Canterbury, Lidstone initially built the cabin with his estranged wife, though he said they are still married. He said he’s not grieving the loss of his life in isolation. “Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life,” said Lidstone, who drifted apart from his family. “I grew up never being hugged or kissed, or any close contact. … I’ve never loved anybody in my life. And I shocked myself because I hadn’t realized that. And that’s why I was a hermit. Now I can see love being expressed that I never had before.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a suspect’s recorded phone call made from a police station can’t be used as evidence against him and a friend because they weren’t notified it was being monitored. The case involved a Middlesex County man arrested in 2018 after fleeing a traffic stop. In a call from the Piscataway police station, he told his girlfriend to look for a weapon at his residence, according to police, who used the phone call to file charges against the two. In a 7-0 ruling, the Supreme Court wrote Tuesday that the call can’t be used as evidence because no notice was given that it was being recorded. “Few would dispute that an arrestee has a lesser expectation of privacy within the confines of a police station,” the court wrote. “A police station, however, is not a constitution-free zone.” The state had argued that the two had no reasonable expectation of privacy because it’s common knowledge that police station phone calls are recorded. Denise Alvarez, an attorney who argued as a friend of the court on behalf of the defendants, called the ruling “a privacy win” that reaffirms the right to be free from government officials “arbitrarily prying into our personal conversations.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Universities and colleges across the state appear to be getting COVID-19 shots to young people at higher rates than the general public. With and without mandates, leaders of colleges and universities say they’re on track to increasing vaccination rates on campuses to levels far higher than their surrounding communities. The state’s largest public universities announced vaccine mandates last week, requiring virtually all students and staff to be inoculated by the end of September, a few weeks into the fall semester. The University of New Mexico system, the state’s largest, said it’s already vaccinated 48% of students, higher than the state average for the 18-24 age group, which is 42%. People traveling to campus who opt out through medical or religious exemptions must undergo regular coronavirus testing. In the state’s rural, conservative southeast, one Christian college says it’s having success vaccinating students without a mandate. “I suspect we’ll probably be 80% to 90% vaccinated by the time the term starts,” said University of the Southwest Dean Ryan Tipton. That’s an ambitious goal in Lea County, where the adult vaccination rate stands at 43%.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced his nominees to lead high-profile U.S. attorney offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Biden picked Damian Williams for the top spot in Manhattan’s Southern District of New York and Breon Peace to head Brooklyn’s Eastern District of New York. Both men are Black, and Williams would be the first Black person to run the Manhattan office. Both offices have been involved in attention-getting investigations and prosecutions. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District in 2018 oversaw the prosecution and subsequent guilty plea of Michael Cohen, at one time the personal lawyer of former President Donald Trump, on campaign-finance violations and other charges. In the Eastern District, the office is overseeing the investigation of Tom Barrack, the chair of Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that he secretly lobbied the U.S. on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. Williams is currently chief of the securities and commodities task force in the Southern District office, where he oversees more than 20 prosecutors. Peace worked in the Eastern District office from 2000 to 2002, under former Attorney General Loretta Lynch when she was the U.S. attorney there. The nominees must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed ahead Tuesday with legislation that would repeal the state’s century-old practice of requiring residents to obtain a permit from the local sheriff before buying a handgun. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted to recommend the measure, which passed the House three months ago. The bill must clear one more committee before reaching the Senate floor. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who has supported gun restrictions in response to the mass shootings of recent years, is likely to consider vetoing the bill if it gets to his desk. The bill is opposed by the gun-control group North Carolinians Against Gun Violence but has the backing of the gun-rights group Grass Roots North Carolina and the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association. For years, the association had opposed eliminating the permit requirement. But now the process has become duplicative because the federal background checks that licensed gun dealers conduct have become more robust, association lobbyist David Ferrell told the committee. Bill supporters say the federal checks effectively reveal problems with potential gun buyers, such as involuntarily commitments for mental health, or substance abuse treatment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWatford City: Authorities say fires involving three oil wells in McKenzie County were brought under control over the weekend after they had burned for 16 days. Crews put out the fire at the first well northeast of Watford City last Tuesday and extinguished the final well Saturday, said Beth Babb, a spokesperson for Petro-Hunt, the company operating the well pad. An inspector from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality was headed to the site to talk with personnel and do a visual inspection, The Bismarck Tribune reports. An early estimate Petro-Hunt provided the state indicated 4,200 gallons of oil and 4,200 gallons of produced water spilled in the incident. Produced water, also known as brine or saltwater, comes up alongside oil and gas in wells. State officials believe any fluids that spilled either burned up or were contained. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but the blaze began at one of the wells and then spread to the other two, all of which are on the same well pad. Bill Suess, who has worked for Environmental Quality since 2008, said he could not remember another oil well fire in North Dakota that burned for as long as this one.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The city is tied for first in the nation for how quickly homes sold in July, according to a new report that also hints at some relief ahead for central Ohio home shoppers. According to Realtor.com, Columbus-area homes sold in a median of 17 days last month, tied with Denver; Nashville, Tennessee; and Rochester, New York, for the fastest pace in the U.S. Homes in the Cincinnati area sold in 30 days, and in Cleveland they sold in 36 days, both faster than the national average of 38 days, according to the report. Despite the frenzied pace for home shoppers, the report also found more Columbus-area homeowners are sticking for-sale signs in the yard. The number of homes listed in the area jumped 43% in July over a year ago, by far the biggest jump in the country and well above the U.S. average of 6.5%. “July housing trends show a market still working its way back toward some version of normal,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale said in a news release. “New listings grew at an unusually high rate for the summer months, further helping the inventory crunch.” Hale noted that many of the new listings tend to be smaller homes. “Still, if these changing inventory dynamics continue, we could see a wave of real estate activity heading into the latter part of the year,” she said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Two siblings who survived the Tulsa Race Massacre are going to visit Africa for the first time, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Viola Fletcher, 107, and 100-year-old brother Hughes Van Ellis are scheduled to fly to Ghana on Friday and return Aug. 21, accompanied by family members and others. The all-expenses-paid trip to Accra is being co-sponsored by Our Black Truth, a Virginia-based social media platform, and the Diaspora Africa Forum in Ghana, the Tulsa World reports. “We are sending out our treasures to, just for a moment, share them with the motherland,” said state Rep. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa. Organizers have arranged for the siblings to meet President Nana Akufo-Addo, as well as Ghanaian tribal chiefs and other government officials. They also plan to visit the Diaspora Africa Forum embassy and will take part in a traditional naming ceremony, during which Fletcher will be honored as a queen mother and Van Ellis as a chief. “From the moment they touch down in Ghana, they are going to be treated like celebrities, like royalty,” said Michael Thompson, who will accompany them on the trip. “They are really rolling out the red carpet for us.” The siblings are two of three known survivors of the 1921 massacre. Lessie Randle, 106, declined an invitation for the trip but said she’d be there in spirit.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A new set of gates will further limit access to the Little North Santiam Canyon and Opal Creek area and stay in place at least through the summer of 2022, Marion County officials said this week. The narrow river canyon east of Salem and northeast of Mehama, often known as the North Fork, has been closed to visitors since March, following extensive damage from the Beachie Creek Fire. The latest move will mean only residents and their guests will be able to drive into what was once among Oregon’s most popular recreation destinations. Before last year’s wildfires, the North Fork and Opal Creek area was a popular place to hike, swim, kayak and camp that could see upward of 5,000 people visiting on a hot weekend, according to Forest Service data from 2020. The decision to shut the area down with gates came for multiple reasons, Marion County spokeswoman Jolene Kelley said. The area remains dangerous, and despite the earlier closure and signs threatening $2,000 fines, people have been trespassing into the area on a regular basis this summer, officials said. The Marion County Sheriff’s Office issued 237 warnings or citations to people trespassing into fire-burned areas this summer.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A rural, Republican-majority county board on Tuesday accused a state senator of creating “unnecessary chaos” in pushing for a detailed review of how the county collected and counted votes in former President Donald Trump’s reelection defeat last year. The three Tioga County commissioners all read portions of a statement at a board meeting urging state Sen. Doug Mastriano to reverse his demand that Tioga and two other counties turn over election records and equipment to the Intergovernmental Operations Committee he chairs. “It is time for Sen. Mastriano to withdraw his demands and to let responsible Republicans get back to work on subjects such as recovering from COVID-19, addressing the opioid crisis and the ‘help wanted’ issue,” the statement said. Mastriano said a week ago that he expected to have a committee vote within two weeks on his proposal to subpoena the elections material from the vote last November as well as from the May primary. There are indications he may face opposition from fellow GOP senators; so far he has not issued the public notice required for a committee to vote. The statement said Mastriano “began his one-man quest with a false accusation” that not agreeing to his demand would indicate the county has something to hide.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has systematically and repeatedly failed to protect women from rape and other sexual misconduct, according to a federal class action lawsuit filed recently by four current and former female students. The suit, filed Friday in Providence federal court, alleges the Ivy League school actively prevented the reporting of incidents of sexual violence and perpetuated a culture of silence on campus. One of the women said she was advised against making a formal complaint after being sexually assaulted at a party hosted by rugby team members because it happened off-campus, where officials said it would be more difficult to hold someone accountable. Another said the university found her alleged assailant responsible for her sexual assault but then named him a speaker at the school’s commencement ceremony while he was appealing the case. The woman said the university overturned his assault finding and sanctioned her after she went public with her concerns about his role in commencement. The male student ultimately didn’t speak at graduation. Kim Evans, one of the lawyers representing the women, said Monday that the women’s experiences dealing with university administrators are particularly shocking given they come years after the #MeToo movement sparked a global reckoning on sexual misconduct.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An Anne Frank Center is opening at the University of South Carolina that will be the first museum in North America and fourth in the world where visitors can walk through the famed story of the teenage Holocaust victim. “The Anne Frank Center at USC is unlike anything the university has ever done before,” interim university President Harris Pastides said during an announcement ceremony Tuesday, according to news outlets. “Through the eyes of this little girl – who still lives, I would argue – we can change the world.” The 1,060-square-foot center on the Columbia campus features a rendering of the attic where the girl’s Jewish family hid from the Nazis for more than two years during World War II. That exhibit includes a reproduction of the desk where Frank wrote what was eventually published as “The Diary of a Young Girl,” which has been translated into 70 languages. While the museum shares the history of the Holocaust, it also tells Frank’s story through the lens of the American Jim Crow and civil rights eras. A reference is made to Black U.S. track star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, according to The Post and Courier. The tour also mentions the story of Emmett Till, a Black teenager who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The number of injury crashes has risen this year at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. As of Wednesday’s report, there had been 62 crashes at the rally, with 36 involving injuries. Last year there had been only 33 injury crashes reported by the rally’s fourth-day report. There has been just one fatal crash this year. The data comes from a department press release about South Dakota Highway Patrol citations connected to the event. Among the injury crashes was an incident in which a bighorn sheep was struck by a motorcycle on Highway 385 in Deadwood. While arrests for driving under the influence have been lower in 2021 compared to the previous year, Wednesday’s data showed DUI arrests on the rise with 74 arrests made thus far. Last year there had been 82 DUI arrests by the fourth day’s report, according to the data. Drug arrests continue having the biggest gap in numbers compared to the previous year. In total there have been 154 drug arrests, 45 fewer than 2020’s 199 arrests, according to the data. Citations are up by 131 this year, with 865 citations given. Warnings are up by a larger number, with 2,340 given compared to the 1,774 from last year’s rally, according to the data. The 81st annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally officially started last Friday and spans 10 days, formally concluding Sunday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Officials say the state saw a lower rate of decline in tourism spending than the country as a whole in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Tennessee Department of Tourist Development said the state had $16.8 billion in domestic and international travel spending last year in a report from the U.S. Travel Association and Tourism Economics. That’s a 31.6% decline from the previous year, compared with a 42% drop for the nation at large. The numbers coincide with efforts from Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s administration to drum up tourism amid the pandemic. The approach has also drawn critics who think the state isn’t doing enough to fight the pandemic.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Officers of the state House of Representatives delivered civil arrest warrants for more than 50 absent Democrats on Wednesday as frustrated Republicans ratcheted up efforts to end a standoff over a sweeping elections bill that stretched into its 31st day. But after sergeants-at-arms finished making the rounds inside the Texas Capitol – dropping off copies of the warrants at Democrats’ offices and politely asking staff to tell their bosses to please return – there were few signs the stalemate that began when Democrats fled to Washington, D.C., in July in order to grind the statehouse to a halt was any closer to ending. The latest escalation threw the Legislature into uncommon territory, with neither side showing any certainty over what comes next or how far Republicans could take their determination to secure a quorum of 100 present lawmakers – a threshold they were just four members shy of reaching this week. Democrats, who acknowledge they cannot permanently stop the GOP voting bill from passing in Texas, responded to the warrants with new shows of defiance. Refusing to attend legislative sessions is a violation of House rules – a civil offense, not a criminal one, leaving the power the warrants carry to get Democrats back to the chamber unclear. They would not be jailed.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The top health official in the state’s most populous county said Tuesday that she will seek a mask mandate in schools for kids under age 12, who are unable to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Salt Lake County Health Director Angela Dunn said she issued an order of constraint requiring children under 12 to wear masks in school. Dunn, who was targeted by anti-mask protesters when she served as state epidemiologist until stepping down a few months ago, made the announcement with Mayor Jenny Wilson, who said she supports the decision. The order comes about a week before children return to school and would only apply in indoor settings. “It is in the best public health interest of our students for them to be in masks in the fall, to keep them in-person learning with the least disruption possible and the least health concerns possible,” Dunn said. Last year masks were required in schools, but under a new state law, school mask mandates are banned. Local health departments can issue a rule – but only with the support of elected county leaders, and anti-mask advocates have been vocal in their opposition. Dunn’s order now moves to the Republican-controlled Salt Lake County Council.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The City Council has again rejected a proposal to raise the cap on the number of sworn city police officers that was imposed earlier this year. Early Tuesday, the council did approve the Burlington Police Commission’s request to hire two community service liasons. Last year, the panel voted to cap the number of officers at 74 and to allocate resources elsewhere. The Burlington Police Commission last week recommended raising the cap to 82 following recent crime in the city and concerns about staff shortages overnight. Mayor Miro Weinberger supports adding more officers, saying that the department lost nearly 20 officers in about a year and that more than half the officers still on the force are looking for new jobs, WCAX-TV reports. “If that happens, we will cease to have a functional police department in the city of Burlington,” Weinberger said before the vote. The City Council also rejected raising the cap in February.\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: A northern Virginia mosque is asking the Biden administration to release a set of religious tiles that were confiscated at Dulles International Airport after they were deemed to violate sanctions on Iran. At a news conference Tuesday at the Manassas Mosque, Imam Abolfazl Nahidian said the custom-made tiles were shipped in June from the Iranian city of Qom, to be used in construction of a new mosque a few miles away. He said the tiles were a gift, and he paid no money for them, but a Customs and Border Protection officer at the airport blocked the mosque from claiming the tiles, citing the sanctions. Nahidian said he has received other tile shipments throughout the years without incident. A letter from Customs and Border Protection informed the mosque that the tiles must be shipped back to Iran or destroyed. Destroying the tiles, which are adorned with Quranic verses, would be especially disturbing, Nahidian said. Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said it makes no sense to enforce the rules on a benign piece of religious art. “They are not weapons of mass destruction,” Awad said. “We believe the government should have common sense.” Speakers at Tuesday’s news conference suggested anti-Islam sentiment may be responsible for the confiscation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington is trying to keep a proposed Seattle charter amendment that would change how the city handles homelessness off the November ballot. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in King County Superior Court, the ACLU and other homelessness activists said the “Compassion Seattle” measure, officially known as Charter Amendment 29, is beyond the scope of local initiative power and violates state law on how local governments can address homelessness. The measure, which recently qualified for the ballot, directs the city to provide 2,000 units of emergency or permanent housing within a year and requires the city to ensure that parks, playgrounds, sidewalks and other public spaces remain clear of encampments. According to the lawsuit, state law gives local legislative bodies – city and county councils – the exclusive authority to develop plans targeting homelessness. Further, it says, the amendment would undermine the city’s binding agreement with King County creating a regional homelessness authority and would unlawfully waive land-use regulations to speed the development of emergency and permanent housing. Proposed Charter Amendment 29 has received mixed feedback from mayoral candidates and City Council figures.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice presented the final cash prizes in the state’s vaccination sweepstakes Tuesday, part of a push to entice residents to get their COVID-19 shots – with mixed results – just as cases are again spiraling upward. The Republican governor presented a nearly $1.6 million check to real estate agent Wally Board of Spencer as the grand-prize winner in the lottery for vaccinated residents that began seven weeks ago. Earlier Tuesday, Justice presented a $588,000 second-place check to Kara Waldeck, a pharmacy worker from Charles Town whose job includes administering doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Justice also handed out custom pickup trucks, four-year college scholarships, lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, shotguns, hunting rifles, and weekend trips to state park lodges. The final drawing had been postponed by a week after the state cited a system glitch that had closed the registration process early for some scholarship hopefuls. State data shows more than 69% of residents ages 12 and up have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Justice had set a goal of vaccinating 85% of residents 50 and up, a group that currently has 83% coverage. He also is close to a goal of getting 90% of those 65 and older to receive their shots. The state has seen far less success in getting people under 30 inoculated.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials set a 300-animal limit Wednesday for the state’s fall wolf hunt, exceeding biologists’ recommendations as they study the impact of a rushed spring season that saw hunters take almost twice as many wolves as allotted. State Department of Natural Resources scientists asked its policy board to cap kills at 130 animals, saying board members must be cautious because the four-day season in February took place during wolves’ breeding season, and the long-term ramifications on the population are unknown. But conservative-leaning members of the board countered that the population is still well above the DNR’s goal of 350 animals and that they have a responsibility to manage the pack and protect livestock from wolf attacks. The board ultimately voted 5-2 to set aside the department’s recommendation and up the quota to 300 animals. However, the working quota for state-licensed hunters will almost certainly be less than 300. The state’s Chippewa tribes are entitled to claim up to half the quota under treaty rights dating back to the 1800s. The Chippewa consider wolves sacred and refuse to hunt them. If the tribes claim their full half of the quota, state-licensed hunters will be allowed to kill only 150 wolves.\n\nWyoming\n\nEvanston: A pickup truck struck and killed a 2-year-old boy in southwestern Wyoming. The boy, Nico Ringer, had run into a street in downtown Evanston before being hit by the Chevrolet Silverado about 9 p.m. Tuesday, according to the Wyoming Highway Patrol. He was the 64th person killed on roadways across the state in 2021, compared to 74 total in 2020 and 103 in 2019, KTWO Radio reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/04/travel-hypocrisy-street-racing-vaccine-limitations-news-around-states/115097638/", "title": "Travel hypocrisy, street racing: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state hit new highs Wednesday for the numbers of coronavirus cases reported in a single day and patients hospitalized with COVID-19, health officials said as hospitals brace for an additional wave of cases in the weeks following Thanksgiving gatherings. Dr. Scott Harris, the state health officer, said excluding backlogged cases, the state reported more than 3,000 additional virus cases Wednesday, a new daily record. The state also reported having 1,801 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the highest number since the pandemic began. “There is simply a great deal of community transmission occurring right now in most parts of Alabama. Now, more than ever, we hope that Alabamians can avoid large gatherings, wear masks in public and try to maintain a 6-foot distance from other households whenever possible,” Harris said. About 1 in 3 patients in intensive care units in the state has COVID-19, said Dr. Don Williamson, the former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association. Only 10% of the state’s 1,634 intensive care beds were available Monday, Williamson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A second inmate at a prison experiencing a coronavirus outbreak has died from complications related to COVID-19, as the total number of active cases at the state’s largest prison has reached 480, the Alaska Department of Corrections said Tuesday. The 77-year-old with underlying health issues, who was serving sentences for sexual abuse and release violations, died Monday after being taken to a Palmer hospital Nov. 22, the department said. Both prisoners who’ve died of the virus in the state were inmates at Goose Creek Correctional Center near Wasilla, which has been experiencing an outbreak. The department said it offered tests to about 1,300 inmates at the prison to try to find undetected cases. Results brought the facility’s active case count to 480, with results in 120 cases pending and another roughly 190 inmates considered recovered, the department said. Sarah Gallagher, a department spokesperson, said it “can only offer and recommend testing” – not require it – but she said there were few refusals to be tested.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Top hospital officials across Arizona urged the state Wednesday to take more action to stop the spread of COVID-19, making a bleak projection that the health care system could go beyond capacity later this month. Gov. Doug Ducey acknowledged that “the numbers in Arizona are heading in the wrong direction,” but he declined to order a statewide mask mandate, curfew or business lockdown. “I don’t think the right answer is to throw hundreds of thousands of Arizonans out of work right before the holidays,” Ducey said. Better enforcement of existing restrictions on restaurants, bars and gyms, along with local mask mandates and good hygiene, are sufficient, he said. Businesses that skirt safety protocols will face closure after a second offense, he said. Banner Health, the state’s largest health system, is predicting it could surpass its hospital bed capacity as early as next week and 125% of bed capacity by mid-December.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A White House panel said in a report released Wednesday that Arkansas remains in the “red zone” for new coronavirus cases as the state set a new record for COVID-19 hospitalizations for the fourth day in a row. The White House Coronavirus Task Force said Arkansas last week ranked 24th in the country for new cases per capita. The state’s test positivity ranked 30th, according to the panel. The panel said 88% of the state’s counties have moderate or high levels of community transmission of the virus. The report said cases may be reaching a plateau in Arkansas, but the percentage of nursing homes with at least one coronavirus-positive staff member and positive residents is increasing. The panel again recommended restaurants in the state limit indoor dining capacity to less than 25%, a proposal Gov. Asa Hutchinson has previously rejected. The number of people hospitalized because of COVID-19 increased Wednesday by 14 to a new high of 1,088, the Department of Health said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will likely order most of its businesses to close or limit capacity in the coming days, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday, as part of new rules triggered when less than 15% of beds are available in intensive care units for regional hospital networks. Newsom said four of the state’s five regions – excluding the San Francisco Bay Area – will meet that threshold within a day or two. When they do, the state will order the closure of all hair salons and barbershops; bars, breweries and distilleries; casinos; and indoor and outdoor playgrounds. Restaurants would be limited to takeout and delivery only, while retailers must limit customers inside their stories to 20% capacity during the busy holiday shopping season. California on Wednesday reported more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases, the most ever in one day. A record 8,500 people are in hospitals, including more than 2,000 in intensive care units, leaving the state with fewer than 2,000 available intensive care beds.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The ACLU of Colorado and a county sheriff’s office have reached an agreement to implement measures at the county’s jail to better protect inmates from the coronavirus pandemic. Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams and the ACLU have asked a federal judge to enter a consent decree between the two sides to officially implement the changes and provide federal oversight. The ACLU had filed a lawsuit in April alleging that the sheriff’s office had failed to meet public health orders related to the pandemic and did not sufficiently protect inmates, jail staff and the public. As part of the agreement, the jail is required to promote social distancing, require and distribute masks to all people in the jail, conduct coronavirus testing pursuant to U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidelines, and isolate medically vulnerable inmates while monitoring them regularly. The jail also agreed, with limited exceptions, to prevent inmates charged with misdemeanor, municipal or petty crimes from being held in the facility. The county sheriff will also be required to regularly advise officers to minimize custodial arrests.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Lyme: Nearly two dozen inmates at the state’s only women’s prison recently tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting a partial lockdown, Department of Correction officials said. There were 14 infected inmates with symptoms at York Correctional Institution in East Lyme and another nine inmates who tested positive but had no symptoms as of Wednesday evening, department spokeswoman Karen Martucci said. All of them were in medical isolation, she said. The partial lockdown at York, which houses nearly 500 inmates, includes restrictions on prisoners’ movements and a temporary suspension of in-person, non-contact social visits. Martucci said inmates are still able to use the phone and take showers every day, and free video conferencing has been made available. The facility was undergoing a deep cleaning, officials said. Statewide, more than 290 inmates and nearly 140 employees currently have COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, nearly 1,750 state inmates have tested positive for the virus, and eight have died, according to the latest Correction Department data. More than 9,200 inmates are detained in state prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Several key indicators of the spread of COVID-19 in the state have reached or eclipsed spring records. Delaware on Thursday reported 754 new cases, the most ever in a single day. The greatest single-day case count in the spring was 487 on May 10, and that number has been surpassed nine times this fall. The seven-day average of daily confirmed cases has set a record in each of the past five days, climbing to 555.7 on Thursday. The recent spike cannot be solely attributed to increased testing. Although Delaware has administered about 7,000 tests per day over the past week, a dramatic increase over the roughly 1,500 tests performed daily in May, the percentage of tests that are positive is rising, too. The state reported a seven-day average of 8% of tests that are positive as of Nov. 30, the highest it’s been this fall. A week earlier, the figure was 6.1%. There are currently 277 people hospitalized in Delaware due to COVID-19, the most since May 12. At his weekly COVID-19 press briefing Tuesday, Gov. John Carney said the state is considering implementing new restrictions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the second time in a week, D.C. has tallied more than 300 new cases of the coronavirus in a single day, WUSA-TV reports. Thursday marked only the third time ever that the district’s daily COVID-19 case count has exceeded 300. And for the first time ever, the city is now averaging more than 200 new cases of the virus a day. There are also indications that the city’s coronavirus testing capacity hasn’t been able to keep pace. The average positivity rate for tests has been steadily rising and now sits at 5.6%, 2.6 percentage points higher than it was a month ago. Since Nov. 21, average wait times for test results have increased by a full day. Some of that may ease as labs work through the glut of tests from the Thanksgiving holiday, but since labs nationwide are reporting difficult keeping up with testing demand, it’s likely wait times will remain elevated for the near term.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Residents in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities will be the first to get a coronavirus vaccine when the state begins receiving it later this month, Gov. Ron DeSantis said. The Republican governor’s priorities, announced in in a video Wednesday evening, largely reflect the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We want to get as much vaccine for our citizens as possible, but we know we will not, nor will any state, have enough to vaccinate everyone right off the bat,” DeSantis said in the three-minute video. He said long-term care residents are most vulnerable to the virus. Through Tuesday, there have been 7,376 confirmed deaths from the virus among residents and staff at long-term care facilities. Overall, COVID-19 is blamed for more than 19,000 deaths in Florida and more than 1 million confirmed infections. On Thursday, the state reported 10,870 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 100 new deaths from COVID-19. There were 4,280 people hospitalized, up 75 from the day before.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Leaders of some of the state’s hospitals told Gov. Brian Kemp in a meeting Wednesday that they’re seeing increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, although they said in some cases those infected with the coronavirus do not appear as gravely ill as patients who were hospitalized in earlier waves. The Republican governor continued to express optimism about Georgia’s level of infection compared to other states, as well as about vaccines on the horizon. But some hospital leaders warned that they expect things to keep getting worse, while many said that they struggle to hire nurses and that staff members are exhausted nearly nine months into the pandemic. “I think it’s important for all of us to stay grounded that this third surge is very different than the first and the second ones,” said Bryce Gartland of Atlanta-based Emory Healthcare. “This one is much more insidious in nature. It’s much more building in nature.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A seniors advocacy group has called on the state Department of Health to release more information about nursing home inspections after a coronavirus outbreak at a veterans home caused at least 27 deaths earlier this year. Kokua Council asked the state to put all its inspection reports of long-term care facilities on the health department’s website. The inspection report for the Yukio Okutsu State Veterans Home, where at least 71 residents and 35 employees were infected with the virus, has not yet been made public. The facility had been fined twice since 2018 for health violations. The owners of Yukio Okutsu were accused of improperly restraining residents who did not require restraints, failing to adequately supervise residents showering, serving expired food, allowing a resident to fall off a bed and break a hip, and incidents in which staffers accidentally caused minor injuries. Several residents were found to have left without supervision, including one case in which a resident in a wheelchair was found 3 miles away before anyone realized the resident was missing, according to a 2018 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services inspection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Residents will have increased access to broadband service following a state investment of nearly $50 million in federal coronavirus recovery funds. Idaho paid for 102 projects with the money, which will connect about 40,000 Idaho households to broadband service, Boise State Public Radio reports. The state funded projects to provide free wireless internet in schools and public spaces, including downtown areas and parks, plus more than 50 rural libraries. A report by the Pew Research Trusts said Idaho was one of a handful of states without a broadband grant program before the pandemic. Georgia Dimmick, disaster recovery coordinator at Region IV Development in Twin Falls, helped several communities apply for broadband grants over the summer. Eden, a community of 400 residents in Jerome County, received nearly $3 million to bring service to more homes to address the impact of the pandemic and the lack of broadband service for its youth. “There was like 20 or 30 kids out on the front yard at the high school because they didn’t have internet at their house, and they had to get their homework done,” Dimmick said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State public health officials reported 10,959 newly confirmed cases of coronavirus illness Thursday and a second consecutive day of near-record deaths. The 192 fatalities from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, matched the toll from May 13, at the height of the initial wave of the disease in Illinois. That total is second only to the 238 reported Wednesday. The Illinois Department of Public Health said some data reported this week was delayed by the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Illinois has now suffered 12,830 deaths among 759,562 coronavirus infections. Hospitalization numbers continue to decrease slowly, good news particularly because the state’s health care front is bracing for another rush of cases in coming weeks after Thanksgiving travel and congregations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: As the state faces a longer stretch of COVID-19 illnesses and deaths, the governor and top state health official on Wednesday pinned improvement on personal responsibility and the looming first arrival of vaccines rather than reinstating more statewide precautions. Nearly all of Indiana remained in the greatest-risk categories for coronavirus spread in a state health department update that also showed a new high for average daily COVID-19 deaths for the state. Health officials across the state are worried about hospitals being overwhelmed by the growing number of severely ill patients and a possible new surge tied to Thanksgiving gatherings last week. Indiana hospitals were treating more than 3,400 COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday – about a 350% increase since late September, when the state’s steep increase in hospitalizations and deaths began.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state added another 70 deaths Thursday to the tally of people who died with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours – the largest one-day increase since the pandemic arrived in the state. The state has reported 2,519 total deaths related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. That was an addition of 2,449 since Wednesday, according to the state’s Coronavirus.Iowa.gov website. Prior to Thursday, the largest one-day death increase was 47, which was reported Nov. 25. Although the deaths were reported since Wednesday, none occurred in December. Since noon Monday, an additional 107 deaths in November have been reported, bringing that month’s total to 718. The majority of the 70 newly reported deaths – 61 – happened in November, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Eight additional deaths were reported from October. The earliest death that is newly reported is from Aug. 26.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County on Thursday rejected part of the new federal and state guidelines for shortening the time people are quarantined after they’re possibly exposed to COVID-19. New guidance Wednesday from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people who’ve been exposed to coronavirus and show no symptoms but don’t get tested can end their quarantines after 10 days, instead of 14. The new guidance also said a person without symptoms who tests negative can end a quarantine after seven days. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment adopted that guidance, though its top administrator, Dr. Lee Norman, said it is still urging people to remain quarantined for 14 days. Shawnee County will allow people without COVID-19 symptoms who’ve not been tested to shorten their quarantines to 10 days, Dr. Gianfranco Pezzino, the county’s health officer, said Thursday. But he said it will not allow people who’ve tested negative to leave quarantine after seven days. Pezzino said the testing system is stressed in the county, home to Topeka, and the county does not want to overload it. Also, he said, the spread of COVID-19 remains “uncontrolled” locally.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus surged Wednesday after another daily record, and some hospitals are being stretched “to the brink” as virus cases escalate, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Beshear reported 37 more virus-related deaths, eclipsing the previous record of 35 deaths posted Tuesday, as the state’s total death count since the start of the pandemic approached 2,000. The latest deaths included people ranging in ages from their 40s to their 90s. Six were under the age of 60. Back-to-back days of record virus deaths underscored the need for people to wear masks and follow other health guidelines, the Democratic governor said. He recently announced new restrictions on in-person gatherings at restaurants, schools and event venues to combat the virus. Those actions sparked criticism from Republican lawmakers, business owners and private schools. “We are not surrendering. We are fighting back,” Beshear said Wednesday. “That’s not always going to be popular. It’s going to be difficult.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A health care worker and an academic are warning that testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is being neglected during the coronavirus pandemic. Joseph Olsen, an HIV testing manager at a clinic in New Orleans, told WDSU-TV on Wednesday that the clinic has performed 2,000 HIV tests since the pandemic began. Before the virus outbreak, he said the clinic usually did up to 12,000 tests in a year. “Coronavirus parallels HIV. They do not care who you are; they just do what viruses do and spread,” Olsen said. Some HIV testing sites have closed as clinics shifted to telemedicine during the pandemic, said Meredith Clement, a professor at Louisiana State University’s Health Sciences Center. Olsen said his clinic, Crescent Care, has increased at-home testing kits and is offering walk-up testing.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Gov. Janet Mills said Wednesday that the number of doses of the new coronavirus vaccine that the state could receive later this month is disappointingly low. Mills, a Democrat, said Maine is slated to get about 12,600 doses of a vaccine by the middle of December. The vaccine requires two doses, which means the shipment could allow the state to vaccinate some 6,300 people. The people at the front of the line for the new vaccine would be health care workers. Mills called the number of doses “far less than what is needed.” She said the state hoped for closer to 36,000 doses in the initial shipment. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Nirav Shah has said the number of vaccine doses the federal government could ship to the state is a preliminary number that could change.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will receive about 155,000 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine during the first wave of distribution – an amount that will not even cover half of the front-line health care workers who are slated to receive initial immunizations. “That’s a tiny fraction of what we need,” Gov. Larry Hogan said at a news conference Tuesday in Annapolis. “It doesn’t get anywhere near what we need in phase one.” He said state officials learned details of the first phase Tuesday. It’s still unclear whether the 155,000 will represent complete doses of two separate injections or individual injections. Hogan said about 50,000 will come from Pfizer and the remainder from Moderna. “The good news is they have vaccines that are years ahead of schedule, and we’ll get some relatively fast,” Hogan said. “The bad news is it’s not enough. So we have some difficult decisions ... about the implementation and rollout of the plan.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A 220-bed field hospital at a sports and convention center in Worcester is scheduled to open Sunday, and the state is already working on establishing a second to care for an expected torrent of coronavirus patients, Gov. Charlie Baker said Thursday. “Field hospitals play a critical role in our preparedness strategy that helps us alleviate pressure on the health care system generally and enable hospitals to focus on non-COVID patients,” the Republican governor said after touring the field hospital set up at the DCU Center in Worcester and run by UMass Memorial Health Care. The visit came a day after the state reported 4,613 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest single-day total since the pandemic began, with nearly 1,300 patients in the hospital. In addition to all the medical equipment and amenities its needs to care for patients, the Worcester facility also has some features aimed at helping patients dealing with the isolation they often feel because family can’t visit, including common areas and exercise bicycles, said Dr. Eric Dickson, president of UMass Memorial Health Care.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Thursday that her administration may extend portions of a three-week partial shutdown of schools and businesses next week because of the “sheer volume” of coronavirus cases in Michigan. The Democratic governor said no decision had been made, but hospitals can’t be overrun with COVID-19 patients. Although the infection curve has leveled off, it is a “dangerous moment” for the state, she said. “As we get a few more days of information under our belts, we’ll be in a much stronger position to really assess if there are some things that maybe are safer to do,” Whitmer said during a news conference in which she reported continued progress addressing virus-related racial disparities. The state health department’s order closed high schools to in-person instruction, stopped organized sports, prohibited indoor restaurant dining, and closed various entertainment businesses such as movie theaters and bowling alleys. It will end late Tuesday unless extended, which was commonplace for stay-at-home and other restrictions earlier in the pandemic.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz and public safety officials pleaded Wednesday for Minnesotans to follow coronavirus safety guidelines to protect their local police, fire and ambulance services, which have been hit hard by staff shortages amid the surge in cases. Jay Wood, a firefighter from Plato, a town of about 300 people about 45 miles west of Minneapolis, said his 20-person all-volunteer department had to shut down last month because most members had tested positive for the virus or been exposed. One had to be hospitalized. And he said departments large and small across Minnesota face similar challenges. “Just like we preach about fire safety, one little spark can cause a fire. And that’s exactly what happened to us,” Wood said at the governor’s briefing. “COVID-19 sparked an outbreak at the Plato Fire Department. Before we knew it, over three-quarters of our fire department had been affected in one way or another from the virus.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state reported its single-day record of nearly 2,500 new coronavirus cases Wednesday as the state health department issued an advisory saying people should avoid social gatherings, including weddings, funerals, sporting events and in-person religious services. “Where we are in the pandemic right now, just to be very clear, it’s nonessential social activities that are absolutely undermining the health and well-being of our state,” Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, said during a news conference. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has declined to reinstate a statewide mask mandate that expired two months ago, but he has issued mask mandates for 54 of the state’s 82 counties where virus transmission is highest. Many physicians have called on the governor to require masks statewide in public places. Dobbs said Wednesday that the mask conversation “is distracting from the real threat” of spreading the virus through nonessential gatherings. He said people let down their guard and hug others at parties or funerals, often without their faces covered.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: The state plans to bring in hundreds of health care workers from other states to help provide care as already-stretched hospitals prepare for a possible increase in COVID-19 cases resulting from the Thanksgiving holiday. Gov. Mike Parson and Herb Kuhn, president and CEO of the Missouri Hospital Association, announced Wednesday that the state will partner with Vizient, a private national health care company, to recruit up to 760 more health care workers for Missouri. Kuhn said the partnership comes as early data have raised concerns about a possible surge in new COVID-19 cases because of Thanksgiving travel. He said data showed Missourians’ travel for recreation and retail increased an average of 40% daily from Nov. 23 to Thanksgiving Day. The workers will include registered nurses, respiratory therapists and certified nurse assistants. When fully deployed, the plan will add nearly 600 hospital beds to Missouri’s statewide bed capacity, Parson said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock said Wednesday that the state could receive about 9,750 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by drug company Pfizer as soon as Dec. 15. Both Pfizer and Moderna have applied for emergency authorization for their vaccines. Once it’s granted, the state is slated to receive thousands of additional doses in subsequent weeks, Bullock said. The state has between 45,000 and 60,000 health care workers and 10,000 residents and staff members at long-term care facilities, who will have first access to the vaccine once it is available. The focus of the first allotment will be health care workers, the governor said. Bullock said during a news conference that the state is slated to use all $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief allocated to the state in the spring, and he called on Congress to pass another relief measure to help the state address economic and health-related challenges once the deadline for spending the original allocation passes at the end of the month. “This is a storm that cannot be weathered without federal support,” Bullock said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: City leaders across the state find they’re left with the onus of whether to require masks as the governor continues to resist issuing a statewide mask mandate in the face of a raging coronavirus pandemic. The Omaha suburb of Papillion was slated to vote Thursday on a proposal to require masks in public buildings, after two consecutive nights of public debate over the proposal. The Papillion Board of Health has recommended the mask mandate, and several medical workers and educators – two professions hit particularly hard by the outbreak – spoke in favor of a mandate at meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, the Omaha World-Herald reports. More than a dozen people spoke against the proposal, including laundromat owner Peter Mayberry, believed to be the first person in Omaha ticketed for violating that city’s mask mandate. In Grand Island, police made clear this week that they will enforce the city’s mandate passed last week, including charging violators with public nuisance counts. On Wednesday, the state reported 48 more coronavirus deaths and 2,336 new coronavirus cases.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state reported 48 new deaths from the coronavirus Thursday, marking the deadliest day since the onset of the pandemic. Nevada also reported 2,536 new confirmed virus cases, bringing the statewide totals to 159,532 cases and 2,249 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Nevada is more than a week into what Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak coined a “statewide pause” involving virus prevention measures, with the number of customers businesses can accept and the number of people allowed in gatherings reduced to 25% of fire codes limit. Meanwhile, state officials said they plan to revise their coronavirus vaccine distribution plan to align with interim recommendations that a U.S. Centers for Disease Control committee issued Tuesday. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that the first available doses go to nursing home residents and health care workers. In Nevada, where tourism and hospitality fuel the economy, officials initially assigned residents of long-term care facilities third-tier priority, behind retail workers, teachers, police officers and airport operators.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Senate Democrats are pressing Republican Gov. Chris Sununu to address a COVID-19 outbreak at the New Hampshire Veterans Home that has left 15 residents dead. Senate Minority Leader Donna Soucy and Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, both of Manchester, sent a letter to the governor Thursday saying they are deeply disturbed by what they view as a lack of action at the 250-bed nursing home in Tilton. Since the virus was first detected at the home Nov. 10, 53 residents and 64 staff members have tested positive, and 15 veterans have died. The senators called for the implementation of a plan to prevent further spread of the virus, address staffing shortages and ensure the availability of personal protective equipment. “The staff at the New Hampshire Veterans Home are risking their health and safety simply to do their jobs and care for our veterans,” they wrote. “This is unacceptable.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s COVID-19 caseload surged Thursday to levels not seen even during the height of the spring outbreak, with Gov. Phil Murphy and experts warning things could get worse. The state recorded about 4,900 new cases overnight as New Jersey weathers another wave of the outbreak, Murphy, a Democrat, said Thursday in a tweet. The increase comes as weeklong averages of new cases have climbed steadily for weeks. The Democratic governor also reported 64 new deaths overnight, putting the toll at 15,373. Murphy said Wednesday he’s keeping “all options on the table” when it comes to closing parts of the state’s economy again, as he ordered in the spring. He urged people to be especially vigilant with Christmas coming up. “This is Grinch times five. Don’t travel,” he said Wednesday, urging people even to keep their distance from Santa. “Santa’s got to wear a face covering; you’ve got to wear a face covering.” New Jersey’s hospitalizations topped 3,000, Murphy said – a level not seen since May.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: City officials are planning a crackdown on illegal street racing and other disruptive driving that has accompanied the coronavirus pandemic and say they’ll seek new regulations to help them. It’s just one of many safety concerns as state health officials on Wednesday reported a record-setting 40 virus-related deaths across New Mexico. Interim Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said Wednesday during a telephone town hall event that the city is expanding late-night patrols in response to reckless driving including racing and will lobby state lawmakers for stiffer penalties for repeat offenders on par with sanctions for driving while intoxicated. He described a rash of complaints about drag racing, loud mufflers and tire-squealing maneuvers. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller believes the speedway phenomenon extends to many communities nationwide. “This is happening all over the country, and it’s because of COVID,” Keller said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city is setting up plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccines starting this month, including making sure hospitals have the ultracold freezers needed to store the Pfizer vaccine, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he hopes to receive 170,000 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine Dec. 15, with additional vaccine shipments from Pfizer and Moderna within weeks. Health care workers and nursing home residents and workers will be prioritized in the first wave of vaccinations, Cuomo said. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi noted that while the Moderna vaccine can be stored at normal freezer temperatures, the Pfizer vaccine requires ultracold storage at minus 80 degrees Celsius. Chokshi said more than 50 city hospitals either currently have access to ultracold storage or will have ultracold freezers delivered soon, for a total citywide storage capacity of at least 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nYoungsville: The town is planning to hold a Christmas parade despite concerns from county health officials that the event could facilitate the spread of the coronavirus. The Raleigh News & Observer reports Youngsville plans a mile-long parade with up to 300 people watching. Those who are expected to attend include a volleyball team, a plumbing company and a hair salon. The town has faced repeated warnings from the Franklin County Health Department, which warned that COVID-19 cases are reaching record highs locally. The county also said the parade would violate Gov. Roy Cooper’s executive order limiting crowds. Town Manager Phil Cordeiro told county officials that Youngsville’s parade falls under the same First Amendment exemption that allowed Raleigh protests this year. He also said the parade is a permitted religious service because it starts in the parking lot of a church. “It’s just been a really bad year, and we’re trying to do something to lighten people’s spirits and give them a little hope,” Mayor Fonzie Flowers told the newspaper. “We don’t want it to be a situation where people don’t feel safe.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State lawmakers decided Thursday to require masks at the Capitol, despite opposition by far-right members of the Republican-controlled Legislature. Senate and House lawmakers approved rules Thursday for the session that convenes Jan. 5. House Majority Leader Chet Pollert and Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said they support a mask mandate at Capitol legislative spaces to help protect lawmakers and the public. A memo written to the Legislature by its lawyers said the lawmakers have the authority to impose restrictions on areas of the Capitol controlled by the legislative branch. Lawmakers who ignore the mandate may be removed by law enforcement and charged with a misdemeanor crime or expelled from the Legislature. Gov. Doug Burgum imposed a mandate in November after months of refraining from such an order, hoping to stem a coronavirus surge that is among the worst in the U.S. and threatens to overwhelm the state’s hospitals.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state will receive close to 100,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine by mid-December, Gov. Mike DeWine announced during a briefing Thursday. The brief but promising details provided the first look at what vaccine distribution will look like in Ohio as the number of cases, deaths and hospitalizations continue to rise at staggering rates. The Pfizer drug requires two doses for each person taking the vaccine, meaning the initial distribution will only affect about 49,000 Ohioans. Also Thursday, DeWine made good on earlier threats and vetoed a bill that would restrict the state Health Department’s abilities to issue public health orders during emergencies. The governor said he would provide further details about the state’s vaccine plan Friday but disclosed the partnership the state will have with CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to provide the vaccine to nursing home patients and staff. “This is a huge, logistical operation made particularly more challenging by the necessity of keeping the vaccine super cold,” DeWine said during the briefing. “We’re going to report the best we can about the progress. We’ll be transparent.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The first shipment of a coronavirus vaccine is expected in the state in about 10 days, with health care workers and long-term care providers and residents receiving the first doses, state health commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said Thursday. Federal health officials are also working to provide vaccine to long-term care facility staff and residents, according to deputy health commissioner Keith Reed. Frye said emergency use approval of the vaccine developed by Pfizer is expected Dec. 11, and 33,000 initial doses should arrive in Oklahoma two or three days later, with shipment of a second, required dose expected about three weeks later. Emergency approval of a similar vaccine developed by Moderna is also anticipated, and about 10,000 doses are expected by the end of December, Frye said. The state’s plan places first responders such as paramedics, police officers and firefighters in addition to the elderly and those at high risk in the second phase of people to receive the vaccine. School students, teachers and staff are in the third phase of those to receive the vaccine, then the general public.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: An 11-person COVID-19 outbreak at the Wilsonville office of the Oregon Employment Department will likely cause further delays in handling claims, officials said. The outbreak “will cause real disruptions in our ability to get work at the pace we have been,” said David Gerstenfeld, acting director of the department, which has already been dealing with a backlog. Agency officials said many of the office’s 600 employees will soon work from home. Health authorities have not advised the office to close, Gerstenfeld said. But Gov. Kate Brown’s COVID-19 safety orders require employers to allow work-from-home options when possible. The department has made significant progress in enabling remote work and establishing safety protocols, Gerstenfeld said. He said he expects hundreds of Wilsonville employees to work from home in the future, but some lack adequate internet service. As part of Brown’s proposed budget and policy agenda announced Tuesday, she wants $146 million to replace the employment department’s computer systems and implement a new paid family and medical leave program.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hospital beds are filling up, and medical staffs are being stretched to the limit, as Pennsylvania’s health care system copes with a growing number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients. Nearly half of all hospitals in the south-central region of the state and a third of those in the southwest anticipate staffing shortages within a week, according to the state Department of Health. Nurses in the Philadelphia area say they’re overloaded with COVID-19 patients, limiting the quality of care they can provide. And Pennsylvania’s top health official, Dr. Rachel Levine, said Thursday that she’s worried about modeling that shows the state will run out of intensive care beds this month. More than 85% of the state’s ICU beds are occupied amid an enormous statewide spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations this fall. The health secretary added that she’s even more concerned about hospital staffing. While medical-surgical beds can be converted into ICU beds, the supply of medical workers is “not infinite.” On Thursday, Pennsylvania reported more than 5,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the state’s highest point in the pandemic and up from a statewide average of about 450 at the end of September.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nearly 30,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines will arrive in the state before the end of month, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Thursday. The term-limited Democrat also declared she wouldn’t be President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for health and human services secretary, dispelling speculation that’s ramped up in recent weeks as Biden forms his Cabinet. “My focus is right here in Rhode Island,” the governor said near the end of her weekly coronavirus briefing. Meanwhile, early reports from the state’s two-week economic “pause” imposed Monday are encouraging, Raimondo said. She said restaurants and bars appear to be following the new rules on their industry, which include reduced capacity limits for in-person dining and shuttering bar areas to patrons. Raimondo also said road travel appeared lighter, and officials have received no credible reports of large parties. She said she’s hopeful the restrictions will lead to a decline in COVID-19 cases in the next couple of weeks. At the same time, Raimondo said, she hasn’t ruled out extending the temporary restrictions, currently slated to run through Dec. 13.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s Republican leaders made no major changes Wednesday to their main House committees, and the group that handles the budget remains stuck with the same problems, only this time it’s looking at steep cuts due to the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Rep. Murrell Smith of Sumter was reelected chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, two years after House Speaker Jay Lucas wielded his power to make committee assignments for all members and kicked Rep. Brian White off the powerful panel he led for eight years. Smith told his committee they will have to immediately deal with the budget, as economists can’t guarantee that tax and other revenue estimates slashed by the COVID-19 economic downturn will be enough to avoid budget cuts before this spending plan ends in June.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s COVID-19 death toll surged past 1,000 on Thursday, with 38 additional deaths, the Department of Health reported. The additional deaths brought the total to 1,033, and they included a person between 20 and 29 years old, which has been a rarity. So far, three people in that age range have died with COVID-19, while 15,656 in that age range have tested positive for the coronavirus. The new deaths brought December’s total to 87 so far, after a November in which deaths went from 425 to 946. The department reported 1,145 new coronavirus infections, along with 490 newly recovered infections. The number of active infections increased to 15,474. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 rose from 531 to 538. The peak for hospitalizations was set Nov. 10, with 607.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials have expanded a mental health hotline during COVID-19 times to extend support to teachers. The Department of Education says the hotline provides free and confidential support from trained volunteer mental health professionals to people experiencing increased anxiety and stress due to the pandemic. Officials say the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services set up the hotline in May for health care workers and first responders on the front lines of the pandemic. The department partnered with the Mental Health Active Response Team; the Tennessee Association of Alcohol, Drug, and other Addictions Services; and the Tennessee chapter of the National Association of Social Workers. With the expansion, educators are now eligible for the services as well. The hotline is available at 888-642-7886 daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Central time.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Mayor Steve Adler went on vacation to Mexico with family in November as he urged people to stay home amid worsening coronavirus caseloads in Texas, at one point recording a video during the trip in which he told residents back home that now was “not the time to relax.” The trip revealed Wednesday is the latest example of a public official who has pleaded for vigilance in the face of rising cases and hospitalizations across the U.S. seeming not to heed their own guidance. Hours after the story was published, Adler issued a statement apologizing for the trip. “While I violated no orders or guidelines, I regret this travel,” Adler said. “I wouldn’t travel now, didn’t over Thanksgiving and won’t over Christmas. But my fear is that this travel, even having happened during a safer period, could be used by some as justification for risky behavior. In hindsight, it set a bad example, for which I apologize.” The trip to Cabo San Lucas came after Adler hosted an outdoor wedding and reception with 20 guests for his daughter at a hotel near downtown. Adler said the attendees had to take a rapid COVID-19 test and maintain social distancing. He acknowledged, however, that although masks were distributed at the wedding, all guests were “probably not” wearing them all the time.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday that the state plans to prioritize front-line health care workers after it receives its first round of coronavirus vaccine doses that could arrive as early as mid-December. The first doses in Utah will go to front-line workers such as doctors and nurses in emergency departments, urgent care facilities and COVID-19 units, as well as housekeeping workers, said Dr. Jeanmarie Mayer, chief of infection prevention at the University of Utah Health hospital. “It’s just so incredibly important to make sure that we keep our health care systems intact and able to care for the most vulnerable in our populations,” Mayer told reporters. Public health experts have warned that if people do not follow masking and social distancing guidance, COVID-19 hospitalizations will further overwhelm the state’s already strained health care system. In Utah, 1 in 173 people was diagnosed with COVID-19 over the past week, and the state is ranked eighth in the country for new cases per capita, according to data from Johns Hopkins.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s tax department is forecasting a 9% increase in education property taxes, mostly because of the pandemic. The forecast assists lawmakers and administration officials in planning for a budget and gives them a preview of education tax yields for homeowners and the non-homestead tax rate for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The forecast indicates a lack of spending at local stores, restaurants and hotels translates to an estimated $40 million shortfall in the education fund. Tax Commissioner Craig Bolio called it “one of the largest-single year increases in the average homestead rate in the last decade.” But he said the numbers aren’t final, and the economic picture could improve depending on how the state does in curbing the virus and getting more people back to work. “The governor and administration do not believe this is a tenable tax increase for Vermonters who are working hard to recover from the pandemic, nor for the Vermont economy which continues to struggle due to the pandemic-related disruption,” Bolio wrote.\n\nVirginia\n\nRustburg: Officials in Campbell County have passed a resolution expressing opposition to the governor’s new safety guidelines that aim to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The Lynchburg News & Advance reports the county’s supervisors on Tuesday declared it to be a “First Amendment sanctuary.” The resolution is considered mostly symbolic and is similar to a Second Amendment sanctuary resolution passed by the county’s board more than a year ago. Gov. Ralph Northam’s executive order limits indoor and outdoor gatherings to no more than 25 people. It also directs restaurants and bars to halt alcohol sales at 10 p.m. and close by midnight. The county’s resolution claims the Democratic governor’s mandate is in violation of the state’s constitution and seeks to oppose enforcement of his executive order. It asks the sheriff’s office to “not assist any state law enforcement officer, state health agent or federal agent” attempting to enforce the order. The Virginia Department of Health enforces the governor’s mandates, not local law enforcement agencies.\n\nWashington\n\nLittle Boston: A COVID-19 outbreak on the Port Gamble S’Klallam Reservation in North Kitsap has spread to at least 13 people and forced nearly 50 close contacts into isolation. The tribe said in an announcement that the 13 positive tests had come over the weekend through Tuesday, saying nearly 10% of the households on the reservation needed to quarantine. “It did not need to be this way,” the tribe said in a pointed update on its Facebook page, connecting the spread of the virus on the reservation to group gatherings during Thanksgiving week. “This past week, people got complacent,” the announcement said. “They had dinners. They got together with loved ones. We’re now seeing the consequences of those actions. If you’re one of the affected, this notice is not meant to shame – we hope for a quick and uneventful recovery. It is important though that we all, as a community, learn from where we find ourselves right now.” The tribe was an early adopter in setting up a community testing site in May and has continued to test its employees and community members since then.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state debuted a partnership for free home-based saliva coronavirus testing Wednesday. The testing kits from Vault Health can be requested on the state’s coronavirus website. Results are expected in 24 to 48 hours after individuals send their test sample back in the mail. Officials said there are no restrictions on who can request the tests. Gov. Jim Justice announced the news as the state reported 20 additional deaths linked to COVID-19, bringing the total to at least 778 deaths. There were 678 new confirmed cases, for a total of 49,905. Forty-seven of the state’s 55 counties are classified with the state’s most severe infection rate with 25 or more positive cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said he expects the first doses of a coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer to reach the state Dec. 14. He acknowledged that a focus on increasing testing in the state has not brought the outbreak under control.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers told President Donald Trump and the state’s congressional delegation Thursday that Wisconsin needs $466 million by April to pay for vaccine distribution, coronavirus testing, contact tracing, hospitals and a public health awareness campaign. Evers, a Democrat, made the plea amid talks with Republican state lawmakers on COVID-19 proposals but with no agreement or immediate action in sight. Evers also wrote to the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asking that Wisconsin be prioritized for vaccine distribution so the state’s 450,000 health care workers can be vaccinated. Wisconsin is expected to receive nearly 50,000 doses of vaccine within weeks. The state is nearing 400,000 total cases of COVID-19 even as new positive tests begin to slow from a peak in mid-November. There were 4,618 new cases reported Thursday, bringing the total to 399,708 cases. There were 60 new deaths, for a total of 3,562.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An oil and gas stimulus program in the state has shown promising initial results in helping operators recover from the economic downturn caused in part by the pandemic, officials said. Gov. Mark Gordon created the Wyoming Energy Rebound Program to give companies money needed to complete specific projects placed on hold because of the pandemic, including plugging and abandoning wells, as well as drilling uncompleted wells, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Republican governor announced last month that he would dedicate $15 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to create the program. He later doubled the amount to $30 million in response to high demand. “This is a great and appropriate use of CARES Act money to respond to the devastating effects of the pandemic on our economy,” Randall Luthi, chief energy advisor to Gordon, said in a statement. “The oil and gas operators responded quickly and they need to act quickly in the near future.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/24/paulies-push-sweet-connie-vr-brain-rewiring-news-around-states/118465756/", "title": "Paulie's Push, sweet Connie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPanola: General Store owner Dorothy Oliver has persuaded and helped almost everyone in her community to get their COVID-19 shots. In her decades living in Panola, Oliver has become one of the most influential people in the area. She is the vice president of the local day care center and on the board of the community center, in addition to owning her store. “All of them know me,” she said of her customers. “They come in, and I just start talking to them like I know them. I don’t have to know you to talk to you.” And she isn’t afraid to ask about their vaccination status. “Back in December, whenever vaccination started, I started with it,” she said. “I went to calling all the older people around in the community, trying to make sure how their mind is and make sure they started thinking on going and getting a shot whenever it got ready for them.” By the time doses were readily available in Alabama, there were not any vaccination sites in the immediate area, with the closest facilities about 40 minutes away. So Oliver volunteered to schedule neighbors’ appointments and drive them to and from the sites. According to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community of roughly 350 people are left unvaccinated. “I know all my people that haven’t got it,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Three-time Super Bowl champion Mark Schlereth returned home to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. Anchorage Daily News reports the Service High alumnus made a halftime appearance Friday night at West High, where his alma mater squared off against the West Eagles. “I just want to encourage everybody to do your part, to talk to your doctor, and if it’s the right decision for you, please get vaccinated,” Schlereth said. “Please take care of one another.” He has been advocating for COVID-19 shots on social media, and he said the NFL Players Association reached out to him about spreading the word in his home state. Almost 54% of Alaska residents 12 and older have been inoculated, according to the state dashboard. Schlereth, 55, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 1993 while playing for Washington. He said one of the reasons he got the vaccine was to visit with his mother, who has cancer. “I wanted to spend as much time safely with her as possible … so it was just a no-brainer for us,” Schlereth said. He said one of his high school coaches whom he considered a mentor died Thursday from COVID-19. “I just lost a dear, dear friend who refused to get vaccinated, so that hit home for me,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Private businesses can require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but must allow reasonable religious and medical exemptions under state and federal law, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a legal opinion. And they can impose vaccine requirements on patrons as well, as long as they provide reasonable accommodation for customers who can’t take a vaccine because of a disability and don’t discriminate against those who won’t for religious reasons, the Republican wrote in Friday’s opinion. Public schools and universities and local and state government agencies are different because of laws enacted this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. They are not allowed to require employees or students to get inoculated once the new laws take effect Sept. 29. But private schools can, if they allow exemptions for religious or health reasons. Ducey last week issued an executive order barring state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing law that says health agencies can’t force people to be treated if they comply with sanitary or quarantine rules. A violation carries criminal sanctions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Connie Hamzy, a rock ’n’ roll groupie from the Natural State who was immortalized as “sweet, sweet Connie” in the 1973 Grand Funk Railroad hit “We’re an American Band,” has died. She was 66. “I was determined to become a famous groupie,” Hamzy, who lived in Little Rock, told KTHV in 2019. She told the station she was finishing her senior year of high school when the manager of Grand Funk Railroad called to say her name would be in a song. “I said, ‘Yeah I’ll have to see it to believe it,’ ” she said. But that summer, at the lake with friends, she heard a radio announcer introduce the new song and note that a local girl was in the first few lines, she said. “Out on the road for forty days. Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. Sweet, sweet Connie, doin’ her act. She had the whole show, and that’s a natural fact.” Hamzy told KTHV she first got backstage at age 15 after her mother, who didn’t want to deal with traffic, dropped her off early to see Steppenwolf at Barton Coliseum. “We’d go out there, and then we’d wander around the backstage area, and one thing would lead to another,” she told KTHV. Hamzy, who worked for a time as a substitute teacher, hung out with groups including Queen, the Eagles and Kiss, KTHV reports. She told the station Van Halen was a particular favorite.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMalibu: Powerful surf washed away a section of a beach access road, and swimmers and surfers were urged to use caution as huge waves from a southern swell battered the Southern California coastline. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted photos Saturday that showed the ground under Westward Beach Road completely collapsed. Beach hazard advisories had mostly expired by Sunday morning, but officials warned that dangerous rip currents and localized flooding were still possible. “We cannot emphasize this enough: surf and swim in front of an open lifeguard tower,” the Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted. “Check with the nearest lifeguard before entering the water.” Aerial video by CBS 2 News showed huge waves hitting the patio and second-story balconies of a hotel in the Orange County city of Laguna Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: After taking last season off due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bustang rides to Denver Broncos home games are back with service from Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. The state Department of Transportation said the return of rides on its Bustang coaches will begin with the team’s final preseason game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High against the Los Angeles Rams. Service was suspended last year due to the pandemic and restricted capacity at the stadium. This is the fifth season the service has been offered. The round-trip fare is $30 per person. Coaches are climate-controlled and equipped with Wi-Fi, restrooms, USB and power outlets, comfortable seats and wheelchair access. Face masks are required for drivers and passengers, and hand sanitizer wipes will be offered to passengers when boarding the bus. The buses are cleaned and disinfected upon completion of each route and each day’s routes, according to officials. Amber Blake, CDOT’s director of Transit and Rail, said the service provides an alternative for fans, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides a designated driver and enhances safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Slot machine revenues generated at the state’s two tribal casinos continue to rebound. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino report seeing an influx of visitors over the summer as COVID-19 restrictions have eased. Both destinations closed for more than three months at the height of the pandemic last year. Mohegan Sun, owned by the Mohegan Tribe, generated $49.9 million in slot machine revenues in July after paying out winnings. That’s a 5% increase from July 2020 and the most money the casino has retained since August 2019, according to The Day of New London. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, kept $36.5 million in July, marking a 19.6% increase from the more than $30.5 million in generated in July 2020. It’s the casino’s highest amount since November 2019. Jason Guyot, CEO of Foxwoods, said slot revenues at the site increased by $7.1 million from June to July. To meet increased consumer demand this summer, he said the casino has offered new experiences, including an outdoor pop-up eatery and a “Cocktail Carnival.” Mohegan Sun has also rolled out more promotions and entertainment over the summer, helping to drive traffic, said Jeff Hamilton, the resort casino’s president and CEO.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As housing prices soared over the past year, the dream of homeownership was less achievable in the First State, where buyers need more cash for closing the sale. Delaware has the highest real estate transfer tax in the nation, making the average closing costs the second-highest behind Washington, D.C. On a $250,000 home, the transfer tax due at settlement in Delaware is $10,000, which is usually split between the seller and buyer and must be paid at closing. The buyer can’t roll that amount into the mortgage and pay it off over time. Mia Burch, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors, said she has worked with buyers who were in good financial shape in almost every way but had trouble coming up with all the cash they needed at closing. She calls the transfer tax a “discouragement” tax. In 2017, the Legislature hiked the real estate transfer tax from 3% of the property’s sale price to 4%. It was only supposed to be a temporary increase to help solve the state’s budget deficit, said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek. But four years later, even after a $1 billion budget surplus, the 4% tax is still in place. “Seniors and young people are the ones getting squeezed,” Ramone said. In January, he introduced a bill to reduce the tax to its previous level, but it’s yet to make it to the House floor for a vote.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ten years after an earthquake shook the nation’s capital, repair work is only half done on the National Cathedral, WUSA-TV reports. The Aug. 23, 2011, temblor registered a 5.8 on the Richter scale and dealt extensive damage to buildings across the area. “The quake lasted 58 seconds,” said Joe Alonso, National Cathedral head stonemason. He still can recall every single second of that shake that bent the historic cathedral’s beautiful spires, split its gargoyles and sent chunks of masonry to the ground. “I thought, ‘Wow we’ve got a task ahead of us, that’s for sure,’ ” Alonso said. Repairing the spires and towers is not as simple as slapping some glue on the pieces and putting them back up. “It’s just the nature of the work – everything is handmade, hand-done,” Alonso said. “But that’s how the cathedral was built.” For ten years, the stonemasons have had to reconstruct every single broken piece and reset it hundreds of feet in the air by scaffolding or crane. “What it costs to do this is very expensive, and we are doing (a) sort of a pay-as-you-go,” Alonso said. He believes the 58 seconds were the difference between a slow, tedious repair and complete reconstruction. “If the quake had lasted 2 or 3 more seconds, the stuff that was like a Jenga game would have just come completely down,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The state’s power struggle over wearing masks in school landed Monday before a judge considering a lawsuit that challenges Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order reserving the decision for parents. The three-day hearing before Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper pits pro-mask parents against the Republican governor and state education officials who say parents, not schools, should choose whether their children cover up inside schools. The hearings come as the highly contagious delta variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across Florida, where the school year is already being disrupted. Charles Dodson, a former judge representing the parents challenging the governor’s order, in an opening statement that the delta variant affects children more than the previous virus strain and places them at greater risk in crowded schools. He said the Florida Constitution and state law give local school boards the authority to decide health and safety matters affecting their students. Michael Abel, a lawyer for the defendants, said the state’s experts will testify that requiring students to wear masks causes many harms – speaking difficulty, mood changes, breathing issues and depression – while scientists disagree on their effectiveness against the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has found that part of the state’s sweeping new election law that broadly prohibits the photographing of a completed ballot is likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee on Friday granted a preliminary injunction on that section of the law, meaning it cannot be enforced for now. In the same order, he declined to block a number of other provisions that mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The judge’s order came in a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election integrity group, and others. Boulee wrote that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit “have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the broad ban on photographing a voted ballot in both public and nonpublic places violates their First Amendment rights. The new law, known as SB 202, also adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mail ballot, results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta, and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a surge in tourists is leading to increased harassment of sea turtles on a popular North Shore Oahu beach. Hordes of people are crowding turtles at Laniakea Beach Park, known as Turtle Beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said increased patrols are being dispatched to enforce laws against approaching the turtles. “There are packs of 200 people at a time, throughout the day,” said Debbie Herrera, volunteer and education coordinator for turtle conservation group Malama na Honu. The state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement has assigned officers to Laniakea. “Typically, if there’s a uniformed officer standing on the beach, people are not going to break the law in front of them,” said Jason Redulla, division chief. Harassment of turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals led Gov. David Ige to warn that violators will be prosecuted if caught. Tourists at Laniakea Beach tell Malama na Honu they didn’t know touching turtles was illegal, Herrera said. Most follow the rules once informed, but there have been a “very few who refuse, despite dozens of cautionary signs or warnings from volunteers, to give green sea turtles on the beach or in the ocean wide berth,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: One of two U.S. district judges for Idaho announced seven months ago that he’d take senior status in August, but there’s still no official nominee to replace him. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill planned to continue to hear a full caseload when he took senior status Aug. 16, but expected Idaho to have a new district judge to replace him by then – effectively giving the state the third judge it has needed for decades, the Idaho Press reports. “We desperately need the help,” Winmill said. But there’s been no word from the White House about a nominee for the now-open second federal judgeship, though Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials interviewed candidates last winter and submitted an all-female shortlist of four nominees to the Biden administration in March: Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson, and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Traditionally, state senators are given a big say in federal district judge nominees, but that system was jettisoned under the Trump administration. The Senate – where Democrats hold a thin majority – must confirm any nominee by simple majority. It’s unclear what role Idaho’s Republican senators will play in the nomination.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials have dropped a “do not eat” advisory for sport fish in the Illinois River for the first time since the 1970s. The Illinois Department of Public Health relaxed the warning because concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have declined, the Chicago Tribune reports. The toxic contaminants were banned in 1979 but stick around in the environment, prompting the advisory. IDPH issues advisories annually based on fish samples collected from 40 to 50 streams, rivers and inland lakes, as well as from four stations in Lake Michigan. They are geared toward vulnerable populations including pregnant and nursing women, along with children younger than age 15. The department said there is no known immediate health hazard from eating contaminated fish in Illinois. But there are “concerns about the effects of long-term, low-level exposure” to contaminants including PCBs. Guidance also was relaxed for some Lake Michigan fish, including whitefish and rainbow trout. Recommended consumption is now no more than one meal a week. Previous guidance was to limit consumption to once per month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Hoosier Lottery saw record profits in the past year as its ticket sales soared 26% from the year before. That big jump was fueled by 27% growth in scratch-off ticket sales that accounted for nearly 80% of the lottery’s $1.74 billion in revenue during the year period ending June 30, officials told the State Lottery Commission this past week. Lottery administrators had projected a slight drop in sales because of worries about coronavirus-related shutdowns and the possible economic impact. But the boost in revenue will result in the lottery sending a record $375 million in profits to the state – up about $71 million, or 23%, from the year before. That’s even higher than the $368 million profits that lottery officials had projected in May. “These are really extraordinary numbers,” Lottery Commission Chairman William Zielke said. “It certainly reflects the efforts of a lot of people who tried to keep it going (through the pandemic).” The state directs about $235 million of the lottery profits toward reducing auto excise taxes, with $60 million going to pension funds for teachers, police officers and firefighters. The scratch-off tickets sales growth follows the lottery’s long-term strategy to attract more players enticed by the regular release of new instant games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: When state Sen. Joe Bolkcom asked in June how much it would cost to deploy Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Department of Public Safety said expenses wouldn’t be calculated until the mission was completed. The response ignored that the state agency had run its own internal cost estimate a week before the since-completed deployment had even been made public, according to records reviewed by the Des Moines Register. The department recently released more than 2,200 pages of emails in response to a joint records request from the Register and the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced June 24 that troopers would be deployed to the border after Texas asked for help with an influx of migrants. The announcement led legislators and the media to ask questions of the Department of Public Safety and Iowa State Patrol. At the onset, Iowa officials issued scant details about the operations, citing concerns for officer safety. They did not cite that for costs. On June 17, Iowa State Patrol Maj. Robert Hansen sent top department officials an initial cost estimate: $383,700.24 to cover a 16-day deployment of 28 troopers of various ranks. Initial cost estimates after they returned were shy of $300,000, department Commissioner Stephan Bayens said at a July 28 news conference.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: If the Evel Knievel museum moves to Las Vegas, the owner of the museum dedicated to the daredevil has pledged to repay $117,000 it has received from the city of Topeka since it opened in 2017. It was reported earlier this month that the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, may move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Museum owner Mike Patterson told city officials in a meeting last week that he believes it is appropriate to repay the city even though it might not be required in the incentive contract the museum signed. Patterson said private loans were the main source of funding for the roughly $3.5 million museum. But it was also slated to receive up to $300,000 from the city over 12 years if it continued operating in Topeka. The money it received came from the city’s tax on hotel stays. City Council member Spencer Duncan said Topeka will make sure future incentive contracts with businesses include terms that require businesses to repay the incentives they received if they do leave the city.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear has declared this week Healthcare Heroes Appreciation Week in honor of the doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic staff, and others who have helped the Bluegrass State during the COVID-19 pandemic. “They are heroes. They have earned that title,” Beshear said at a press briefing Thursday, urging local businesses and community members to find ways to show gratitude for health care workers. The most important way, he said, is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Let’s make sure that everywhere these health care heroes go, they see how much we care,” the Democratic governor said. Following a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling impacting his executive authority, Beshear on Monday rescinded his executive order requiring masks in schools. The move came a day before a federal judge is scheduled to decide whether to continue a temporary restraining order preventing the mandate from being enforced. Without an order to block, the legal challenge is likely moot. A separate mask mandate for public schools from the Kentucky Department of Education still stands, as does a similar measure for child care centers from the Department of Public Health. Without a mandate in place, private schools across the state are now able to adopt mask-optional policies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 20 government agencies, universities and electric utilities in the state soon will be getting electric vehicle charging stations worth more than $1.7 million. The Department of Environmental Quality is awarding grants to 26 entities for 82 charging stations, using money from the state’s $19.8 million share from a settlement worth nearly $3 billion between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen over violations of the Clean Air Act, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Volkswagen sold about 590,000 vehicles equipped with devices that worked against their air pollution control features, resulting in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide. Almost $12 million of Louisiana’s share of the 2016 settlement was set aside to replace 351 diesel engine buses owned by 16 school boards. The new engines will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Another $7.3 million was given to the state Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Agriculture to replace old diesel equipment and vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s $1,500 bonus to attract new workers back to the workforce this summer during the pandemic hasn’t been successful. Only about 5% of the 7,500 people whom the $10 million program could cover have been declared provisionally eligible, the Bangor Daily News reports. An extended deadline to file applications closed Friday. The bonus for new employees who work at least eight weeks and meet other criteria equates to about two weeks of unemployment pay. It may not have been enough to entice workers to give up benefits or to get overworked employers to handle the extra paperwork that the program entails, said Steve Hewins, executive director of the industry group HospitalityMaine. Maine’s neighbor to the west has had a bit more success. New Hampshire, which stopped the enhanced unemployment benefits in June, drew 700 applicants to its $1,000 return-to-work program in the first four weeks after it started July 19. In contrast, Maine had attracted only 400 applicants since mid-June.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The woeful record of the Baltimore Orioles is combining with the coronavirus pandemic to cost the state millions of dollars in rent payments. The Baltimore Sun reports the Major League Baseball team’s rent payments to the Maryland Stadium Authority have dropped precipitously in the past year due to low attendance and loss of ballpark-generated revenue. The Orioles paid $1.6 million in rent to the Stadium Authority for the use of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the fiscal year ending June 30. The team’s average annual rent of its 30-year lease has been $6.8 million. The rent payments are based on a percentage of ticket sales, concessions, parking and stadium advertising. The team has the worst record in the majors, and attendance is sparse. During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, fans were not allowed in the stadium at all. The rent money is used specifically for the maintenance of the ballpark. Stadium officials say they have curtailed maintenance expenses accordingly. The rent losses are in addition to the loss of admission taxes on ticket sales. The newspaper based its reporting on data obtained under the state’s Public Information Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNatick: A retired flight attendant pushing an airline beverage cart more than 200 miles from Boston to New York City to honor colleagues who died during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is well on his way. Paul Veneto, 62, resumed his 20th anniversary journey Monday after a night at the Verve Hotel in Natick, two days after starting his trek at Logan International Airport and a day after braving drenching rains from the Henri storm system. He plans on pushing the cart – decorated with photos of all the 9/11 airline crews for inspiration and courage – to ground zero by Sept. 10. “I look on top of this cart, I see these crew members’ faces, every time my legs hurt, it’s cold, rainy, they’re smiling back at me, the pain goes away,” Veneto said Saturday before he departed. The walk called Paulie’s Push will benefit the families of his former colleagues as well as Power Forward 25, a nonprofit that assists people dealing with addiction. Veneto himself is in recovery from an opioid dependency caused in part by the attacks. “I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized,” he said Saturday. United Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center’s south tower, was Veneto’s regular run. But he had the day off Sept. 11, 2001. The Braintree resident spent 30 years as a flight attendant for five different airlines.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Bloomfield Township woman who won the grand $2 million prize in the state’s COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes said Monday that she and her husband will save money for their three kids’ college education, remodel their house and donate a portion to improve mental health services. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Christine Duval left her full-time job as a project manager for a language training company in Troy to help her daughter, now 10, with remote learning after her school closed. She and her husband got their first COVID-19 shots in early April and their second ones weeks later. Their 18- and 15-year-old sons also are vaccinated. Winning $2 million “will help us achieve all of our dreams,” Duval said. “We are really lucky and want to give back to those in need. The pandemic was tough on everyone, and we believe the need for providing services that promote positive mental health care is more important than ever.” The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes program was designed to boost the vaccination rate in July. The weekly number of people getting a first shot across the state rose for four straight weeks between July 11 and Aug. 7 before dropping in the past two weeks. About 65% of residents ages 16 and up have received at least one dose, federal data shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Igor Vovkovinskiy, the tallest man in the United States, has died at age 38. His family said the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. His mother, Svetlana Vovkovinska, an ICU nurse at Mayo, initially posted about his death on Facebook. Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic in 1989 as a child seeking treatment. A tumor pressing against his pituitary gland caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the U.S. at 7 feet, 8.33 inches and ended up staying in Rochester. His older brother, Oleh Ladan of Brooklyn Park, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Vovkovinskiy was a celebrity when he arrived from Ukraine because of his size and the flickering Cold War of the late 1980s. But Ladan said Vovkovinskiy “would have rather lived a normal life than be known.” Vovkovinskiy appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and was called out by President Barack Obama during a campaign rally in 2009, when the president noticed him near the stage wearing a T-shirt that read: “World’s Biggest Obama Supporter.” In 2013, he carried the Ukrainian contestant onto the stage to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi Poison Control Center officials say they are receiving an influx of calls from people trying to treat COVID-19 by using anti-parasite medicine purchased at livestock stores. At least 70% of recent calls to the center have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers, Mississippi Department of Health officials said. Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization, though no hospitalizations have been reported. Most callers – 85% – have had mild symptoms, according to the Department of Health. “Patients should be advised to not take any medications intended to treat animals and should be instructed to only take ivermectin as prescribed by their physician,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a memo Friday. “Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans.” Ivermectin tablets are approved for human use at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical formulations for head lice and skin conditions. Ivermectin is not a drug for treating viruses.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Two groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions argued in a petition filed Monday that a man who has spent more than 20 years in prison for killing his mother did not commit the crime. Michael Politte was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2002. He was 14 when his mother, Rita Politte, was burned to death inside their home in Hopewell, eastern Missouri, in 1998. The Midwest Innocence Project and the MacArthur Justice Center argue in the petition filed with the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District that Politte was convicted because of a biased investigation, faulty science and an incompetent defense at trial. Michael Politte and a friend were sleeping when they awoke to smoke early Dec. 5, 1998. Michael told authorities he found his mother’s burning body in her bedroom as he and his friend tried to escape, according to the petition. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The petition alleges fire investigators quickly decided the fire was started with gasoline, and police immediately zeroed in on her son as a suspect, although no blood or other injuries were found on him. Investigators also said he did not show much emotion or remorse in the following days. Law enforcement did not investigate other viable suspects, the attorneys say.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge has ordered the director of the state’s public defender office to appear before him next month to explain why her office is failing to assign public defenders to Billings-area cases in a timely manner and why she shouldn’t be held in contempt of court. District Judge Donald Harris set a Sept. 13 hearing for Rhonda Lindquist, The Billings Gazette reports. The director of the Office of Public Defender is required to ensure that qualified attorneys are immediately assigned after a judge assigns cases to the public defender’s office, according to Harris’ order, which was signed Tuesday. At times, public defenders have a conflict of interest in representing a defendant. When that happens, their case is assigned to the agency’s Conflict Office to hire an outside attorney. The managing attorney for the Conflict Office told Harris that as of July 31, his office had a backlog of 663 unassigned cases. State law requires the Office of Public Defender to immediately assign a lawyer to any case in which a judge designates the office as counsel. Harris said the office has not been able to meet this obligation for months, causing “significant delays in conducting court proceedings and jeopardizes the administration of justice.” The state’s jobs website lists postings for three public defenders and an appellate defender.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state currently appears relatively safe on some national websites tracking the spread of COVID-19, but state health officials say those maps aren’t accurate. The problem is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using different data for Nebraska since the state retired its website that reported coronavirus figures daily and started reporting updates weekly with fewer details. So two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties shouldn’t be colored blue on the CDC map, indicating low COVID-19 transmission rates, at a time when cases are surging statewide, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “The color blue on the map may not be an accurate representation of transmission rates,” said Olga Dack, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has nearly doubled from 374.14 new cases per day Aug. 6 to 727.57 new cases per day Friday. In its most recent update, the state said Wednesday that 2,676 cases had been reported in the previous week – more than 10 times higher than the 253 cases per week the state reported in late June. Dack said the state continues to report county-level virus data to the CDC, but the agency hasn’t been using that for some technical reasons.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Several organizations led by women of color have banded together to shed light on the ways the state’s low-income and diverse communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution. The advocacy groups are creating a website, breathefreenv.com, that aims to raise awareness about climate change and steps that can be taken to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and lower energy costs for families, especially in low-income communities. Erika Washington, executive director of Make It Work Nevada, one of the groups involved in the effort, told the Las Vegas Sun that Black communities have not received as much outreach about climate change or the environment as white communities. “It’s been very white-led for a very long time,” said Washington, who is Black. “You have to include the people who are closest to the issue in order to actually make any sort of change.” Along with Make It Work Nevada, other groups participating include Battle Born Progress, CHISPA, Make the Road Nevada, Mi Familia Vota Nevada, the Faith Organizing Alliance and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund. All seven groups are led by women of color.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Revenue has completed a three-year project aimed at providing a better online experience for taxpayers. The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, launched the first phase of its online user portal and revenue management system in 2019. The final phase of the Granite Tax Connect portal was completed this month, allowing tax preparers and others to file taxes electronically, schedule automated payments, check on the status of refunds, and complete other tasks. Officials said the system could serve about 148,000 taxpayers. The portal also can be used to anonymously report suspected tax fraud.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state joined a small but growing list of places Monday to require COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers and state workers or for them to undergo regular coronavirus testing. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the new mandate during a news conference, saying pre-K-12 teachers and staff and state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or get tested once or twice a week. New Jersey has about 130,000 public school teachers, 1.3 million public school students and an estimated 70,000 state workers. “Scientific data shows that vaccination and testing requirements, coupled with strong masking policies, are the best tools for keeping our schools and communities safe for in-person activities,” Murphy said. The Democratic governor, who’s running for reelection this year, announced the move just as schools across the state prepare to begin the new academic year. The decision follows an announcement earlier this month to require staff, students and visitors to wear masks on school grounds. The state’s biggest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, supported the order, as did the state’s School Nurses Association and the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The ritual burning of a giant, ghostly marionette in the city will be a hybrid event this year. Organizers of the Zozobra burning said they are planning to limit in-person attendance to 10,000 while also broadcasting the event on television and online. The nighttime spectacle that’s been transformed by modern pyrotechnics is in its 97th year. A team of a dozen puppeteers heaves on cords to flex the groaning marionette’s arms, head and jaw. Will Shuster, a painter from Philadelphia who migrated to the Southwest, created Zozobra, a name derived from a Spanish word for “anguish.” Donations from energy companies ensured the event could move forward Sept. 3. It typically happens around Santa Fe’s weeklong community fiestas that include historic and religious processions. Anyone attending in person must prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the event. Face masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe uses the event to raise money for youth charities. Organizers said they’ll tweak the event as needed to comply with federal and state public health orders.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Andrew Cuomo defended his record over a decade as governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a “media frenzy” Monday as he prepared for a midnight power transfer that will make Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul the state’s first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11:59 p.m., just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations. In a prerecorded farewell address released at noon, Cuomo boasted of making government effective in his years in office, cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic and struck a defiant tone on the harassment allegations. He said the report that triggered his resignation – a scathing account of what Attorney General Letitia James said was sexual harassment or inappropriate touching of 11 women – was “designed to be a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work,” Cuomo said. He also touted his “progressive” record and positioned himself as a bulwark against his party’s left-wing faction that he said wants to “defund the police” and “demonize businesses.” He touted New York’s long-awaited passage of same-sex marriage under his administration, as well as gun control legislation and a law setting an eventual statewide $15 minimum wage.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of state residents who have been convicted of felonies but whose current punishments don’t include prison time can register to vote and cast ballots, a judicial panel declared Monday. Several civil rights groups and ex-offenders who sued legislative leaders and state officials in 2019 argue the current 1973 law is unconstitutional by denying the right to vote to people who have completed their active sentences or received no such sentence, such as people on probation. They said the rules disproportionately affect Black residents. In a brief hearing following a trial last week challenging North Carolina’s voting restrictions upon felons, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell said two judges on the three-judge panel have agreed they will issue a formal order soon allowing more felony offenders to vote. The judges are acting before issuing a final ruling from the trial, as voting in October municipal elections begins next month. The law says felons can register to vote again once they complete all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. With Bell’s ruling, felons who only must complete these punishments that have no element of incarceration can register again.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A petroleum company has reported a saltwater spill in northwestern North Dakota to state regulators. The Bismarck Tribune reports Whiting Oil and Gas says the spill occurred Thursday. The company told regulators that a broken fitting in a pipeline system operated by Goodnight Midstream resulted in the spill at a well site 11 miles south of Stanley in Mountrail County. The company said 1,400 barrels containing 58,800 gallons of saltwater spilled but were contained, and most of the fluid has been recovered. Saltwater, also known as brine, can come up along with oil and gas from a well. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division said a state inspector has visited the site and will monitor cleanup efforts.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: More than 120 activists, scholars, pastors, students and average citizens attended the first hearing Monday of a new panel charged with redrawing state legislative districts for the next 10 years, most advocating new maps that are more fair and representative. Witnesses at the first of nine public hearings of the Ohio Redistricting Commission at Cleveland State University maligned the current gerrymandered maps and called the process disheartening, embarrassing, demoralizing and unfair. “My vote doesn’t count,” Daisie Reish, 77, of Grafton, told the panel. “I call my representatives constantly, and they never vote for me. They always vote the opposite.” Person after person – young, old, Black, Muslim, immigrant, and people whose families have lived in the area for generations – told the panel they feel disadvantaged and unheard by their government as a result of the current district maps. Meanwhile, Tom Hach, executive director of Free Ohio Now, complained that all nine of the commission’s hearings will be held at universities, which he said don’t attract a diversity of political participation. He called the process unfair and said commissioners, the majority of whom are Republicans, were being bullied by Democrats. An Associated Press analysis has found Ohio to have some of the nation’s most gerrymandered maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Blocks from where she initiated one of the nation’s first sit-in movements, civil rights icon Clara Luper is now memorialized in the name of the city’s downtown post office. Luper’s descendants, former students and original “sit-inners” joined local dignitaries Saturday for the dedication of the Clara Luper Post Office Building, formerly called the Center City Station. Luper’s daughter, Chelle Luper Wilson, said her mother would want others to take it as a call to action against inequality. “One of the things I know she would say is she never wanted her name to just be a symbolic gesture,” Wilson said. “She was never about symbolism without any action. She was about structural and systemic change. I know she would want people whenever they see her name not to just think, ‘Oh great, what a great woman,’ but hope it sparks them to become passionate about a cause.” Luper, a longtime public school teacher, died in 2011 at age 88. The renaming coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the Oklahoma City sit-in movement. Luper and a group of Black schoolchildren arrived at the whites-only lunch counter of Katz Drug Store on Aug. 19, 1958, and refused to leave until they were served. It was the beginning of a successful six-year campaign to end racial segregation in Oklahoma City establishments.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Opposing rallies that drew hundreds of people sparked clashes Sunday. The two groups had gathered in different parts of the city after a far-right group changed the location of its event. The right-wing rally drew about 100 people in a parking lot of a former Kmart store, and clashes began as it wound down, KOIN-TV reports. A van tried to drive into the parking lot but crashed, and the driver ran away. Demonstrators then began igniting fireworks and similar devices. It was not immediately clear whether anyone suffered serious injuries. Later, shots were fired near demonstrators downtown. Dustin Brandon Ferreira, 37, a left-wing activist, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was with others Sunday evening when a man used a slur against a Black man in the group and then fired multiple rounds in their direction. Portland police said the man was arrested. No one was injured. Demonstrations associated with anti-fascists had earlier drawn more than 200 people downtown. The plans for the opposing demonstrations had prompted Portland police to call in all available police personnel. Sunday’s event fell on the one-year anniversary of a particularly violent political clash in which opposing groups brawled on the street next to police headquarters for hours.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More drivers have been hitting the road as coronavirus restrictions have loosened, and it’s showing in the number of those who have been caught speeding through photo-enforced construction zones. The state has issued more than 220,000 violations in the first seven months of this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Nearly $2.9 million has been collected in fines so far, higher than the $1.7 million remitted in 2020, said Jennifer Kuntch, a spokeswoman for PennDOT. Drivers receive a warning for the first offense, but second and subsequent violations carry a fine. Traffic volumes were down last year because of the pandemic, and that led to fewer violations than what might have been expected, Kuntch said. Meanwhile, the program remains on track to double its speed camera deployments this year. PennDOT is expecting to see a downward trend in violations through the rest of the year, Kuntch said. Based on evaluating Maryland’s trends and in having consistent deployments to the same work zones in Pennsylvania, drivers begin to comply with the speed limits, which leads to fewer violations, she said. In addition, drivers tend to watch their speed after getting their first warning.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are warning residents about a fake form circulating that purports to give the bearer a medical or religious exemption from coronavirus mask requirements. The certificate even includes a Rhode Island Department of Health logo, the agency said in a tweet Sunday. “It was not developed by RIDOH or any official source, should not be filled out, and should not/will not be accepted by any entity, as the form is not legitimate,” the department wrote in the tweet. The agency did not say where the fake certificate originated. The state has recently been restoring mask mandates for some indoor spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. Last week Gov. Daniel McKee issued an executive order requiring masks in K-12 schools for the upcoming school year regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Before the order, McKee had simply recommended masks for schoolchildren, leaving the final decision up to individual school districts. But state officials said more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s new coronavirus cases are among children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccination against the disease.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Prosecutors are now required to share evidence of innocence they find even after a defendant is convicted of a crime. The changes to the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct were announced last week, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina is joining about two dozen other states with the rules, which were first developed by the American Bar Association in 2008. They require a prosecutor to disclose any information when they become aware of “credible, material” evidence that indicates a defendant was wrongfully convicted to the defendant or defense attorney as well as the chief prosecutor where the person was tried. Prosecutors who have “clear and convincing” evidence that a person was wrongfully convicted in their jurisdiction then have an ethical obligation to remedy the conviction, according to the new rules. Prosecutors will have discretion to determine what exactly crosses the threshold of the new rules, said John Freeman, professor emeritus for the University of South Carolina School of Law. The rules also protect a defendant even after exhausting all normal appeals, Freeman said. “What this says, basically, is that so long as there is a possibility of proof surfacing that shows that the guy is innocent, it ain’t over,” he said. “And, frankly, isn’t that the way it should be?”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state is facing a shortage of nurses at a time when they are needed most, officials say. South Dakota News Watch reports that stress, long hours and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused more nurses than usual to leave the field, move to other states or retire early. From 2015 to 2016, about 1,700 registered nurses left South Dakota. Last year, more than 2,500 nurses dropped out of the state workforce. “The pandemic just kind of burned them out,” said Michelle Bruns, a spokeswoman for the nursing program at Oglala Lakota College. “It’s a tough situation.” The state’s higher education system has not produced enough nursing graduates to keep up with a growing population and rising demand for health care services, and educators are scrambling to find ways to lure more students and produce degrees more quickly. Meanwhile, a shortage of nurses in other states has raised competition to attract new graduates and experienced providers, but South Dakota health care systems are at a competitive disadvantage because median pay for nurses in the state is the lowest in the nation, according to federal labor data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The University of Tennessee announced Monday that it will extend its mask mandate to all indoor public spaces due to the ongoing spike in coronavirus cases and increasing hospitalizations. UT had been under a temporary mask mandate that only applied to classrooms, laboratories and indoor academic student events. Officials say the new requirement will extend to all indoor public spaces, but exceptions will include private offices, residence hall rooms and while engaging in fitness activities. According to a news release, the university will “re-evaluate the need for the expanded face-covering requirement by Sept. 7.” “While we are trying to do our part to keep our campuses healthy, we continue to stress the importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” UT System President Randy Boyd said in a statement. As of Monday, Tennessee has seen 13,135 COVID-19-related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. That death count is the 15th highest in the country overall and the 24th highest per capita at 194 deaths per 100,000 people. The state is averaging 2,508.3 current COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to data through Aug. 20 from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Dell Medical School at the University of Texas is beginning a three-year study using video games and virtual reality to try to rewire the brains of teens with epilepsy. It’s taking the concept of neuroplasticity – that brains can create new pathways after an injury – and seeing if brains also can create the new pathways before the injury ever occurs. In this case, the injury is surgery to the affected area of the brain that is causing the epileptic seizures. The study is funded by a $2.5 million grant from the Coleman Fung Foundation. Fung is the founder of software company Open Link Financials Inc., and his Austin-based business venture, Blue Goji, is a wellness technology company that uses treadmills, virtual reality and video gaming to create a fitness experience. Dell Medical School will receive two Infinity treadmill virtual realty game systems from Blue Goji to use in the study. Dr. David Paydarfar, chair of Dell Medical School’s department of neurology and the study’s lead researcher, said that while people have studied neuroplasticity for decades, this study will actually implement the research. Previously, it was like studying rocket science without trying to go to the moon. The study is targeting 15- to 20-year-olds with epilepsy who need to have surgery to stop their seizures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A ban on school districts requiring masks is forcing parents of vulnerable kids to wrestle with the painful choice of whether to risk coronavirus infections at school or keep them at home yet again, according to a lawsuit filed Monday. Parents like Jessica Pyper say a Utah law that blocks districts from passing mandates wrongly prevents children from getting a safe education. She wants her 10-year-old son, Ryker, to join his fifth grade classmates this year, but his Type 1 diabetes puts him at serious risk. “It just sort of seems like nobody cares,” she said. “Kids with disabilities often get left behind. They don’t get considered when these types of decisions are being made.” The case filed by a group of nine parents is the latest U.S. lawsuit of its kind from families and educators concerned about school without masks as the highly contagious delta variant surges. Officials, mostly Republican, contend that there are downsides to kids being masked all day and that parents should have the power to decide whether to put them on children, who tend to be less vulnerable to the virus than older adults. The lawsuit was filed against Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, whose office didn’t immediately respond to messages requesting comment, and Republican Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who declined comment.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development has launched its latest relocation program to get workers to move to Vermont – especially cooks, servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. The reimbursement grants are for up to $7,500 for “eligible expenses” after moving. The online application for the grants requires proof of residency and documentation of eligible expenses. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018, the Legislature created the remote worker grant program, which offered reimbursement grants of up to $10,000 for workers who could relocate to the state and bring their current job with them. The next year, in 2019, the Legislature created the worker relocation grant program, which offered reimbursement grants to move to the state and take a job. The two programs together have awarded more than 300 grants to “newly settled Vermonters” in towns across the state, according to a news release. The worker relocation program is available to those who relocate to Vermont on or after July 1, 2021, and fill one of the qualifying positions with a Vermont employer. Remote worker grants are for those who relocate on or after Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Monday urged all employers to require COVID-19 vaccines for eligible workers, sharpening a policy debate in the governor’s race over how best to deal with the pandemic. McAuliffe’s call followed a decision by federal regulators to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The former governor now seeking a second term has previously urged Virginia health systems and school divisions to issue mandates and required his own campaign staff to be fully inoculated. McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer, in the November general election. Youngkin has consistently urged Virginians to get COVID-19 shots but said he opposes vaccine or mask mandates. At a campaign event last week, the former co-CEO of the Carlyle Group was asked about his approach to managing the pandemic as the delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “First of all, we pray it’s behind us every day,” he said. “My expectation is, this virus is tough. And so first thing that I would ask everybody to do is get the vaccine.” He said in a statement Monday that McAuliffe was trying to “bully” Virginians and businesses into compliance with a step that will “clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again.”\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Authorities say they have found the first Asian giant hornet nest of 2021 in a rural area of the state, about a quarter-mile from where a resident reported seeing one of the hornets earlier this month. The Washington State Department of Agriculture narrowed the search area last week and located the nest east of Blaine, department officials said. Crews found the nest Thursday after they followed a hornet that was equipped with a tracking device, KOMO reports. Crews were able to net and tag three hornets between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. State entomologists will now develop a plan to eradicate the nest, most likely this week. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: An annual festival that celebrates a local legend about a “Mothman” has been called off for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant announced the festival’s cancellation Thursday. It had been set for next month. The organizers said in a statement that thousands of people pack the town along the Ohio River during the festival and that local health officials predict rising COVID-19 cases could peak around that time. “We are disappointed, but it was not an easy decision to make, we can assure you of that,” the statement said. Mothman is a mysterious creature with glowing red eyes that witnesses described seeing in 1966 and 1967. It was the subject of the 2002 film “The Mothman Prophecies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Residents who get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine between Aug. 20 and Labor Day will receive a $100 gift card, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday. The reward being offered just as students return to school is Wisconsin’s latest incentive designed to entice those who have yet to be inoculated to receive the shots. As of Monday, just over 50% of the state’s entire population and 61% of adult residents were fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Many other states have offered similar programs to get more people vaccinated. Recently in Wisconsin, attendees at the state fair who got vaccinated received a free cream puff. More than 600 fairgoers took advantage of that promotion. The $100 Visa gift card will be available to anyone age 12 and up who gets their first shot during the 18-day eligibility window that closes Sept. 6. To receive the gift card, those being vaccinated will need to fill out an application form, available at 100.wisconsin.gov. The cards will be mailed up to six weeks later. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths caused by the more contagious delta variant have spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: The outdoor gear and clothing company Patagonia has stopped providing its merchandise for sale at a Wyoming ski resort to protest the owners’ sponsorship of a Republican fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other top supporters of former President Donald Trump. Well known for decades for its outspoken support of progressive causes and environmentalism, Patagonia in the past has brought unwanted attention to Facebook and Instagram and the Outdoor Retailer shows in Salt Lake City. Now, the company’s activism could spell trouble – among left-leaning skiers, at least – for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. A major tourism destination in Wyoming, the resort known for its bright red gondola car and logo with a silhouetted bucking horse and rider is among the best-known brands from one of the most Republican states. “We join with the local community that is using its voice in protest. We will continue to use our business to advocate for stronger policies to protect our planet, end hate speech and support voting rights and a strong democracy,” Patagonia spokeswoman Corley Kenna said in a statement. The boycott, first reported by WyoFile, means Patagonia merchandise won’t be available in three shops at the resort that Kenna said were Patagonia’s largest account in Jackson Hole.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/18/gator-rebound-paragliding-sea-turtle-protections-news-around-states/119060514/", "title": "Gator rebound, paragliding at 103, sea turtle protections: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A divided state school board has cemented rules that ban so-called critical race theory teachings from K-12 classrooms and limit how educators can talk about race in the classroom. The decision drew sharp criticism from opponents who said the language could prevent honest conversations and lessons about history and race. The Alabama State Board of Education voted 7-2 on Thursday to put the measure in the state administrative code, news outlets report. It instructs schools to follow a previous resolution that bans “concepts that impute fault, blame, a tendency to oppress others, or the need to feel guilt or anguish to persons solely because of their race or sex.” It also bans theories that promote political ideologies or “one race or sex above another.” The Rev. Rayford Mack of Montgomery called the resolution an “anti-truth” measure, al.com reports. “It is a dangerous step backwards that has emerged from a coordinated national effort to suppress our nation’s history and to deny the experience of Black people and other people of color,” he said. Board members in August first approved the measure in August. Alabama Superintendent Eric Mackey said critical race theory is not currently taught in Alabama schools, but board members wanted to take action that would be preventative.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives’ annual convention, the largest gathering of Indigenous people in the state, will be fully virtual this year, organizers announced Friday. The decision was made after federation leaders consulted with state federal and tribal health officials and reviewed current COVID-19 data trends, according to a statement. The federation decided to go all-virtual out of concern for the safety of the thousands of people from across the state who normally attend in person, the statement said. Organizers cited the continuing high rates of COVID-19, transmission, hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in Anchorage, the statement said. Alaska currently has the highest number of cases in the past seven days per 100,000 population among the 50 states, the state health department said Thursday in its weekly case update. “The incidence of COVID-19 in the Municipality of Anchorage appears to have either plateaued or be increasing. Regardless of the trajectory, intense community transmission is continuing to occur and is causing significant illness, death, and demand on the health care system,” the report says. “Safety is paramount to our decision,” said Sheri Buretta, chair of Alaska Federation of Natives convention committee, who also noted social distancing guidelines would be hard to meet.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has rejected the Republican-controlled state Senate’s contention that it can withhold a raft of communications between its leaders and private contractors they hired to conduct an unprecedented review of the 2020 election results in the state’s most populous county. The ruling released Thursday evening is the latest in a series of losses for the Senate stemming from its efforts to keep secret records showing how the review was conducted. A watchdog group called American Oversight had sued to compel their release and repeatedly won. The Arizona Republic has a separate lawsuit seeking records from the election review. The Senate has already released tens of thousands of records after court rulings in the American Oversight case found they were covered by the state’s public records law. It was trying to shield more than 1,000 other texts and emails. American Oversight said it is fighting for the public’s right to know how the partisan audit was funded and how Cyber Ninjas and other private contractors hired by the Senate conducted the review. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Kemp’s ruling said the Senate’s position that the records were covered by legislative privilege was flat wrong. He said that privilege is intended to protect debate about pending legislation.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State Attorney General Leslie Rutledge raised $190,970 over the past three months in her bid for governor, her campaign said Friday, as she continued trailing former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in fundraising for the state’s top office. Rutledge’s campaign said the latest contributions brought her total fundraising haul to more than $1.6 million since she announced her candidacy last year. Rutledge spent $259,134 during the quarter and reported having more than $1 million cash on hand. Sanders a day earlier reported raising $2.1 million during the quarter and having $7 million in the bank for her bid. The two are running in next year’s Republican primary. Friday was the deadline for candidates to file their quarterly fundraising reports with the state. Rutledge said more than 80% of her contributions are from Arkansans. All but $3.7 million of the $11 million Sanders has raised total has come from out-of-state donors. “I will continue to keep my campaign focused on Arkansas and issues that are important to Arkansans,” Rutledge said in a statement. The two are running to succeed Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. Chris Jones, a Democratic candidate, on Thursday reported raising more than $384,000 during the quarter.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state has added the Pacific leatherback sea turtle to its endangered species list, guaranteeing more protections for a rapidly dwindling population. The California Fish and Game Commission voted Thursday to add the turtles under the state’s Endangered Species Act. The world’s largest turtle species has been on the federal endangered species list since 1973. But scientists now know more about how crucial California is to its survival, according to Catherine Kilduff, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. A subpopulation of leatherback sea turtles hatches on beaches in Indonesia. Once fully grown, the reptiles swim nearly 6,000 miles to eat jellyfish off the California coast. Adult leatherback sea turtles weigh an average of 1,000 pounds. Scientists say these sea turtles have declined by about 5.6% in California each year for the past three decades. About 50 sea turtles visit the California coast each year, compared to about 178 turtles in the 1990s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Adding turtles to California’s endangered species list will make them a conservation priority for state agencies. It will also increase the state’s cooperation with federal agencies to protect the sea turtle population.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: The fire, floods and massive debris flows of the past year in Glenwood Canyon could help answer an aeons-old question – where exactly does the underground source of water that feeds Hanging Lake begin? The U.S. Forest Service is working with scientific consultants from the renowned Ozark Underground Laboratory out of southwest Missouri to conduct an experiment that may answer the question once and for all. The team recently placed special carbon samplers at key locations in Hanging Lake and at points where multiple springs emerge at the lake and Spouting Rock above the lake, as well as in nearby surface streams. Then, they traveled into the Flat Tops above Glenwood Canyon to place nontoxic fluorescent tracer dye into the water at various potential source points. The idea is that the dye will travel through the canyon’s extensive karst system of caves and sinkholes. Whichever color dye or dyes come out at Hanging Lake should identify the source. Water travels through limestone deposits deep underground and eventually pools amid the steep cliffs at what’s become one of the most popular hiking destinations within the White River National Forest. That passage through the travertine formation and the unique vegetation in and around the lake give Hanging Lake its unique turquoise-green color.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPreston: The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, which owns and operates Foxwoods Resort Casino, is seeking to develop a luxury RV resort on land the tribal nation has owned since 1994. The tribe and Blue Water Development Corp., of Ocean City, Maryland, recently filed plans for the proposed park in Preston, to include camping sites, a pool, a water slide, a splash pad, tennis and volleyball courts, a playground, a camp store and a picnic pavilion. The project, located just north of Foxwoods, will be discussed Tuesday at the Inlands Wetlands and Watercourses Commission meeting. Blue Water has completed eight projects of similar size and scope in various states. This latest project comes after a record number of recreational vehicles were sold over the past year in the U.S. “We have waited many years to find the best use and environmentally-conscious partner for this property as we look to thoughtfully enhance our resort experiences,” said Jason Guyot, president and CEO of Foxwoods, in a written statement. He has said previously that Foxwoods has long considered a high-end RV park option for its patrons.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The city’s two municipal beaches, formerly known as Beach 1 and Beach 2, are getting brand-new names. Beach 1, which sits at the end of Savannah Road, will now be known as Savannah Beach. Mayor Ted Becker said the geographic name seems “intuitive.” Just down the coast, the former Beach 2 has officially been renamed Johnnie Walker Beach – a nod to a prominent Black business owner who opened a restaurant there and created a welcoming atmosphere for Black families during segregation. While many people recall that the small port city of Lewes was largely known as a diverse and welcoming area in the 1950s and ’60s, Jim Crow laws still segregated significant parts of life – including the resort town’s two beaches. But Johnnie Walker’s, a restaurant and open-air pavilion where live music often played, was a place where people ate fish sandwiches and french fries, teenagers danced until their shoes were worn out, and families found a sense of belonging, according to people who shared stories from this time. Becker said the city is working with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to possibly recreate the Johnnie Walker pavilion on that beach.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Indigenous groups and other environmental activists marched to the Capitol on Friday as they continued a weeklong protest demanding that Congress and the Biden administration stop new fossil fuel projects and act with greater urgency on climate change. Nearly 80 people were arrested on the fifth day of the “People vs. Fossil Fuels” protest, bringing the total arrested during the week to more than 600, organizers said. Under a banner declaring “We did not vote for fossil fuels,” activists pressed President Joe Biden to stop approving new pipelines and other fossil fuel projects and declare a climate emergency. Demonstrators urged members of Congress to “listen to the people” who sent them to Washington and take urgent action to phase out fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Capitol Police said 78 people were arrested on obstruction or crowding charges. Three of those arrested also were charged with assault on a police officer. The Capitol protest followed a sit-in Thursday at the Interior Department in downtown Washington. The protest was part of “a historic surge of Indigenous resistance” in the nation’s capital that started last Monday, Indigenous Peoples’ Day, outside the White House, said Jennifer Falcon, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, part of the coalition that organized the protest.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The gunman who killed 14 students and three staff members at a Parkland high school will plead guilty to their murders, his attorneys said Friday, bringing some closure to a South Florida community more than three years after an attack that sparked a nationwide movement for gun control. The guilty plea would set up a penalty phase in which Nikolas Cruz, 23, would be fighting against the death penalty and hoping for life without parole. Cruz attorney David Wheeler told Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer that he will plead guilty Wednesday to 17 counts of first-degree murder in the February 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The pleas will come with no conditions, and prosecutors still plan to seek the death penalty. That will be decided by a jury, with the judge hoping to start the trial in January after choosing a jury from thousands of prospects starting in November. Cruz will also plead guilty to 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder. He was not initially present during the hearing but later entered the Broward County courtroom to plead guilty to attacking a jail guard nine months after the shooting. Cruz said he understood that prosecutors can use the conviction as an aggravating factor when they later argue for his execution.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: One of the world’s largest elevator towers will soon be opened to test elevators of the future as well as current ones high above the Atlanta suburbs. TK Elevators’ 420-foot tower is set to become fully operational early next year, company executives said during a tour of the new research lab and elevator testing facility. “This is going to transform our industry,” said Kevin Lavelle, CEO of the company’s North American operations. It’s the largest elevator test tower in the Western Hemisphere, according to the company and general contractor Brasfield & Gorrie, which built it. The tower with its multiple elevator testing shafts looks down into the Atlanta Braves’ stadium nearby and offers stunning views of the Atlanta skyline. It’s next door to the company’s new North American headquarters in Cobb County, just northwest of the city. Construction on the tower began in 2019 with 3,000 tons of steel, and the structure is now in place, with interior work still ongoing as TKE prepares to fully open it in February. Among concepts being tested in the high-rise: twin elevators, which use the same elevator shaft but operate independently, with one car above the other, Lavelle said. Twin elevators save space and are able to carry passengers more efficiently, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state can expect above-average rainfall during the upcoming wet season and potentially have more floods like last winter, the National Weather Service said Friday. Even so, Maui County and the Big Island may remain in drought and at greater risk for wildfires because the leeward sides of their islands won’t get as much rain. The strength of this year’s La Nina weather event will likely influence rainfall patterns across the island chain. La Nina is a cooling of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures near the equator and the flip side of a warmer El Nino pattern. Kevin Kodama, the weather agency’s senior service hydrologist in Honolulu, said La Nina is expected to be moderate this year. That will mean heavy rainfall on the windward sides of the islands and drier leeward sides during the wet season, which runs from this month through April. That’s similar to the last wet season. Under this scenario, Kauai and Oahu, which have some areas of moderate drought, will likely recover, but drought is expected continue on Maui County and the Big Island. Ranchers in leeward Maui County – areas currently in extreme and severe drought – have recently lost cattle due to the dry conditions. A lack of vegetation in the forests has pushed invasive Axis deer into farms, leading to agricultural losses.\n\nIdaho\n\nAmmon: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin held a news conference Thursday to defend her decision to refuse to release public records until she lost a lawsuit over the matter, criticizing the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and accusing several news organizations of lying in their coverage of the civil case. Her remarks at an elementary school in Ammon included campaign talk that may have violated a state law against campaigning on public school grounds. McGeachin held the event with Republican Attorney General candidate Art Macomber, of Coeur d’Alene, saying she wanted to “set the record straight” regarding the lawsuit from the Idaho Press Club. She refused to take any questions. “I know the media is very busy writing lies about me and my office,” she said. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. The panel was ordered to investigate allegations of “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system, something McGeachin said was necessary to “protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism and Marxism.” The journalists requested public feedback forms and other documents.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that she took her fight with the head of the city’s police officers union to court, arguing that his call for officers to ignore the order to report their COVID-19 vaccination status was illegal. The mayor said in a statement that the city’s law department filed a complaint in Cook County Circuit Court for injunctive relief against Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara, whom she accused of “engaging in, supporting and encouraging work stoppage or strike.” A judge on Friday evening granted the city’s request for a temporary injunction barring Catanzara from making any public comments that encourage FOP members to disobey the city’s vaccine mandate until the next hearing on the city’s lawsuit Oct. 25. Judge Cecilia Horan ruled there was potential irreparable harm if Catanzara continued such statements. City attorneys argued they were tantamount to him advocating “sedition” and “anarchy” because he was directing members to disobey an order from their superiors. Lightfoot said that by urging union members not to report their COVID-19 vaccination status by Friday’s deadline, Catanzara put the public in danger.\n\nIndiana\n\nKnox: An Israeli company has started work to build a solar energy farm that’s planned to cover some 13,000 acres across two northern Indiana counties when completed. Executives of Doral Renewables took part in a groundbreaking ceremony Thursday with Gov. Eric Holcomb and local officials for the project that is estimated to cost $1.5 billion to build over the next few years. The project, dubbed Mammoth Solar, will see solar panels erected in Starke and Pulaski counties, generating electricity that Doral will sell under a long-term agreement to American Electric Power for the Columbus, Ohio-based utility company to increase its renewable energy capacity. The solar farm’s first phase is expected become operational by mid-2023 and will produce 400 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 75,000 households, according to the company. Construction is planned to start next year on other phases of the farm, which will ultimately generate 1.65 gigawatts of electricity as those portions begin operating in 2024. Proposals for large solar farms have faced opposition in some places over loss of farmland. But Starke County Commissioner Mark Gourley said he was excited about the project coming to the rural area about 50 miles southwest of South Bend. “I’ve never in my life seen anything like this project here,” Gourley said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Republican leaders are calling for a new round of tax cuts after a state panel projected Friday that Iowa would take in more money this year than previously expected. Iowa’s three-member Revenue Estimating Conference, which sets the revenue projections that lawmakers use to form the state budget, has increased its revenue estimate for the next two budget years after the state saw an 11% year-over-year growth the year before. Panel members expect state revenues will continue to grow but at a more modest rate – about 1.5% – for each of the next two years. Iowa Republicans credited their budgeting practices and pandemic policies and immediately pointed to the results as reason to cut taxes. But Democrats said the credit for the state’s recovery should go to the federal pandemic relief package that Republicans opposed, and any new tax cuts should be sustainable and focus on middle-class families. Rep. Chris Hall, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, didn’t rule out agreement on tax cuts, but he said in a statement that Republicans need to also focus on investing in areas that will attract and keep families in Iowa. “Any tax changes made next session must be targeted to middle class families, not just the wealthy and special interests,” he said in the statement.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A task force formed three years ago to investigate clergy sexual abuse in Catholic dioceses across the state has received 215 tips and opened 122 cases, according to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Robert Jacobs, executive officer of the KBI, reported on the work of the agency’s Catholic Clergy Taskforce last week during a hearing of a state legislative committee. He said investigators set up a phone line and email address for people to report abuse, The Kansas City Star reports. The task force has been working with Catholic dioceses to review almost 40,000 diocesan records since its work began in 2019, Jacobs said. Along with considering a specific allegation, investigators are working to determine if the allegation was made to the diocese or to law enforcement “and what the follow-through was on that claim when it was initially made.” State Sen. Jeff Pittman, D-Leavenworth, questioned why no prosecutions had arisen from the investigation. “Why, with 40,000 different records, there doesn’t seem to be any action on this?” Pittman said. “Is the pursuit not revealing anything? I mean, it seems like there’s a lot in the news about this. What’s the story?” Jacobs said one issue has been that some of the alleged acts took place years ago. “Obviously, we run into time constraints,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Saying the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the necessity for accessible health care, Gov. Andy Beshear marked a milestone Friday for the state’s relaunched health insurance exchange, where consumers now can shop for health coverage for the coming year. Kentuckians can find out if they qualify for Medicaid and compare private plans on the state’s health care marketplace on the web portal, known as kynect, ahead of the enrollment period that begins Nov. 1. Open enrollment for existing recipients of Medicaid started Friday. In a state with high rates of cancer and other diseases, the portal signed up hundreds of thousands for health coverage before it was shut down by the previous governor. Beshear had already relaunched the state-run portal, and Friday marked the first day consumers could go on the website to review coverage plans for 2022. “People deserve easy access to information about their health plans and their benefits,” Beshear said. “It shouldn’t be hard to secure something that keeps you healthy and, in a pandemic, alive.” The Democratic governor was joined by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in promoting kynect, which offers a centralized place for Kentuckians to apply for health insurance coverage and other benefits.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Once-endangered alligators are thriving in the wild, so state authorities are proposing a deep cut in the percentage that farmers must return to marshes where their eggs were laid. “Over the past 50 years, alligator nest surveys have increased from an estimate of less than 10,000 in the 1970s and 1980s to well over 60,000 nests in recent years,” the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission said in a notice published Wednesday. “This increase in nesting has produced a population that can now be sustained with a much lower farm return rate.” The commission is taking comments until Jan. 4 on a proposal to cut that rate from 10% to 5%. The big armored reptiles don’t breed well in captivity, so farmers are allowed to collect eggs from nests as long as they return a percentage to the same area as youngsters big enough to foil predators other than people and much bigger alligators. Alligator hides are made into luxury leather for products including watchbands, boots and purses. The meat is used in sausages; companies also sell roasts, steaks, ribs, nuggets, jerky and even whole skinned alligators. Forelegs are marketed as “alligator wings.” Uncontrolled hunting nearly wiped out American alligators before Louisiana barred all hunting in 1962.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A law banning obscenities from license plates on Maine’s roads and highways goes into effect Monday, but removing such profanities in a state where such regulation has been unusually lax won’t happen overnight. Currently, there are license plates with salty language including f-bombs, references to anatomy and sex acts, and general insults. One license plate says simply “F---Y0U” – except it’s plainly spelled out. Now, rule-making is getting underway to ensure the law protects First Amendment rights while getting rid of obscene language. The process, which includes public comment, could take two to four months, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said. Requests for so-called vanity license plates that are deemed to be potentially offensive will be on hold in the meantime. Eventually, the state will begin recalling previously issued plates, likely this winter. A majority of states have restrictions on license plate messages that are considered profane, sexually suggestive, racist, drug-related, politically objectionable or religiously offensive. But Maine became the “wild, wild, wild west of vanity license plates” when the state dropped its review process in 2015. “Our anything-goes approach was unusual,” Bellows said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan proposed a $150 million boost in public safety spending Friday. The Republican governor dubbed the plan the “Re-Fund the Police Initiative” and decried “an all-out assault on the entire law enforcement community” at a news conference announcing the plan, The Baltimore Sun reports. The name is a play on the call to defund police, a tactic supporters say aims to address systemic problems in policing and direct spending to other needs, but Hogan called the idea “dangerous far-left lunacy.” The plan would put $45 million toward local law enforcement and $50 million toward state police agency raises and bonuses. It would also spend $24 million on body cameras and training and $10 million on neighborhood grants for safety improvements like lighting and security cameras. Hogan’s proposal would spend $20 million on victim protection, including $14 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to restore funding for victim services providers after federal cuts. The proposal also includes $1 million for the state’s police chief and sheriff’s associations. The governor is set to speak at a joint meeting of the two groups Monday. The General Assembly would need to approve most of the spending Hogan is proposing.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A high-tech buoy designed to enhance maritime safety is being installed in Buzzards Bay, state environmental officials said. The buoy that measures wave height, wave period, wave direction and surface water temperature every 30 minutes will be placed about 4 nautical miles southwest of Cuttyhunk Island, according to a statement last week from the state Department of Environmental Protection. The buoy is a joint project involving the state, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems. “The waters of Buzzards Bay and Cape Cod Bay are precious natural resources in Massachusetts, and we must continue to make strong efforts to protect them for both the public and marine species to benefit from,” state Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Kathleen Theoharides said. “Adding this new buoy in Buzzards Bay will expand Cape Cod’s marine safety network and help ensure safe passage for mariners traveling through these important waters.” The state is providing about $900,000 to purchase, install and operate the buoy. The money is coming from the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Trust Fund, established after a barge spilled 98,000 gallons of oil into the bay in 2003.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state must serve kosher meat, dairy and cheesecake to prisoners observing the Jewish Sabbath and holidays, a federal appeals court said, rejecting arguments that a special menu would be too costly and disruptive. The Corrections Department typically offers a vegan meal to anyone with religious dietary needs. But the appeals court said it was a “substantial burden” on the rights of prisoners who said they instead need meat and dairy to practice their Jewish faith. In a 3-0 opinion this week, the appeals court affirmed a decision by U.S. District Judge Linda Parker. The court analyzed the case under a federal law that protects the exercise of religion in a confined setting. Gerald Ackerman and Mark Shaykin sued after the state in 2013 adopted a vegan religious meal and said Jewish organizations could no longer send food for four holidays. Prisoners can purchase small kosher meat and dairy products at the commissary, but the food can’t be brought into the chow hall. Ackerman and Shaykin said they must eat the special food as meals, not snacks. They also believe they must eat kosher cheesecake on Shavuot, which recalls the ancient harvest of wheat and the delivery of the Torah to Jews. The appeals court said the “cheesecake issue is trickier” than meat and milk, but it affirmed the trial judge’s findings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRobbinsdale: Gov. Tim Walz said Friday that he’ll use the Minnesota National Guard to help alleviate staffing shortages at care facilities that are struggling to cope with the surge in COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated residents. “These folks need respite care. They’re at a breaking point. They can’t go anymore,” Walz said. The governor went to North Memorial Health Hospital to announce plans for relieving overstretched staffs at long-term care facilities that prevent hospitals from discharging patients into transitional care centers. More than 400 Minnesota hospital patients are currently waiting for beds to open up for incoming patients, he said. Walz said the number of soldiers who will provide that relief and their exact roles have yet to be determined, but it would be a “fairly large contingent.” “We’re not going to send untrained National Guard into an ICU unit, but we can give them the training necessary to provide … the long-term care for the other folks,” he said. Hospitals across Minnesota are at or near capacity, treating just over 1,000 COVID-19 patients. But officials say the problem is due not only to the coronavirus but also to other conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, trauma, scheduled surgeries and a backlog of procedures that began building up earlier in the pandemic.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Russell C. Davis Planetarium is undergoing renovations and expected to reopen at the end of 2023 with a fresh look and more extensive exhibits. This is the first renovation in decades at the site in downtown Jackson. Mike Williams, the planetarium manager, said the city is creating a world-class center for science and technology. “This is going to be something we can present to the world that is in diametrically opposed to a lot of the negative ideas people may have about our state,” Williams said. He said visitors will see interactive exhibits, including some using augmented and virtual technology. Exhibits will showcase recent space missions and projects by NASA and space travel by private companies, he said. He said he hopes new and updated exhibits will inspire students to explore science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers. “It’s a total investment in our kids and the people of our state,” Williams said. The planetarium closed in April 2018 because of a roof leak and interior damage. After the roof was repaired, the city announced in June 2020 that the planetarium would undergo renovations. Those are expected to cost $12 million or so, and plans include establishing a $2 million operational endowment, said John David Lewis, the city’s deputy director of cultural services.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three months after creation of a commission to identify cybersecurity risks in state government, Gov. Mike Parson has yet to appoint any members. A state lawmaker said Friday that vulnerabilities exposed on a state website prove the need for just such a panel of experts. Rep. Ashley Aune, D-Kansas City, helped write the section of Senate Bill 49 that created the Missouri Cybersecurity Commission. Parson, a Republican, signed the bill into law in mid-July. A St. Louis Post-Dispatch journalist uncovered a security flaw on a Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s web application that allowed the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. The newspaper found that the Social Security numbers of perhaps 100,000 teachers and other school officials from around the state were in HTML source code. The Post-Dispatch alerted the department Tuesday, and the agency removed the pages. The Post-Dispatch said it gave the state time to fix the problem before publishing a story Thursday. But Parson on Thursday announced a criminal investigation, alleging the journalist was “acting against a state agency to compromise teachers’ personal information in an attempt to embarrass the state and sell headlines for their news outlet. We will not let this crime against Missouri teachers go unpunished.” Aune accused Parson of a “smear campaign” against the Post-Dispatch journalist when it was Parson’s administration that stored the private information and left it unprotected.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University celebrated the grand opening of its American Indian Hall over the weekend, saying it will serve as a bridge between Native American culture and all other cultures on campus. The event Saturday began with a procession from the current American Indian Center – just over 1,000 square feet in the basement of Wilson Hall – to the new $20 million, 31,000-square-foot building. The procession was led by a Native American honor guard followed by flag-bearers with the state flag and others from Montana’s tribal nations, along with tribal dancers. The building will house the university’s Department of Native American Studies and a working space for the Senior Diversity and Inclusion officer. Classes will start there in January. It also has a kitchen, a drum room, and rooms for tutoring, counseling, advising and cultural ceremonies. Native American art is displayed, and there are furnishings crafted from trees removed from the site where the building now stands. The building is surrounded by gardens with indigenous plants that were planted by MSU Native American students and staff and is heated and cooled by 24 geothermal wells.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s attorney general said Friday that he won’t seek disciplinary action against doctors who prescribe controversial, off-label drugs to treat and prevent coronavirus infections, as long as they get informed consent from patients and don’t engage in misconduct. The office of Attorney General Doug Peterson released a legal opinion saying it didn’t see data to justify legal action against health care professionals who prescribe ivermectin, a decades-old parasite treatment, or hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that former President Donald Trump took to try to prevent a COVID-19 infection. “Based on the evidence that currently exists, the mere fact of prescribing ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 will not result in our office filing disciplinary actions,” the Republican attorney general said in the opinion. Many health experts and leading medical groups have been trying to stop the use of both drugs, arguing that they can cause harmful side effects and that there’s little evidence that they help. It’s also unclear whether many doctors are actually prescribing them in Nebraska or elsewhere, although a few isolated cases have emerged nationally.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The COVID-19 pandemic helped expose the growing vulnerability of Lake Tahoe’s increasingly tourism-dependent economy as housing costs balloon, year-round residency declines, and more workers commute from afar or seek jobs elsewhere, a new report says. The Tahoe Prosperity Center says the findings in the study it commissioned with the help of a grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration underscore the need to better diversify Tahoe’s economy, build more affordable housing and utilize an increasingly skilled workforce. “Exorbitant home prices, the high cost of living, long-haul commuters, a shortage of workers, and a flat to down economy over the past 10 years point to an economy that is not healing itself, nor resilient to disruptive changes that impact visitor-based economies more deeply,” the study said. Tourism now accounts for more than 60% of Lake Tahoe’s $5 billion regional economy – up from 40% in 2010, according to the nonprofit center’s research released last week. The report also pointed to the effects of climate change, which scientists say has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive, along with shifting snow and precipitation trends affecting the region’s ski resorts.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Mental health advocates are praising the state’s decision to expand services for children by purchasing a private, 111-bed psychiatric hospital. An association that represents the state’s 10 nonprofit community mental health centers called the news “a major milestone in our system.” “This is truly an investment in the future and will ensure that we strengthen our continuity of care,” said Brian Collins, president of the Community Behavioral Health Association. The cost of buying Hampstead Hospital and other details haven’t been determined, but it will be covered by federal pandemic relief funds pending approval of the legislative fiscal committee and Executive Council. The facility has had contracts with the state during the coronavirus pandemic to treat children in mental health crises. “Band-Aids and short-term solutions are not going to cut it,” Gov. Chris Sununu said while announcing Thursday that the state is in the final stages of the purchase. In late March 2020, for the first time in eight years, no one in New Hampshire was waiting in a hospital emergency room for an inpatient psychiatric bed. But the numbers went back up during the pandemic. By May 2021, more than 80 mental health patients, including record numbers of children, were waiting on any given day.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Orange: An apartment complex from which 45 families were abruptly evacuated due to a rock slide stemming from the remnants of Hurricane Ida will be demolished, according to the lawyer representing the property owner. Attorney Steven Eisenstein handed evacuees checks for returned security deposits, October’s rent and an extra $1,250 per unit to help cover relocation costs during a community meeting Thursday, NJ.com reports. Eisenstein said three engineering firms had recommended to owner John Jakimowicz that the Ron Jolyn Apartments in West Orange be demolished. “It’s not that he has any choice,” Eisenstein said. The red brick garden apartment complex was evacuated late last Monday hours after a township employee opened an email sent Friday night warning that a steep, rocky slope behind the apartments was unstable and could result in property damage and “possible loss of life.” Mayor Robert Parisi said the township would go on paying for the hotel accommodations of evacuees while they sought new permanent housing. Evacuees voiced anger and frustration with the evacuation conducted from 10 p.m. Monday to 1 a.m. Tuesday with no warning to tenants, who had little time to gather what belongings they could carry.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A judge on Friday denied a request by dozens of scientists and others at Los Alamos National Laboratory to block a vaccine mandate, meaning workers risked being fired if they didn’t comply with the lab’s afternoon deadline. The case comes as New Mexico extends a mask mandate for indoor spaces across the state, citing persistently high levels of community spread. While the vaccination rate among adults in New Mexico continues to hover below 72%, the lab confirmed Friday that 96% of employees are fully vaccinated. It’s not known how many workers have requested exemptions or how many could end up being fired for declining the shots. The legal challenge was backed by 114 scientists, nuclear engineers, research technicians, designers, project managers and other workers at the lab. Some are specialists and have high security clearance for the work they do, which ranges from national defense to infrastructure improvements and COVID-19 research. The workers claim that the mandate is a violation of their constitutional rights and that lab management has created a hostile work environment. Attorneys for the lab argued in court Thursday that being vaccinated was a condition of working at Los Alamos. State District Judge Jason Lidyard agreed, saying unvaccinated employees will have to find work elsewhere.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Democrat who will likely become the next mayor says he does not intend to get rid of the city’s program for gifted and talented students, nipping plans that outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio just announced. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said in an interview on CNN on Friday that de Blasio can’t get rid of the program in the nation’s largest school district until next year, when a new mayor is in place. Adams said he would preserve the program and expand opportunities for advanced learning. In response, the city’s department of education noted that Adams’ plans to expand accelerated learning in schools match the goals of de Blasio’s plan to replace the gifted and talented program. De Blasio, in a radio interview Friday, again defended his plan that would begin next year to phase out the program, which critics say favors white and Asian American students, while enrolling disproportionately few Black and Latino children. De Blasio said the district, with about 1 million students, would next year stop administering a screening test to 4-year-olds that’s used to identify gifted and talented students. Instead, he said the public school system would work to offer accelerated learning to all kindergarteners.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nElizabeth City: A northeastern North Carolina judge changed her voter registration from Democrat to Republican the day after she was sworn in to the job for which Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper appointed her. District Court Judge Jennifer Karpowicz Bland switched her registration Sept. 3, according to Dare County elections records. The former assistant district attorney was sworn in Sept. 2, the week after Cooper announced Bland would succeed now-Superior Court Judge Eula Reid, The Daily Advance of Elizabeth City reports. There’s no requirement that someone of the governor’s or departing judge’s political party is picked by the governor. Historically, however, governors have often favored someone of their own party to fill vacancies. Bland said her political views never came up during two pre-appointment interviews with Cooper. Bland said she didn’t contact Cooper’s office about her party switch before completing it. “I’ve always been conservative,” Bland said recently. “It’s the party that best represents my values.” In response to the switch, Cooper’s office focused on criticizing the GOP-controlled Legislature for passing laws in the 2010s to make judicial elections officially partisan again. “It’s still wrong now,” spokesperson Jordan Monaghan said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is offering license refunds to nearly 30,000 deer hunters due to an outbreak of a viral disease in the western part of the state. It’s the second straight year that North Dakota’s Game and Fish Department is offering refunds to thousands of hunters. The department says it has received nearly 1,000 reports of dead deer after epizootic hemorrhagic disease, known as EHD, surfaced in late August. The disease, transmitted by biting gnats, seems to be affecting a larger portion of the state than usual, Wildlife Chief Casey Anderson said. Game and Fish Wildlife Veterinarian Charlie Bahnson said one theory could be that prolonged drought conditions in the state and record-breaking heat in October created conditions favorable to midges and more viral spread. The heaviest concentration of reported deaths is along the Missouri River, especially to the north and south of Bismarck and Mandan, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Last year’s outbreak was in the southwest and west central parts of the state, and Game and Fish offered license refunds to more than 9,000 hunters. Only about 400 sought refunds. Bahnson said nearly 30,000 hunters are potentially affected this year. Hunters and landowners are asked to report any dead deer, along with photos, through an online wildlife mortality reporting system.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Democrats in the state House are calling for action on legislation that would remove time limits restricting when sexual assault victims could file lawsuits against perpetrators. The lawmakers are also urging that hearings be held on a bill that would lift caps on pain-and-suffering awards in lawsuits brought by rape victims. The bills in question focus on separate issues encompassing sexual assault. One involves lawsuits brought by long-ago survivors of sexual abuse, a measure backers say could assist both victims of priest abuse and – in a recent high-profile case – abuse perpetrated on hundreds of student-athletes by former Ohio State team doctor Richard Strauss. That bill would also eliminate the spousal exception for marital rape. The other bill involves recent state Supreme Court rulings dramatically reducing jury awards to child survivors of rape. The issue is not partisan, said Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron. “We have a combining of victims now coming forward, and survivors, friends of survivors, family of survivors, combining with the Strauss victims who’ve been reaching out to our office to contact us,” she said at a Thursday news conference. A separate Republican bill meant to assist survivors of Strauss is stalled, and a GOP lawmaker last week suggested it was never meant to pass but only pressure Ohio State to settle. A federal judge dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits against Ohio State last month, agreeing with OSU’s argument that the legal window for such claims had passed.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma State Department of Health says it will reconcile its tally of COVID-19 deaths with those reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resulting in more than 1,000 additional deaths. “This is part of our annual review process that we do every year for reportable diseases,” not just COVID-19, state epidemiologist Dr. Jolianne Stone said. The review is required of all states and, in Oklahoma, will result in an estimated 1,053 COVID-19 deaths when the CDC publishes the data Monday, Stone said Thursday. The update will also result in an estimated 1,366 additional coronavirus cases in the state, she said. The department, which investigates each death, has for months reported the CDC’s provisional death count based on death certificates. The health department on Friday reported a total of 10,826 deaths due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, based on the CDC’s provisional death count.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Court of Appeals has reversed a lower court’s decision to throw out an age discrimination lawsuit against a gun retailer, declaring it illegal to deny gun sales to buyers between the ages of 18 and 20. Brandy Dalbeck filed a $10,000 lawsuit against Bi-Mart in 2018 after the company’s Florence store refused to sell her a hunting rifle when she was 18. Bi-Mart had announced that year it would no longer sell guns and ammunition to people under the age of 21. Companies like Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods made similar changes around the same time after 17 students and staff members were killed in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports federal law bans firearms retailers from selling handguns, but not rifles or shotguns, to anyone under 21. Oregon law allows residents to buy shotguns or rifles starting at age 18. Lane County Circuit Judge Charles D. Carlson dismissed Dalbeck’s case without a trial in 2019. In his order for dismissal, Carlson said Oregon’s anti-discrimination law did not prohibit places like Bi-Mart from discriminating against people between the ages of 18 and 20 based on age – and even if the law did, Bi-Mart could adopt a policy against selling firearms to those under 21 as a matter of public safety. Oregon’s appeals court disagreed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nUpper Darby: A woman was raped by a stranger on a commuter train in suburban Philadelphia in the presence of other riders, who a police official said “should have done something.” Superintendent Timothy Bernhardt of the Upper Darby Police Department said officers were called to the 69th Street terminal about 10 p.m. Wednesday after the assault on the westbound train on the Market-Frankford Line. An employee of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority who was in the vicinity as the train went past called police to report that “something wasn’t right” with a woman aboard the train, Bernhardt said. SEPTA police waiting at the next stop found the woman and arrested a man. The woman was taken to a hospital. Bernhardt called the victim an “unbelievably strong woman” who provided police with a lot of information. She did not know her attacker, he said. “She’s on the mend,” Bernhardt said. “Hopefully she will get through this.” The entire episode was captured on surveillance video that showed other people on the train at the time, Bernhardt said. “There was a lot of people, in my opinion, that should have intervened; somebody should have done something,” Bernhardt said. “It speaks to where we are in society; I mean, who would allow something like that to take place?”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Foundation is providing a $250,000 grant to purchase thousands of opioid overdose prevention kits until a more sustainable source of state funding is in place. The grant announced recently to the University of Rhode Island will enable the Community First Responder Program at its College of Pharmacy to purchase approximately 3,000 Narcan kits for distribution to community-based recovery and harm reduction organizations across the state, the foundation said in a statement. There is a critical need for the kits. Supplies of Narcan, also known as naloxone, are seriously depleted as drug overdoses rise. According to state Department of Health figures, 384 Rhode Islanders died of a drug overdose last year. “Narcan kits are a simple solution to a deadly problem. While our funding will save lives, it’s just a large, yet critically needed Band-Aid until a sustainable funding source is put in place,” foundation President and CEO Neil Steinberg said. The funding will provide about a two-month supply of Narcan. The Rhode Island Foundation is the largest and most comprehensive funder of nonprofit organizations in the state.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An elementary school teacher surrendered to authorities Friday after being accused of having marijuana edibles in a student prize box in her classroom. The 27-year-old teacher from Lexington was behing held on a charge of possession of a Schedule I drug. Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon said the teacher bought a mixed bag of candy to give to her students at Rocky Creek Elementary School, and two students were allowed to get a prize from the candy box Sept. 23. “Marijuana edibles are cannabis-based food products. They come in many forms, but the items in this case were candy,” Sheriff Jay Koon said, adding that while they looked similar to traditional candy brands in wrappers with bright colors, they are illegal in South Carolina. According to the arrest report, one student grabbed a pack of “Stoney Patch Kids” gummies, believing they were “Sour Patch Kids,” and though the teacher told the student to get something else, the child still left with marijuana edibles. The other student grabbed a lollipop. After getting the prize, the student with the gummies went to an after-school day care program and asked his teacher there to help him open the pack. The teacher saw that the candy was not “Sour Patch Kids,” did not open the pack, and contacted the child’s school, the deputy’s report said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpearfish: A junior mineral exploration company is making a new push to find gold in the Black Hills. Solitario Zinc Corp. arrived in Spearfish in July. Todd Christensen, a geologist with Solitario, said the company was invited to evaluate some claims from a group of investors, and “we saw it as an opportunity to get our foot in the door and to evaluate exploration potential.” Solitario will be combing through 580 mining claims that make up about 11,600 acres of land in Lawrence County. Christensen said the company plans to conduct a multiyear surface exploration program and intends to look for deposits like the Homestake deposit. The former Homestake Mine near Lead became the largest and deepest gold mine in North America and generated 40 million ounces of gold during its 126-year life. In 2002, it closed and became an underground research facility. Homestake’s origins were in the Black Hills gold rush of the 1870s. “Currently, we’re collecting samples to get an understanding of the geology and the mineralization potential,” he said. Christensen told the Black Hills Pioneer that Solitario has focused on zinc in recent years but expanded to gold after a geologist with South Dakota roots gave a presentation at a mineral exploration conference in Toronto.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge has limited the ability for now for the nonprofit running Oak Ridge National Laboratory to place employees on unpaid leave who receive exemptions to a COVID-19 vaccine requirement. U.S. District Judge Charles Atchley in Knoxville issued the temporary restraining order Friday barring UT-Battelle from placing employees on indefinite unpaid leave or firing them after they receive a religious or medical accommodation to the vaccines. The six workers who sued have argued they were told the unpaid leave would be indefinite. Their employer said in a court filing that the leave will last 60 days – with health benefits intact – and then will be reevaluated. Those with security clearances will maintain them for 90 days, the filing said. The judge wrote that he will decide by Oct. 29 whether to let the order expire or keep it while the case plays out. He reasoned that “preventing their (employees’) placement on unpaid leave for a matter of two weeks simply will not harm” the organization, while the unpaid leave presents a “functional loss of employment” and other damages for the workers at the lab, which is about 25 miles west of Knoxville. The judge wrote that the order shouldn’t be interpreted that he is inclined to block the order permanently.\n\nTexas\n\nSouthlake: A school district administrator told teachers that if they have books about the Holocaust in their classrooms, they should also have books that offer “opposing” or “other” viewpoints on the subject. Gina Peddy, the executive director of curriculum and instruction for the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, issued the directive this month during a training session about which books teachers can have in their classroom libraries. A staff member secretly made an audio recording of the training session and shared it with NBC News, which broke the story. In the recording, Peddy told the teachers to remember a new Texas law that requires teachers to present multiple perspectives when discussing “widely debated and currently controversial” issues. She said: “And make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust that you have one that has an opposing – that has other perspectives.” “How do you oppose the Holocaust?” one teacher asked. “Believe me,” Peddy said. “That’s come up.” Texas and some other Republican-controlled states this year moved to regulate what can be taught about race-related ideas in public schools and colleges amid the nation’s racial reckoning after last year’s police killing of George Floyd.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city received more than $1million last year to develop the community from a grant program run by the federal government but only spent about two-thirds of the money. Each year, the city of St. George is given money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make community improvements, especially for moderate- to low-income residents. In the most recent year, the city only used 66% of those funds on community projects. Some went to donations to public service organizations and to purchase fire protective equipment. The Community Development Block Grant funds are meant to be used on providing housing, a suitable living environment and expansion of economic opportunities, according to HUD. “There is a lack of decent affordable units across the board,” said a report in which CDBG detailed the housing situation in St. George. Although the city didn’t use any CDBG funds on creating more affordable housing, the CDBG report indicates the city is trying to remove barriers to accessing affordable housing primarily through encouraging a mix of housing choices such as single-family homes and single-bed apartments and promoting various lot sizes in developments to allow for increased densities.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A group of housing advocates are promising to camp outside the Statehouse until the state does more to help homeless people, one of the advocates said Friday. Brenda Siegel, of Newfane, and others want the expanded eligibility for housing assistance to stay in place through the end of the year. Begun amid the pandemic, the aid is set to expire Thursday. The advocates also want the state to accept federal funds intended for that purpose. “Any measure taken must include people who are on the street now and may be in the future,” Siegel said in an email Friday. In July, the state extended the hotel voucher program, which is used to provide shelter for some of those who experienced homelessness during the pandemic, through mid-September. Gov. Phil Scott later moved to keep the program running for 30 days, until Oct. 21, so a replacement could be developed. On Friday, Rebecca Kelley, a spokesperson for the governor, said in an email that the replacement plan is nearing completion and that a further extension would be included, without providing details. Meanwhile, Siegel said in a text Friday that the advocates would be using sleeping bags to camp in the front of the Statehouse “until appropriate action is taken.”\n\nVirginia\n\nBurke: A man who works for the sergeant-at-arms of the U.S. House of Representatives has been charged with possession of child pornography, according to police. Stefan Bieret, 41, of Burke, was arrested Wednesday and charged with 10 felonies related to possessing child pornography, Fairfax County police said. The Washington Post reports he’s being held without bond and is expected back in court next month. Bieret’s attorney did not return calls seeking comment. The investigation began when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was notified of a potentially illicit image uploaded to a Dropbox account, police said. The matter was reported to a task force on internet crimes against children. The owner of the account was found to live in Fairfax County. County detectives took over the investigation in August. A search warrant on the Dropbox account turned up additional images of child sexual abuse, and subsequent search warrants led detectives to identify the owner of the account as Bieret, officials said. On Wednesday, Fairfax detectives executed a search warrant on Bieret’s home and recovered multiple electronics. Bieret works as a program manager for the sergeant-at-arms, the chief law enforcement and protocol officer for the House of Representatives.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools is suspending 142 school bus routes beginning Monday. District officials said the cuts are necessary because of a national bus driver shortage and because some drivers are choosing not to follow the state-mandated COVID-19 vaccine rules for public employees, The Seattle Times reports. District spokesman Tim Robinson said out of the 18,000 students who are eligible for bus rides, about 6,740 could be affected by the bus route cuts. The 142 bus routes being suspended will not affect students in special education classes, students with individualized education programs, or Section 504 plans that include public transportation services, students experiencing homelessness and foster students. Schools at interim sites or those that serve “high proportions of historically underserved students” also won’t be affected, an email sent to parents Friday said. The district doesn’t know how many students will actually be affected by route shortages because the number of students who ride the bus fluctuates every day, Robinson said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state is ready to move forward with a plan to expand long-sought broadband access in rural communities at a potential cost of more than $1 billion, Gov. Jim Justice announced Friday. The plan, which Justice called the largest investment in broadband in the state’s history, will combine federal and state funding with private-sector investments and aims to bring broadband availability to at least 200,000 additional homes and businesses. “We’re going to change the trajectory of West Virginia in a bigger and better way,” Justice said at a event announcing the program. The plan will combine the state’s $236 million commitment with $362 million in funding from the Federal Communication Commission and $120 million from other state and federal resources, the governor’s office said in a news release. Most of the state funding comes from its share of federal American Rescue Plan allocations. The statement said the money will be allocated through competitive programs that draw additional matching funds from private-sector and local government partners. State Economic Development Director Mitch Carmichael said the plan will boost the ability for rural areas to offer distance learning, remote work and telehealth options.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources policy board plans to vote this week on whether to hire its own attorneys in a pair of lawsuits seeking to block the fall wolf hunt, underscoring the deepening rift between the board’s Republican members and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul. The department announced Friday that the board will convene remotely Monday to take the vote. Board Chairman Fred Prehn said he’s not sure Kaul’s Department of Justice will represent board members’ pro-wolf management position in court because its attorneys aren’t talking to board members. “We haven’t met with them; they haven’t talked to any board members or talked strategy,” Prehn said. “The board feels it’s not being consulted.” Prehn has been at odds with Evers since his term on the board expired in May. The governor appointed Sandra Naas to replace him, a move that would give Evers appointees majority control of the panel. Prehn, who was appointed by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker, has refused to step down. He maintains he doesn’t have to leave until the Senate confirms Naas. Republicans control the Senate and have made no moves toward a confirmation vote, ensuring the board remains under GOP control.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A 103-year-old man has set a record for the oldest adaptive paraglider to fly in America. Fred Miles doesn’t speak much, but he can hum his way around a melody, and the one coming out of his mouth this past summer as he looked down from the top of the Bridger Gondola at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort was “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” by John Denver. But Miles, 103, wasn’t going home via a car or a road just yet. First he was going tandem adaptive paragliding. It would be his first experience flying, seated in a wheeled cart with a paraglider behind him. It would also be the record-setter for the oldest adaptive paraglider to fly in America.But as his son, Greg Miles, reminded his father just before the flight, it would be far from his first time navigating the skies, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. “Part of the reason you’re not going to have a problem is because of your flying experience,” Greg, a former town councilor, told his father. The senior Miles first piloted a plane 81 years ago after joining the United States Army Air Corps, which eventually became the Air Force. He joined the force after graduating from Syracuse University with an engineering degree and flew in World War II, again in the Korean War and afterward for some time, for a total of 30 years.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/18"}]}

The Senate Health Committee voted 8-3 on Wednesday to advance the bill by Sen. Jim McClendon to the Senate floor. McClendon, an optometrist, said the change would make the position more accountable to elected leaders. But two other doctors on the committee argued it is wrong to interject politics into public health decisions. The state health officer, a position currently held by Dr. Scott Harris, is selected by the state public health committee, which consists of members appointed by the Medical Association of the State of Alabama. The bill does away with the position of state health officer and creates the Cabinet post of secretary of health, who would be appointed by the governor. The secretary would then appoint a chief medical officer. McClendon said the bill was not about Harris and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, but debate on the bill comes at a time where there has been pushback against business closures and restrictions to combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Two doctors on the Senate committee said the change would wrongly interject politics into health decisions.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The city will lift its coronavirus-related capacity restrictions on many businesses and ease limits on other places where people gather under a new emergency order set to take effect Monday. City officials announced the changes Thursday, saying retailers, bars, restaurants and other businesses will have their capacity restrictions eliminated, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Requirements for wearing masks and maintaining distance will remain in effect. The businesses must operate in ways that allow customers to stay 6 feet apart from people outside their households. Indoor gatherings with food and beverages will be allowed to have 25 people, while indoor gatherings without food or drinks can have up to 35 people. Previously, up to 10 were allowed with food or beverage around and up to 15 people without food or drinks. Outdoor gatherings with food and drink will be permitted to have up to 60 people, and the same gatherings without food or drink can have up to 100 people. That doubles the prior allowances. Entertainment venues such as theaters will be allowed to operate at full capacity as long as patrons wear masks. Groups of people must stay 6 feet apart. Gyms and fitness centers will have no capacity restrictions, but masks and social distancing will remain mandated.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey lifted capacity restrictions at gyms, restaurants and other businesses Friday, citing fewer COVID-19 cases and increased vaccination, as he eases up on the pandemic restrictions that have upended life for nearly a year. His order does not change mask mandates imposed by cities and counties, which remain in effect across most of the state. The decision to lift capacity restrictions applies to gyms, restaurants, theaters, water parks, bowling alleys and bars providing dine-in services. Ducey again ignored the guidance his own administration issued last year, which said those businesses should be closed altogether under the current “substantial” level of virus spread across most of Arizona. “Today’s announcement is a measured approach; we are not in the clear yet,” Ducey said in a statement. “We need to continue practicing personal responsibility. Wear a mask. Social distance. Stay home when you’re sick, and wash your hands frequently.” Dr. Cara Christ, the state Department of Health Services director, said some businesses will now be able to serve more people but still maintain the recommended distance of 6 feet apart. There will still be fewer people than normal in venues such as movie theaters and stadiums, she said. The move was met with opposition from most of the state’s big hospital chains.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson says residents will be required to wear masks in public through at least the end of the month, but health officials are developing criteria for when to lift the measure aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus. In contrast to the swift rollbacks of mask mandates in the neighboring states of Texas and Mississippi, Hutchinson told “Fox News Sunday” that he loosened restrictions on businesses but wanted a gradual approach to face coverings. “I wanted to set a goal and give people hope that we can end the mask mandate if we get to these – this place and where we feel more comfortable that our hospitalizations are still down, and so we wanted an off-ramp; we didn’t want a cliff,” the Republican told anchor Chris Wallace. “I wanted an off-ramp.” Health experts say masking is among the most effective ways to curb transmission of COVID-19. The disease has been linked to nearly 5,300 deaths in Arkansas. On Saturday, state health officials reported 327 confirmed and probable cases of the coronavirus and 14 more deaths from it. There were 345 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Arkansas, 14 fewer than on Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Public schools can tap into $6.6 billion in a plan Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Friday to try to pressure districts to reopen classrooms by the end of March, but educators, parents and lawmakers question whether it will work. After nearly a year of distance learning for most K-12 students amid the pandemic, parents say they are frustrated and losing hope their children will see the inside of a classroom this year. “Is this money going to be a motivator? I don’t know,” said Dan Lee, a father in San Francisco, a city that sued its own school district to reopen classrooms. “We throw money at them; we sue them; we shame them. They still haven’t moved.” The state is dangling $2 billion before cash-strapped school boards, offering them a share only if they start offering in-person instruction by month’s end. The rest of the money would go toward helping students catch up. Teachers from some of the biggest districts have come out against it, saying schools can’t reopen until infection rates drop and enough educators have been vaccinated. Among them is the powerful United Teachers of Los Angeles, whose members voted Friday to reject what they called an unsafe return. Last week, the union slammed the reopening plan as “a recipe for propagating structural racism” by benefiting wealthier, whiter areas with lower infection rates.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A meatpacking plant that saw a deadly coronavirus outbreak last year suspended operations Friday so workers could receive COVID-19 vaccines on-site. Workers at the JBS USA-owned plant received their shots in a temporary clinic set up in a hallway, The Greeley Tribune reports. More employees were vaccinated Saturday in a partnership with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7. The union said it expected as many as 350 people per hour to get shots. Six employees and a corporate supervisor at the plant died and 291 workers tested positive for the virus during an outbreak last year, according to the state Department of Public Health and Environment. JBS suspended operations in April to deep-clean the plant, install a new ventilation system and physical barriers on production lines, and enhance social distancing protocols. JBS also said the employees’ coronavirus infections were not work-related – a claim disputed by the union. In September, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company more than $15,000 for failing to adequately protect its employees from the coronavirus. JBS objected to the fine and said OSHA was trying “to impose a standard that did not exist in March as we fought the pandemic with no guidance.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Coronavirus infections among students in prekindergarten through grade 12 across the state have dropped and leveled off after infection rates spiked to their highest levels of the school year in January. There were 467 new student infections from Feb. 25 to March 3, or 49 fewer than the previous week, according to the Department of Public Health. For the week that ended Jan. 13, there were more than 1,600 new infections. School staff infections also have declined substantially since mid-January but increased last week when 151 staff tested positive, up 18 from the previous week. There were 521 new staff infections during the week that ended Jan. 13. Only a small percentage of the more than 500,000 students and 50,000 educators in the state have contracted the virus. Both President Joe Biden and Gov. Ned Lamont have been pushing for schools to be open for in-person learning during the pandemic.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Inmates at state prisons will be able to receive visitors later this month as coronavirus cases among inmates and the population at large continue to drop. The Delaware Department of Corrections announced Friday that in-person visits can resume starting March 16. Those wishing to visit will be able to schedule appointments starting Monday. In-person visits were suspended in November as COVID-19 cases increased across the state and among inmates. The most recent report from the state shows that seven of its eight correctional facilities don’t have any active coronavirus cases among inmates. The Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington reported one symptomatic inmate and two who were asymptomatic.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The capital’s first high-capacity COVID-19 vaccination site opened Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The D.C. Health Department said it would distribute 2,500 vaccines in its first day at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. Those who were able to book an appointment said it allowed them to breathe a sigh of relief after a long 12 months. “I’m just thrilled. I mean, it’s been a really tough year,” Michael Weinstein said before he entered the center to get his vaccine. “It just means the start of kind of coming back to some kind of normalcy,” Sarah Moody said as she waited to get her shot. It’s also the district’s first distribution site for the newest vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the one-dose version from Johnson & Johnson. D.C. Health Department Senior Deputy Director Patrick Ashley said the convention center vaccination site won’t be open every day but will be used whenever citywide vaccine supply levels allow. Many smaller vaccination sites across the district will continue to operate on a normal schedule. And two more high-capacity vaccination sites are scheduled to open in the district next weekend, Ashley said, at the Entertainment and Sports Arena and Providence Health System.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Daytona Beach’s annual Bike Week brought tens of thousands of motorcyclists to the city and its neighbors this weekend, with few wearing masks. The city made a bargain with its bars: 60% capacity indoors in return for the permits necessary for temporary outdoor sales and entertainment. The city is trying to avoid what happened at a South Dakota motorcycle rally in August, which led to a disputed number of infections around the country, ranging from several hundred to tens or hundreds of thousands. “I’m grateful to be open for Bike Week, grateful that the city allowed the vendors and the full Bike Week thing,” said Bobby Honeycutt, owner of Froggy’s Saloon, as the 10-day event began Friday. The bar is limited to 102 customers inside but is serving from tubs and bars outside. The Daytona Regional Chamber of Commerce, which organizes the event, estimates 300,000 to 400,000 motorcyclists will attend. It typically draws 500,000. “We know it’s likely to be less just because of COVID concerns, as well as many still struggling to make ends meet due to loss of income from COVID,” said Janet Kersey, the chamber’s executive vice president and chief operating officer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The White House on Friday announced it will partner with Georgia to open a new mass vaccination center at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta. The stadium will be capable of administering 42,000 doses of vaccine each week, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. It will be open for seven days a week for an eight-week period. The site should be open in the next two weeks, federal officials said. Federal, state and local officials are now developing plans for operations at the site.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Sea Life Park reopened Saturday after being shut down for almost a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The park had been closed since March 17, 2020, and two-thirds of its staff was furloughed. The marine mammal park, bird sanctuary and aquarium will limit capacity, mandate masks, enforce social distancing and screen temperatures at the door. Sea Life Park will only be open on weekends during its initial phased opening. Park officials said they hope to return to a regular schedule by summer, Hawaii News Now reports. There will be a new insiders tour, reef and dolphin encounters, and table seating for a luau. “We’re really excited to make this back in again,” general manager Valerie King said. “We have a lot of new great programs starting up, including our new tours, our special animal shark tour. People can join us and see our new baby dolphin that was born during COVID.” The park said it would bring back employees and open more than a dozen positions. The jobs available include positions in customer service, housekeeping and food service.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers in the state House have passed legislation that would require parents to opt in two weeks in advance before their kids can receive some sex education lessons in school. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, passed 56-12 on a party-line vote Friday and now goes to the Senate. If enacted, it would change the existing state law, which allows parents to opt out if they don’t want their child getting sex education lessons in school. Instead, parents who want their child to take part would have to give written permission two weeks before any lesson, discussion or reading assignment that involves human sexuality or topics such as gender identity and sexual orientation. Ehardt said her bill doesn’t change curriculum but encourages parental involvement in education decisions. “I’m just asking you to make sure that our parents are involved,” she told her fellow representatives. Opponents said the legislation would be challenging for teachers and parents, resulting in some kids missing out on sex education entirely because their parents miss the opportunity to sign permission slips two weeks before each lesson that touches in some way on human sexuality.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The first case of the more infectious Brazil variant of the coronavirus in the state has been detected in a resident, public health officials say. Northwestern University researchers found the so-called P.1 variant in a test sample from a Chicagoan who came down with the disease, city and state health officials announced Friday. The infected person told contact tracers they hadn’t recently traveled outside Illinois. “We identified it through our research program following mutations in the virus over time in the Chicago area,” said Dr. Egon Ozer, assistant professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Northwestern and a Northwestern Medicine physician. The P.1 strain was first found in Brazilian travelers who arrived in Tokyo in early January. It appeared in Minnesota later that month and has since been identified in several other states. The Chicago Department of Public Health “is working to identify close contacts of the individual to reinforce the importance of adherence with quarantine and isolation measures,” health officials said in a statement. Evidence suggests that this variant can spread more easily than most currently circulating strains of the virus, health officials said. Variants from Great Britain and South Africa have previously been identified in Illinois.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb was jabbed with a COVID-19 vaccine shot when the state’s first mass vaccination clinic opened Friday morning at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The governor was joined by Black elected officials who encouraged members of minority groups to put aside concerns and get vaccinated. Holcomb wore a mask and sat in the front passenger seat of an SUV while getting his shot of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine at the drive-thru clinic. Holcomb said his message to Indiana residents is: “Do it, just do it.” “This is going to help us beat COVID-19,” said Holcomb, a Republican. “The more, the faster.” The Indiana State Health Department said nearly 17,000 people snatched up four days of appointments at the speedway clinic from Friday through Monday. State officials are planning mass shot clinics for South Bend, Gary and Sellersburg during the next three weeks. Democratic U.S. Rep. Andre Carson and state Rep. Robin Shackleford, both Black and from Indianapolis, were among the officials joining the governor Friday. Shackleford, chairwoman of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, said the vaccines are especially important for minority communities that have had higher rates of COVID-19 illnesses and deaths. “We wouldn’t be out here unless we thought it was safe,” she said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state on Friday was among just 10 with a trend of more coronavirus cases as federal officials urged leaders to continue restrictions on mask-wearing and social distancing. The 14-day positivity rate showed Iowa was one of 10 states seeing an increase in confirmed virus cases, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate also has risen over the past two weeks from 14.15% on Feb. 18 to 19.37% on Thursday. Iowa’s increasing infection numbers come as Gov. Kim Reynolds has ended her orders requiring masks in public places and social distancing. Several other states have taken similar moves, leading President Joe Biden and health officials to criticize such steps and urge officials to retain restrictions for a few more months. Iowa public health officials reported 564 new confirmed cases and 13 additional deaths Friday, bringing the total number of deaths to 5,549. The state’s per capita death rate is 16th highest in the nation at 175.8 deaths per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins data. The most recent CDC data shows Iowa has received just over 1 million doses of vaccine and administered over 773,000. The CDC report said 6.5% of the population has received both doses for full immunization – the second-lowest rate in the nation.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Slightly more than 15% of the state’s residents have received at least the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with white residents getting the shots at higher rates, according to health department data released Friday. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported on its website that 439,127 people have been vaccinated, with 658,459 doses of the vaccines administered so far, including 219,306 second doses. A racial breakdown shows that 311,948 people who got the shots were white, a rate of about 124 per 1,000. That compares to the 9,781 Black Kansans who have been vaccinated, a rate slightly below 55 per 1,000. A breakdown of people vaccinated by ethnicity shows 324,827 who self-identified as not Hispanic received the vaccine, a rate of more than 127 per 1,000. That compares with 27,023 Hispanic Kansans who got the vaccine, a rate of nearly 76 per 1,000. Health officials also updated the state’s coronavirus count Friday with 752 new cases added since Wednesday, bringing the total to 295,861 since the start of the pandemic. No new deaths were added to the state’s death toll 4,812.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear on Saturday announced the creation of a fund to develop a permanent monument for the state’s COVID-19 victims. Beshear made the announcement during a memorial service commemorating the one-year anniversary of Kentucky’s first COVID-19 case. It was held in front of the Capitol, where the lawn was covered in small American flags, one for each of the 4,754 Kentuckians who have died from the coronavirus. “We must never become numb to what these represent or the staggering number of flags,” Beshear said. Those who died were “unique and irreplaceable human beings.” Several family members of victims spoke about those they have lost, often tearing up as they recounted the lives of firefighters, pastors and school workers killed by the virus. Beshear said this anniversary is also one of hope, with the state now vaccinating tens of thousands of people each day. All qualified adults who want to be vaccinated should be able to get a vaccine by the end of May, he said. “There will be no unknown soldier in this battle against COVID,” the Democratic governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state is launching a new $161 million program to aid renters and landlords affected by the pandemic, the governor’s office said Friday. Money for the new program comes from the state’s share of $25 billion for rental assistance included in a coronavirus relief package passed by Congress late last year. The governor’s office said the money has been allocated for relief to 57 Louisiana parishes. Seven parishes – Caddo, Calcasieu, East Baton Rouge, Jefferson, Lafayette, Orleans and St. Tammany – are getting relief directly from the U.S. Treasury. The director of the state’s Louisiana Housing Corporation said Friday that lessons learned in running a $24 million rental assistance program will help the LHC do a better, more efficient job of getting the money from the new program to tenants and landlords. That program was announced in July but stopped accepting applications within a few days due to high demand. As of Friday, LHC Executive Director Keith Cunningham said, the 956 applications had been funded with $2.3 million. In a Friday interview, Cunningham said some 7,000 people whose applications were approved pending additional documentation in the first program will be given priority in the newly launched program.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state is increasing capacity for indoor and outdoor gatherings and easing travel restrictions on other New England states in anticipation of the summer tourism season. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said Friday that Maine will raise indoor capacity limits to 50% on March 26 and 75% on May 24. Outdoor gatherings will increase to 75% on March 26 and 100% on May 24, she said. The state had been using a harder cap to try to control the spread of the coronavirus, allowing 50 people indoors, 100 people outdoors or five people per 1,000 square feet. Mills said the state is also adding Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island to its list of states whose visitors do not need to quarantine or produce a negative coronavirus test upon arriving in Maine. The list previously included Vermont and New Hampshire. She said the moves reflect the state’s success in controlling the spread of the coronavirus and were made in anticipation of spring and summer visitors from out of state. “We’re reopening Maine. Maine is open. You’re welcome to come here and enjoy our beaches and mountains in the coming months,” Mills said. She said the capacity rules can be made more strict if the state’s public health metrics require it.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Strippers are back to the grind after the city lifted a pandemic-related shutdown of gentlemen’s clubs. City strip clubs were allowed to reopen Friday after a prolonged closure of nearly three months. The city’s order allowing strip clubs to resume operations came in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the clubs. They argued that the city had been discriminating against them because other indoor venues were allowed to reopen while clubs had remained closed. The Baltimore Sun reports dancers wore masks and maintained distance during performances their first night back at the Penthouse Club. Patrons had their temperatures taken and signed in via a contact sheet to facilitate tracing if a coronavirus case is reported. Mayor Brandon Scott has said he will enforce regulations to ensure the clubs follow health guidelines.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State education officials on Friday postponed this spring’s standardized testing that would have clashed with plans to bring most students back to the classroom after nearly a year of remote and hybrid learning. Instead of starting April 5, the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System testing for grades three through five is being moved to May 10 to June 11, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education said in an email to school districts. Testing dates for grades six through eight are yet to be determined. State Education Commissioner Jeffrey Riley has said he would take a phased-in approach to reopening schools full time, starting with elementary schools in April. “We want to get kids back to school in a regular routine before they are assessed,” said Colleen Quinn, a state education spokesperson. The state already announced in January that this year’s test would be shorter for students in grades three to eight and that the competency determination for seniors would be modified. The state previously announced it also was planning to significantly reduce the length of the tests for this spring. Merrie Najimy, president of the 116,000-member Massachusetts Teachers Association, said Friday that MCAS testing should be canceled entirely this year.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city turned down 6,200 doses of the newly authorized Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine last week, favoring shots from Pfizer and Moderna, but said Friday that it will accept J&J doses in the state’s next allocation. Mayor Mike Duggan had said Thursday that residents should get the “best” vaccines – from Moderna and Pfizer – conflicting with guidance from top state and federal health officials who caution against comparing the three vaccines and note all provide strong protection against the worst outcomes. Duggan had also said the allotment of 29,000 Pfizer and Moderna doses “covered everyone who wanted a vaccination this week.” On Friday, he called J&J vaccines “a key part of our expansion of vaccine centers.” No other local health department declined any of the 82,700 J&J shots sent to Michigan last week, the state health department said. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan’s chief medical executive, said earlier in the week that people who are offered the J&J vaccine should “take it because declining … could be the difference between life and death.” In a statement Friday, she cited differences in when and where each company conducted its studies, with the Moderna and Pfizer research finished before concerning variants began spreading.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Data from the state Department of Health shows nearly 91% of Minnesotans who have received the COVID-19 vaccine are white, whereas U.S. census data shows white residents make up about 82% of the state’s population. The latest vaccine data released Friday shows about 3.5% of those vaccinated in Minnesota are Black, 3% are Asian, and 1.7% are Hispanic. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the figures only account for about 83% of those who’ve received a shot. Minnesota has been trying to distribute vaccines equitably, but efforts have been hard to track because state laws restrict how demographic information can be collected and distributed. Gov. Tim Walz announced Friday that the state will partner with Minnesota Electronic Health Record Consortium to track vaccinations by race and ethnicity. Health officials reported Saturday that more than 1 million Minnesotans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, including 61.7% of residents age 65 and up. A total of 543,696 people completed the full two-dose series. Walz also announced Saturday that nearly 55% of educators, school staff and child care providers have received a vaccine.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: White House officials publicly chastised the state’s move to repeal its mask mandate last week, calling the decision a big mistake and ill-advised, but Gov. Tate Reeves pushed back, saying he thought that “we should trust Americans, not insult them.” Reeves had pointed to whittling numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations, filled intensive care beds and people on ventilators in pulling back on a statewide mandate Tuesday, but President Joe Biden countered Wednesday that “I hope everybody has realized by now these masks make a difference.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading U.S. infectious disease expert, also admonished states’ mask mandate repeals Wednesday, saying decisions by Reeves and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott are “really risky” and pointing to the plateau of case counts. “That’s a dangerous sign because when that has happened in the past, when you pull back on measures of public health, invariably you’ve seen a surge back up,” Fauci said. The country is close to having enough vaccines for every American, Biden said, but “the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that ‘in the meantime everything is fine. Take off the mask. Forget it.’ It still matters.” Reeves responded Wednesday on Twitter to Biden’s rebuke, saying it’s up to Mississippians to “assess their choices and listen to experts.”\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Medical researchers in St. Louis are trying to determine why a small percentage of children and young adults who test positive for the coronavirus develop a life-threatening condition that can cause severe inflammation of the heart, brain and other organs, university officials said Friday. Washington University pediatric specialists are part of a research team led by the National Institutes of Health investigating how the virus affects children and young adults up to age 21, who account for about 13% of infections in the U.S. Most children and young people survive the coronavirus without serious illness. But researchers at Washington University want to know why some, weeks after infection, develop a condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, which causes inflammation of the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes and gastrointestinal organs. Most survive, but researchers say the long-term effects are unknown. Black and Hispanic children are more likely to get MIS-C, according to researchers. “While MIS-C is rare, it is worrisome because most children hospitalized with the condition were healthy just a few weeks before,” Dr. Charles Canter, a Washington University professor of pediatrics who is leading the investigation, said in a news release.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Educators in the state will begin receiving COVID-19 vaccines this week through a federal partnership with pharmacies, local health officials confirmed Friday. President Joe Biden announced the program last week, with the goal of vaccinating all teachers and child care staff by the end of March. The federal vaccine program is open to Montana educators even as the state has not made its vaccine allotment available to teachers. Montana was one of at least a dozen states that had not prioritized teachers as of Biden’s announcement. In Missoula County, vaccines will be available to all teachers through Granite Pharmacy, the Missoulian reports. Chuck Council, a spokesperson for the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, said the scope of the program remains “unclear” – including the total number of vaccines available in Montana through the federal program and the specific pharmacies participating. Also this week, residents 60 and older and those with chronic health conditions will become eligible for the vaccine. Previously, those 70 and older or with severe health conditions were eligible. Front-line essential workers are not yet eligible for the vaccine, with the exception of health care workers.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Early in the pandemic, Gov. Pete Ricketts delivered a simple message to Nebraskans to try to keep the coronavirus from spreading: If you want to see Husker football in the fall, you had better comply with social distancing measures. The warning fell a bit short, as Nebraska was forced to play its home games in a mostly empty Memorial Stadium. But now, a year after the state’s first known coronavirus case, Ricketts said he’s increasingly confident fans will be able to see those games in person later this year. “I think there’s a light at the end of the tunnel,” Ricketts said in an Associated Press interview. “We’re just asking for people’s patience, to hang with us for a few more months to get through this. But by the second half of the year, we’ll be starting to get back to normal.” Ricketts pointed to the state’s ramped-up testing and vaccination efforts. More than 11% of residents who are at least 16 years old have been vaccinated so far, placing Nebraska in the middle of the pack among states. Officials have said they expect to get more vaccine doses in the coming months and should be able to vaccinate the general public by late April or early May.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gov. Steve Sisolak is marking a year since COVID-19 was detected in the state as a “somber milestone and anniversary” but said Friday that he’s hopeful for the future. The Democratic governor issued a statement to mark the anniversary of the first presumptive positive case of the coronavirus detected in Nevada. In the 365 days since, the state has neared 300,000 cases of the virus and on Thursday reached the grim milestone of 5,000 deaths. “That’s 5,000 of our neighbors, our friends and our family members. The loss is incalculable. The devastation will leave a permanent mark,” the governor said. In total, 5,036 deaths had been reported by Saturday. Sisolak said while the pandemic was one of the greatest challenges the state has ever faced, Nevada has not been broken and is working to overcome all the big challenges it faces. New reported cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been falling since mid-January, but Sisolak reminded people to continue wearing a mask, practicing social distancing and keeping up other mitigation measures in the meantime.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLoudon: Gov. Chris Sununu on Saturday toured a mass vaccination site at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway as the state kicked off a three-day vaccination push with the goal of giving Johnson & Johnson shots to about 12,000 people. Sununu said the state was able to move up to this past weekend vaccines for many people originally scheduled to receive their shots in April. “The opportunity to vaccinate nearly 12,000 Granite Staters at one site over the course of a single weekend is an incredible opportunity for New Hampshire,” the Republican said. The move was made possible by the delivery of Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses. Those scheduled to receive shots drove up to the area where they were being administered and then drove on to an observation area where they were monitored for a brief period of time before being allowed to leave. The J&J vaccine is a single-dose vaccine, meaning there’s no need for a second shot.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Rebuffed by the Democrats who control the Legislature, Republican lawmakers conducted their own hearing Friday on Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s management of the pandemic, questioning his administration’s handling of the coronavirus in nursing homes. The committee met for the first time Friday, remotely, with testimony from a doctor, nursing home administrators, veterans homes residents and others. Lawmakers focused in part on a March 31, 2020, state health department directive requiring nursing homes not to turn away coronavirus-positive patients. The policy made headlines because of news that New York released 9,000 previously uncounted virus patients into facilities under a similar policy. New Jersey’s policy hasn’t been linked to a similar figure, but the legislators questioned if there could be deaths connected to the policy because the administration hasn’t given a full accounting of its handling of the pandemic. Indeed, lawmakers seemed left with more questions than answers Friday. In part, that’s because Murphy’s administration declined to make health department officials available. Democratic lawmakers also did not join them to form a select committee with subpoena power that could compel administration officials to testify at the hearing.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The governor has signed economic relief legislation that provides $600 rebates to low-income workers and a tax holiday for restaurants that have been hobbled by aggressive pandemic health restrictions. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed two bills last week that are part of an ambitious economic recovery package. New Mexico state finances and trust funds are rebounding amid a surge in oil production and prices, along with a boost from 2020 federal relief to state and local government, businesses, the unemployed, school districts and tribal governments. “This pandemic has been devastating for everyone, but the pain has been spread unequally,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “My hope is these economic relief efforts reach those who need them most.” A newly signed bill from Democratic Sens. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe and Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City provides a four-month holiday from gross receipts taxes on sales and business services for business operators at restaurants, bars, food trucks, small breweries, wineries and craft distilleries. The second bill from Democratic Sen. Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque expands an emergency loan program for businesses that lost income after the pandemic hit in 2020.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The Legislature has passed a bill to limit Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s emergency powers at a time when he’s facing sexual harassment allegations and scrutiny over his administration’s reporting of deadly COVID-19 outbreaks at nursing homes. Democrats who have expressed disappointment in the governor in recent days have trumpeted the bill as a “repeal” of Cuomo’s emergency powers. Those powers are set to sunset at the end of April when the state of emergency ends, unless the Legislature acts to end it sooner. The Senate and Assembly passed the bill in party-line votes of 43-20 and 107-43. It has been sent to the governor, who has said he supports it. Any governor in New York has the power to suspend laws in a state of emergency, but last spring, lawmakers approved Cuomo’s request for additional authority to pass sweeping mandates unilaterally. Republicans have long opposed the additional powers. Under the new legislation, the governor would no longer have the power to pass new mandates. But it would allow the governor to extend or amend dozens of his COVID-19 mandates, which include limits for restaurant capacity, eligibility rules for vaccinations, the number of vaccine locations, gathering limits, social distancing rules, testing, quarantine rules, and air quality or filtration requirements.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: As the one-year anniversary of the state’s first COVID-19 death nears, the governor wants to see more residents vaccinated. Gov. Roy Cooper stopped at the Crown Complex in Fayetteville on Friday to check out Cumberland County’s COVID-19 vaccination program. “I want to make sure that this is fast and fair and that we get vaccines off the shelf and into arms before the next shipment comes and that we make sure that those arms look like the people of North Carolina,” Cooper said. State Health Director Dr. Mandy Cohen, who received the Johnson & Johnson one-dose shot in Wake County before Friday’s visit to Fayetteville, said health care workers, residents 65 and older, and front-line essential workers are eligible for vaccination. Charles Evans, chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners, said he wants to ensure more Black and Hispanic residents are among those in line. Evans cited data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that shows Black and Hispanic people are three times more likely to contract the coronavirus than white people. The data also shows that in the past month, only 16% of the state’s Black residents have received the vaccine; about 22% of the state’s total population is Black, and 10% is Hispanic.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: While older residents and health care workers have kick-started the state’s vaccine rollout, many health officials worry that turning out younger and healthier adults will be a more difficult chore. The state has started soft-selling via social media and word of mouth, emphasizing the safety of the vaccine and the importance of a strong turnout in thwarting the coronavirus. Molly Howell, the North Dakota Department of Health immunization program director, said the campaign will be ramped up once more vaccine is available and more people become eligible for shots. “Because the vaccine is in such short supply, it’s difficult to promote it,” Howell said. “We don’t want to create too much demand that people are stressed about getting the vaccine. So it’s a delicate balance of when to start more of a mass media campaign.” Sherry Adams, executive officer of the Southwestern District Health Unit, said she’s already seeing vaccine hesitancy among her clients in a seven-county area. Some people, she said, feel like the coronavirus has disrupted their lives, and the “further they can get away from it, the better.” Howell said the state is focusing its campaign on dispelling a wide variety of misinformation about vaccines, such as one claim that the medicine can lead to infertility. They’re also trying to take politics out of the equation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A mass vaccination clinic with the capacity to administer 6,000 shots a day will open in Cleveland this month with support from the Biden administration, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. The community vaccination center will open March 17 at Cleveland State University’s Wolstein Center after state and federal officials designated the downtown area based on its proximity to high-risk communities and medically underserved populations. “Now that the supply of vaccine is significantly increasing, this is the perfect time for a large-scale clinic in Ohio to bolster our work to get shots in arms quickly, efficiently, and equitably,” DeWine said in a release Friday morning. The site in Cleveland joins the nearly 20 FEMA-supported sites that have been announced by the White House in recent weeks as part of a broader effort by the administration to get shots into arms more quickly and reach minority communities hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak. The federal government is funding the site as well as providing the additional vaccine supply and the staff to administer it. Of the 25,000 people who live within 1 mile of the Wolstein Center, more than 60% are minorities, 6.36% are elderly, and almost 45% of households live in poverty, federal data shows.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state will open its next phase of eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines starting next week, deputy state health commissioner Keith Reed said Friday, including those in prisons and at homeless shelters. “Starting Monday … Oklahomans in congregate care or work locations; city, county and state leaders or elected officials; and public health staff supporting” front-line health workers will be eligible for the vaccinations, Reed said. More than 1.2 million in Oklahoma have now received at least a first dose of a vaccine, and more 11% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to health department data available Sunday. Reed said he hopes to begin providing vaccinations to those in the next phase – which includes teachers, staff and students in higher education and vocational schools – by April.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown said Friday that she is issuing an executive order mandating all K-12 public schools to provide universal access to in-person learning by the month’s end for students up to fifth grade and by mid-April for older students. The state’s coronavirus case numbers have fallen sharply in recent weeks, and Oregon put teachers ahead of older residents in the line for COVID-19 vaccines – a decision that angered many people 65 and up. As teachers get vaccinated, Brown has been under tremendous pressure from parents and local elected officials in many counties to reopen schools. Under her order, students in kindergarten through fifth grade must have an in-person learning option by March 29. Students in grades six through 12 must have one by April 19. Students who prefer to remain in online class will also have that option. State education officials have until March 19 to revise their guidelines for in-person instruction to help districts facilitate the return, she said. Rylee Ahnen, spokesman for the Oregon Education Association, said in a statement that teachers support returning to classrooms if it can be done safely. He said the union understands the frustrations of both school districts and parents as everyone navigates how to return to class.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: One year after the pandemic hit Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday acknowledged the severe toll COVID-19 has taken on his state but said he sees “a light at the end of the tunnel” with the growing availability of vaccines. Wolf announced March 6, 2020, that Pennsylvania had confirmed its first two cases of the new coronavirus. Since then, Pennsylvania has counted more than 944,000 confirmed or probable cases and attributed more than 24,200 deaths to the virus. “I’m not sure there isn’t anybody in Pennsylvania who isn’t frustrated, sad, maybe even grieving for a loved one who has been lost,” Wolf said Friday at a news conference outside a Rite Aid pharmacy in Steelton, where people with appointments were waiting to be vaccinated. “There’s a lot of sadness,” he said. “But at this point, though, we have something we didn’t have a year ago and that is hope. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.” Cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been trending down for weeks after a January peak. More than 868,000 people have been fully vaccinated in Pennsylvania, according to the state Department of Health, and Wolf asserts the vaccine rollout is showing signs of improvement after early stumbles.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Daniel McKee vowed to lead the state back to a sense of normalcy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic during a ceremonial inauguration Sunday on the Statehouse steps in Providence. “Together we’re going to keep Rhode Islanders healthy. We’re going to get us back to work. We’re going to get teachers and students safely back in the classroom. And we’re going to get our businesses back in business,” McKee said. He pledged that the state will not just recover but come back stronger. “Thankfully the vaccines are here, and we’re getting shots in arms,” McKee said. The Democrat was sworn in Tuesday night in a private Statehouse event following the resignation of former Gov. Gina Raimondo, who is now President Joe Biden’s commerce secretary. McKee is serving out the remainder of Raimondo’s four-year term but has said he’ll run for governor outright in 2022. The 69-year-old served as lieutenant governor and is a former longtime mayor of Cumberland. McKee thanked Raimondo for her leadership during the pandemic and acknowledged the toll COVID-19 has taken on the state. “Many have lost their jobs or lost a business that they have built for decades. So many have lost friends and family members to this virus. This past year has been hard on all of us,” McKee said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster on Friday lifted orders requiring masks in government office buildings and restaurants, leaving it up to state administrative officials and restaurant operators to develop their own guidelines related to the coronavirus pandemic. The executive order essentially reversed similar guidance from the governor issued in July, when McMaster made the face coverings a requirement for anyone entering a state office building, per guidelines developed by the Department of Administration. At that time, McMaster also issued a similar edict for restaurantgoers and employees. But given South Carolina’s declining number of COVID-19 cases, as well as the rising number of residents who have been vaccinated, McMaster said it was time to begin loosening more mandates – while still maintaining his recommendation that everyone wear face coverings in public settings where social distancing isn’t an option. South Carolina never had a comprehensive statewide mask mandate. Last month, McMaster lifted bans on late-night alcohol sales and gatherings of more than 250 people, encouraging people “to make responsible decisions” but saying in a statement that he believed “these targeted and limited safety measures are no longer necessary.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state is closing in on a major milestone in the fight against COVID-19. Nearly a third of the adult population had received at least one dose of a vaccine in the week that ended Friday. The South Dakota Department of Health reported more than 158,000 people have received at least one dose through its program. That number didn’t include 12,800 people vaccinated by Veterans Affairs, thousands through Indian Health Service and thousands more from the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, which has expanded rapidly in the past three weeks. And the vaccine surge will only intensify. On Wednesday, Department of Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon announced an increase in the state’s weekly allotment, with thousands more doses expected after a third vaccine from Johnson & Johnson got approval from federal officials. Since vaccinations began in December, South Dakota has consistently ranked in the top five for per capita vaccine administration. Despite the positive numbers, South Dakota continues to see a stubborn level of new infections. A week ago, the state was averaging 157 cases a day. On Friday, it was closer to 167. But the increasing number of vaccinations and previous infections should start to bring numbers down.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: An advisory panel tasked with deciding in what order residents should receive the COVID-19 vaccine acknowledged that prison inmates in the state were at high risk but concluded that prioritizing them for inoculation could be a “public relations nightmare.” The result: Prisoners are in the last group scheduled for vaccines in the state, even though the Pandemic Vaccine Planning Stakeholder group concluded that “if untreated they will be a vector of general population transmission,” according to records of the panel’s closed-door meetings obtained by the Associated Press. To date, there is no firm timeline for prison vaccine rollouts. Medical experts have argued since the beginning of the pandemic that prisoners were at extremely high risk for infection given that they live in such close contact with one another. “It shows a lack of morality and an absence of empathy to allow someone to die or expose them to greater risk because they happen to be incarcerated,” said Jeannie Alexander, executive director of the No Exceptions Prison Collective, a Nashville-based grassroots organization. Tennessee ranks 24th in the nation for prisoner cases of COVID-19. To date, 1 in 3 state inmates – more than 38,800 in total – has tested positive for the coronavirus at some point. More than 40 inmates have died from COVID-19.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state expects more than 1 million COVID-19 vaccine doses next week, state officials said Friday. According to a Texas Department of State Health Services statement, the vaccines will be first doses, with 245,000 being the new single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The federal government will send more than 200,000 doses directly to pharmacies and federally qualified health centers. The state will distribute more than 930,000 first doses to providers in all but 20 of the state’s counties, along with 457,000 second doses. Meanwhile, the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths are rising, according to data from Johns Hopkins University on Saturday. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in the state during the past two weeks has increased from 5,040.8 per day to 7,022.7, and the average number of daily deaths rose from 127 to 222. The rolling average of the positivity rate is also on the rise during the same time period, from 5.8% on Feb. 19 to 12.5% on Friday. The state health department on Saturday reported 4,713 newly confirmed or probable cases and 233 additional deaths due to COVID-19 for a fatality total of 44,367 since the pandemic began.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Legislature wrapped up its business for the year Friday in a session that was conducted partially remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. A statewide mask mandate will be lifted April 10 under a measure that passed the full Legislature on Friday night. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has said he plans to sign the bill. The bill lays out a new timeline for when COVID-19 restrictions applying to businesses, events and schools would end. The mask mandate would still apply to gatherings of more than 50 people. Emergency powers for the governor, mayors and local health departments will also likely be restricted under a bill that passed the Legislature on Friday, nearly a year after the state’s COVID-19 emergency declaration began. The legislation would limit the duration of a public health order to 30 days and only allow legislative bodies, including city councils, to extend or terminate an order. The measure also cuts government fines for people who violate public health orders from $10,000 per violation to at most $150 in most cases.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A year after the state reported its first coronavirus case, Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that he’s optimistic about the future. No one one could have predicted a year ago that “just 12 months later we’d already have three safe and effective vaccines rolling out to defend ourselves,” the Republican governor said during his twice-weekly virus briefing. “Think about that.” As of Thursday, 20% of Vermonters over the age of 16 had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Scott said. Starting next week the state will open up the vaccines to residents with underlying health conditions, teachers and more public safety workers. “This means within a month, one-third of the eligible population could be vaccinated, and all the most vulnerable to severe illness and death will have had the opportunity to be protected,” he said. The state should see hospitalization rates and deaths continue to drop, and with possible increases in the supply of vaccines, the state may be able to open eligibility sooner than planned, the governor said. On Friday, Scott also announced a change to the rules on social gatherings. People who are vaccinated may now gather with other vaccinated individuals at their homes, he said. This can also include one other household that is not vaccinated, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: Officials are telling residents who preregistered for vaccinations to take another look at the form. Laura Lee Wight, Central Shenandoah Health District’s population health director, said the state has added additional questions to the preregistration form that may change eligibility. Not all questions were available to the public on health district forms. “We want to make sure everyone’s data has the most up-to-date eligibility information,” Wight said. She said people who got a new job or were diagnosed with a medical condition also have a chance to update the forms to reflect it. Wight recommended everyone visit vaccinate.virginia.gov or, if their preregistration included a phone number, call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA. A button on the website allows users to verify and update records. “If you don’t update it right away, you won’t need to preregister again, but your record could be missing important information or contain outdated information and that could delay your appointment,” Wight said.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state has reached its goal of vaccinating 45,000 people per day against COVID-19, health officials said Friday evening. The Department of Health said in a news release that the daily goal had been reached and that more than 1.8 million vaccine doses had been administered in the state. That’s 77% of the 2.4 million doses that have been delivered to Washington’s providers and long-term care programs, officials said. The state also has been told to expect an increase in weekly dose allocations in the next few weeks. Although health officials said this means the state is moving in the right direction, the state is still not able to provide all the doses that providers request. The state also on Friday reported 784 new coronavirus cases and nine additional deaths. Those numbers bring the state’s totals to 343,868 cases and 5,041 deaths, state health officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice loosened pandemic restrictions Friday at restaurants, bars and most businesses to allow full capacity at those establishments where social distancing is possible. The state’s mask mandate will remain in effect. Full capacity will be allowed at small businesses, retail stores, gyms and museums. Justice said standing room to congregate will not be allowed in places such as bars. Last month, Justice loosened restrictions on businesses after a dip in cases and deaths. But he said he will not be influenced by other Republican governors removing mask mandates, to avoid a “whiplash that really hurts us” in cases. “We absolutely expect you to continue to wear your mask,” Justice said. “We are not backing off of our mask mandate at this time.” The limit on social gatherings will go up from 75 to 100. Restrictions are also being lifted on youth travel sports in counties that are not labeled red on the state’s coronavirus map. Currently, no county has that designation, which is for the most severe level of virus spread. “I’m 100% comfortable” with the latest lifting of restrictions, said the state’s coronavirus czar, Dr. Clay Marsh, at a press conference with Justice.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: More than 1 million residents have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Tony Evers said Friday. But that good news was tempered by the announcement that health officials have detected another highly contagious version of the coronavirus in the state. As of Thursday, Wisconsin had administered at least one dose to 17.6% of its population, ranking it 18th nationwide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was ahead of the national average of 16.3%. More than 1.6 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in Wisconsin. More than 570,000 people have been fully vaccinated, based on the totals from the state Department of Health Services. The first shipment of about 48,000 doses of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine is scheduled to arrive in Wisconsin this week. State health officials also said the next eligibility group would be announced this week, likely to include some people with preexisting health conditions. Teachers, health care workers and others became eligible last week, joining everyone over age 65 as well as front-line health care workers. More than 58% of people over age 65 had received at least one dose, the state reported.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Lawmakers have voted down two bills intended to increase the tax burden on companies generating electricity from solar or wind energy, which already pay property, sales and use taxes. The House Revenue Committee on Thursday voted to not advance a pair of renewable energy tax bills to the full House, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The first bill would have levied a $1 tax on each megawatt hour of electricity produced from larger solar energy facilities, similar to a tax currently enacted on wind energy facilities. “I just feel like it’s an equity issue,” said Republican state Rep. Albert Sommers, who sponsored the bill. The second bill, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Timothy Hallinan, would have increased an existing wind generation tax by 100% and eliminated an existing three-year tax exemption for new projects. Currently, the state charges $1 a megawatt hour of electricity produced on wind facilities after three years of operation. Wyoming Department of Revenue Director Dan Noble said the current wind production tax generates about $4 million a year. Hallinan argued that the state doesn’t charge enough for developers and that the extra revenue would be beneficial as the state faces a multimillion-dollar shortfall caused in part by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/11/17/find-columbus-central-ohio-restaurants-food-near-you-2021-map-directory-guide/6245251001/", "title": "Columbus restaurant guide: Find food near you by cuisine", "text": "Compiled and edited by Erin Edwards, Tom Hanks, David Rees, Lily Roby and Eiliana Wright\n\nColumbus Monthly\n\nLove local restaurants?

Recently, the group helped local businesses band together to buy outdoor heaters.\n\nMore:'Falling through the cracks': What restaurant workers, owners need to get through winter\n\n\"The need was clear,\" said founder and creative director Zev Friedman. \"There are a lot of good restaurants and breweries that need to stay open through the winter, and they need to have enough business to do that.\"\n\nDemand has created a shortage of heaters while driving up the cost. But Friedman and his team were able to secure 250 heaters at a bulk discount and pass along the savings to local business.\n\nCo-Operate WNC also worked directly with the city to determine which heaters could be permitted under fire code.\n\nLocal churches and a few other community centers also benefited from the bulk buying.\n\nThe heaters were distributed at Smith Mill Works, where Co-operate WNC's Whip Randolph slept overnight protecting the goods until all could be collected.\n\nLocal business owners stopped by over a span of days, some of them deciding to participate more formerly with Co-operate WNC.\n\nMutual aid, said Friedman, is a powerful tool for local economic development.\n\n\"Working to develop a long term cooperative economy is a way to address socio-economic limitations,\" he said. \"We can do everything from bulk solar panel purchases to get the cost of going solar down to food-related stuff, building materials, bulk cell phone plans.\"\n\nCooperative economics doesn't have to be rooted in material goods, he added — it could also mean offering cooperative child care or having a network to turn to in case of emergencies.\n\nIn short, Friedman said, \"link up do together what we can't do alone.\"\n\nCristina Hall of Ginger's Revenge said she hadn't even attempted to hunt for heaters on her own after word of the national shortage spread.\n\n\"So I jumped at the opportunity to buy heaters through Co-Operate WNC, especially since these heaters were already approved by the city,\" Hall said.\n\nBoth the Asheville Brewers Alliance and Mountain Bizworks clued her into the initiative. Co-Operate WNC did the heavy lifting like researching fire codes and sourcing equipment, which enabled her to focus on work, Hall said.\n\n\"Business owners have certainly had to figure out how to do all sorts of new things this year, but our community organizations have certainly stepped up and made it easier on us,\" she said.\n\nPersonal igloos, no ice\n\nAt Hi-Wire's Big Top, 7-foot plastic-covered domes act as personal pods where people can sit, sip and snack while staying warm in the parking lot. But there are no heaters in these \"igloos.\"\n\nTaproom director Christine Ferguson said the igloos basically function as greenhouses, kept warm by sunlight and trapping residual heat — though there are ventilation flaps just in case.\n\n\"It can still get chilly, but you don't have the elements hitting you,\" she said.\n\nShe also said the No. 1 question the brewery gets is regarding sanitation practices. \"We use a hard surface sanitizing spray and an air sanitizing spray,\" she said, adding that, ideally, the dome should stay empty for about five minutes before another group enters.\n\nCustomers have to abide by a few common sense rules: no smoking, and vacate the igloo when your time is up.\n\n\"And we can't say 'If you're not from the same household, you can't sit in the same pod,\" she said. \"But we're trusting our guests will use their discretion and best judgement while sitting in an enclosed space.\"\n\nHi-Wire is at 2-A Huntsman Place.\n\nA word of caution\n\nBusinesses still need to follow spacing requirements and other guidelines for heater placement, according to downtown specialist Dana Frankel, who has worked closely with restaurants throughout the pandemic.

Whether your love is a foodie or a total bookworm (or just enjoys a great surprise), here are the best wifey gifts that are sure to make them smile and land you the title of the best spouse of all time.\n\n1. For the wife who's into gadgets: Apple Watch Series 7\n\nIt's a pretty 21st-century experience to need a gadget for your gadgets, but that's the reality of life in 2021. With the Apple Watch Series 7, your wife can track her workouts and her vitals, make calls, text and send emails, scroll social media, listen to music, navigate directions and more—versatility that makes it our top smartwatch pick for 2022. If your wife isn’t an iPhone user, you can swap in the fabulous Galaxy Active Watch 4 instead.\n\n2. For the wife who loves to wear sneakers: Catiba Pro Women's Sneakers\n\nShoe shopping for your wife can be hard, but we’re confident she’ll love lacing up with this perfect pair of kicks. With a sleek aesthetic that’s right on-trend, these popular Cariuma sneakers have an ultra-cozy feel while also offering plenty of support to keep her feet happy all day long.\n\n3. For the wife who ends her day with a glass of wine: Winc wine subscription\n\nWant to give the gift that keeps on giving? Winc’s online wine subscription service may be just the gift for the wife who prefers her grapes fermented. After trying Winc, we can whole-heartedly attest to how delicious this wine is. We also like that the service includes useful details about each bottle and suggests recipes to pair with each wine. Whether she’s more of a red or white kinda girl, Winc is a great way to sample something new, while also enjoying a taste of tried-and-true favorites, so for those searching for stellar gift ideas for wives, it's aces.\n\n4. For the wife who is into essential oils: Asakuki Portable Essential Oil Diffuser\n\nWhen it comes to aromatherapy, distribution is as essential as the oils, themselves. So up her olfactory game with the Asakuki Portable Essential Oil Diffuser, our favorite affordable diffuser. It's sleek, it's affordable and it works as advertised, and makes a great gift for a wife who you think has everything else.\n\n5. For the wife who loves a little bling: Brilliant Earth Diamond Halo Pendant\n\nNothing like a reminder of your love she can wear everywhere and get complimented on, right? This Diamond Halo Pendant from Brilliant Earth is sure to put a smile on her face every time she wears it, because it's sure to make her feel like the queen she is. The necklace length can be adjusted from 16-18 inches, so she can position the pendant in just the right spot. The center diamond is surrounded by smaller diamonds, lending a simple elegance to the overall look.\n\n6. For the wife who is into beauty: Glamcor Riki Skinny\n\nThere are few things more embarrassing than looking into a public mirror and seeing that your makeup looks totally different than it did at home in the bathroom lighting. It’s hard enough to do makeup without having to contend with poor or dim lighting at the vanity. A good makeup mirror with adjustable lights makes a huge difference, and luckily you can buy her the best makeup mirror, the Glamcor Riki Skinny. It has excellent lighting, a large viewing area, and is portable.\n\n7. For the wife who enjoys feeling pampered: Parachute Classic Robe\n\nWant to treat your wife to a spa day every day? A plush robe is a great start, and the Classic Bathrobe from Parachute is the perfect splurge for any spouse who appreciates the finer things. One of our editors loves this robe because it’s “luxurious, comfortable, and functional.” Just be prepared to buy your own once you feel how soft hers is because she won't be letting you borrow it.\n\n8. For the wife who styles her own hair: Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer\n\nA trip to the blowout bar is so pre-pandemic. Bring the glam home with the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer, a must-have styling tool with more than 37,000 rave reviews—including a resounding endorsement from Reviewed’s beauty editor. Simply put, this thing is awesome. If your wife doesn't already have one, buy it now, and thank us later, because believe us, it's one of the best gift ideas for wives right now.\n\n9. For the wife who is a pro in the kitchen: Made In Nakiri Knife\n\nWe think every cook should have a Nakiri in their kitchen toolkit because it can't be beat for slicing and dicing. This 6-inch knife features a razor-sharp blade and beautiful design, which our tester noted makes it \"a lovely gift that’s also practical.\" Your wife will no doubt appreciate how easy it is to maneuver this knife for the perfect cut when she chops up her next onion.\n\n10. For the wife who loves vino: Oster cordless electric wine opener\n\nIf your wife is a wine lover, the Oster Cordless Electric Wine Bottle Opener is an impressive gadget that can uncork her bottle of wine with just a touch of a button. Oster's electric opener is completely cordless and can uncork up to 30 bottles of wine before needing to be recharged. It's stylish and comfortable to hold thanks to the opener's ergonomic design. She'll love the bonus foil cutter and easy it is to use. Cheers!\n\n11. For the wife who loves to nap: YnM Weighted Blanket\n\nLong days call for some rest and relaxation and a weighted blanket may be just the thing your wife needs to unwind. These unique blankets provide what’s called “deep touch pressure,\" which can feel comforting and soothing for some. (Think of it as a big hug but from a blanket.) We think the YnM Weighted Blanket is a fantastic, budget-friendly option for your wife because it performs just as well as many products double the price. It comes in a variety of sizes ranging from 5 pounds to 30 pounds and it’s comfortable enough to keep her cozy all night long.\n\n12. For the wife who is on her feet all day: UGG Women's Scuffette II slippers\n\nEver walk on a cloud? Neither have we, but we'd bet it feels a lot like wearing these UGG slippers, which we named our best women's slippers after several rigorous rounds of very cozy testing. So if that sounds like something your wife might like after a long day of being amazing, go on and add these must-have slippers to your cart.\n\n13. For the wife who has a sweet tooth: Premier Favorites Sweets & Treats Gift Basket\n\nThe Premier Favorites Sweets & Treats Gift Basket from 1-800-Baskets includes an array of delectable sweet and salty treats your wife will love to snack on. There's everything from Cheryl's Iced Buttercream Cookies to Totally Caramel Popcorn Moose Munch, plus it comes in a beautiful, water hyacinth basket that she can repurpose in the home.\n\n14. For the wife who needs a new vacuum: Dyson V8\n\nA vacuum cleaner might not sound like a gift you should buy your wife, but a premium vacuum like the Dyson V8 cordless vacuum is sure to put a smile on her face. It comes with five brush accessories, a mountable charging dock and it can run for up to 30 minutes on a single charge. Here at Reviewed, we are big fans of Dyson's vacuum's high-powered suction and sleek corner-cutting abilities, so you really can't go wrong with this easy-to-use vacuum.\n\n15. For the wife who needs her coffee hotter, longer: Yeti Rambler mug\n\nYeti didn't get as popular as it is without delivering on its promises. The brand’s 14-ounce Rambler is one of our favorite travel mugs, keeping coffee hot for as long as your wife needs to drink it. Trust us, this mug is worth the wait—and is one of the best gift ideas for wives for 2021.\n\n16. For the wife who loves jewelry: Kate Spade's One In A Million necklace\n\nKate Spade's One In A Million Pendant necklace is a fantastic choice to make any lady feel extra special. You can choose the initial of your choice to place on the front of the 12K gold plated necklace with \"one in a million\" engraved on the reverse side. The pendant comes on a 17-inch chain with a 3-inch extender, and we bet she'll be wearing this necklace for years to come.\n\n17. For the wife who is workin' on her fitness: Fitbit Charge 5\n\nOur favorite Fitbit is the Fitbit Charge 5, which may not offer all the bells and whistles of the Apple Watch, but still packs quite the punch—and also tells time—at a much more digestible price point. Not only is the Fitbit Charge 5 comfortable to wear, it offers comprehensive activity tracking features and an intuitive app, so it's a perfect gift for a wife who seems to have everything but wants to keep fit in these odd times.\n\n18. For the wife who loves to lounge: Athleta leggings\n\nIf she wants something that's both perfect for you and lounging, get here these Salutation leggings from Athleta. Boasting more than 2,900 reviews, this customer favorite comes in seven colors, regular, tall, and petite sizing, and features a curved seam for a flattering behind. It’s got deep pockets for any belongings, a high waistband that lies flat on the tummy while tucking it in, and a roomy leg that makes for a cozy alternative to leggings.\n\n19. For the wife who loves cold brew: Takeya Cold Brew coffee maker\n\nYou’ve heard the saying some like it hot—a nod to the classic 1959 film—but when it comes to coffee, she might prefer it cold. To brew up the very best, your wife needs the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker. It’s been one of our favorite cold brew coffee makers for a while now because of its user-friendly design. It also doesn’t hurt that it makes some of the tastiest coffee (and tea) we've ever sipped.\n\n20. For the wife who likes to keep it cozy: Barefoot Dreams CozyChic socks\n\nBarefoot Dreams makes some of the softest blankets ever, so it comes as no surprise that the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Socks also live up to the same hype. Like a soft, warm, hug for her feet, your wife will love slipping on these ultra soft socks after a long day. These cozy socks come in three colors and can be tossed in the washing machine for easy cleaning.\n\n21. For the wife who wishes she had a sous chef: Amazon Echo Show 5 (second-gen)\n\nAmazon’s Echo Show 5 (second-gen) makes the perfect countertop accessory, but did you know it can also double as a sous chef? Relying on Amazon Alexa, the Show 5 can help your wife find new recipes, read aloud the ingredient list, and guide her step-by-step with helpful photos and videos. As a bonus, she can also use it to make video calls to her friends and family.\n\n22. For the wife who loves to cook: Instant Pot Ultra\n\nLooking for genuinely sweet gift ideas for wives? If your wife has a lot of family recipes she likes to make for holidays and gatherings but is short on time, this is a great solution. An Instant Pot helps any cook create delicious meals quickly, without dirtying multiple dishes. The Instant Pot Ultra is the best pressure cooker we’ve tested: it cooks perfectly, is intuitive to use, and is easy to clean.\n\n23. For the wife who likes to snuggle up: Nordstrom's Bliss plush throw\n\nAs temperatures drop, a cozy blanket becomes an increasingly important thing to have. So don't let your wife be caught cold-handed (or footed) without Nordstrom's highly-rated Bliss Plush Throw blanket. The luxuriously soft throw features stylish tassels at the top and bottom and measures 50-inches by 60-inches, so there's plenty of room for her to cuddle up. Even better, the blanket is machine washable and can be tossed in the dryer for an easy clean, so it's an ideal gift for a wife who seems to have it all.\n\n24. For the wife who can't live without music: Apple AirPods Pro\n\nYour wife needs a quality pair of wireless earbuds to do things like listen to her favorite songs, handle work calls, and drown out the noise from the kids once in a while. With clear sound, intuitive design, a great fit, and brilliant noise cancellation, there’s no better pair of earbuds to get the job done than Apple’s AirPods Pro.\n\n25. For the wife who loves to do her nails: SunUV Gel Nail Lamp\n\nIs your wife missing her pre-pandemic manicures and pedicures? This professional salon curing nail lamp is one of the most thoughtful gift ideas for wives, and it's so good it’s garnered a 4.5-star rating from more than 17,000 Amazon reviewers. Our staff loves this popular nail lamp because it works with any gel polish and doesn’t smudge. A win-win.\n\n26. For the wife who needs a new weekend bag: Minted's personalized Snap Tote\n\nWhether she enjoys spending weekend mornings at the farmers' market, crunching or working out, the Snap Tote from Minted is the perfect bag no matter what she's up to. It's spacious, durable and comes in several stylish prints and patterns she'll love. For a custom touch, personalization (up to 12 characters) is available at no cost.\n\n27. For the wife who practices yoga: lululemon yoga mat\n\nIf your wife is a serious yogini, she should have a serious yoga mat, and lululemon's 5mm reversible yoga mat, our best yoga mat winner, carries plenty of bang for its buck. We loved its portability, its firmness and how easy it was to clean, making it worth every penny. If you're stumped for what else to buy, this could be a great gift for a wife who seems hard to shop for otherwise.\n\n28. For the wife who says there's nothing on TV: Disney+ subscription\n\nIt's a dejected feeling when you get to the bottom of the TV channel listings without finding anything you want to watch. Fortunately, a Disney+ subscription can help with that problem, offering hundreds of movies and thousands of TV episodes ranging from Pixar favorites new and old to the Marvel universe to Star Wars, National Geographic, and more. At an affordable price, Disney+ is a great deal the whole family can enjoy.\n\n29. For the wife who loves to exercise: Echelon Connect Bike EX-5\n\nIndoor cycling is booming, but not everyone is ready to invest in a Peloton. Fortunately, there are more affordable options available for those looking to buy a fitness bike on a budget. My husband and I share a Schwinn IC4, which we pair with a monthly subscription to the Peloton app. When one of us takes a class, we watch along on a phone or tablet, and the whole set-up works pretty well. If your wife would rather not have to use a second device, she may prefer the Echelon Connect EX-5, which offers a built-in screen in its popular indoor bike.\n\n30. For the wife who loves stylish footwear: Nisolo Heeled Chelsea boot\n\nNothing's chicer than a trendy pair of durable and supportive black boots to elevate your wife's wardrobe during the fall and winter months. Our tester raved about these boots because they are comfortable to wear all day long (even with the three-inch block heel) and she receives compliments every time she wears them. Even if you think your wife already has too many shoes, these Nisolo Heeled Chelsea boots are worth the investment and she'll love that you picked them out for her.\n\n31. For the wife who needs a personal assistant: Amazon Echo Dot (4th-Gen)\n\nIt never hurts to have a little backup, and an Echo Dot (4th-Gen.) speaker makes for the perfect sidekick. A brilliantly simple and affordable smart speaker, the Echo Dot uses Amazon Alexa to help manage calendars, set reminders, and answer (almost any) questions throughout the day. Alexa’s not all business, though. She can tell funny jokes, play trivia games, and play your wife’s favorite songs, making her an ideal personal assistant.\n\n32. For the wife who wants to try new recipes: Home Chef subscription\n\nWhen preparing a meal, planning is half the battle, and when crunched for time, coming up with new things to cook can start to feel like a chore. Our favorite meal kit delivery subscription, Home Chef, takes the preparation out of the equation, giving you fresh, creative options, portioned out and delivered directly to the door. And if she dislikes meal prep, it's one of the most thoughtful gift ideas for wives right now.\n\n33. For the sentimental wife: Framebridge custom frames\n\nAs the world has moved away from processing negatives and printing photos, Framebridge offers a great online photo service that will help your wife turn her lasting memories into lovely pieces of art. You can upload your own imagery and choose a frame for her, or give her a gift card so she can make her own selections. I’ve been using Framebridge in my own house for years and I’ve given it as a gift on multiple occasions. It’s always been well-received and the framed photos are an amazing value given the quality, so it's one of the most super-sweet gift ideas for wives.\n\n34. For the wife who is into family history: AncestryDNA Kit\n\nDoes your wife love to learn about her family history? Help her discover more about where she came from with the AncestryDNA Kit. The test, which comes with detailed instructions, will help your wife trace her roots back to the beginning. Think of this as a gift for a wife who really wants to have the ultimate family tree.\n\n35. For the wife who never misses an episode: Roku Ultra\n\nWith so many different streaming services competing for our attention, staying afloat in a sea of available programming isn't always easy. But with the Roku Ultra, our favorite streaming device, your TV-loving wife will have a trusty tool at her disposal. In addition to being easy to use, the Ultra offers a customizable remote complete with a headphone jack, giving your wife access to easy wireless audio for binging after you've started snoring.\n\n36. For the wife who never stops learning: a MasterClass subscription\n\nWould your wife enjoy a tennis lesson with Serena Williams? How about a cooking class with Gordon Ramsey? A comedy workshop with Steve Martin? These experiences may never be feasible in real life, but they're just a few of the offerings included with a MasterClass subscription. We love MasterClass for its encyclopedia of motivating content for users with interests across the board.\n\n37. For the wife who likes to eat healthy(ish): Cosori CP158-AF Air Fryer\n\nLet's be honest: Air fryers didn't become a kitchen craze because people are looking to eat healthy foods. Consider it more like a healthier way to eat the snacks you already love. So don't feel guilty hitting \"add to cart\" for your wife on our best value air fryer. It's a gift for a wife that the whole family will love, it works well, it's easy to use, and your wife will love how it looks in the kitchen—the perfect combination.\n\n38. For the wife who loves candles: Capri Blue Volcano candle\n\nIf your wife loves candles, then surprise her with the top-rated Capri Blue Volcano Candle. Made in the USA, this best-selling scent features notes of tropical fruits, sugared oranges, lemons and limes and fresh mountain greens. It has a burn time of up to 85 hours and comes in a gorgeous iridescent jar with a copper lid that can be repurposed after use.\n\n39. For the wife who loves to soak in the tub: Da Bomb Candy bath bomb\n\nWho says candy is just for eating? Handmade in the USA, this fun cotton candy-inspired bath bomb makes for a great stocking stuffer. The 7-ounce bath fizzer with \"sprinkles\" will begin dissolving as soon as she puts it in the water. There's even a bonus surprise hidden inside for an extra-sweet treat, making it a sweet and simple gift idea for a wife.\n\n40. For the creative wife: Apple iPad\n\nCreativity can strike at a moment's notice, so portability is critical when it comes to the tools of the trade. Apple's ninth-generation 10.2-inch iPad builds on the company's long-standing legacy of excellent mobile devices, offering a high-quality product that your wife is sure to get plenty of use out of. And, if you really want to fill out the suite, toss in Apple's Smart Keyboard and an Apple Pencil, then watch her creativity flow. An iPad always makes for a nice surprise, so definitely consider getting one if she doesn't have it yet.\n\n41. For the wife who needs perfect coffee: Hario V60 Coffee Dripper 02 Ceramic\n\nMost people are either \"coffee people\" or they're not—and there's not much in-between. If your wife loves coffee, the Hario V60 is the best pour over coffee maker out there. It’s a handy, durable accessory that will give her complete control over her morning cup(s) of joe. Pour-over coffee allows the person making it to determine the flow of water through the grounds, allowing for more precise saturation and temperature control. It's a subtle technique adjustment, but if you're looking for a gift for a wife who's a coffee buff, it can make a huge difference.\n\n42. For the wife who loves home décor: Ruggable\n\nA house isn't a home until it's properly decorated, and as they say, it's the rug that pulls a room together. It's also pretty helpful when that rug is machine-washable and looks amazing, which makes Ruggable a bit of a unicorn in the world of interior design. I have multiple Ruggables and they stand up to just about anything my family and I throw their way. When it's time to swap them out, Ruggable has lots of unique prints to choose from, so refreshing any room is a breeze.\n\n43. For the wife who wants to be a plant mom: The Sill\n\nThe Sill is one of our favorite places to buy plants online and sells a variety of potted plants that your wife will love. Reviewed staffers have ordered from The Sill numerous times with nothing but positive things to say about the experience. The online plant company also offers helpful online plant workshops so your wife can keep her favorite holiday gift in tip-top shape. There are lots of stylish pots to choose from, or you can customize your own for a personal touch.\n\n44. For the wife who loves a good blowout: Shark HyperAIR blow dryer\n\nIf your wife has long, flowing tresses, you probably have seen all the tools and contraptions she uses to get them looking their best. Many of these hairstyling gadgets use heat to achieve the desired look, and it's well known that heat can damage hair. Luckily, some products counter this issue with lower-heat technology and manage to achieve the same end result as its heated competitors, without damaging the hair. One such product is the Shark HyperAIR blow dryer. It has \"intelligent heat control\" to make heat damage a thing of the past. It also comes with several attachments for all hairstyles, a negative ion generator and a cool shot button to make sure her style stays put.\n\n45. For the wife who loves to nap: Thread Count 4-piece sheet set\n\nYour average sleeper likely isn't too concerned with the thread count of their sheets, but if your wife enjoys snoozing in the lap of luxury, these 600-thread-count sheets from Home Depot will surprise and delight. You might not normally consider the hardware store the best place to find a gift for a wife that's hard to impress, but this bedding is the sheet. Not to mention, it's got a 4.7-star rating from Home Depot shoppers!\n\n46. For the wife who likes to game in bed: Nintendo Switch\n\nA Switch might be on your little one's wish list, too, but Nintendo's latest foray into the world of handheld gaming appeals to adults all the same. I love getting lost in Animal Crossing after the kids go to bed, and my husband is convinced he is better than I am at Mario Kart (though I can assure you, he is not). Video games can make for a great release at the end of a long day, regardless of skill level, and this particular console is the perfect addition to any gamer’s nightstand.\n\n47. For the wife who deserves a new pair of glasses: Frames from GlassesUSA\n\nIf your wife’s been rocking the same pair of prescription glasses all year long, it might be time for a new pair of stylish specs. GlassesUSA is one of our favorite places to buy glasses online and could be a great choice if you're looking for a gift for a wife because they offer a great selection of affordable frames, designer glasses, colorful lenses, and more options she will love.\n\n48. For the wife who needs a massage: Theragun G3\n\nMove over foam rollers—there's a new gadget that’ll make your wife's muscles “ooh and ahh” after a grueling workout. Several Reviewed staffers tried the highly sought-after Theragun, agreeing the massage gun's high-powered pulse feels great on sore muscles. Another thing we love? The free Theragun app, which will help guide her along as she uses it to warm up before a workout or cool down afterward.\n\n49. For the wife who wishes she had more time to read: Audible subscription\n\nThere's nothing new about the concept of listening to books, particularly when you just don't have time to settle in and actually read with your eyes. But Audible, Amazon's super-popular audiobook subscription service, offers a modern take on old-school books on tape, and we loved it when we put it to the test. For $7.95 a month, your wife—and, by extension, you—can access unlimited titles in the Audible Plus catalog, plus a book of choice each month and discounts on additional titles.\n\n50. For the wife who is also a dog mom: Furbo Dog Camera\n\nIf your wife is a dog mom, she's probably searching for an answer to an age-old question: \"What does the dog do when I'm not at home?\" With a Furbo dog camera, one of the best pet smart pet cameras, you can both find out and give a gift for a wife who really wants to know.

While humans will still trade options, a big section of the landmark Chicago Board of Trade Building will go dark.\n\nAnd with it will pass an age of gaudy personalized jackets, arcane hand signals symbols and an overwhelming mercantile chatter on par with that of the world's greatest bazaars. The trading floors achieved iconic status in popular culture, whether derided as the lair of \"whores\" by poet Carl Sandburg or spoofed in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\n\nBut for years, as more traders have traded the thrill of the floor for the efficiency of computers to make multimillion-dollar, split-second decisions, the ambience of the bustling pits have become downright desultory. Floor volumes had fallen to just 1% of the company's total futures volume, according to CME Group.\n\nStill, the death of the tradition is being mourned by the generations of traders who worked the pits during a time when a mixture of sharp understanding about the state of the market coupled with sharp elbows could take a trader a long way.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the frantic screaming and hand signals that traders use to buy and sell could appear to be utter chaos. But for many of those who braved the floors in Chicago and New York, the language of the floor had beauty and order that the more efficient world of computerized trading lacks.\n\nThat part of the business has been a long, steady decline for years. It now accounts for less than 1% of a weekly cash volume that exceeds what the New York Stock Exchange turns over in a whole year, according to CME estimates.\n\nTrader Virginia McGathey has been on the floor since 1976, when she started as a runner.\n\n\"When the computers first appeared, I was thinking they were a great tool,\" she said. \"Had I known they would take over what I do, I might have done something else.\"\n\nShe conceded that electronic exchanges have made it easier for women to get a piece of the action in what she described once as a \"center of Neanderthalism.\"\n\nBut \"the idea that the computers leveled the playing field is absolutely wrong as it relates to participation,\" she added. \"This industry was built on fairness, to create a space for commerce to thrive — but it is now all about power and money.\"\n\nScott Shellady, a 28-year veteran of the exchange who followed his father onto the floor, lamented that it is \"like making homemade furniture and having an IKEA move in next door.\"\n\nHe was in London when all trading went electronic virtually overnight and noted that unlike the U.S., \"where it has been a steady drip-drip-drip of attrition, at least they took the band-aid off a lot faster.\"\n\nThere are \"strings that tug,\" as open outcry was \"the foundation of this place,\" Shellady said. \"But it is the inevitable march of time and if you look for ways of adapting, you will win.\"\n\nTraders are not the only ones who will feel the loss.\n\nLocal businesses around the Chicago Board of Trade building, particularly the watering holes and restaurants that served as place to celebrate and commiserate, watched the demise of the futures pits closely.\n\n\"Already, there are hardly any traders left on the floor,\" said Billy Assimos, manager of Ceres Café, a bar and restaurant on the ground floor of the CBOT building. \"There used to be 6,000 people running around this building and now there are a lot of empty spaces.\"\n\nCeres used to be packed from early morning until closing, he said. \"Breakfast would roll right into lunch, which would roll into late lunch, which would roll into cocktail hour, which started around 2 p.m,\" he said. \"Now you can shoot a cannon in here at that time.\"\n\nAssimos estimates 95% of his business used to come from traders and support staff, a figure that has fallen to about 1%.\n\nOn Thursdays and Fridays, Ceres still draws pretty well from a pool of other people working downtown, mostly because of its central location and reputation for pouring the strongest cocktails in Chicago.\n\nFranco Calascibetta has run a hair salon in the basement of the building for 32 years.\n\n\"I saw this coming five or six years ago when they started to switch,\" he said. \"A lot of people trade at home now and once they leave the Loop, and they live in the suburbs, they don't come back.\"\n\nCalascibetta used to be able to count on 20 customers a day, a number that has been cut in half over the past few years. And those he does get are not flush with cash like the free-spenders of yesteryear.\n\n\"We would get $200 tips if someone had a good day,\" he recalled. \"There were a lot of big tips.\n\nLenny Pomerantz, now retired, traded everything from pork bellies to gold for more than 30 years. He threw in the towel sponge​ in 2009 as the future became clear.\n\n\"Guys like me couldn't make the transition to electronic trading,\" he said. \"How the hell am I supposed to compete with kids who grew up playing video games?\"\n\nPomerantz is still warming a bar stool at the Sky-Ride Tap, across from the CBOT, most days but he has watched the crowds dwindle away.\n\n\"Years ago, you couldn't even get in here,\" he said. \"They were four or five deep at the bar. Now, you might as well sit in Afghanistan and trade.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/07/14/5-questions-winery-leader-bill-oliver/87060990/", "title": "5 questions with winery leader Bill Oliver", "text": "Amy Lynch\n\nFor Bill Oliver, the business of winemaking is a family affair.\n\nBill’s father, a law professor at Indiana University, fell in love with winemaking as a hobby and launched Oliver Winery in 1972. Bill took charge as president in 1983; his wife, Kathleen, joined the team as general manager in 1993.\n\nUnder Oliver’s direction, the oldest and largest winery in Indiana produces more than 360,000 cases annually in a diverse portfolio of products. This year, Oliver was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Eastern Winery Exposition in Lancaster, Pa. He recently transitioned into the role of CEO to make way for the winery’s new president, Julie Adams. In turn, he plans to focus on team building, capital projects and the creation of a new facility that will triple the winery’s production capacity.\n\n“New products are another priority for me, as our growth depends on having great new wines that resonate with consumers,” he said. “My background is mostly from the winemaking side of our business, so I’m frequently showing up in the winemaking offices tasting and collaborating with the winemaking team.”\n\nAlthough Oliver’s Soft Red and Soft White remain favorites among Hoosier wine drinkers, he said it’s a mistake to generalize about the characteristics of Indiana wines.\n\n“We make classic vinifera wines from our own grapes that would stand up against any California wine, but the world is awash in great vinifera wines such as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon,” he said. “We’ve found a growth opportunity in unique wines with solid appeal. Some of those are dry; some are sweet.”\n\nOliver also is quick to point out just how much Indiana’s booming wine industry has evolved over the past few decades.\n\n“The wine has gotten a lot better, for sure,” he said. “There’s a higher level of business savviness as well. Social media has been a great thing for smaller wineries, giving them a platform to build a brand and build relationships.”\n\nAs to the wine industry’s future in Indiana, Oliver predicts we’ll see continued quality improvements and increased sales.\n\n“I believe consumers want to buy from businesses that not only offer a great product, but that also offer a personal relationship,” he said. “Indiana wineries are real businesses operated by people you can meet in person simply by visiting their tasting rooms. We sit on the genuine side of the spectrum, and that speaks to consumers who want authenticity.”\n\nQuestion: What does the word “leader” mean to you?\n\nAnswer:Leadership is about creating a vision and getting others on board to collectively work toward achieving that vision. Good leaders inspire and bring the best out of others.\n\nQ: What are your biggest successes you’ve had on the job?\n\nA:Building one of the largest wineries in the eastern U.S. — and doing so with my wife as my primary business partner — has been my biggest achievement. I’m very proud of the team we’ve built across winery functions — winemaking, sales, marketing and hospitality. We have the best crew of hardworking and dedicated people that we’ve ever had. Our employees are simply good people and make coming to work loads of fun.\n\nTen years ago, we transitioned Oliver Winery to 100 percent employee ownership through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Employees are incentivized by sharing in the company’s successes, and this is a model that has contributed to our success.\n\nQ: If you weren’t involved in wine, what would you be doing?\n\nA:That’s actually a question I ponder on occasion. My other love is aviation. I can see myself as a commercial pilot, but probably not for airlines. I’m more of an Alaskan Bush pilot kind of guy. Or perhaps running a school teaching aerobatics, and showing up in the air-show circuit.\n\nQ: Do you have a business philosophy you try to follow?\n\nA:My business philosophy is fundamentally the four operating principles of Oliver Winery — respect people, expect quality, think differently and get stuff done.\n\nQ: What is the best piece of career advice you’ve ever received?\n\nA: Unquestionably, it would be to never give up. You need tough skin, patience and perseverance to succeed in any business.\n\nMore about Bill Oliver\n\nJob title: CEO of Oliver Winery.\n\nEducation: MBA from Indiana University, 1993.\n\nPrior employment: Commercial balloon pilot and instructor.\n\nFamily: Wife, Kathleen; three sons.\n\nFavorite pastimes: Wilderness travel, skiing, bicycling, aviation and cooking.\n\nFavorite musical artists: Jimmy Buffett, Bonnie Raitt, Aaron Neville, Pentatonix.\n\nFavorite quote: “We’re free to live average lives on average decisions.

The incident occurred during Trump’s visit to watch the University of Alabama football game. The balloon, which is more than 20 feet tall, was set up in a nearby park. Jim Girvan, the organizer of a group that “adopts” out the Trump balloons for protests, said a man charged the balloon with a knife and cut an 8-foot-long gash in the back. In a news release, Tuscaloosa police said Hoyt Deau Hutchinson, 32, was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal mischief. The orange, diaper-clad, cellphone-clutching caricature of the president is often taken to Trump appearances as a way to protest him. “Baby Trump” first rose over London when local activists brainstormed a way to troll Trump. Now, several groups raise money to bring balloon replicas across the U.S. It is unclear whether Hutchinson has an attorney who could comment.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: State officials said they need another 10 years to reduce air pollution by half in Fairbanks, but the deadline is Dec. 31. The Daily News-Miner reported that U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan proposed a bill to push the deadline as late as December 2028 to comply with smoke pollution standards. Representatives under Sullivan said state officials requested the bill. The state Department of Environmental Conservation said in a state implementation cleanup plan that 2029 is the earliest Fairbanks could reach federal air quality standards. State officials said a five-year extension could be requested if they do not meet the clean air quality deadline. Officials said a new plan for clean air must be developed if the request is denied. Officials said they are already developing that plan.\n\nArizona\n\nKingman: Mohave County in northwestern Arizona is officially on the record as a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” in support of gun rights. The county Board of Supervisors’ unanimous vote last Monday followed similar actions by some state, county and local governments to take a public stance on the issue. The resolution said in part the board won’t authorize county spending or other resources for “enforcing laws that unconstitutionally infringe on the people’s right to keep and bear arms.” Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar and GOP state legislators Sonny Borrelli and Leo Biasiucci spoke in favor of the resolution that County Supervisor Hildy Angius called a nonbinding “statement of fight.” Mohave County Democratic Party Chairperson Mary McCord Robison urged the board to delay consideration of the resolution, which she called divisive and redundant.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The U.S. Senate has confirmed a former Arkansas solicitor general as federal judge in Little Rock. President Donald Trump nominated 40-year-old Lee Philip Rudofsky for the U.S. District Court in eastern Arkansas. The Senate approved the pick Thursday on a party-line vote. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that Democratic Sen. Patty Murray from Washington argued against Rudofsky’s confirmation, saying he supported abortion restrictions when he was a solicitor general and opposed LGBTQ rights. Rudofsky had said he would follow Supreme Court precedent. Arkansas Republican Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton backed Rudofsky’s confirmation. Rudofsky served as Walmart’s senior director of global anti-corruption compliance. He clerked for judges in Massachusetts and Alaska. Federal district judges can serve for life and earn $210,900 annually.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg will soon be staring down at pedestrians in the heart of San Francisco where an artist is painting a massive mural of the Nobel nominee. SFGate reported Friday that Argentine muralist Andres Iglesias, who signs his art with the pseudonym Cobre, is set to finish the artwork in Union Square sometime this week. Iglesias told SFGate he is donating his time to complete the work and that he hopes the mural helps people realize “we have to take care of the world.” He also painted a mural of Robin Williams in downtown San Francisco that has since been demolished. Cobre said he had been searching for a building downtown for a new mural when he was approached by environmental nonprofit One Atmosphere.\n\nColorado\n\nAspen: Researchers continue to study a series of destructive avalanches in Colorado last winter. Some of the avalanches from March 1-14 caused unprecedented damage, destroying a home and a mining structure dating to 1881. Brian Lazar with the Colorado Avalanche Information Center told an audience in Carbondale on Wednesday nobody alive had seen avalanches that severe in Colorado. The center recorded nearly 1,000 avalanches but Lazar suspected the real number was closer to 5,000. The center documented 87 avalanches at or above D4, or fourth-strongest on a D1-D5 scale. Officials documented 24 D4 avalanches in Colorado over the previous nine years. The Aspen Times reported some mountains got up to 12 feet of snow.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new group has been charged with finding ways to improve recycling efforts in Connecticut and lower costs for cities and towns. House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz’s Blue Ribbon Panel on Recycling is scheduled to hold its first meeting Tuesday at the Legislative Office Building. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities in March said municipalities across the state have seen municipal recycling move from being a revenue generator for their communities to a growing expense as the market price for recyclables has collapsed. In January 2018, China stopped accepted lower-grade recyclables, leaving many communities in the U.S. without a market. The conference gave the example of Bridgeport, where recycling shifted from a $129,000 revenue generator to a nearly $400,000 expense. And North Haven had gone from paying no cost to $70 per ton.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The sound of engines revving briefly filled Wilmington’s Hilltop neighborhood Saturday afternoon when members of the Pagan Motorcycle Club gathered to remember a man who was shot and killed by a Wilmington police officer 13 years ago. About 30 members gathered near the steps of a home in the 1400 block of W. Sixth Street, where Derek J. Hale was shot to death by Lt. William Browne during an investigation of the motorcycle club. Browne was cleared of wrongdoing by the state Attorney General’s office in 2007. The group’s motorcycles filled the block, arranged in two long lines between parked cars as the club’s leader, Paul Fitzwater, shared a few words with the motorcyclists and residents looking on from their porches. After less than 10 minutes, their engines roared and the group left. Hale was a decorated Marine who had served two tours in Iraq. He had a son and a daughter. In 2010, Wilmington settled a lawsuit filed by Hale’s widow, Elaine. She agreed to drop a federal lawsuit against Wilmington after she received $875,000 from the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: On Nov. 19, the district will say one of its hardest goodbyes, to beloved panda Bei Bei, WUSA-TV reported. The 4-year-old panda will leave the Smithsonian National Zoo for China as part of the panda diplomacy program between the U.S and China. An agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association requires all cubs born at the zoo to move to China when they turn 4. Bei Bei will play in his outside habitat for the last time on Nov. 19 between 7 and 8 a.m. before he makes his way to Dulles Airport for a long flight. To give his many adoring fans time to bid Bei Bei farewell, the Smithsonian National Zoo is holding a series of public events from Nov. 11 through Nov. 18. Panda Cam 1 will focus exclusively on Bei Bei for the duration of his “goodbye week.” Through Nov. 17 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., patrons can visit Bei Bei in his outdoor habitat and write a postcard that will get sent to China with Bei Bei. At 11 a.m., panda keepers will be on hand to answer any Bei Bei questions. Bei Bei was born on Aug. 22, 2015, and was given his name, which means ‘precious’ or ‘treasure’, five weeks after his birth by Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan, the first lady of China. Bei Bei will be accompanied by one panda keeper and a veterinarian on his nonstop flight to Chengdu, China, and the team will monitor him throughout the flight, and make sure he has a ready supply of his favorite treats.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Shark experts said the coast of Florida is starting to heat up with great white shark activity. OCSEARCH, a research group, said the annual migration to warmer waters off the Florida and Carolinas coasts is underway. The Palm Beach Post reported that eight great white sharks tagged by the Utah-based research group were spotted from New Jersey to Florida in the last week. Three other sharks that had been tagged were detected Wednesday in waters on North Carolina beaches, and two more sharks – Helena and the 2,076-pound Unama’ki – made their presence known with toothy grins just west of Key West in September. Unama’ki had been tagged off Nova Scotia in September. She’s 15-feet, 5-inches long. It’s not unusual for great whites to call southern waters home during winter and sightings are common near popular fishing and diving spots in Florida through spring.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service is giving visitors an inside look at the life of Union soldiers occupying a captured Confederate fort on the Georgia coast during the Civil War. Veterans Day weekend events at Fort Pulaski National Monument include reenactors taking on the roles of troops in the 48th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The regiment was stationed at Fort Pulaski east of Savannah for a year after it was seized from Confederate troops in 1862. The Union soldiers stayed ready for a counterattack that never came. Weekend visitors will see how the soldiers performed drills, as well as cannon and weapon firing demonstrations. Exhibits throughout the park include photographs of the 48th New York Volunteers during their time at Fort Pulaski.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Navy said it is considering a new plan to use double-wall tanks to upgrade a fuel storage facility in Honolulu. Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday that the Navy updated its initial proposal to reinforce tanks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. The Navy said if the upgrade cannot be completed it will relocate the fuel in 20 tanks that sit atop the Southern Oahu Basal Aquifer. A 2014 leak of 27,000 gallons of fuel at the facility threatened Oahu’s drinking water and prompted calls for improvements. The Navy’s Sept. 9 proposal had favored single-wall tank upgrades with added monitoring features. The plan was rejected by a Honolulu City Council committee last month and was opposed by the Board of Water Supply.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A panel of lawmakers is looking at making changes to Idaho’s only independent performance evaluations agency, possibly by having staffers focus more on legislative budgets and less on whether state programs are working properly. The Office of Performance Evaluations does deep-dive research and auditing of state agencies and programs, looking for ways the state can fix any problems and become more efficient. Often the reports have uncovered big issues, such as increasing delays in the parole process, rapidly growing caseloads for child welfare workers and problems with the monitoring of state contracts worth millions of dollars. Rep. Wendy Horman, the House vice-chair of the legislative budget-writing committee, said her committee needs more staffers available to quickly research and answer questions about the impact of state budgeting decisions. But House Minority Leader Mat Erpelding said the right solution would be to add more resources to the budget-writing committee, not to cannibalize another office.\n\nIllinois\n\nOlympia Fields: A suburban Chicago post office has been named in honor of Robert Martin, an original member of the famed all-black Tuskegee Airmen who flew scores of missions in World War II. U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, who introduced legislation in February to name the post office for Martin, called him “an American hero.” Martin’s children attended the unveiling of a plaque in their father’s honor at the post office. He lived in Olympia Fields from 2008 until his death at age 99 in July 2018. Martin was born in Dubuque, Iowa, on Feb. 9, 1919. Before the war, Martin earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He was a captain when he was discharged from the Army in 1945. He then worked as an electrical engineer in Chicago until retiring in 1988. Martin received his wings in 1944 and was commissioned a second lieutenant, then flew with a squadron based in Italy. On his 64th mission, Martin was shot down by enemy gunfire near Zagreb, Yugoslavia, in March 1945. He spent a month behind enemy lines with partisans in a secret Yugoslavian camp before the Allied advance allowed him to return to his base in Italy.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:The Veterans Day Council of Indianapolis has canceled the annual Veterans Day Parade because of the possibility of inclement weather, The American Legion, Department of Indiana said Friday. “The projected freezing temperatures and possible snowfall/freezing rain could not only create a dangerous situation for all involved, but it could also hinder operations to clear the roads along the parade route,” the group wrote in a press release. The National Weather Service said that along with bitterly cold temperatures, there is a chance of rain and snow before 11 a.m. Monday, and that rain is likely between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. There is also a 40% chance of snow Monday night, the weather service said. The annual Veterans Day Service will still take place, but it has been moved indoors to the Indiana War Memorial’s Pershing Auditorium, according to the release. It will begin at 11 a.m. Monday. The Veterans Day Breakfast, scheduled for 8-10 a.m. in the Murat Arabian Room at 502 N. New Jersey St., will not be affected by weather, the release said\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Iowa Appeals Court has ruled against a convicted killer who said he “died” during a medical emergency and thus fulfilled his life sentence. Wapello County court records said Benjamin Schreiber has been serving the life term since being convicted in 1997 of beating a man to death. Schreiber said his heart stopped five times on March 30, 2015, at a hospital where he had been taken from the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison. Schreiber filed for release in April 2018. A district judge found little merit in Schreiber’s argument, saying his filing confirmed he was still among the living. The appeals court affirmed that ruling Wednesday, saying: “Schreiber is either alive, in which case he must remain in prison, or he is dead, in which case this appeal is moot.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The city will add the state’s first electric buses to its public transit fleet in hopes of saving hundreds of thousands of dollars and reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. The first bus is expected to hit the road this month, and an additional 10 should come into service next year, KCUR reported. The city’s transit director, Mike Tann, won a $2 million federal grant that allowed the city to purchase four new electric buses from manufacturer ProTerra. Tann also bought seven smaller electric buses from a company called Custom Coach Works, and those vehicles will replace aging buses that look like old trolleys and run downtown Wichita routes. Wichita Transit has also remodeled its bus barn and placed0 charges for 14 buses. Transit workers will plug in buses to charge overnight, which should prepare buses to run for about 150 miles by morning. The agency estimates each electric bus will run for 12 years and save the city $462,000 in that time compared to its diesel counterpart. Tann estimated every diesel bus in the fleet will be replaced by an electric- or hydrogen-powered bus as early as 2027.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Officials have removed drought declarations for all 120 counties in the state. A Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet news release said recent rains have eliminated precipitation deficits and improved stream flows and soil moisture levels. Statewide drought declarations were issued Oct. 3, but officials said precipitation since then has helped ease the moderate to severe drought conditions. State climatologist Stuart Foster said October finished as the third-wettest on record.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Nearly $10 million in 2010 oil spill money is rebuilding a barrier island bird rookery off Louisiana. Work on Queen Bess Island had to wait for this year’s nesting season to end in August and must finish by late February or early March before the next nesting season. Queen Bess Island was the first spot where brown pelicans were returned to Louisiana after the pesticide DDT wiped out Louisiana’s state bird in the 1960s. Today, the island supports Louisiana’s third-largest brown pelican nesting colony, with about 15% to 20% of all nests in the state. But its usable nesting area is now down to about 5 acres. The island also was heavily hit by oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, but that has been cleaned and birds are back. Plans call for 30 acres of pelican habitat and 7 acres for terns and skimmers, smaller birds that nest on gravel. The $9.8 million contract with New Orleans-based Pontchartrain Partners LLC. is only part of the project. Engineering, design, operation, maintenance and monitoring will be adding up to nearly $7 million more, said Chuck Perrodin, spokesman for the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. Many pelicans have stayed in the area despite the construction work, and biologists said that’s a good sign, WVUE-TV reported.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine troopers are preparing to issue traffic citations via computers in their cruisers. The motorist gets a printout of the citation, which is electronically sent to court. Trooper Anthony Keim, the first to test the “e-citation program,” said it’s easier to type out the ticket than to write out a ticket by hand. It will be rolled out to all state police cruisers in December. But it comes with a cost of about $1,000 per cruiser. That’s a problem for smaller departments but some of them are hoping grants might eventually cover those costs.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A Maryland lawmaker said legislation is being considered to resolve a long-running lawsuit in federal court over program disparities between four historically black colleges and traditionally white colleges. Del. Charles Sydnor, a Baltimore County Democrat, said Friday he is working with other lawmakers on proposals for a settlement of at least $577 million. That’s the amount that an attorney representing the HBCUs has recommended. Sydnor spoke at a news conference to discuss a rally this week calling for a fair resolution. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has offered to settle the lawsuit for $200 million over 10 years. House Speaker Adrienne Jones has urged Hogan to settle the case for $577 million. Hogan responded that lawmakers could find ways to reach the higher amount in the upcoming budget process.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNeedham: A solider killed in World War II has been laid to rest after his remains were recently identified. WCVB-TV reported a memorial service was held Saturday at St. Joseph Church in Needham for U.S. Army 1st Lt. Joseph Edward Finneran. He was buried with full military honors in Mount Benedict Cemetery in Boston’s West Roxbury neighborhood, alongside his mother. The 22-year-old was shot down north of Bucharest, Romania, on Aug. 1, 1943, during a bombing mission. He was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and other military honors. Finneran’s unidentified remains had been kept inside a military cemetery in Belgium for 70 years, along with other Americans killed during “Operation Tidal Wave.” The Pentagon last month announced it had accounted for Finneran using anthropological and DNA analysis.\n\nMichigan\n\nBowne Township: Quick-thinking hunters in central Michigan rescued two deer who became locked in battle. WOOD-TV reported that insurance agent Mark Johnson spotted the rutting bucks in a field with their antlers entangled. He figured the eight-point bucks would die from exhaustion or starvation if they stayed stuck. Video of Wednesday’s rescue on WOOD-TV’s website showed Johnson’s friend, Brad Lyons, deploying a specialized branch saw to cut part of an antler. That enabled the bucks to pull away and run off. The rescue came a week before the opening of firearms deer season. Johnson, Lyons and another acquaintance who showed up to help are hunters and in other circumstances, the bucks would have been prized trophies. What they got from the encounter instead was a good story to tell and a chunk of sawed-off antler.\n\nMinnesota\n\nFergus Falls: Gov. Tim Walz headed to Fergus Falls for the 17th annual Governor’s Deer Hunting Opener. Walz spoke at the Big Buck Brunch on Friday to kick off the event. He met later with local fourth- and fifth-graders to talk about the importance of outdoor education. The governor was scheduled to head into the woods in Austin on Saturday morning for the opening of Minnesota’s firearms deer season. It was Walz’s first Governor’s Deer Hunting Opener, a tradition that began under Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Walz is known mostly as a pheasant hunter. The governor bagged a rooster Saturday in mostly wet and windy conditions. The Star Tribune reported that Walz was joined by Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan, state Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen, Explore Minnesota Director John Edman, members of Pheasants Forever, as well as local elected officials and Austin Mayor Tom Stiehm. Nearly 500,000 hunters are expected to participate in Minnesota’s 2019 deer season. According to a 2011 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report, all hunting-related expenditures in Minnesota totaled $725 million annually, with deer hunting helping to support 3,760 jobs.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: A monument is being rededicated in a national park on a Civil War battlefield. A ceremony is scheduled for Monday at Vicksburg National Military Park. The Vicksburg Post reported the monument underwent a $75,000 restoration funded by the state and promoted by a group called Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park and Campaign. Work included masonry repairs, testing of the monument’s lightning suppression system and thorough cleaning. It was done by the National Park Service’s Historic Preservation Training Center. The monument was dedicated on Nov. 12, 1909, and honors the state’s 32 infantry units, 17 artillery units, and 37 cavalry units that served in the Confederate Army during the 1863 Vicksburg Campaign of the Civil War.\n\nMissouri\n\nEminence:A herd of seven wild horses that was causing problems at a state park has been rounded up and adopted. The Springfield News-Leader reported that visitors to Echo Bluff State Park in Eminence were feeding the horses, raising concerns that someone might be seriously injured. That didn’t happen, but one of the horses chewed up a park visitor’s motorcycle seat. Missouri Wild Horse League secretary Carolyn Dyer said several cars received paint damage from horses in the park lodge’s parking lot. One of the horses even seemed to figure out how to press the button to open the lodge’s front door with its nose. Dyer said all seven of the wild horses in the park found homes with Missouri horse lovers.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Wildlife authorities are investigating the poaching of a mule deer buck in southwest Montana. KECI-TV reported that Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks game warden Justin Singleterry said the case involves a 4-by-4 buck that was found poached east of Corvallis in the Bitterroot Valley. An investigation determined the buck was killed on location and then discarded down a steep embankment. Nothing was taken from the deer and its meat was left to waste. A member of the public reported the deer poached last Thursday. The deer might have been killed days before it was discovered.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Wildlife officials are urging owners of small pets – even those in cities – to be vigilant in protecting them from coyotes. Coyotes are common throughout Nebraska, including in some urban areas where there are creek bottoms, green space with tall grass and agricultural fields. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission cautioned people against approaching or feeding a coyote. It also suggested not leaving pet food outside and keeping an eye on pets outside, even if they’re out for just a few minutes. Pets should be kept on a leash and not allowed to roam at night. The commission said most interactions people experience with coyotes are between coyotes and dogs because of the territorial nature of both animals. Coyotes typically avoid people, so attacks on humans are rare.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A 67-year-old man who became one of the longest-serving inmates in Nevada history after he was convicted of murdering a woman at a Lake Tahoe casino in 1971 has been released from prison. Michael Anselmo spent 47 years behind bars. His Nov. 1 release came more than a decade after a Nevada Supreme Court justice who previously prosecuted him as Washoe County district attorney recommended he be given the possibility of parole. Anselmo initially was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in 1972 in the killing of a 22-year-old co-worker at Cal Neva Lodge at Crystal Bay on Tahoe’s north shore. His sentence was commuted in 2005 at the urging of Justice Bob Rose to allow for possible parole. Rose told fellow members of the Pardons Board that, in those days, a convicted murderer could expect to serve 20 to 30 years. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that Anselmo did not have a constitutional right to parole. He was finally granted parole for the murder charge in June 2018 but remained imprisoned to complete his sentence for a 1976 escape attempt.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A plaque commemorating a New Hampshire man who was piloting one of the planes that was hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, is missing from the Portsmouth tree where it had been chained for 17 years. The plaque honors Tom McGuinness, the co-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11, which was hijacked by terrorists and crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. A year after McGuinness’ death, his widow planted a maple tree in front of the Thomas J. McIntyre Federal Building in Portsmouth and installed the plaque. Seacoastonline.com reported it appears a bolt that connected the plaque to a chain was cut. City and federal officials don’t know what happened. Police were unaware the plaque was missing until asked about it by the news organization.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: Some residents have been getting an early Thanksgiving surprise. A gaggle of 40 to 60 wild turkeys has been aggressively terrorizing residents daily in a 55-and-older community in Ocean County. Holiday City residents said the turkeys are blocking doorways, pecking at cars and behaving aggressively when they are shooed away. The wild turkeys can sometimes weigh between 16 and 24 pounds and run up to 20 mph. The township has received dozens of complaints but said its animal control is powerless in capturing or stopping the birds because they are not licensed to trap wildlife. A spokesman for the state’s Department of Environmental Protection said the agency is aware of the issue but does not have further comment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRehoboth: The Navajo Nation honored the life of a police officer who died from a medical problem while on duty. Friends, colleagues and tribal officials paid tribute to Sgt. Lamar Martin during a funeral on Friday in Rehoboth. A press release from the Navajo Nation said relatives described Martin as a great family man who loved his wife and children, enjoyed outdoor activities and liked reading books and comic books. His fellow officers recalled him as a mentor and leader who didn’t hesitate to share the expertise he gained in 22 years with the Navajo Police Department. Martin was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and New Mexico National Guard. He’s survived by his wife and five children.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is facing calls to create a $1 billion fund for climate change projects ranging from mass transit to aid to municipalities when fossil fuel plants close. A coalition of environmental and labor groups called NY Renews is asking Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo to include such a fund in his budget proposal. They said the money should come from New York’s general fund, and said additional revenue is needed to address climate change. Coalition members in an Oct. 28 letter to Cuomo said the fund could also support direct investments in renewables, environmental justice community projects and energy efficiency efforts for low-income families. Supporters said the fund will help New York fulfill a sweeping climate change law that passed this year. That law called for zero-emissions statewide by 2050.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: A University of North Carolina system investigation about the former interim chancellor of East Carolina University determined he “probably consumed” between seven and 10 drinks over several hours while visiting popular student bars in Greenville. The system released late Friday a report from a law firm it hired to investigate events involving Dan Gerlach in late September and anonymous emails sent to university leaders about him. Videos and photos on social media showed Gerlach “interacting with college-aged young adults and taking selfies.” Gerlach was placed on administrative leave, then resigned Oct. 26 as another video surfaced. The report found the emailed allegations largely false. The law firm did find Gerlach ultimately drove a short distance home after visiting the bars. Gerlach didn’t respond to a text on Saturday seeking comment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state will receive federal help for farmers and ranchers who struggled with an early blizzard and wet harvest conditions. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the secretarial disaster designation on Friday. Gov. Doug Burgum requested the help last week to help make federal loans available to farmers and ranchers. To qualify for a secretarial designation, a county must have experienced a minimum 30% production loss of at least one crop because of a natural disaster. In North Dakota, 47 of the state’s 53 counties report meeting that threshold.\n\nOhio\n\nAshland: A law enforcement official said he has persuaded bishops of an Amish sect to install blinking lights on buggies to make them more visible to motorists. The Ashland Times-Gazette reported Ashland County Chief Deputy Sheriff Carl Richert has been working with local Amish and Mennonite communities for years to make their buggies and wagons easier to spot. Richert said the community that agreed to install blinkers is more liberal and modern than other sects. He said he has warned community leaders that if they don’t begin using reflective tape and lights on their buggies the Ohio Legislature could pass laws mandating them. A local Amish buggy maker has ordered about 200 battery-powered blinking lights and anticipates community members will generally be willing to use them.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The state’s 35 tribal nations with casinos have rejected arbitration in a dispute with the state over whether existing gaming compacts automatically renew at the end of the year. The Tulsa World reported that the tribes said in a letter to state Attorney General Mike Hunter that they remain unified in the belief the compacts renew. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt has said the 15-year-old compacts expire at the end of the year and wants to renegotiate them to give the state a larger share of casino revenue. The tribes pay fees of between 4% and 10% of a casino’s net revenue and receive exclusive rights to operate casinos in the state. The fees generated nearly $139 million for the state last year. Stitt spokeswoman Baylee Lakey said the governor is disappointed the tribes declined arbitration. Hunter’s office declined comment.\n\nOregon\n\nCanyonville: Someone shot a bald eagle to death in western Oregon, and the police want to find out who did it. Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife troopers are seeking tips from the public. The troopers responded on Wednesday to a report that a bald eagle was seen dead in Lower Cow Creek, in Douglas County. A photo showed the bird face-down in the water. They determined it was shot one to two days before being found. A reward of up to $2,500 is offered for information leading to a conviction. The killing, or possession of a bald eagle or its parts, is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of up to $100,000.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHempfield Township: Officials said three trains were involved in a derailment in western Pennsylvania, prompting cancellation of rail service between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, but no injuries were reported. Three Norfolk Southern Corp. trains were involved in the derailment around 2:30 p.m. Friday just west of the Georges Station Road bridge in Hempfield, about 3 miles east of Greensburg. Norfolk Southern said one westbound train struck the rear of another, and derailed cars hit part of an eastbound train. A total of 11 rail cars transporting 50 shipping containers derailed, blocking lines that carry freight and passengers between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Norfolk Southern said in a statement Saturday that cranes, excavators, loaders and other heavy equipment were being used to clear the tracks, and service restoration was expected late Saturday night.\n\nRhode Island\n\nExeter: State Police said a single-engine Rockwell International 112A airplane experienced mechanical problems shortly after taking off from T.F. Green Airport in Warwick at 4:45 p.m. Saturday. The pilot was heading to Long Island, New York, but had to make an emergency landing on Interstate 95 near Exeter. State Police said the pilot changed the plane’s direction to avoid landing in the highway’s busier southbound side, potentially saving lives. The plane landed safely in the northbound lane. The pilot and his passenger were not injured. State Police didn’t name the pilot but said he’s a New York resident with eight years of flying experience. They’ve also turned over the plane to the National Transportation Safety Board for their review.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: It’s about to look a lot more like Christmas at the Statehouse. The Columbia Garden Club said the state Christmas tree will arrive in front of the Statehouse on Tuesday morning. First lady Peggy McMaster will speak along with members of the club after the tree arrives. Then the garden club will start decorating. The garden club said in a statement that the tree will be fully trimmed and the lights turned on Nov. 24 at the end of the annual Governor’s Carolighting ceremony. South Carolina has put up a Christmas tree in front of the Statehouse for more than 50 years.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Officials said South Dakota has sold nearly 26,000 fewer hunting licenses this year, which has cost the state more than $1 million in lost revenue. State Department of Game, Fish and Parks official Heather Villa told the Rapid City Journal that the long winter, flooding and a decline in the pheasant population could be to blame. However, she acknowledged that the drop in license sales could also be a continuation of a decades-long decline in hunting, trapping and fishing. The department generally gets about half its budget from license revenue, and it adopted a resolution last month to examine the recruitment, retention and reactivation of hunters, anglers and trappers. Gov. Kristi Noem has created a live-trap giveaway and set a bounty on certain predators to encourage hunting.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Mitsubishi Electric said it is talking with a potential buyer for its Memphis plant. Mitsubishi Electric general manager Joe Durante told The Commercial Appeal the company expects the third-party prospective buyer would hire at least some current Memphis workers. He said the possible buyer has a U.S. presence, but declined to identify it. The facility opened in 2013, creating buzz as a high-tech game-changer for manufacturing in Memphis. The 212-employee plant opened with more than $45 million in state and local tax incentives, and included the company’s head office for its U.S. transformer business. Durante declined to disclose current Memphis employment totals. Durante said the Japanese company came across the possible buyer while exploring ways to increase Memphis sales through a joint venture, technology sharing or a sale.\n\nTexas\n\nTurkey: A newly released report has found a September plane crash in est Texas occurred when the pilot’s crop-duster stalled out after dumping hundreds of gallons of pink water during a couple’s gender reveal celebration. One passenger suffered minor injuries when the plane crashed Sept. 7 near Turkey, about 260 miles northwest of Dallas. A National Transportation Safety Board report released Thursday said the pilot dumped about 350 gallons of pink water from the aircraft, which then stalled and crashed. Gender reveal parties for expecting parents have grown in popularity but mishaps can be deadly. Last month, an Iowa woman was killed when a homemade device that was meant to spray colorful powder into the air instead exploded like a pipe bomb.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah principal and teacher have returned to work from a week of paid leave after school district officials completed an investigation into a student dressed as a Nazi for a Halloween parade. The Davis County School District announced Friday the two Creekside Elementary employees have been reinstated but did not specify why they were placed on leave. Online photos showed a boy wearing a swastika on the sleeve of a long-sleeve dark brown shirt. Officials said the school district does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portrays or promotes hate in any form. District officials said it cannot discuss further details of the investigation. The student’s name or what disciplinary action was taken was not released. The United Jewish Federation of Utah called the costume “intolerably offensive.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Young people were in the forests of Vermont participating in a two-day youth deer hunting weekend. Anyone 15 years old or younger who successfully completed a hunter education course could participate if they obtained a hunting authorization and obtained a free youth deer hunting tag. The young hunter must be accompanied by an unarmed adult over 18 years of age who holds a Vermont hunting license. Youth deer hunting weekend is intended to ensure that young hunters get the quality training they need for lifelong participation. Vermont’s 16-day rifle deer hunting season begins Nov. 16.\n\nVirginia\n\nBristol: The state has received 18 requests for funding under a new pilot program that will dole out millions of dollars to reclaim abandoned coal mines. The Bristol Herald Courier obtained grant requests submitted for the federal government’s Abandoned Mine Land Pilot Program. The 18 requests ask for more than $24 million in funding; $10 million is to be awarded. The proposals range from outdoor recreation to agricultural uses. The Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy administers the program in Virginia. A department spokeswoman said the projects will be screened for eligibility. An advisory council will then recommend projects to the federal government for final approval. Clinch River Hemp Co. submitted the largest funding request. It wants $4.11 million for a project aimed at remediation by cultivating hemp.\n\nWashington\n\nIllia: The Nez Perce Tribe and Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission released 37 wild steelhead into the Snake River below Lower Granite Dam in hopes of boosting the number of spawning steelhead. The Lewiston Tribune reported the fish, known as kelts, were captured at the dam as they tried to return to the ocean after spawning in their natal streams. They were held for one or two years at Dworshak National Fish Hatchery to allow them to regain strength, and they were released Tuesday, ready to spawn again. Steelhead are unique among anadromous fish – fish that migrate from the sea to reproduce – in that they don’t necessarily die after spawning. Still, it’s rare for female steelhead to make it as far as the Lower Granite Dam to spawn a second time. Less than a half-percent of Snake River steelhead are able to make the repeat trip on their own, said Doug Hatch, a fisheries scientist with the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission at Portland, Oregon. The repeat spawners have on average about 5,000 eggs. Wild Snake River steelhead are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and this fall’s steelhead run is shaping up to be one of the worst on record. The kelt program is listed as one of the emergency responses that could be implemented when fish numbers are alarmingly low. The National Marine Fisheries Service said this week that steelhead numbers have declined steeply since a robust return recorded in 2014.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s Ethics Commission has determined that a panel of teenagers is subject to the state’s open meetings law. According to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the commission’s Open Governmental Meetings Committee determined Thursday that the Charleston Youth Council falls under the law’s requirements of advance public notice of meetings and agendas, restrictions on closed-door sessions and other provisions. Charleston Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin’s council aims to help seven to 13 city teens between 14 and 18 years old develop leadership skills and understand local government. They will attend city council meetings, perform community service and advise Goodwin on how Charleston can improve relations with its youth. The ethics panel was divided, with concerns about imposing onerous requirements on teenagers and other worries about creating a loophole that government entities might exploit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is proposing raising state employees’ minimum wage to $15. Evers’ administration released its 2019-21 state employee compensation plan Friday. It called for raising all permanent state workers’ minimum wage to $15 an hour beginning June 7, 2020. It also called for a 2% across-the-board salary increase in each year of the biennium and raises for prison guards. Their starting wage would increase from $16.65 to $18.22 an hour. According to Evers’ administration, the entire package is expected to cost $84.15 million. The plan is subject to legislative approval. The Legislature’s finance committee has authorized money to cover the 2% raises and the prison guard raises.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The Park County Animal Shelter in Cody began a three-week quarantine last Monday after a litter of kittens came in carrying the disease feline parvo. None of the shelter’s dozens of cats can leave and no more can enter during the quarantine. The outbreak has killed at least 15 kittens, including all nine in the infected litter. Shelter manager Valerie Swensrund told the Cody Enterprise a vaccine nearly eradicated the disease but some people have stopped vaccinating their cats. The virus damages the intestines, bone marrow and lymph nodes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/12/11/best-gifts-boyfriends-gift-ideas-he-actually-love/6508397002/", "title": "Best gifts for boyfriends 2021: 39 gift ideas he will actually love", "text": "Camryn Rabideau and Jordan McMahon\n\nReviewed\n\n— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Trevor Haynes, current CEO of the Milford, Connecticut, company, told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview that starting this month, each franchisee will be allowed to decide whether to sell the sub that is so famous.\n\nOr infamous.\n\nWhen the chain brought back the $5 Footlong last winter after a years-long absence, many franchisees were irate. They complained loudly of the slim margins they earned off of the discounted 'wich, and according to Haynes, the company – whose restaurants are 100 percent franchised – listened to the gripes.\n\nMore:This week's recalls and warnings: Ford F-150s, Toyota Prius and Honey Smacks\n\nMore:Why wages are finally picking up. And will it last?\n\nMore:Facebook, Twitter and other tech stocks swoon amid threat of government regulation\n\n\"How do we help our franchises with more of a regional value message, so they're able to (have) a value proposition that fits with their economic model,\" Haynes said. \"If you look at California, there's a very different cost of business than in Arkansas.\"\n\nThe 53-year-old privately-held company, originally called Pete’s Super Submarines, had $16.8 billion in global sales in 2017, thanks to some 44,000 restaurants worldwide, including 25,000 in the U.S. Subway, which has put about 1,300 stateside locations on the chopping block in two years, declined to share growth percentages or customer traffic numbers.\n\nHaynes, 47, became CEO this summer after Suzanne Greco, sister of Subway co-founder Fred DeLuca, retired. The Australian has worked for the company for 12 years on three continents and inherited a brand still smarting from the sex and child-pornography scandal of former company spokesman Jared Fogle.\n\nThe demise of the $5 Footlong is just one of the differences customers will notice at Subway. Here are four other changes Haynes shared with USA TODAY.\n\nOther cheap eats are available\n\nRemember that some franchisees may choose to retain the $5 Footlong, but Subway is encouraging different markets to try their own value options. For examples, customers in San Francisco can now buy a $3.99 6-inch sub.\n\n\"Affordable food is what we've always stood for,\" Haynes said. \"It's not just about one price point.\"\n\nRestaurant consultant John Gordon of Pacific Management Consulting Group questions how low Subway can drop its prices, due to its main meats – ham, roast beef and chicken.\n\n\"Those are generally more costly on a per-pound basis than the ground beef that the burger guys use, so Subway has a hard time discounting,\" he said. \"There's a tremendous amount of franchisee disruption and negativity regarding this discounting ... They take it in the shorts. Their average check goes down.\"\n\nSo what about wacky stunt foods, so beloved by other fast-food brands such as Starbucks and Taco Bell?\n\n\"Maybe off-the-menu-type products or Unicorn-type drinks at some time, but it needs to be profitable and successful for our franchisees,\" Haynes said.\n\nNew tastes are coming down the pike\n\nThe chain is testing some more exotic tastes. Haynes said they're working on what's been dubbed Firebird chicken, a spicier rotisserie-type poultry, and guajillo steak.\n\nPlus, 200 San Diego locations are testing a quartet of new sandwiches, which the chain refers to as \"regional flavors\" – a Steakhouse Melt (shaved steak, American cheese, onions, green peppers, spinach and Sub Spice), a California Club (oven-roasted turkey, fresh avocado and Mustard Seed Spread), a Provencal Tuna Melt (tuna, cheese, tomatoes, spinach and Provencal herbs) and an Italian Grinder (pepperoni, Genoa salami, Black Forest ham, onions, Signature Herb Garlic Oil and cracked black pepper).\n\nNew beverages include Watermelon Agua Fresca and Passion Fruit Agua Fresca.\n\nAnd while the large, long rolls are a key part of Subway sandwiches, the company is now experimenting with paninis in California.\n\nThey're not the brand's first foray into alternative breads. In March, Subway launched a line of wraps, which Haynes called \"extremely successful for our brand.\" Subway had tried this carb form in in 2004, followed by a tortilla option in select markets three years later.\n\nGordon doesn't expect much from Subway's move to new tastes, though, explaining, \"Bold flavors and spices have been a big deal in restaurants for at least five years. They totally missed that. They were asleep at the switch.\"\n\nHe said the $5 Footlong was a hit in 2007-2008 due to the recession and the healthy image the veggie-heavy subs had at a time when Americans began to care more about what they ate. Then, crickets.\n\n\"That was 10 years ago. Nothing has happened at Subway essentially in 10 years,\" he said.\n\nGordon gives Subway a thumbs-up for its new wraps but advises moving away from bread and starting to serve meats shaved and stacked deli-style, if the chain wants to avoid fellow sub chain Quiznos's downward spiral.\n\nYou want how many pickles?!?\n\nThey key to Subway's continued success is underscoring customers' ability to pick precisely what they do and don't want on their sandwiches, according to Haynes.\n\n\"With other brands, it’s very much packaged formats. We customize. You can add as many tomatoes or olives as you want,\" he said. \"We have millions and millions of combinations and flavors.\"\n\nAaron Allen, founder of the Orlando, Florida-based eponymous global restaurant consulting firm, is unimpressed by Subway's continued emphasis on customization.\n\n\"It's certainly in the playbook of many more (fast-food) restaurants than it was previously,\" he said, explaining that with an increasing number of chains focusing on self-ordering – both at in-store kiosks and online – the approach becomes even less unique to Subway.\n\nSubway also is bumping up against increased competition from sandwich upstarts and their step-sibling, the hamburger joint.\n\n\"We need to stick to what we know and do it very, very well. We can't be distracted,\" Haynes said. \"Burger chains are big competitors. We need to make sure we’re playing in that arena as well.\"\n\nThe company records more than 7 million transactions globally every day, he added.\n\nDon't just Instagram the food\n\nSubway restaurants are being redesigned. The bright, fresh, green palette is vegetable-inspired, and the decor overhaul for everything from freestanding drive-thru locations to the kiosks will \"start in earnest\" next year, Haynes said.\n\nThe cost is about $40,000 for a typical 1,200-square-foot store.\n\nBut Allen wonders how many franchisees, more accustomed to makeovers every five to seven years, will be happy about spending money to spiff up their stores.\n\n\"It’s one of the lowest price-point franchises to get into,\" he said. \"But it also makes it hard to refresh and modernize. It’s difficult to get the franchisees to buy into that.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/29/entertainment/johnny-depp-amber-heard-careers/index.html", "title": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: Can their careers survive the trial ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter six weeks of testimony in a defamation trial that has aired the good, bad and the very ugly of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s former relationship, the case is now in the hands of the jury.\n\nWhatever the verdicts in Depp’s $50 million suit and Heard’s $100 million countersuit, something else is true: The fate of their respective careers will be decided in the court of public opinion, according to Hollywood insiders.\n\nCNN spoke with six entertainment industry experts for this story, some of whom spoke on background to protect professional relationships.\n\nWhether fair or unfair, the wave of support Depp has received on social media during the trial – especially on TikTok – may serve him well going forward, one veteran publicist who has known Depp for years told CNN.\n\n“I wasn’t sure what to expect before he took the stand and if anything, I believe this has done nothing but help his public image,” the source said.\n\nAnother top Hollywood publicist, who hasn’t worked with either Depp or Heard, said neither of their images have fared well.\n\n“Both are highly dysfunctional. Money is toxic and greed destroys. No one wins here,” this publicist said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Depp and Heard paint each other as abusers in trial testimonies 03:31 - Source: CNN\n\nA ‘forgiving’ industry\n\nNaturally, there are hurdles for both actors to overcome once their legal battle ends.\n\nHeard testified that Depp was verbally and physically abusive. She also accused Depp of sexual violence during their relationship.\n\nDepp claimed multiple times on the stand that he has never struck a woman, denied Heard’s allegation of sexual battery and called himself a victim of domestic abuse by Heard, which she denies.\n\nDepp and Heard met in 2009 on the set of their film “The Rum Diary” and were married from 2015-2016 before divorcing.\n\nPhotographs as well as audio and video recordings painted a picture of two people in a relationship with what was characterized as “mutual abuse” by Laurel Anderson, a clinical psychologist who worked with Depp and Heard in 2015 as their marriage counselor, in testimony played on April 14. (To illustrate how contentious this trial has been, the witness’s use of the term itself has spurred criticism.)\n\nEntertainment agent Darryl Marshak thinks film studios might – at least, initially – be hesitant to engage with the actors entangled in a controversy that has played out so publicly.\n\n“Robert Downey Jr. won an Academy Award and then aired his personal business out in the world and people kind of recoiled,” said Marshak, who has previously represented stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Hilary Swank. “I think Hollywood is a strange place. When you air your dirty laundry in front of the machine, the executives, all the people that make the parts move, they sort of recoil from a hot flame.”\n\nDepp claims a 2018 op-ed by Heard in which she described herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse” defamed him. He has starred in two films since the op-ed, which did not mention him by name, “Waiting for the Barbarians” and “Minamata,” both independent films.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Every word of it is true': Heard speaks on op-ed after break in defamation trial 04:33 - Source: CNN\n\nHeard, whose countersuit claims she was defamed by an attorney for Depp who called her abuse allegations a “hoax,” will appear in the sequel to “Aquaman,” scheduled for release in 2023.\n\nMarshak said he believes Depp’s “unbelievable talent” will help him return to movie screens.\n\n“Hollywood is also forgiving and as it moves forward and this thing stops airing and Johnny is able to move fluidly back into the business. I think he’ll reemerge again,” he said. “Hollywood is a fickle place.”\n\nThe courtroom performance by the legal teams for Depp and Heard – a live-streamed trial watched by millions – may also shape industry perspective on the two stars.\n\n“Globally, people have seemingly become polarized by the trial, we have watched this unfold in the press prior to its culmination in the courtroom, ” Amanda K. Ruisi, founder and president of AKR Public Relations & AKR Ventures, told CNN.\n\nRuisi believes Depp’s representatives have been more effective.\n\n“Mr. Depp’s legal and strategic communications team have done an incredible job in delivering a consistent message in the courtroom and throughout the media, which I believe has helped corral the support from his fan base.”\n\nNot that Depp’s supporters needed the nudge. The scales of social media justice are heavily tipped in his favor, so much so that the imbalance has prompted headlines pondering the reason behind it. One writer for The Cut asked, “Here is a woman recounting, in agonizing detail, how an extremely famous man allegedly abused her. Why, in 2022, do so many people seem to hate her for it?”\n\nSociologist Nicole Bedera offered a few theories – both on Twitter and in an article for Harper’s Bazaar – about why both female survivors of domestic abuse and many women period have seemed to support Depp.\n\n“It can be scary – and for victims, re-traumatizing – for women to empathize with an abuse survivor. If violence really *is* everywhere and if it *feels* like it can happen to anyone, then a lot of women will start to worry that they will be next,” she wrote. “So is it surprising that a lot of women are coming to Depp’s defense? No. Not at all.”\n\nHeard has had her supporters, but notably fewer vocal ones than Depp – both in the entertainment business and in and around the courthouse.\n\nHeard’s former co-star David Krumholtz has come to her defense publicly, actress Ellen Barkin testified for her defense team and comedian Kathy Griffin wrote in response to a pretrial tweet from Heard, “I’m thinking about you and sending all the love.”\n\nFor two working actors, the question once court is adjourned is will producers send them scripts as reliably as onlookers have been sending tweets?\n\nFranchise futures in peril?\n\nThe crux of both Heard and Depp’s lawsuits rests in claims that their careers – specifically their futures in respective film franchises – have been adversely affected.\n\nDuring the past several weeks of testimony, Depp’s team has tried to prove that Depp, who portrayed Jack Sparrow in five films, was dropped from a potential sixth film in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise due to Heard’s op-ed.\n\nJohnny Depp in \"Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\" Peter Mountain/Walt Disney/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nJerry Bruckheimer, who produced the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films, told The Times that “the future is yet to be decided” regarding Depp’s involvement in a possible next installment.\n\nThe producer said that the creative team is “developing two ‘Pirates’ scripts” – one that would potentially have Margot Robbie as the lead and “one without” Robbie.\n\nThe last film was 2017’s “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.”\n\nIn a taped deposition played for the court, Depp’s former agent, Christian Carino, who began representing Depp in October 2016 and even represented Depp and Heard at the same time, testified that he believed accusations of domestic violence made by Heard against Depp cost the actor a paycheck that would have been worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnd when an attorney for Heard pressed Carino on other issues Depp may have had while working on previous “Pirates” films, he dismissed them.\n\n“I’m aware of him being tardy but he’s been tardy on everything his entire life,” Carino said. “I think it’s troublesome to everybody, but everyone has learned how to produce a film to deal with it.”\n\nOther witnesses saw his behavior as more detrimental.\n\nTracey Jacobs, who testified in a recorded deposition and represented Depp for 30 years as his talent agent before being terminated, said as a witness that she was honest with Depp that showing up late consistently to sets and his behavior, including drug and alcohol use, was hurting his career.\n\n“His star had dimmed due to it getting harder to get him jobs given the reputation that he’d acquired due to his lateness and other things,” Jacobs testified. “People were talking and the question was out there about his behavior.”\n\nA Hollywood director, who hasn’t worked with Depp but has met him, told CNN that he doesn’t think Depp will ever helm another major franchise.\n\n“I believe that Johnny Depp will be able to be cast in various independent films because he still has significant name value and there’s an audience for him, however the studios will be more cautious because of insurance reasons and because of the potential to stop protection and they would be more concerned about public backlash as opposed to smaller independent companies,” he said.\n\nJason Momoa and Amber Heard in 2018's \"Aquaman.\" Warner Bros/Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to Heard, the director believes the attention around the trial hasn’t helped her image.\n\nCurrently, there’s a petition to have Heard dropped from the upcoming “Aquaman” sequel, which has already been filmed and is in post-production. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nThat likely won’t happen. But Walter Hamada, the head of DC Films, which produced “Aquaman,” testified that the creative team had concerns about Heard resuming her role in the franchise over a lack of chemistry with co-star Jason Momoa.\n\nHe also said the studio never planned to portray Heard as a co-lead in the second film and that Heard’s role was not reduced in the forthcoming film, titled “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.”\n\nWhatever decision the jury renders, Juda Engelmayer, founder of Herald PR, who has represented celebrities like disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, told CNN that Depp’s time in court – which included quirky, meme-able moments involving doodling and jelly beans – has bolstered his image.\n\n“His testimony, whether true or an act, has caused a resurgence of fans who missed him,” he said. “For his reputation and career, studios see he still has a fan base,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I knew it was wrong': Amber Heard testifies in defamation trial 04:46 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for Heard, whose career was less established than Depp’s when their relationship and troubling accusations began, that’s harder to say, according to sources.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, before the drama with Depp came to light, Heard told Vanity Fair she was up for the ebbs and flows of an acting career.\n\n“Do you think you would have pursued it if you knew it was gonna be this much of a circus?” Heard was asked in a 2013 interview.\n\n“Absolutely,” Heard responded. “I love very much the struggle that you’re constantly…you’re constantly put in a state of fight or flight. It’s a constant struggle. So I don’t know if I could have it any other way.”", "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "publish_date": "2022/05/29"}]}
