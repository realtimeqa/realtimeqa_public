Some of that growth reflects higher prices and not higher volume, since the firm’s figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. But Adobe said sales would have been higher even if inflation were factored in.\n\nAmericans are dipping into their savings accounts and racking up debt on credit cards to make purchases, according to Claire Tassin, Morning Consult’s retail and e-commerce analyst.\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of people leaning on savings and debt to afford a lot of these purchases,” Tassin told Christine Romans, CNN Business’ chief business correspondent. “Even more than credit cards, we’re seeing a lot of people leaning on ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ services, which is sort of a newer form of debt that American consumers are really embracing.”\n\nBNPL installment plans were about 80% higher compared to the previous week, Adobe said. Some lawmakers and economists have criticized BNPL programs for their lack of transparency and regulatory oversight.\n\nOnline shopping is expected to remain strong through Cyber Monday. Adobe predicts that American shoppers spent more than $9.55 billion across Saturday and Sunday, and that Monday will be the “biggest online shopping day again” — growing more than 5% from last year, to $11.2 billion.\n\nAdobe previously reported that US shoppers spent a record $5.29 billion on Thanksgiving Day, up 2.9% from a year ago.\n\nThe holiday shopping season looks very different now than it once did. Instead of doorbuster deals on Black Friday, many retailers began their holiday sales in early fall. Amazon (AMZN) held a second Prime Day event in October this year, and Walmart, Target (TGT) and others held competing savings events.\n\nBy spreading out their holiday deals online, retailers have reduced the draw of Black Friday.\n\nBut shoppers are returning to many of their pre-pandemic routines and retailers expect a more typical holiday season than the last two years in the pandemic. Shoppers are once again expected to buy around key holidays like Black Friday and also buy later in the season, hoping to land deals.\n\nThis year, inflation has squeezed many shoppers’ budgets. Retailers say customers are pulling back on discretionary spending like furniture and electronics and are being more selective about what they buy.\n\nThe number of people giving gift cards and money is “up significantly over last year,” Tassin said, likely because it’s an easy way for shoppers to “to stay on budget because you can control the amount.”\n\nIn total, holiday sales will increase by up to 8% this year, the National Retail Federation projects.\n\n–CNN’s Kevin France and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/reviewed/2022/12/02/best-cyber-monday-sales-2022/10813024002/", "title": "Cyber Monday 2022: Sales still going on at Amazon, Walmart and ...", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

This year, like has been the case in the past few years, retailers have be emphasizing online shopping. Cyber Monday is specifically intended to promote online shopping via exclusive, website-only deals from popular retailers.\n\n►Giving Tuesday 2021: Giving Tuesday: How to avoid scams when making donations\n\nWhen is Cyber Monday 2021?\n\nCyber Monday was on November 29, 2021. Each year, Black Friday occurs the day after Thanksgiving, with Cyber Monday following shortly after. This year, many Cyber Monday sales are continuing through this weekend.\n\nWhen do Cyber Monday 2021 sales start?\n\nWhile Cyber Monday officially fell on November 29, plenty of post-Cyber Monday sales are still available right now! This year, Amazon launched Cyber Monday on Saturday, November 27, and many other popular retailers followed suit. Although the bulk of the Cyber Monday promotions ran earlier this week, many stores have extend their discounts through this weekend.\n\nHow long do Cyber Monday sales last?\n\nThe best seasonal sales are usually limited to Black Friday and Cyber Monday—which took place on November 26 and November 29—however, some bargains have stuck around. Right now, plenty of Cyber Monday deals are still live—and we're rounding them up. We expect several of these extended Cyber Monday sales to continue through the end of this weekend.\n\nWhat stores offer Cyber Monday 2021 deals?\n\nNearly every retailer from big box stores, like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, to start-ups, like Leesa, Casper and Our Place, offer some sort of promotion in celebration of Cyber Monday.\n\nTo ensure that you’ll be able to check out with ease, make sure your shipping and payment information is up to date at the retailers you intend to shop. Be aware of how much cash back your credit cards will net for each retailer, or if there are benefits you’d like to use (for instance, some credit cards offer extended warranties for certain products purchased).\n\nMeanwhile, if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can sign up for a free, month-long trial. The subscription is $6.49 for students and $5.99 for those receiving qualifying government assistance. For everyone else, an Amazon Prime subscription will cost $12.99 per month, or $119 per year. This subscription gets you free two-day shipping, plus tons of other benefits, including Prime Gaming, Prime Video and access to Amazon’s Lightning deals.\n\nWho has the best Cyber Monday 2021 deals?\n\nIt depends on what you need. If you're looking to get a powerful computer or update your home media room, Best Buy is the place to find the best tech on the market for more wallet-friendly prices. Target and Walmart both have major price cuts on top-rated home essentials, with the latter offering an affordable entry into the world of robot vacuums and the former letting users try air fryers for less than $100.\n\nAre Cyber Monday deals as good as Black Friday deals?\n\nSome are, yes. Many of the best extended Cyber Monday prices you'll see on display this weekend are typically the same prices shown during Black Friday sale events. We're recommending that shoppers buy their must-have items early (especially if they're already discounted), as supply chain and labor issues could impact the stock of certain items at retailers, and waiting might mean missing out on products you want.\n\nThere’s more where this deal came from.

Right now, you can use coupon code AS450 to save $450 on any of the company’s mattresses, including the Amerisleep AS3, which we loved for its firm and supportive surface. The mattress is available as a hybrid or solid foam, so you can opt for whichever sensation and structure you prefer.

The online brand is currently hosting its Organic sale with savings of up to $880 on select mattresses. We've tested the Avocado Green mattress and found it to be a worthwhile sleeper—we loved that the springy mattress didn't retain too much body heat. Our tester found it to be \"super bouncy,\" which gave the mattress a nice balance of comfort and coziness. The queen size of the Avocado Green is typically listed for $1,999, but using the code SAVE10 at checkout brings that price down to just $1,709.10.\n\nAwara mattress sale\n\nSave $300 on any mattress and get up to $499 worth of accessories for free\n\nWe love that Awara mattresses are built like traditional sleepers—made of cotton, latex foam, coils and wool—and, right now, as part of the brand's current sale, you can save $300 on any mattress, get up to $499 worth of free accessories and take advantage of a free 365-night trial period so you can truly decide whether or not an Awara sleeper is right for you.

Plus, you'll receive $499 worth of free accessories for free including a sheet set, mattress protector and cooling pillow. With good overall support, especially for side and back sleeping, the coils add bounce and it absorbs body motion nicely. While it is heavy (at about 129 pounds for the queen size), this mattress didn't have the unpleasant off-gassing odor you can sometimes get when unboxing a new mattress. Pair your new sleeper with the Awara adjustable bed frame that's down from $999 in the queen size to $699—a whopping $300 markdown.\n\nBirch Living Black Friday mattress sale\n\nGet $400 off mattresses and two free Eco-Rest pillows\n\nIf you're looking for better sleep and want to help save the planet, Birch Living can meet you in the middle.

A queen size standard Birch Living Natural mattress is typically listed for $1,849, but the sale brings that price down to $1,449.

The queen size of this mattress is usually $1,332 but during the current sale, you can snag it for just $932.40 using the promo code BFRIDAY30. Brooklyn Bedding also has unconventional mattress sizes, including short and RV bed mattresses. Our reviewer, who tested the medium-firm type and found the surface too forgiving when sleeping on her stomach, recommended opting for the firm option if you sleep mostly on your stomach or back. Note that it runs warmer than other sleepers but, if you prefer softer and squishier, it's a good option.\n\nCasper mattress sale\n\nGet up to $800 off mattresses at Casper during this Black Friday sale\n\nShop the Casper mattress sale through Sunday, December 18 to save up to $800 on Casper mattresses, up to 25% on sheets and up to 30% on sleep bundles. The Casper Original mattress, typically listed for $1,295 in its queen size is currently available for $1,165 during the sale. We tested Casper's flagship mattress and found it to do a solid job of giving an undisturbed sleep.

We love the medium-firm feel with a bit of bounce and the effective cooling layer that is well-suited for many types of sleepers but is \"perfect for back sleepers,\" according to our tester.\n\nDreamCloud mattress sale\n\n25% off sitewide plus $599 in accessories\n\nDreamCloud makes a comfortable and fairly affordable hybrid that our tester called a great choice for those who sleep hot and like a supportive sleep surface. It took a bit longer than most mattresses to off-gas and fully form, but once our tester got beyond the growing pain stage, she loved the bed. The DreamCloud Luxury Hybrid mattress usually retails for $1,199 in the queen size, but can be yours for just $899—a $300 savings. We found the mattress to be firm, supportive and comfortable to sleep on in different positions. An especially great pick for stomach and back sleepers, our tester noted that the mattress stayed “remarkably cool overnight.” Plus, DreamCloud will throw in a bundle of free accessories valued at $599, including a mattress protector, sheet set and cooling pillow (one if you purchase a twin or twin XL, and two if you opt for a full size or larger).\n\nHelix Sleep Black Friday mattress sale\n\nGet up to $450 off select mattresses and two free pillows with purchases\n\nSide sleepers will love Helix Sleep's Black Friday sale, which offers plenty of price cuts on its line of mattresses.

A queen size Nectar memory foam mattress with accessories normally runs you $1,498, but the sale lets you get the sleeper, two cooling pillows, a sheet set and mattress protector all for $669. We tested a Nectar mattress to see if it lives up to the hype and found that it stays cool and cradles the body nicely, especially for side sleepers. While a Nectar was once deemed our top pick mattress, after testing many more, we noticed that it is softer than others, making it a great pick if a super soft mattress is your specific preference.\n\nNolah Black Friday mattress sale\n\nSave up to $700 on all mattresses and get two pillows for free\n\nIf you prefer a soft mattress and huge savings, head to the Nolah Black Friday sale.

This year, like has been the case in the past few years, retailers will offer some of the year's best online sales and deals.\n\nAccording to History.com, Black Friday started back in 1869 when the price of gold decreased dramatically, causing Wall Street financiers to lose millions. The day came to be known as \"Black Friday.\" Over time, the day has evolved into a term for retailers to help ensure they would be able to finish the year in the black with strong profits. While the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas has signified shopping and heavy spending since the Great Depression, the recent rise of online shopping, which has intensified due to the pandemic, has hinted at the idea of Black Friday eventually evolving into “Black November.”\n\nWhen is Black Friday 2022?\n\nBlack Friday 2022 falls today, Friday, November 25. Cyber Monday 2022 will take place on Monday, November 28. Thanksgiving is the last Thursday of November, and each year Black Friday occurs the day following, with Cyber Monday following shortly after.\n\nWhen do Black Friday 2022 sales start?\n\nBroadly speaking, Black Friday starts as soon as Thanksgiving ends. However, every year, Black Friday sales start earlier and earlier. This year, we saw the first Black Friday sales begin toward the end of October.\n\nHow long do Black Friday sales last?\n\nBlack Friday is followed directly by Cyber Monday on November 28, 2022. Technically speaking, as soon as Cyber Monday begins, Black Friday ends. The best discounts are usually limited to these two days (and the weekend between them); however, some deals stick around through the end of the following week.\n\nWhat deals can we expect during Black Friday?\n\nAs in years past, Black Friday often matches and exceeds the best prices offered throughout the year. You can expect to save on nearly every product available, especially on home appliances. Whether you’re shopping for a new oven, the latest refrigerator or an updated laundry room setup, Black Friday 2022 will have you covered with some of the lowest prices of the year.\n\nWhere can you shop the best Black Friday mattress deals?\n\nThe best mattress deals are available from popular sleep retailers, including Leesa, Brooklyn Bedding, Awara and Mattress Firm—many of the companies that rank among the top mattresses we have tested. The best mattress deals are offering up to $1,000 off select mattresses and some companies even throw in a pair of pillows, sheets or other bedding items for free. With certain sales, you can also save on bed frames, mattress protectors and other sleep accessories to complete your new bedroom set or upgrade.\n\nIn addition to the current mattress sales, some mattress brands offer first-time shoppers anywhere from 15% to 20% off their first purchase if you sign up for email alerts. Along with those extra discounts, select mattress brands offer free white glove delivery, free shipping and even free returns or trial periods in some cases. If you choose to have your mattress delivered, you can typically schedule a delivery timeframe within a certain window, usually about four hours, so the mattress arrives when you can arrange to be home.\n\nHow long does a mattress last?\n\nMattress expiration dates fall somewhere between eight and 12 years, with many brands suggesting that a decade-old mattress is one that's ready to be replaced. Along with the expiration date, there are other signs like tossing and turning or sniffling and sneezing that could mean you're due for a new mattress.\n\nAre there free mattress trials?\n\nNearly every mattress brand we’ve tested offers a trial period during which you can test out the mattress for a specified period of time, because there’s nothing like actually sleeping on it. For instance, you can try an Awara mattress for 365 nights.\n\nMake holiday shopping easy with help from our experts.

Many online shoppers are expected to snag Cyber Monday deals today and then participate in Giving Tuesday, a day of heightened generosity when people give to their favorite charities.\n\nHere’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.\n\n(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n\n1. Travel delays\n\nA severe weather system moving into the Pacific Northwest is causing delays and headaches for millions of travelers across the US. As of Sunday night, more than 6,000 flights into, out of, or within the US were delayed, according to FlightAware – and more than 170 were canceled. The large storm system caused trouble on one of the busiest travel days of the year as many people tried to fly back from their Thanksgiving destinations. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an early forecast warning, calling for “a significant severe-weather event” in the South which could affect more than 25 million people on Tuesday from eastern Texas to southern Indiana.\n\n2. China protests\n\nUnprecedented protests are sweeping China over the country’s Covid lockdowns. Numbers swelled at demonstrations in multiple major cities from Shanghai to Beijing over the weekend in a rare show of dissent against the ruling Communist Party. Among the thousands of protesters, some have even called for the resignation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who for nearly three years has overseen a strategy of mass-testing, brute-force lockdowns, enforced quarantines and digital tracking. Demonstrations are occurring in at least 16 locations nationwide, but China’s zero-Covid policies have been felt particularly in Shanghai, where a two-month long lockdown earlier this year left many without access to food, medical care or other basic supplies.\n\n3. Gun ban\n\nPresident Joe Biden last week said he would be urgently working with Congress “to try to get rid of assault weapons” after a recent spate of mass shootings in the US. However, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN on Sunday that Senate Democrats don’t have the 60 votes needed to advance an assault weapons ban. While Murphy did express optimism that something could get done in the next Congress if Democrats keep their seat in Georgia, he emphasized there needs to be a conversation in the Senate about funding law enforcement in counties that are refusing to enforce state and national gun laws. His comments come after the recent shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, involved an assault-style weapon and a handgun, while officials said the alleged shooter at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia, last week was armed with a handgun and multiple magazines.\n\n4. Idaho stabbings\n\nUniversity of Idaho students are expected to return to campus today from Thanksgiving break despite the lack of a suspect or arrest in the stabbing deaths of four students at an off-campus home. It remains unclear how many students will show up to campus, but many have expressed hesitancy about returning until a suspect is in custody. It’s been two weeks since the killings and dozens of local, state and federal investigators are still working to determine who carried out the brutal attack. Investigators have yet to identify a suspect or find a weapon – believed to be a fixed-blade knife – and have sifted through more than 1,000 tips and conducted at least 150 interviews. The stabbings have unsettled the campus community and the town of about 25,000, which had not seen a murder since 2015.\n\n5. Ukraine\n\nUkraine’s national power supplier says it’s back at about 80% capacity following Russian strikes that have wreaked havoc on the country’s energy grid ahead of winter. Power, water, heat and internet are “almost completely restored” in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv after a scramble to make repairs, city leaders said today. The head of Ukraine’s nuclear energy provider also said Russian forces may be preparing to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which provided up to 20% of the country’s electricity before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in February. It has been under Russian control since March. The plant and the area around it have endured persistent shelling that has raised ongoing fears of a nuclear accident.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nChildren scream for joy after they spot Biden out shopping\n\nPresident Biden stopped to take selfies with ecstatic kids who spotted him shopping in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

TSA projected on Twitter that Monday could be Seattle-Tacoma International Airport's busiest day since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\"This has been another travel Armageddon weekend,\" James Ferrara, co-founder and president of global host travel agency InteleTravel, told USA TODAY. \"But it's not isolated, or really a surprise.\"\n\nFriday was the busiest day for air travel this year with over 2.4 million people passing through security at U.S. airports, according to the Transportation Security Administration. On Saturday, there were 2.1 million travelers.\n\nThe U.S. has dominated global flight issues, but it isn't the only country having airline issues; worldwide, an additional 3,500 flights have been canceled and over 23,000 have been delayed this weekend.\n\nCurrently, passenger volumes nationwide for this month are 87.7% of 2019 volumes, according to TSA spokesperson Lorie Dankers. The average number of people screened per day is 2.24 million compared to 2.56 million in June 2019.\n\n\"This is the highest sustained level we have seen since travel began to recover from the pandemic,\" Dankers told USA TODAY on Monday.\n\nNationwide, Delta and United have the highest number of cancellations, with 7% and 3% of flights canceled, respectively, not including flights on their regional affiliates.

Canceling a flight is always our last resort, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience to their travel plans,\" Delta spokesperson Emily Cashdan said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nFerrara said the loss of skilled positions, such as pilots and aircrew, is \"really what's driving\" all of the airline issues. Pilot unions at Delta, American and Southwest have said airlines haven't been quick enough to replace pilots who retired or took leaves of absences when the pandemic began.\n\n\"We're in a boom time for travel. We're blowing away all records all previous years. So you've got this surge in demand, and you've got limitations on staffing,\" Ferrara said.\n\nOn Thursday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with airline CEOs virtually to discuss how airlines can effectively handle the growing number of travelers through the summer. The meeting came weeks after airlines struggled with the Memorial Day holiday weekend, when around 2,800 flights were canceled during the five-day stretch.\n\n\"That is happening to a lot of people, and that is exactly why we are paying close attention here to what can be done and how to make sure that the airlines are delivering,\" Buttigieg told The Associated Press on Saturday, one day after his own flight from Washington, D.C. to New York City was canceled.\n\nHow long will flight cancellations and delays continue to happen?\n\n\"I'm not a betting man. But I would absolutely bet that this will continue through the summer,\" Ferrara said.\n\nJosh Verde, former pilot and aviation expert with airline consultation group Aerovise, said he wouldn't be surprised if travel woes continue throughout the rest of the year. Summer is expected to be the busiest time of the year, but holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas might bring similar issues for travelers.\n\n\"I think we're probably going to be dealing with headaches for the rest of this year. Hopefully, they'll get a handle on things,\" Verde said.\n\nWhat should travelers do?\n\nIf your flight is canceled, the U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines rebook you on the next available flight with space. You are not obligated to accept it, and if so, the airline is required to give a refund, which can be given as your money back, travel credit or voucher.\n\nIf your flight is delayed, the length of the delay matters. The DOT says passengers are eligible for a refund regardless of cause as long as it is a \"significant delay.\" However, the definition of a \"significant delay\" depends on the airline.\n\n\"Learning that your flight is canceled, kind of unexpectedly, really just causes chaos,\" Verde said.\n\nVerde recommends travelers try to keep a flexible schedule so if flight plans change, vacation plans and other scheduled activities aren't heavily affected. He also advises people bring essential items, like water, medication and toiletries, in their carry-on bag, so they are available at any moment if people are unavailable to get to their checked bag.\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/07/us/winter-weather-northeast-friday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm: Weather threat prompts government and school ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA fast-moving winter storm that pummeled parts of Kentucky and Virginia is expected to cause widespread disruption across the Northeast on Friday and Saturday, dumping between 4 and 12 inches of snow on the region’s major cities.\n\nMore than 60 million people are under winter weather alerts, and local officials have taken pre-emptive measures to prepare the densely-populated region, including shutting government offices and ordering school closures.\n\nThe forecast calls for as much as 12 inches of snow in Boston, with 4 to 6 inches in Washington DC, 3 to 5 inches in New York City and up to 4 inches in Philadelphia, according to CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford.\n\nWith snow falling at up to 2 inches an hour Friday morning, travel in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut is “very treacherous & slow,” the National Weather Service in Boston tweeted just after 8 a.m.\n\nThe heavy snowfall and poor visibility are making it difficult for road crews, the weather service said in the tweet, advising people to “delay travel until this afternoon when snow ends,” if possible.\n\nThe winter weather, coupled with disruptions arising from Covid-19, has caused huge headaches for air travelers, too.

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, sent letters Friday to the CEOs of American, Southwest, Delta, JetBlue, Republic and Allegiant. She wrote that she is concerned by reports that have highlighted the role of worker shortages in a surge of delayed and canceled flights.\n\nIn identical letters to the CEOs, Cantwell said each airline did a poor job of managing its workforce and, at worst, “failed to meet the intent of tax payer funding and prepare for the surge in travel that we are now witnessing.”\n\nSince March 2020, when the pandemic began to crush air travel, Congress has approved $54 billion to keep airline workers employed. As a condition of the aid, airlines have been prohibited from furloughing workers, but they persuaded tens of thousands of employees to take voluntary buyouts, early retirement or long-term leave to cut costs.\n\nNow the airlines are trying to bolster their staffs. This week, American cited rising passenger numbers in saying it will recall 3,300 flight attendants from long-term leave and hire 800 more before the end of the year. Delta said it will hire between up to 5,000 workers this year to reduce long hold times for customers who call the airline and to deal with workers shortages at contractors such as food caterers and airplane cleaners.\n\nAirlines and their unions lobbied for the federal aid, which has been extended twice and is scheduled to end Sept. 30. Trade group Airlines for America said that without the money, “the impacts of the pandemic would have been far more devastating to our industry and our workforce, and our return to the skies would have been dramatically slowed.”\n\nGovernment figures show that about 35,000 airline jobs were lost last fall, when the aid briefly expired. The jobs were restored when Congress extended the payroll relief.\n\nLabor shortage:The economy needs millions of workers.

The therapy will carry a wholesale cost of roughly $194,000 for a full course of treatment, the drug’s manufacturer said in an investor call on Friday, although this is not expected to be the price consumers would pay.\n\nIt is thought to work by turning down the body’s misdirected attack on its own insulin-producing cells. The idea is that protecting these cells buys people more time before they become dependent on insulin to manage their condition.\n\nIn clinical trials, Tzield delayed progression to full-blown diabetes by a little over two years. But the benefits have lasted much longer in some of the study participants.\n\nOne of them, Mikayla Olsten, was screened for diabetes after her 9-year old sister, Mia, suddenly developed a life-threatening episode of diabetic ketoacidosis and was diagnosed with diabetes. There was no history of diabetes in the family, and Mikayla wasn’t sick, but she had four of the five types of autoantibodies that doctors look for to assess a person’s risk.\n\n“They told us when somebody has that many markers, it’s not if they’re going to develop diabetes, it’s when,” said her mom, Tracy.\n\nMikayla was 15 when she joined the study and received teplizumab. She’s now 21 and a senior in college. She gets an annual battery of tests to check her pancreas and blood markers, and Tracy Olsten says her condition hasn’t progressed in six years.\n\nAccording to a scientific statement from JDRF, the Endocrine Society and the American Diabetes Association, when a person has markers for autoimmune disease and episodes of uncontrolled blood sugar, the five-year risk for progression to insulin-dependent symptomatic disease is 75%. The lifetime risk of developing insulin-dependent diabetes is nearly 100%.\n\nSo far, Mikayla seems to be beating those odds.\n\nTracy said that for Mia, who is dependent on insulin, managing her diabetes is a constant chore.\n\n“She has a tremendous amount of juggling that her peers don’t have to do. She has to plan ahead when she has a basketball game or practice on making sure she carbs up and decreases her insulin levels,” Tracy said. “She cannot go a minute or a day without thinking about it nonstop, and to be able to give Mikayla the opportunity where she doesn’t have to think about it 24/7 is amazing.”\n\n‘Screening becomes a really big issue’\n\nAaron Kowalski, CEO of JDRF, says the main challenge in prescribing Tzield will be finding people who need it. The drug is approved for people who don’t have any symptoms of the disease and may not know they’re on the road to getting it.\n\n“Screening becomes a really big issue, because what we know is, about 85% of type 1 diagnoses today are in families that don’t have a known family history,” Kowalski said. “Our goal is to do general population screening” with blood tests to look for markers of the disease.\n\nTzield is approved for use in people 8 and older who are in stage 2 of their type 1 diabetes. In that stage, doctors can measure antibodies that attack insulin-producing beta cells in the person’s blood, and they have abnormal blood sugar levels, but their body can still make insulin.\n\n“The way in which not just industry but our medical system go about managing autoimmune diseases, and especial type 1 diabetes, is really suboptimal in today’s day and age,” ProventionBio co-founder and CEO Ashleigh Palmer said. “What we do is, we wait until the symptoms of the disease present to doctors, and then doctors treat the patient’s symptoms chronically for a lifetime. The trouble is that in type 1 diabetes, when the symptoms first present, it’s too late.”\n\nThe treatment comes in a single 14-day course of infusions that each last 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nThe most common side effects reported in the trial participants were low white blood cells and lymph cells, rash and headache.\n\nThe first option for preventing type 1\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, a person’s immune system attacks cells called beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, a hormone that helps blood sugar enter cells, where it’s used for energy. The attack can happen for years before any symptoms of diabetes appear. Without insulin, blood sugar can build up in the bloodstream and break down the body’s own fat and muscle.\n\nPalmer says Tzield holds off the disease before symptoms appear by stopping the autoimmune disease process and the underlying destruction of beta cells. The treatment essentially reboots the immune system, preserving beta cell function.\n\n“We really have no preventative measure for type 1 diabetes to date, and that is despite [the National Institutes of Health] funding hundreds of millions of dollars over the last 20-plus years of a program called TrialNet that has tested many, many different things, including this, and some of this came out of that work,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association. “Finally, there is something that delays the onset of type 1 diabetes, and it’s so exciting.”\n\nUnlike type 2 diabetes, which can be prevented with lifestyle changes like losing weight and exercising, type 1 is a genetic disease that has not had any prevention options until now.\n\n“For some reason, we don’t screen for type 1 diabetes, even though there are biomarkers available to show that the autoimmune disease process is already underway,” Palmer said. He added that the hopes the drug will catalyze the medical system to start population-based screening during routine childhood well visits in order to intercept the disease and delay its onset.\n\nWith Tzield, doctors would screen individual family members of people with type 1 diabetes to see whether they have those specific antibodies. If antibody levels are high and it appears that the person is about to develop diabetes, the treatment will delay that process.\n\n“If somebody has type 1, a common question that comes up is ‘well, what about my child? Are they going to develop type 1?’ It’s only about a 5% risk, so more often than not, they won’t, but if you could find the ones that would and treat them, that can make a big difference,” Gabbay said.\n\nThe potential to help millions\n\nA delayed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes could have a significant impact.\n\n“Obviously, the quality of life is substantially impacted, negatively impacted, if you are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. It’s a disease that never goes away,” Palmer said.\n\nPeople who are type 1 diabetics must monitor their blood glucose levels around the clock, affecting how they exercise and eat. High blood sugar can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, in which the body starts to break down fat as its fuel, and can cause a buildup of acids called ketones in the bloodstream.

You can’t have a kid do distance learning without a computer,” said Tom Baumgarten, superintendent of the Morongo Unified School District in California’s Mojave Desert, where all 8,000 students qualify for free lunch and most need computers for distance learning.\n\nBaumgarten was set to order 5,000 Lenovo Chromebooks in July when his vendor called him off, saying Lenovos were getting “stopped by a government agency because of a component from China that’s not allowed here,” he said. He switched to HPs and was told they would arrive in time for the first day of school Aug. 26. The delivery date then changed to September, then October. The district has about 4,000 old laptops that can serve roughly half of students, but what about the rest, Baumgarten asks rhetorically. “I’m very concerned that I’m not going to be able to get everyone a computer.”\n\nPeach recall expanded:Salmonella outbreak prompts recall of Prima Wawona peaches sold at Walmart, Target, Aldi\n\nWhen will extra unemployment start?:Don't expect $300 boost anytime soon, experts warn\n\nChromebooks and other low-cost PCs are the computers of choice for most budget-strapped schools. The delays started in the spring and intensified because of high demand and disruptions of supply chains, the same reasons that toilet paper and other pandemic necessities flew off shelves a few months ago. Then came the Trump administration’s July 20 announcement targeting Chinese companies it says were implicated in forced labor or other human rights abuses against a Muslim minority population, the Uighurs. The Commerce Department imposed sanctions on 11 Chinese companies, including the manufacturer of multiple models of Lenovo laptops, which the company says will add several weeks to existing delays, according to a letter Lenovo sent to customers.\n\nSchool districts are pleading with the Trump administration to resolve the issue, saying that distance learning without laptops will amount to no learning for some of the country’s most vulnerable students.\n\n“It’s a tough one because I’m not condoning child slave labor for computers, but can we not hurt more children in the process?” said Matt Bartenhagen, IT director for Williston Public Schools in North Dakota, a district of 4,600 waiting on an order for 2,000 Lenovo Chromebooks. “They were supposed to be delivered in July. Then August. Then late August. The current shipping estimate is ’hopefully” by the end of the year.\n\nThe Denver Public Schools district, the largest in Colorado, is waiting for 12,500 Lenovo Chromebooks ordered in April and May. The district has scrambled to find machines, settled for whatever is available and is handing out everything they get to students that need them. Still, when school starts Wednesday, they will be about 3,000 devices short, says Lara Hussain, an IT director for the district.\n\n“We were promised devices. Our students need devices. And as a result of not receiving devices we will have students starting the school year unable to participate. It’s unconscionable,” said Hussain.\n\nLenovo had informed Denver and other districts over the spring and summer of supply chain delays. In late July, Lenovo sent a letter to customers to say the “trade controls” announced by the Commerce Department would cause another slowdown of at least several weeks.\n\n“This delay is a new development and is unrelated to supply constraints previously communicated,” Matthew Zielinski, president of Lenovo North America said in the letter, which referred to the sanctions on a Chinese supplier, Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co. Ltd. The letter listed 23 Lenovo models for education and corporate customers made by Bitland.\n\n“Effective immediately, we are no longer manufacturing these devices at Bitland,” the letter said, adding that Lenovo is working on “a transition plan” to shift production to other sites.\n\nA Lenovo official told California’s Department of Education the company has a backlog of more than 3 million Chromebooks, said Daniel Thigpen, the department’s spokesman.\n\nLenovo declined to respond to repeated questions from AP seeking confirmation of the backlog and details on the numbers of devices delayed, replying only to deny a question on whether computers were seized by U.S. customs, as some schools were told by suppliers.\n\nU.S. government agencies said they have no knowledge of the computers’ whereabouts and also deny any were seized.\n\n“U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not have any record of detained laptops matching this description,” the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe Department of Commerce said it added Hefei Bitland to its so-called Entity List, which restricts the export and in-country transfer of items by sanctioned companies. “It does not apply to the importation of Chromebooks from China,” the department said in a statement, adding, however, “we should all agree that American school children should not be using computers from China that were produced from forced labor.”\n\nThere are no nationwide tallies on the numbers of laptops and other devices that schools are waiting for. The Associated Press found that some of America’s biggest school districts are among those with outstanding orders of Chromebooks, other laptops or hotspots for internet connections, including Los Angeles, Clark County, Nevada, Wake County, North Carolina, Houston, Palm Beach and Hawaii, the nation’s only statewide school district.\n\nA recent poll of California’s 1,100 districts showed schools across the state are waiting on at least 300,000 backordered computers, said Mary Nicely, a senior policy advisor to the state superintendent. A survey in Alabama found that about 20 schools were waiting on 33,000 computers, said Ryan Hollingsworth, director of the School Superintendents of Alabama.\n\nSmaller districts in Montana, New York, Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, New Hampshire and elsewhere are also waiting on laptop orders, with delivery dates that have become moving targets.\n\nSome of the school districts, like Los Angeles, say the outstanding orders are for replacement devices and all students who need a computer will have one. Many districts are asking parents with the means to buy devices for their children but realize that’s not an option for many families.\n\nIt’s also not an easy task with supplies at commercial stores running out. Best Buy’s website shows 36 models of new and used Chromebooks priced under $500, the low-cost models that are popular for students. As of this week, 33 of those models were sold out.\n\nThe backlog and delays have become so widespread that some students will be forced to start the semester without an essential piece of technology for remote learning, said Michael Flood, senior vice president of Kajeet, which works with more than 2,000 school districts in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nSome school administrators told Flood their laptop and Chromebook suppliers hope deliveries will only be delayed by a month or so. But others are being told their machines may not be available until early 2021.\n\nThe shortage stems from exceptionally high demand at a time when the personal computer industry is still recovering from pandemic-driven precautions that shut down the factories of major PC suppliers in China during February and March. Just as the supply chain started ramping back up, new orders poured in from huge companies and government agencies with large numbers of employees working from home — in addition to school districts scrambling to secure machines, said Mikako Kitagawa, research director at Gartner Inc., which closely follows the PC industry.\n\n“The bottom line is everyone seems to want a laptop or Chromebook right now and there just isn’t enough supply of it,” Kitagawa said. “It’s a case of very bad timing.”\n\nTo make matters worse, many school districts underestimated their needs during spring ordering, assuming that traditional in-person classes would resume in the fall.\n\nIn California, most schools were planning for some form of in-person classes in the fall but only learned in July that wouldn’t be possible, when Gov. Gavin Newsom effectively ordered the majority of schools to start with remote learning. It created a mad dash for computers.\n\nTom Quiambao, director of technology for the Tracy Unified School District in Northern California, said he and his vendor contacted HP directly to ask why his July order for 10,000 HP laptops would take three months to be delivered. He was told, “HP is short 1.7 million units of laptops” because of production shortages in a variety of components made in China, including processors, touchscreens, motherboards and others, Quiambao said.\n\nAn HP spokeswoman declined to confirm or deny that number, saying only “we are continuing to leverage our global supply chain to meet the changing needs of our customer.”\n\nDell offered a similarly brief response to detailed questions about a backlog.\n\n“We can’t comment on demand and supply specifically,” Dell said in an emailed statement, adding the company was seeing increased orders due to virtual learning and trying “to fulfill orders as efficiently as possible.”\n\nWith so many customers ordering laptops at the same time, PC manufacturers may be put in the uncomfortable position of deciding who gets them first, said Linn Huang, an analyst for the research firm International Data Corp. Those kind of pecking orders threaten to push small school districts to the back of the laptop line.\n\nThat’s part of the problem for the central Texas district of Abilene, where they are waiting for 6,000 Dell Chromebooks, ordered in May and June but not expected until November.\n\n“In Texas, there are over 1,200 school districts and they’re all ordering,” said district spokesman Lance Fleming. Schools are trying to get disinfecting supplies, too. “Who would have ever thought that computers and Clorox Wipes would be on the same level of need in our country.”\n\nAssociated Press Writers Kathleen Foody in Chicago, Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu, Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/01/14/major-us-snowstorm-djokovic-visa-revoked-5-things-know-friday/9169710002/", "title": "Major US snowstorm, Djokovic visa revoked: 5 things to know Friday", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMajor winter storm poised to hit South, Midwest, East Coast\n\nA potent winter storm is forecast to wallop tens of millions of people across the central, southern and eastern U.S. with snow, ice, wind and rain over the next few days.

Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said Friday he used his ministerial discretion to cancel the 34-year-old's visa on public interest grounds — just three days before play begins at the Australian Open, where Djokovic has won a record nine of his 20 Grand Slam titles. Djokovic's lawyers were expected to appeal, which they already successfully did last week on procedural grounds after his visa was first canceled when he arrived in Melbourne.

McClatchy notes those payments typically went out on the 15th of each month, starting in July. The sixth payment was sent Dec. 15. But families won't see the payments on Jan. 15. The tax credits were part of Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package — and the president had proposed extending them for another full year. But Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., objected to extending the credit out of concern that the money would discourage people from working and that any additional federal spending would fuel inflation that has already climbed to a nearly 40-year high. Manchin's opposition in the evenly split Senate derailed Biden's social spending package and caused the expanded tax credits that were going out to expire this month.\n\nChild tax credit money will be a no show in January: Look out for an IRS letter instead\n\nLook out for an IRS letter instead The IRS is 'buried' in paper after 'most challenging' year for taxpayers: Why it matters for 2022 tax season\n\nCenter for COVID Control's testing sites to 'pause' all operations for 1 week\n\nThe Center for COVID Control will pause all operations at their testing sites for one week, starting Friday.

Andy Beshear. Four tornadoes hit Kentucky on the night of Dec. 10, leaving 77 dead and a trail of destruction through the western portion of the state. Bowling Green, the home of Western Kentucky University and the third-largest city in the state, was hit hard, with 17 deaths recorded in the county.

The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause Covid-19.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the new bivalent boosters and who can get them.\n\nHow are these new bivalent vaccines different?\n\nThe new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, where there’s an average of 91,000 new infections each day.\n\n“These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “In a sense, you’ve just changed the blueprints.”\n\nHaving twice the blueprints doesn’t mean you’re getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though.\n\n“The total mRNA content – the business part of the vaccine – that leads to the immune response is the same amount,” said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines.\n\nPfizer’s booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12.\n\nModerna’s bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It’s authorized for people 18 and older.\n\nThe earlier mRNA shots are still the first two shots a person will get, but they’re no longer authorized for use as boosters in people age 12 and older.\n\nWhere can I get an updated Covid-19 booster?\n\nMillions of vaccines are now shipping to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies.\n\nCVS and Walgreens have started offering the shots. Both chains are scheduling appointments online, and say more slots will be added as they get shipments of the vaccines.\n\nThe Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at Vaccines.gov.\n\n“You’ll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you’re going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN.\n\nAs with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it’s going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall.\n\nWho should get an updated booster?\n\nAmericans ages 12 and older are recommended get the new boosters as long as they’ve already had their primary series of vaccines.\n\nExperts say everyone needs one as protection from both vaccination and infection wanes considerably over time and in all age groups.\n\n“I do believe there will be benefit, essentially for everyone, with clearly more benefit for the elderly and those who have underlying conditions,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN on Friday.\n\nAdults age 18 and older can get either a Pfizer or Moderna shot. Adolescents ages 12 and older can get an updated Pfizer shot.\n\nWhen should I get an updated booster?\n\nYou should wait two months after your last vaccine dose to get an updated booster.\n\nFor those who have recently recovered from a Covid-19 infection, the CDC recommends waiting at least until the illness has passed and a person is no longer contagious. For best results, it may be better to delay a booster for at least three months after symptoms started. Infection itself probably already acted like a booster; studies have shown that people have a relatively low risk of getting sick again for about three months after they recover.\n\nYou may not want to wait as long as three months if Covid-19 levels are already high in your community or if you are reduced immune function.\n\n“Myself as an example, I was vaccinated, doubly boosted and infected, and I will be getting the updated BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine within three months of my having gotten infected, exactly the way the FDA has authorized and the CDC has recommended,” Fauci said.\n\nCan people get other vaccines at the same time as the updated booster?\n\nUS health officials have recommended that providers offer the seasonal flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccines at the same visit if a patient is eligible for the vaccinations. This upcoming fall and winter could host a high spread of flu and Covid-19, and administering both vaccinations at the same time has been found to be safe.\n\nThe government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nOne vaccine for which there are no data on administering it at the same time as others is the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, according to the CDC’s guidance. The agency recommends that people, particularly adolescent or young adult men, might consider waiting four weeks after receiving monkeypox vaccination before receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, “because of the observed risk” for myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.\n\nThe CDC adds that monkeypox vaccination “should not be delayed” due to recently receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nWhen can younger children get an updated booster?\n\nChildren ages 5 through 11 can still be boosted with the older, single-strain vaccines.\n\nVaccine manufacturers are updating boosters for younger children now. Pfizer said it’s retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It’s working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\nUntil those are ready, the best way to protect babies, toddlers and gradeschoolers is to get eligible family and friends an updated shot.\n\nCan immunocompromised people get an updated booster?\n\nYes, but that’s not all. If a health condition or a medication has lowered your immune function, the CDC recommends a two-pronged approach to boost your protection against Covid-19 – vaccination and preventive treatment with a type of passive immunity called Evusheld. Passive immunity is when antibodies are made in a lab and then given by injection or infusion to help people who can’t make enough of this protection on their own.\n\nEvusheld can be taken every six months and is available for immunocompromised people ages 12 and up. It requires a doctors prescription, but the treatment itself is free. The CDC estimates 7 million people may be eligible to take Evusheld, but most haven’t gotten it because they don’t know about it.\n\nIf you need Evusheld, you should wait at least two weeks after getting a Covid-19 vaccine to take it. But after a person has taken Evusheld, there’s no waiting period for getting an updated booster.\n\nAre the updated Covid-19 boosters safe?\n\nA recent review of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, commonly reported side effects after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches.\n\nVery rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men.\n\nThe highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men – ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about 11 cases of myocarditis for every million doses.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose.\n\n“It seems to be associated when they’re given closer to one another,” he said.\n\nHow do we know the updated Covid-19 vaccines work?\n\nThe evidence for these updated vaccines is a bit different than what was behind earlier versions. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice, following much the same process used each year when annual flu shots are updated.\n\nThe FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway. FDA’s Marks said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available.\n\nOfficials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don’t provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic.\n\n“You’re asking people to get a new product for which there’s no data,” Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. “Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.”\n\nOffit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we’ve used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nIt’s not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine.\n\n“So if you say to me, ‘can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?’ I’d say ‘no, I can’t.’ We’re extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,” Poland said.\n\nFDA officials point out that animal studies weren’t the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence.\n\nThe first is the vaccines’ track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low.\n\nThe second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe and Canada.\n\nEarlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. Other countries have authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US.\n\nThe BA.1 strain isn’t circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he’s confident that these vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n“It’s fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. … It’s just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there’s a free treatment that would prevent their death,” he said.\n\n“I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,” said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. “I’m very confident about this.”\n\nIn the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It’s hard to know how effective these bivalent vaccines could be.\n\nIn a recent preprint study, published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work.\n\nThey found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person’s protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%.\n\nVariant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn’t dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase.\n\nWhy were the shots updated?\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update.\n\nAs the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it has gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections.\n\nThe hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death.\n\nThere is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus – and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza.\n\nAmong the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months.\n\nSo there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we’ll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}]}

But three years into the pandemic, many people have been pushed to the brink by the government’s incessant use of lockdowns, Covid tests and quarantines – as well as ever-tightening censorship and continued onslaught on personal freedoms.\n\nThe ratcheting-up of restrictions in recent months, coupled with a series of heartbreaking deaths blamed on an over-zealous policing of the controls, has brought matters to a head.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He fully supported China's zero-Covid policy.

When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022. AP\n\nBrewing anger over the fire deaths led to remarkable acts of defiance in Shanghai, where many of its 25 million residents hold deep resentment toward the government’s zero-Covid policy after being subjected to a two-month lockdown in the spring.\n\nLate on Saturday night, hundreds of residents gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, which was named after the city, to mourn the victims of the Xinjiang fire, according to videos widely circulated – and promptly censored – on Chinese social media and a witness account.\n\nSurrounding a makeshift memorial of candles, flowers and placards, the crowd held up blank sheets of white paper – in what is traditionally a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why protesters in China are holding up white paper 01:32 - Source: CNN\n\nIn multiple videos seen by CNN, people could be heard shouting demands for Xi and the Communist Party to “step down.” The crowd also chanted, “Don’t want Covid test, want freedom!” and “Don’t want dictatorship, want democracy!”\n\nSome videos show people singing China’s national anthem and The Internationale, a standard of the socialist movement, while holding banners protesting the country’s exceptionally stringent pandemic measures.\n\nRows of police officers, who initially looked on from the outside, started to move in to push back and divide the crowd around 3 a.m., sparking tense face-offs with the protesters, according to a witness.\n\nThe witness told CNN they saw several people arrested and taken into a police vehicle next to the makeshift memorial after 4.30 a.m. They also saw several protesters being grabbed by the officers from the crowd and taken behind the police line. The protest gradually dispersed before dawn, the witness said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Shanghai residents returned to the site to continue protesting despite a heavy police presence and road blocks.\n\nVideos showed hundreds of people at an intersection shouting “Release the people!” in a demand for the police to free detained demonstrators.\n\nCrowds shouting \"Release the people!\" in Shanghai. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nThis time around, police adopted a more hardline approach, moving faster and more aggressively to make arrests and disperse the crowds.\n\nIn one video, a man holding a bundle of chrysanthemum gave a speech while walking on a pedestrian crossing, as a police officer tried to stop him.\n\n“We need to be braver! Am I breaking the law by holding flowers?” he asked the crowd, who shouted “No!” in reply.\n\n“We Chinese need to be braver!” he said to the applause of the crowd. “So many of us were arrested yesterday. Are they without job or without family? We should not be afraid!”\n\nThe man put up a struggle as more than a dozen officers forced him into a police car, as the angry crowd shouted “Release him!” and rushed toward the vehicle.\n\nOther videos show chaotic scenes of police pushing, dragging and beating protesters.\n\nIn the evening, after one protester was violently dragged away, hundreds of people shouted “triads” at the police, in reference to local crime gangs, according to a livestream.\n\nBBC journalist Edward Lawrence was arrested at the scene of the Shanghai protests on Sunday night and later released, according to a statement from the BBC. A BBC spokesperson expressed concern about Lawrence’s treatment, claiming he was “beaten and kicked by the police.”\n\nOn Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao acknowledged Lawrence’s arrest, claiming he had not identified himself as a journalist before being detained.\n\nPolice officers block Shanghai's Urumqi Road on Sunday.

A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom!

They don’t have to voice their opinions, but I hope they can stand with us,” he said.\n\nIn the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu, large crowds demonstrated along the bustling river banks in a popular food and shopping district, according to a protester interviewed by CNN and videos circulating online.\n\nThe gathering started with a minute of silence to mourn the Xinjiang fire victims, later turning political as the crowd grew in size, numbering into the hundreds.\n\n“Opposition to dictatorship!” the crowd chanted. “We don’t want lifelong rulers. We don’t want emperors!” they shouted in a thinly veiled reference to Xi, who last month began a norm-shattering third term in office.\n\nProtesters hold up blank papers and chant slogans as they march in protest in Beijing on Sunday night.

Freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of arts, freedom of movement, personal freedoms. Give me back my freedom!” The crowd shouted.\n\nUniversity campuses\n\nAcross China, protests have also broken out on university campuses – which are particularly politically sensitive to the Communist Party, given the history of the student-led Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday morning, about 100 students gathered around a protest slogan painted on a wall at the prestigious Peking University in Beijing. A student told CNN that when he arrived at the scene at around 1 a.m., security guards were using jackets to cover the protest sign.\n\nA security guard tries to cover a protest slogan against zero-Covid on the campus of Peking University in Beijing.

Here's what ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nAfter unprecedented protests swept China, several cities have taken steps to ease some Covid-19 restrictions and a top official has signaled a softer approach to virus controls – leading to speculation that an end to zero-Covid may be in sight.\n\nChina’s most senior official in charge of its Covid response told health officials Wednesday that a “new stage and mission” in the pandemic response was due to “the decreasing toxicity” of the Omicron variant, increasing vaccinations and the “accumulating experience” of fighting the virus, according to state news agency Xinhua.\n\nVice Premier Sun Chunlan’s comments – which made no mention of “zero-Covid” – came after anger over Beijing’s increasingly costly strategy of mass-testing, enforced quarantine and lockdowns brought thousands of protesters onto the streets of major cities.\n\nAs their numbers swelled, many also demanded greater political freedoms – and some even called for the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nProtests on such a large scale are highly unusual in China. While demonstrations over local grievances occur periodically, the protests are the most widespread since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989.\n\nThe Chinese government has cracked down swiftly, deploying police at key protest sites, calling protesters to warn them and tightening online censorship.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nWhat’s behind the protests?\n\nThe demonstrations were triggered by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, the capital of the far western region of Xinjiang. The blaze killed at least 10 people and injured nine in an apartment building – leading to public fury after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nThe city had been under lockdown for more than 100 days, with residents unable to leave the region and many forced to stay home.\n\nVideos showed Urumqi residents marching to a government building and chanting for the end of lockdown on Friday. The following morning, the local government said it would lift the lockdown in stages – but did not provide a clear time frame or address the protests.\n\nThat failed to quell public anger and the protests rapidly spread beyond Xinjiang, with residents in cities and universities across China also taking to the streets.\n\nWhere have protests taken place?\n\nSo far, CNN has verified 23 demonstrations since Saturday across 17 Chinese cities – including the capital Beijing and financial center Shanghai.\n\nIn Shanghai on Saturday, hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, named after the Xinjiang city, to mourn the fire victims. Many held up blank sheets of white paper – a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nSome also shouted for Xi to “step down,” and sang “The Internationale,” a socialist anthem used as a call to action in demonstrations worldwide for more than a century. It was also sung during pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing before a brutal crackdown by armed troops in 1989.\n\nBy Sunday evening, mass demonstrations had spread to Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan, where thousands of residents called for not only an end to Covid restrictions, but more remarkably, political freedoms. Residents in some locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets.\n\nProtests also took place on campuses, including the prestigious institutions of Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Communication University of China, Nanjing.\n\nIn Hong Kong, where a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 has been used to stifle dissent, dozens of people gathered on Monday evening in the city’s Central district for a vigil. Some held blank pieces of paper, while others left flowers and held signs commemorating those killed in the Urumqi fire.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nWhat does this mean for zero-Covid?\n\nVice Premier Sun’s remarks Wednesday about China’s “new stage and mission” in pandemic controls came just one day after the country’s National Health Commission (NHC) said the rectification of current pandemic measures is underway and local governments should “respond to and resolve the reasonable demands of the masses” in a timely manner.\n\nIn a meeting with the NHC on Wednesday, Sun also stated that a “human-centered approach” should be taken, and China should enhance its “diagnosis, testing, treatment and quarantine” measures, continue boosting vaccination rates – especially among elderly people – and strengthen medication and medical resources.\n\nExperts have previously said higher vaccination rates among the elderly was necessary before any potential relaxation of restrictions.\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nAt a State Council press briefing on Tuesday, top health officials appeared to acknowledge the disruptions caused by measures such as lockdowns, saying long-term closures “can cause anxiety and life difficulties.”\n\nNHC spokesperson Mi Feng said Covid policies were being rectified to include lifting lockdown “as quickly as possible” to reduce inconvenience.\n\nIn recent days, at least six cities across China, including Beijing, have made changes to their Covid policies, in some cases lifting lockdowns, easing quarantine requirements and eliminating mass testing, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.\n\nSince Monday, the number of locally transmitted Covid cases reported daily in China has been declining, based on NHC data.\n\nWhy are these protests significant?\n\nPublic protest is exceedingly rare in China, where the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, wiped out much of civil society and built a high-tech surveillance state.\n\nThe mass surveillance system is even more stringent in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is accused of detaining up to 2 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in camps where former detainees have alleged they were physically and sexually abused.\n\nA damning United Nations report in September described the region’s “invasive” surveillance network, with police databases containing hundreds of thousands of files with biometric data such as facial and eyeball scans.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region.\n\nProtesters march in Beijing on November 27. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nWhile protests do occur in China, they rarely happen on this scale or take such direct aim at the central government and the nation’s leader, said Maria Repnikova, an associate professor at Georgia State University who studies Chinese politics and media.\n\n“This is a different type of protest from the more localized protests we have seen recurring over the past two decades that tend to focus their claims and demands on local officials and on very targeted societal and economic issues,” she said. Instead, this time the protests have expanded to include “the sharper expression of political grievances alongside concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns.”\n\nThere have been growing signs in recent months that the public has run out of patience with zero-Covid, after nearly three years of economic hardship and disruption to daily life.\n\nIsolated pockets of protest broke out in October, with anti-zero-Covid slogans appearing on the walls of public bathrooms and in various Chinese cities, inspired by a banner hung by a lone protester on an overpass in Beijing just days before Xi cemented a third term in power.\n\nEarlier in November, larger protests took place in Guangzhou, with residents defying lockdown orders to topple barriers and cheer as they took to the streets.\n\nHow have authorities reacted?\n\nWhile protests in several parts of China appear to have largely dispersed peacefully over the weekend, authorities responded more forcefully in some cities on Monday and Tuesday, flooding protest sites to discourage people from gathering.\n\nAuthorities in some cities have also adopted surveillance tactics, such as those used in Xinjiang, to intimidate those who demonstrated over the weekend.\n\nIn what appeared to be the first official – albeit veiled – response to the protests, China’s domestic security chief vowed at a meeting Tuesday to “effectively maintain overall social stability.”\n\nWithout mentioning the demonstrations, Chen Wenqing urged law enforcement officials to “resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order,” Xinhua reported.\n\nThe tough language may signal a heavy-handed crackdown ahead.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows British journalist 'beaten' and detained in China 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\nHow has the world responded?\n\nIn recent days, vigils and demonstrations expressing solidarity with protesters in China have been held around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the United States and Malaysia.\n\nForeign officials and organizations have also voiced support for the protesters and criticized Beijing’s response.\n\n“We’re watching this closely, as you might expect we would,” said US National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday. “We continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest.”\n\nUK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told reporters the Chinese government should “listen to the voices of its own people … when they are saying that they are not happy with the restrictions imposed upon them.”\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union also said on Monday that it condemned “the intolerable intimidation and aggression” directed toward member journalists in China, in an apparent reference to foreign journalists who were detained during protests.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Tara Subramaniam", "Jessie Yeung", "Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/02/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 surge is 'unprecedented' | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe new year is starting with a massive influx of Covid-19 that’s different from any other during this pandemic, doctors say.\n\n“We’re seeing a surge in patients again, unprecedented in this pandemic,” said Dr. James Phillips, chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University Hospital.\n\n“What’s coming for the rest of the country could be very serious. And they need to be prepared.”\n\nEven health care workers are getting sidelined during the rapid rise of the Omicron variant, the most contagious strain of novel coronavirus to hit the US.\n\n“Our health system is at a very different place than we were in previous surges,” emergency medicine professor Dr. Esther Choo said.\n\n“This strain is so infectious that I think all of us know many, many colleagues who are currently infected or have symptoms and are under quarantine,” said Choo, associate professor at Oregon Health and Science University.\n\n“We’ve lost at least 20% of our health care workforce – probably more.”\n\nDon’t get a false sense of security with Omicron\n\nEarly studies suggest the Omicron variant may cause less severe disease than the Delta variant, which still makes up a considerable portion of US Covid-19 cases.\n\nBut because Omicron is much more contagious, the raw number of Covid-19 hospitalizations could get worse, Dr. Anthony Fauci said.\n\n“When you have so many, many cases, even if the rate of hospitalization is lower with Omicron than it is with Delta, there’s still the danger that you’re going to have a surging of hospitalizations that might stress the health care system,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nAnd Omicron might be more problematic for young children, said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\n“It does appear now, based on a lot of experimental evidence that we’ve gotten just in the last two weeks, that this is a milder form of the coronavirus,” Gottlieb told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.\n\n“It appears to be more of an upper airway disease than a lower airway disease. That’s good for most Americans. The one group that that may be a problem for is very young children – toddlers – who have trouble with upper airway infections,” said Gottlieb, a current board member at Pfizer.\n\n“This new strain could have a predilection, again, for the upper airway, which could be a bigger challenge in young kids, because of the way it binds to the airway cells.”\n\nSchool districts go remote after record-high child Covid-19 hospitalizations\n\nJust as millions of students prepared to return to school, new pediatric Covid-19 hospitalizations reached a record high.\n\nFor the week ending December 28, an average of 378 children were admitted to hospitals every day with Covid-19, according to CDC data.\n\nThat’s a 66% jump from the previous week. It also breaks the previous record of 342 set during the Delta variant surge at the beginning of the school year.\n\nWith the more transmissible Omicron variant, some schools might want to postpone in-person learning, pediatrician Dr. Peter Hotez said.\n\n“It may be the case in some school districts, where things are so raging right now in terms of Omicron for the next couple of weeks, and it may be prudent to delay things a couple more weeks,” said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\n“It’s going to be a very challenging time,” Hotez said. “People are going to have to be patient.”\n\nIn Georgia, at least five large Atlanta-area school districts will be starting class remotely this week.\n\n“Due to the rapid rise in positive cases in the metro Atlanta area, students will begin virtual classes Tuesday, Jan. 4 through Friday, Jan. 7,” Atlanta Public Schools said Saturday.\n\n“Our current plan is to resume in-person instruction on Monday, Jan. 10,” the school district said.\n\n“All APS staff are required to report to their work location Monday, Jan. 3, for mandatory COVID-19 surveillance testing, unless they are ill. The data collected from staff testing will be used for future planning.”\n\nAPS said the goal is to allow students and staff to be tested and to isolate and quarantine as needed, according to CDC and health department guidelines.\n\nFour other nearby school districts – in Fulton County, DeKalb County, Rockdale County and Clayton County – announced they would have temporary remote learning following the holiday break.\n\n‘Omicron is truly everywhere’\n\nAcross the country, the rapid spread of Omicron variant has impacted businesses, transportation and emergency services.\n\n“Omicron is truly everywhere,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine professor at Brown University’s School of Public Health.\n\n“What I am so worried about over the next month or so is that our economy is going to shut down – not because of policies from the federal government or from the state governments, but rather because so many of us are ill.”\n\nIn New York, staffing issues led to the suspension of several subway lines, New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced last week.\n\nAnd the city’s emergency medical services were instructed to not transport stable patients with influenza-like symptoms so they could prioritize those in emergencies, according to a directive issued New Year’s Eve by the fire commissioner, chief of department, chief of EMS and the chief medical director. The directive, which includes limited exceptions, applies to the New York Fire Department and voluntary hospital providers in the city’s 911 system.\n\nIn Ohio, the mayor of Cincinnati declared a state of emergency after a spike in Covid-19 infections led to staffing shortages in the city’s fire department.\n\nThe mayor said if the problem goes unaddressed, it would “substantially undermine” first responders’ readiness levels.\n\nAnd thousands of flights have been canceled or delayed as staff and crew call out sick.\n\nLong lines form for Covid-19 PCR tests December 28 in Stamford, Connecticut.

We’re inundated in the ER.”\n\nDespite a year of calls from public health experts to get vaccinated – and now boosted – only about 62% of the US population is fully vaccinated, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nAnd about 33.4% of those who are fully vaccinated have received their booster doses, the data shows.\n\n“If you’re unvaccinated, that’s the group still at highest risk,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “The adults that are being admitted to my institution, the vast majority continue to be unvaccinated.”", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris Holly Yan", "Christina Maxouris", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/china/china-protest-crackdown-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China Covid: Security apparatus swings into action to smother protests", "text": "CNN —\n\nChina’s vast security apparatus has moved swiftly to smother mass protests that swept the country, with police patrolling streets, checking cell phones and even calling some demonstrators to warn them against a repeat.\n\nIn major cities on Monday and Tuesday, police flooded the sites of protests that took place over the weekend, when thousands gathered to vent their anger over the country’s tough zero-Covid policy – some calling for greater democracy and freedom in an extraordinary show of dissent against Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThe heavy police presence has discouraged protesters from gathering since, while authorities in some cities have adopted surveillance tactics used in the far western region of Xinjiang to intimidate those who demonstrated at the weekend.\n\nIn what appears to be the first official response – albeit veiled – to the protests, China’s domestic security chief vowed at a meeting Tuesday to “effectively maintain overall social stability.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN's Beijing reporter breaks down latest police moves to suppress protests 03:10 - Source: CNN\n\nWithout mentioning the demonstrations, Chen Wenqing urged law enforcement officials to “resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order,” the state-run news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nThe tough language may signal a heavy-handed crackdown ahead.

The political defiance is also unprecedented, with some protesters openly calling for Xi, the country’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, to step down.\n\nSome of the boldest protests took place in Shanghai, where crowds called for Xi’s removal two nights in a row. The sidewalks of Urumqi Road – the main protest site – have been completely blocked by tall barricades, making it virtually impossible for crowds to congregate.\n\nPolice cars patrol Shanghai's Urumqi Road, which has been completely blocked off by tall barricades after a weekend of protests.

Police also waited inside a subway station there, closing off all but one exit, according to a protester at the scene.\n\nCNN is not naming any of the protesters in this story to protect them from reprisals.\n\nThe protester said he saw police checking the cell phones of passersby, and asking them if they had installed virtual private networks (VPNs) that can be used to circumvent China’s internet firewall, or apps such as Twitter and Telegram, which though banned in the country have been used by protesters.\n\n“There were also police dogs. The whole atmosphere was chilling,” the protester said.\n\nProtesters later decided to move their planned demonstration to another location, but by the time they arrived, the security presence had already been stepped up there, the protester said.\n\n“There were too many police and we had to cancel,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a widely circulated video appears to show police officers checking passengers’ mobile phones on a Shanghai subway train.\n\nAnother Shanghai protester told CNN they were among “around 80 to 110” people detained by police on Saturday night, adding they were released 24 hours later.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the number of protesters detained and it is unclear how many people, if any, remain in custody.\n\nThe protester said the detainees had their phones confiscated on board a bus that took them to a police station, where officers collected their fingerprints and retina patterns.\n\nAccording to the protester, police told those detained they had been used by “ill-intentioned people who want to start a color revolution,” pointing to nationwide protests breaking out on the same day as evidence of that.\n\nThe protester said police returned their phone and camera upon their release, but officers had deleted the photo album and removed the WeChat social media app.\n\nCalls from police\n\nIn Beijing, police vehicles, many parked with their lights flashing, lined eerily quiet streets on Monday morning throughout parts of the capital, including near Liangmaqiao in the city’s central Chaoyang district, where a large crowd of protesters had gathered Sunday night.\n\nThe demonstration, which saw hundreds marching down the city’s Third Ring Road, ended peacefully in the early hours of Monday under the close watch of lines of police officers.\n\nBut some protesters have since received phone calls from the police inquiring about their participation.\n\nOne demonstrator said she received a phone call from a man who identified himself as a local police officer, asking her whether she was at the protest and what she saw there. She was also told that if she had any discontent with authorities, she should complain to the police, instead of taking part in “illegal activities” such as the protest.\n\n“That night, the police mostly adopted a calm approach when dealing with us. But the Communist Party is very good at meting out punishment afterward,” the demonstrator told CNN.\n\nShe said she did not wear a face mask during the demonstration. “I don’t think Omicron is that scary,” she said. But her friends who wore masks to the protest also received calls from the police – some as late as 1 a.m., she added.\n\nStill, the protester remained defiant. “It is our legitimate right (to protest), because the constitution stipulates that we have freedom of speech and freedom of congregation,” she said.\n\nAnother protester, who has not heard from the police, told CNN that concern she could be the next to be called upon weighs heavily on her mind.\n\n“I can only seek consolation by telling myself that there were so many of us who took part in the protest, they can’t put a thousand people in jail,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, some universities in Beijing have arranged transportation for students to return home early for winter break and take classes online, citing an effort to reduce Covid risks for students taking public transportation.\n\nBut the arrangement also conveniently discourages students from gathering, following demonstrations on a series of campuses over the weekend, including the prestigious Tsinghua University where hundreds of students shouted for “Democracy and rule of law! Freedom of expression!”\n\nGiven the long history of student-led movements in modern China, authorities are particularly concerned about political rallies on university campuses.\n\nBeijing’s universities have been the source of demonstrations which kicked off the May Fourth Movement in 1919, to which the Chinese Communist Party traces its roots, as well as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which were brutally crushed by the Chinese military.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Philip Wang", "Nectar Gan", "Philip Wang"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/americas/canada-truckers-protest-monday/index.html", "title": "Freedom Convoy: Canadian government invokes Emergencies Act ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Canadian government is invoking the Emergencies Act for the first time to address the impact of continued protests across the country over Covid-19 health measures, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Monday.\n\nThe Emergencies Act can provide for the use of the military, but may not necessarily lead to that, and Trudeau said the government is not bringing them in.\n\nBut it can temporarily suspend citizens’ rights to free movement or assembly. And the government is taking steps to stop financial support of illegal protests.\n\nThe trucker-inspired protests have for weeks disturbed residents in Ottawa’s downtown and recently impeded traffic flow at crossings at the US border.\n\n“This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting peoples’ jobs and restoring faith in our institutions,” Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa, adding that the law will be limited geographically, in scope and in time.\n\nThe Canadian law, passed in 1988, states, “For the purposes of this Act, a national emergency is an urgent and critical situation of a temporary nature” that cannot be effectively dealt with under any other law of Canada.”\n\nTrudeau said the government is not overriding the charter of rights and freedoms, nor limiting the right to peaceful assembly. “We are not preventing people from exercising their right to protest legally,” he added.\n\nThe news comes after the Ambassador Bridge – North America’s busiest land border crossing – reopened Sunday and Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, announced plans to loosen pandemic restrictions.\n\nFor almost a week, protesters blocked the bridge linking Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit – severing the key trade route and dealing economic blows to both the US and Canada.\n\nThe bridge reopened Sunday night, allowing “the free flow of commerce between the Canada and US economies once again,” the Detroit International Bridge Company said.\n\nThe leader of Ontario announced the next day he plans to drop the province’s vaccine passport requirements on March 1 if its Covid-19 hospitalization rates continue to improve.\n\n“The removal of these measures has always been our objective and something we have collectively worked towards for months now,” Premier Doug Ford announced.\n\n“Let me be very clear: We’re moving in this direction because it’s safe to do so,” Ford said. “Today’s announcement is not because of what’s happening in Ottawa or Windsor but despite it.”\n\nArrests in Alberta\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Monday it has seized 13 long guns, handguns, multiple sets of body armor, a machete and a large quantity of ammunition and high-capacity magazines connected to a small, organized group within a larger protest at the US border crossing in Coutts, Alberta.\n\nThe RCMP in Alberta said 11 people were arrested near the border crossing that connects Coutts to Sweet Grass, Montana.\n\n“The group was said to have a willingness to use force against the police if any attempts were made to disrupt the blockade,” the statement said. “This resulted in an immediate and complex investigation to determine the extent of the threat and criminal organization.”\n\nAfter obtaining a warrant, police were able to search three trailers early Monday that were associated with the group.\n\nThe Coutts border crossing is one of several that have been blocked by protesters denouncing Covid-19 mandates.\n\nPersonal and corporate accounts can now be frozen, finance minister says\n\nThe government is using the Emergencies Act also to go after those who financially support illegal protests, Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland said at the news conference.\n\nFreeland said financial institutions are being given the power to suspend or freeze personal or corporate accounts they believe are being used to fund illegal protests.\n\nShe warned truck owners, for example, that if the vehicle is being used in a blockade, the corporate account can be frozen.\n\nThe government is taking action on crowd-funding sites and payment providers, requiring them to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada and report any large suspicious donations. Some sites have raised millions of dollars.\n\n“We are making these changes because we know that these platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy,” she said.\n\nThe protests that have hindered traffic at border crossings has impacted more that $500 million in commerce each day, Freeland said.\n\nMuch of that was at the Ambassador Bridge, where 30% of trade by road with the United States crosses, she said. That impacted about $390 million a day, Freeland added.\n\nThe impact at the Coutts crossing is $48 million and at one in Emerson, Manitoba, it has been $73 million.\n\n“These costs are real. They threaten businesses big and small, and they threaten the livelihoods of Canadian workers just as we are all working so hard to recover from the economic damage caused by Covid,” she said.\n\nProtesters not just truckers\n\nThe “Freedom Convoy” protesters’ grievances stem from Canada’s new mandate requiring truckers to either be fully vaccinated when crossing the Canadian-US border or face a two-week quarantine.\n\nThe protest has attracted support from thousands more Canadians – even some who are fully vaccinated but say they want all Covid-19 preventative measures dropped.\n\nAbout four in every five Canadians are fully vaccinated, Johns Hopkins University data shows. And nearly 90% of the country’s truckers are fully vaccinated and eligible to cross the border, according to the Canadian government.\n\nAmong the relaxed restrictions on tap in Ontario are the removal of some event capacity limits as soon as Thursday. Ontario also has a goal to “lift proof of vaccination requirements for all settings” on March 1.\n\nBut Ontario residents must still wear masks “for just a little bit longer,” Ford said.\n\n“This is an important layer of protection that will allow us to proceed with our reopening plans.”\n\nCanada’s capital gets flooded by protesters\n\nMembers of the protest convoy have blocked Ottawa’s downtown core and impeded border crossings between Alberta and Montana; Manitoba and North Dakota; and British Columbia and Washington state.\n\nTruckers and their supporters have gathered in Ottawa since January 29 to rally against mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions on gatherings and other Covid-19 preventative measures.\n\nProtesters will remain in the capital city “for as long as it takes for governments across Canada to end all mandates” associated with Covid-19, Freedom Convoy organizers said earlier this month.\n\nBut Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said Sunday that he had reached an agreement with organizers for them to leave residential areas of downtown and restrict their demonstrations to streets directly in front of Canada’s national parliament.\n\nResidents this month have reported rock throwing, property damage and harassment by protesters. Police said they had opened dozens of investigations, including into alleged hate crimes.\n\nSome downtown Ottawa businesses have had to shut down temporarily.\n\nTrucks with Canadian flags drive by anti-vaccine mandate and anti-government protesters Saturday in Surrey, British Columbia, near the border with Washington state.

But for the hundreds of millions in China relying on news coverage from state-run media, there has been almost no coverage of the unprecedented challenge to leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThat’s because Chinese media have largely ignored the uprising, considered to be one of the largest that has erupted in decades, as Xi employs a host of iron-fist measures to clamp down on coverage and quash the swelling acts of dissent in the authoritarian country.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nOn the homepage of the state-run Xinhua News Agency, for instance, there was not a single story about the demonstrations featured Monday. In fact, according to a search on its website, the word “protest” has not been used by the propaganda outfit in any digital stories since the protests broke out.\n\nXinhua is not an anomaly. Other state-run media outlets are also doing their best to wholly ignore the mass demonstrations, which have broken out in at least 16 cities. Mentions of the protests were absent Monday on the websites belonging to the People’s Daily and China Daily, two other prominent state-controlled media organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, on television, CCTV “spent most of the morning covering the announcement of the planned launch of the Shenzhou-15 spacecraft to China’s space station on Tuesday,” The Guardian’s Jonathan Yerushalmy wrote.\n\n“The lack of media coverage, due to Xi’s control, restricts the spread of information and helps, to some degree, prevent the protests from proliferating in an unbridled fashion,” Philip Hsu, a visiting fellow at Brookings and director of the Center for China Studies at National Taiwan University, said Monday.\n\nHsu left open the possibility that some of the coverage decisions could be due to self-censorship. “But this scenario,” Hsu said, “reflects an even more fundamental control by the Party than if there are the decrees, because the media have been deeply conditioned on what they can and cannot do without having to be instructed case by case.”\n\nIn a symbolic protest against the ever-tightening censorship, young demonstrators across China held up sheets of white paper — a metaphor for the countless critical posts, news articles, and outspoken social media accounts that were wiped from the internet.\n\nThe concerted effort by the state-run media to silence the protests and carry government messaging put on display the lengths Xi’s mouthpieces will go to crush dissent. It also raises questions about the effectiveness of his propaganda machine, given that the blackout in coverage has not been able to stamp out the growing protests or hide the truth from the world that is escaping the authoritarian grip via social media.\n\nPerhaps that is why now state-run media is slightly altering its approach, in some cases featuring articles that appear aimed at quelling the unrest by suggesting the government will work to “refine” its hardline Covid strategies. The People’s Daily, for instance, carried a headline on its homepage that said “precision” is needed “as cities roll out optimized COVID response.” In other words, the uncompromising Covid restrictions need to be eased a bit.\n\nWhether that tactic will work or not remains to be seen. But Hsu said, “no matter what happens,” the protests have already resulted in one “vital” change that will be “hard to roll back.”\n\n“Individual citizens,” Hsu said, “now know that their resistance stands a good chance to be joined by others.”", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/china/china-covid-lockdown-protests-2022-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "China Covid protests: How a deadly fire ignited a week of dissent ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nStunning scenes of dissent and defiance played out across China over the past week, marking the country’s largest protests in decades – and an unprecedented challenge to leader Xi Jinping.\n\nDeep public anger after nearly three years of snap lockdowns, border closures and financial hardship brought thousands out onto the streets to demand an end to mainland China’s zero-Covid policy – with some also calling for democracy.\n\nThe country’s security forces moved swiftly to snuff out the protests, while health officials tried to appease the public by promising to soften tough Covid measures. But furious posts on Chinese social media, which continued despite censors’ best efforts, suggested it wasn’t enough.\n\nThen came Friday, and the first known remarks from Xi on the protests – an unexpected acknowledgment of people’s frustration, according to a European Union official who declined to be named.\n\n“Xi also said Omicron is less deadly than Delta, which makes the Chinese government feel more open to further relaxing Covid restrictions,” the EU official added, raising hopes of greater freedoms after an extraordinary week.\n\nThe deadly fire\n\nOn November 24, Ali Abbas’ granddaughter was charging her tablet device when an electrical fault caused smoke to fill their Urumqi home, in China’s far western Xinjiang region, he told CNN on the phone from Turkey.\n\nSmoke quickly turned to flames, which raced through the wood-furnished apartment. Abbas’ granddaughter and daughter were able to evacuate – but residents on higher floors found themselves stranded after the elevator stopped working.\n\nSome households with previous Covid cases were also locked inside their apartments, leaving them with no way to escape. Urumqi has been under strict lockdown since August, with most residents banned from leaving their homes.\n\nThe fire broke out in Urumqi, Xinjiang, on November 24, according to Chinese authorities. Credit: Douyin\n\nVideos of the incident, taken from other buildings and on the street, suggest firefighters may have been delayed in reaching victims due to street-level lockdown restrictions. Footage shows one fire truck struggling to spray water at the building from a distance.\n\nState-run media reported the fire killed 10 people and injured nine, but reports from local residents suggest the real toll is far higher. A day after the blaze, Urumqi local government officials denied the city’s Covid policies were to blame for the deaths, adding that an investigation was underway.\n\nWhat happened to my neighbors is really a big disaster. I would like to express my sincere sorrow to all Uyghur people, to all those loved ones who lost their family members. Ali Abbas, apartment owner\n\nPublic anger quickly swelled. Videos online showed people marching to a government building in Urumqi on the night of November 25, demanding an end to the lockdown, chanting with fists in the air. Residents in other parts of the city broke through lockdown barriers and confronted Covid workers dressed in PPE; at one point, the crowd sang the national anthem, roaring the chorus: “Arise, arise, arise!”\n\nThe scenes were extraordinary in a city subject to some of China’s most stringent surveillance and security. The government has long been accused of committing human rights abuses against ethnic Uyghurs and other minorities in the region, including placing up to 2 million people in internment camps. Beijing has repeatedly denied these accusations, claiming the camps are vocational training centers.\n\nThe next morning, the Urumqi government said it would gradually ease the lockdown in certain areas. But by then, it was too late to quell the protests erupting across the nation.\n\nMounting frustrations\n\nThe protests tapped into a well of anger that had been brewing over China’s zero-Covid policy – and the damage it has often caused – as the rest of the world ended lockdown restrictions and eased other mandates, including masking.\n\nThe cost has been immense. Unemployment has skyrocketed. The economy is flailing. Those trapped in unexpected lockdowns have found themselves without adequate food, basic supplies, or even medical care in non-Covid emergencies.\n\nAnd, like those in the Urumqi fire, many deaths have been blamed on the zero-Covid policy in the last six months – far more than the six official Covid deaths reported during the same period. Demands for accountability are growing, especially after a September bus crash that killed 27 people while transporting residents to a Covid quarantine facility, and the November death of a toddler during a suspected gas leak in a locked-down residential compound.\n\nFrom left, a protest banner is seen on Sitong Bridge in Beijing on October 13, and Foxconn employees in Zhengzhou take buses home on October 30. Twitter/Getty Images\n\nThe policy had been broadly popular at the start of the pandemic, but many residents have now had enough. In a rare demonstration in October, a sole protester hung banners on a Beijing bridge that decried Covid restrictions and demanded Xi’s removal.\n\nThough all references to the banners were wiped from the Chinese internet, versions of those slogans began appearing in other parts of the country and in universities around the world – scrawled on bathroom walls and pinned on bulletin boards. More acts of disobedience came in November; workers fled China’s largest iPhone assembly factory in Zhengzhou when it was placed under lockdown, while residents of Guangzhou, also a manufacturing hub, tore down lockdown barriers and surged onto the streets in a nighttime revolt.\n\nFrom June to November 22, American think tank Freedom House recorded at least 79 protests against Covid restrictions, spanning from social media campaigns to gatherings on the street. But most of these voiced grievances against local authorities – a far cry from some of the nationwide protests that, for the first time in a generation, took aim at the country’s powerful leader and central government.\n\nAn unprecedented wave of protest\n\nProtesters gather in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai on November 26. Credit: Twitter/@whyyoutouzhele\n\nThe protests in Urumqi quickly sparked more across the country – from the original epicenter of the pandemic in Wuhan, to the capital Beijing, and Shanghai, China’s glitzy financial hub, which still carries the trauma of its own two-month lockdown earlier this year.\n\nHundreds of Shanghai residents gathered on November 26 for a candlelight vigil for the victims of the fire. Grief turned to anger as the crowd chanted slogans calling for freedom and political reform, while holding blank sheets of paper in a symbolic protest against censorship. In videos, people can be heard shouting for Xi and the Communist Party to “step down,” and singing a famous socialist anthem.\n\nAround 300 kilometers (186 miles) away, dozens of students in Nanjing gathered to mourn the victims, with photos showing a crowd of young people lit by cell phone flashlights. Images of the protests raced across social media faster than censors could erase them – igniting demonstrations in other university campuses, including the prestigious Peking University in Beijing. One wall at Peking University bore a message in red paint, echoing the slogans used by the protester who had hung the Beijing bridge banners in October: “Say no to lockdown, yes to freedom.”\n\nProtesters and students demonstrate outside Nanjing University, November 26.

In Shanghai, one protester told CNN around 80 to 110 people had been detained by police on the night of November 26, adding they were released 24 hours later after officers collected their fingerprints and retina patterns.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the number of protesters detained and it is unclear how many people, if any, remain in custody.\n\nBeijing emerged as a protest hotspot on November 27, as hundreds of students gathered at the elite Tsinghua University, shouting: “Democracy and rule of law! Freedom of expression!” Elsewhere in the city, a large crowd gathered for a vigil and a march through the commercial center, chanting slogans for greater civil liberties.\n\nAmid the mourning and frustration, a strong sense of solidarity emerged as people shared the rare chance to stand side by side and voice grievances long silenced.\n\nIt turns out there are so many people who are wide awake Protester in Chengdu\n\nOnline, China’s vast army of censors worked overtime to erase content about the demonstrations – prompting many to get creative. Some posts on social media consisted only of one or two characters repeated for several paragraphs, in the long tradition of using codes and wordless icons to convey dissent on China’s internet.\n\nSimilar tactics were used on the ground, with videos on social media showing crowds shouting, “We want lockdowns, we want tests” after reportedly being told not to chant the opposite.\n\nProtesters in Shanghai hold up pieces of white paper to symbolize censorship, November 27.

In Shanghai, huge barricades were erected to prevent crowds from congregating on sidewalks, while police officers checked passengers’ cell phones on the street and on subway trains, according to eyewitnesses and videos on social media.\n\nIn a veiled warning, the Communist Party’s domestic security committee vowed to “strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilize social order,” according to state media.\n\nOthers in Beijing described receiving phone calls from authorities asking about their participation. One protester told CNN they received a call on Wednesday from a police officer, who revealed that their cell phone signal had been detected near a protest site three days before.\n\nAccording to a recording of the phone conversation heard by CNN, the protester denied being near the site that night – to which the officer asked, “Then why did your cell phone number show up there?”\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time as the crackdown, health officials tried to appease the public, acknowledging in a news conference on Tuesday that some Covid control measures had been implemented “excessively.” Authorities were adjusting measures to “limit the impact on people as much as possible,” they said, reiterating similar recent statements.\n\nThe promises failed to soothe some listeners who seethed in comments on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, where the conference was livestreamed. “You’ve lost all credibility,” one said. Another wrote: “We’ve cooperated with you for three years. Now, it’s time to give our freedom back.”\n\nThe following day, a top official gave the clearest indication yet that the country was considering a new direction.\n\n“With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China’s pandemic containment faces (a) new stage and mission,” said Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who oversees the country’s Covid response, according to state media.\n\nSeveral cities moved quickly to loosen restrictions. On Friday, Beijing’s municipal government reversed rules set just 10 days ago that required residents to show a negative Covid-19 test taken in the previous 48 hours to board public transport in the capital city.\n\nTianjin and Chengdu also scrapped requirements for commuters to present a negative test result, effective immediately, according to notices from both cities’ metro operators on Friday.\n\nIn Chongqing and Guangzhou, close contacts of positive cases can quarantine at home instead of at a government facility. Several lockdowns were also lifted, including in Zhengzhou and in Guangzhou.\n\nWhile these measures are expected to bring some relief, authorities have repeatedly voiced concerns that vaccination rates aren’t high enough to fully open up without risking spikes in Covid deaths.\n\nChina recorded 34,772 new Covid cases on Thursday, then 32,827 on Friday, continuing a downward trend in daily infections from record highs on November 27.\n\nAs of Friday, thousands of buildings and residential communities across China remain under lockdown restrictions due to their classification as “high risk.”\n\n\n\nIt’s not opening up, don’t misinterpret this Comment on Weibo\n\nOne user on Weibo urged authorities to further relax rules “so people can live a normal life,” warning that strict Covid measures could push some too far.\n\n“If they don’t open up soon, people will really go crazy,” one comment read.\n\nAnother wrote: “The pressure is too great.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Carlotta Dotto Henrik Pettersson", "Jessie Yeung", "Carlotta Dotto", "Henrik Pettersson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/china/china-beijing-protests-police-mobile-signal-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 protests: Chinese police are using mobile networks to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChinese authorities are using cellphone data to track down protesters who demonstrated against the government’s stringent Covid restrictions in Beijing, according to a recording of a phone call between a protester and police heard by CNN.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered along Beijing’s Liangma River on Sunday night, calling for an end to the incessant Covid tests and lockdowns. Some also decried censorship and called for greater political freedoms.\n\nThe extraordinary show of dissent in the heart of the Chinese capital ended largely peacefully in the early hours of Monday. But some protesters have since received phone calls from the police inquiring about their participation.\n\nA protester told CNN they received a phone call Wednesday from a police officer, who revealed they were tracked because their cellphone signal was recorded in the vicinity of the protest site.\n\nCNN is not naming any of the protesters in this story to protect them from reprisals.\n\nAccording to a recording of the phone conversation listened to by CNN, the protester was asked if they went to the Liangma River on Sunday night.

Since Chinese leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, and built a high-tech surveillance state.\n\nChina’s security apparatus has moved swiftly this week to smother mass protests that swept the country, keeping a heavy police presence in locations where crowds had gathered over the weekend, or planned to do so.\n\nIn Shanghai, where some of the boldest protests took place with crowds calling for Xi’s removal on two consecutive nights, police searched residents’ cellphones in the streets and in the subway for virtual private networks (VPNs) that can be used to circumvent China’s internet firewall, or apps such as Twitter and Telegram, which though banned in the country have been used by protesters.\n\nPolice also confiscated the cellphones of protesters under arrest, according to two protesters who spoke to CNN.\n\nA protester who was arrested over the weekend said they were told to hand over their phone and password to the police as “evidence.”\n\nThey said they feared police would export the data on their phone after it was confiscated by officers, who told them they could pick it up a week later.\n\nAnother protester said police returned their phone upon their release, but officers had deleted the photo album and removed the WeChat social media app.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Yong Xiong", "Nectar Gan", "Yong Xiong"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/china/china-protests-zero-covid-position-intl-hnk-mic/index.html", "title": "China signals it could soften its zero-Covid policy, but there are ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nChina has given its most significant signal yet that it may adjust its stringent zero-Covid policy that has transformed daily life, roiled the economy – and sparked a wave of protests.\n\nThe top official in charge of China’s Covid response told health officials Wednesday that the country faced a “new stage and mission” in pandemic control.\n\n“With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China’s pandemic containment faces a new stage and mission,” Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said Wednesday, according to state news agency Xinhua.\n\nThe remarks follow a surge in public frustration with zero-Covid and its high human cost, which erupted into unprecedented demonstrations in at least 19 cities since last Friday.\n\nSun – who has been the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s enforcement of the policy – made no mention of “zero-Covid,” as reported by Xinhua. Her comments came a day after a separate body of top health officials pledged to rectify some approaches to Covid control and said local governments should “respond to and resolve the reasonable demands of the masses” in a timely manner.\n\nOn Thursday, Sun reiterated the new tone, telling a health symposium in Beijing that China’s health care and disease control systems now had “effective diagnosis and treatment techniques” against the epidemic. Overall, China had “created conditions for the country to further optimize its prevention and control measures,” she said, according to state media.\n\nThe high-level statements – alongside minor adjustments of rules and some easing of lockdown measures in major cities in recent days – suggest China is bending under pressure on the policy, which has become increasingly disruptive as it struggles to counter highly transmissible variants and record case numbers.\n\nBut the shifting tone has not come with any road map to an end goal or mention of transitioning away from zero-Covid, and it remains uncertain how it will impact realities on the ground or ease mounting public frustration.\n\nAs of Friday, thousands of buildings and residential communities across China remain under lockdown restrictions due to their classification as “high risk.”\n\nLocal officials may be reticent to let cases rise for fear of retribution from a central government that has long prided itself on its zero-Covid stance. Meanwhile, experts say, the country continues to lag in key areas of preparedness for a widespread outbreak.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Protesters clash with police in China during new wave of demonstrations 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nTone shift\n\nChinese health officials and experts have long argued that the costs of the zero-Covid policy are scientifically justified, citing uncertainties in how the virus will evolve, unknowns about its long-term effects, and gaps in medical preparedness, including a lagging elderly vaccination rate and inadequate intensive care infrastructure – especially in rural areas.\n\nThese weaknesses, they have warned, could see the health care system overwhelmed if the virus spreads freely in the country of 1.4 billion – a situation that could exacerbate the deaths expected with an opening up.\n\nThis remains a key concern for the government, according to health security expert Nicholas Thomas at the City University of Hong Kong, who said: “There is still a substantial part of the population that is trusting in the government’s actions in dealing with the virus. An unmanaged engagement with the virus could not only erode that trust but it could also expose vulnerable populations (to risk).”\n\nOfficials’ recent comments around the policy are “not a sign that China is ready to transition to living with Covid, but a sign that the virus has slipped out of control and that the government is unable to return to a zero-Covid environment,” he said.\n\nCase numbers in the past week have hovered around record highs, with more than 34,000 new infections reported Thursday – posing a steep challenge to efforts to return them to a low level.\n\nThere have, however, been recent signs of efforts to shift public perception about the virus, following years of focusing on its risks.\n\nA number of media outlets picked up a piece by state-run Global Times citing “recent research” from Chinese scientists showing the comparative “decreased pathogenicity” of the Omicron variant. Others shared an interview with a medical expert who raised doubts about long Covid — a sharp contrast to previous state media coverage playing up the long-term risks of contracting the virus.\n\nThe government’s own narrative about the success of zero-Covid and its backing by leader Xi Jinping partly explain why China has long maintained the policy, according to Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.\n\nAfter bringing its initial outbreak in Wuhan under control in 2020, China’s border restrictions and swift method of detecting and suppressing the virus allowed the country to live relatively virus-free, while hospitals in many parts of the world were overrun with sick and dying patients. By China’s official count, it has seen only 5,233 Covid-19 deaths since early 2020, with fewer than 600 reported in 2022.\n\nXi has touted China’s measures and its relatively low number of Covid deaths as a triumph of Chinese governance. The country stuck to that system even as others transitioned to living with the virus following mass vaccinations and the spread of the milder, but highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nEven as Omicron made China’s controls less effective, Beijing continued to prioritize resources for lockdowns, mass testing and forced quarantines over preparing for wide spread of the virus, observers say.\n\n“The number one (reason) is propaganda – they want to claim that China is doing a much better job than the United States,” said Wu, adding that expanding state control over the population could be another motivation for maintaining the zero-Covid policy – as Xi has stressed state security as a key policy goal.\n\nBut while pursuing this strategy, China “lost so many golden opportunities,” to prepare to live with the virus, and to prepare the public for a larger scale of deaths from Covid-19, he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'River of blood': Foxconn employee describes violent protests in China 03:26 - Source: CNN\n\nPrepared?\n\nOne concern among health officials about relaxing controls is the low level of vaccination in the elderly population most vulnerable to Covid-19 – a weakness that Beijing on Tuesday launched a new plan to address.\n\nAs of November 11, 40% of China’s over-80 population had received a booster shot, according to state media, while around two-thirds had received two doses – a result of both vaccine hesitancy and an initial roll-out that did not prioritize the elderly.\n\nA World Health Organization advisory group last year recommended that elderly people taking China’s inactivated-virus vaccines receive three doses in their initial course to ensure sufficient protection. Vaccine protection is known to wane over time and decrease against Omicron.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s immunity rests almost entirely on vaccination as so few people have been exposed to the virus. Around 90% of the population is fully vaccinated. While China’s vaccines have been shown to protect against severe disease and death, studies show they offer lower antibody protection than the mRNA vaccines used widely elsewhere in the world. Beijing has yet to approve any mRNA vaccine.\n\nResidents line up for Covid-19 testing at a residential complex in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1, 2022. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA stark warning of the risks for mainland China played out in Hong Kong, where low vaccination rates among that most at-risk group played a role in pushing the Chinese territory’s Covid-19 death rates to some of the highest in the world last spring.\n\nWhile vaccination will not eliminate an increase in deaths when restrictions ease, shots and boosters, and other preparations to reduce risks, are critical for countries transitioning away from policies aimed at “zero-Covid,” according to infectious disease physician Peter Collignon of the Australian National University Medical School.\n\n“The preparation isn’t just vaccines, it’s surge capacity, it’s making sure you have enough hospital staff, you have enough beds and particularly making sure the elderly (are protected),” he said.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nChina has signaled it may make more concerted efforts to bolster its defenses against the virus. Officials on Tuesday released an action plan to boost elderly vaccination rates. This echoed a target mentioned in a 20-point plan to optimize zero-Covid measures, released last month, which also called for hospitals to increase intensive treatment facilities and to stockpile anti-viral drugs and medical equipment.\n\nThe same notice also relaxed certain measures around testing and quarantine, and cautioned against excesses in policy enforcement at the local level – all messages that have been echoed by top health officials in recent days.\n\nAfter that guidance – and in the wake of the recent protests – state media has highlighted a number of cities making minor changes to their policies, largely around testing and quarantine rules.\n\nBut some social media users remained skeptical, saying the changes to testing requirements were too minor to ease the impact of zero-Covid on daily life.\n\nThe northeastern city of Jinzhou on Friday announced it would gradually restore some normal operations in its main urban area – just one day after saying it would not follow other cities by relaxing measures ahead of schedule.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials in the southern hub of Guangzhou relaxed lockdowns in four districts and eased a quarantine requirement. And in Xinjiang’s Urumqi on Saturday, local officials said they would gradually ease lockdown measures in neighborhoods categorized as “low risk,” and moved to reopen essential businesses and public transport in a notice the following day.\n\nThe protests across the nation were sparked by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, where at least 10 people died, and videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims. They joined a list of deaths that have been widely linked in public conversation to Covid-19 controls.\n\nExperts say the real test of the country’s direction remains to be seen in the coming months.\n\nIf the vaccination push and other proposed measures bolstering medical readiness were “seriously implemented,” then China would have “a way forward for future opening,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “But so far they have not been prioritized in the implementation process.”\n\nAnother problem is the disconnect between Beijing’s policies and how they are implemented by local government officials, who are under pressure to control case numbers for fear of being removed from their posts – a regular punishment in the past for those who have allowed outbreaks to spread.\n\n“If you open up and you mess up, then there will be trouble,” Huang said. “You have to change the incentive structure of the local governments before any meaningful changes can be introduced.”\n\nThis article has been updated with new information.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/china/china-lockdown-protests-covid-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's lockdown protests: What you need to know | CNN", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChina has moved quickly to suppress demonstrations that erupted across the country against the government’s zero-Covid policy on the weekend, deploying police forces at key protest sites and tightening online censorship.\n\nOn Tuesday, while defending the policy, top health officials appeared to acknowledge its impact and pledged to “reduce inconvenience” to the public by lifting lockdowns “as quickly as possible” following outbreaks.\n\nHowever, it may not be enough to appease the protesters, who took to the streets of several major cities and university campuses to demand an end to the country’s increasingly costly lockdowns.\n\nAs numbers swelled, so too did the range of grievances aired, with some even calling for the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who for nearly three years has overseen a strategy of mass-testing, lockdowns, enforced quarantine and digital tracking.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nWhat’s behind the protests?\n\nThe demonstrations were triggered by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, the capital of the far western region of Xinjiang. The blaze killed at least 10 people and injured nine in an apartment building – leading to public fury after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nThe city had been under lockdown for more than 100 days, with residents unable to leave the region and many forced to stay home.\n\nVideos showed Urumqi residents marching to a government building and chanting for the end of lockdown on Friday. The following morning, the local government said it would lift the lockdown in stages – but did not provide a clear time frame or address the protests.\n\nThat failed to quell public anger and the protests rapidly spread beyond Xinjiang, with residents in cities and universities across China also taking to the streets.\n\nWhere have protests taken place?\n\nSo far, CNN has verified 23 demonstrations since Saturday across 17 Chinese cities – including the capital Beijing and financial center Shanghai.\n\nIn Shanghai on Saturday, hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil on Urumqi Road, named after the Xinjiang city, to mourn the fire victims. Many held up blank sheets of white paper – a symbolic protest against censorship – and chanted, “Need human rights, need freedom.”\n\nSome also shouted for Xi to “step down,” and sang “The Internationale,” a socialist anthem used as a call to action in demonstrations worldwide for more than a century. It was also sung during pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing before a brutal crackdown by armed troops in 1989.\n\nBy Sunday evening, mass demonstrations had spread to Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Wuhan, where thousands of residents called for not only an end to Covid restrictions, but more remarkably, political freedoms. Residents in some locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets.\n\nProtests also took place on campuses, including the prestigious institutions of Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Communication University of China, Nanjing.\n\nIn Hong Kong, where a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 has been used to stifle dissent, dozens of people gathered on Monday evening in the city’s Central district for a vigil. Some held blank pieces of paper, while others left flowers and held signs commemorating those killed in the Urumqi fire.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear protesters in China call for Xi Jinping's resignation 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nWhy are these protests significant?\n\nPublic protest is exceedingly rare in China, where the Communist Party has tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, wiped out much of civil society and built a high-tech surveillance state.\n\nThe mass surveillance system is even more stringent in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is accused of detaining up to 2 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in camps where former detainees have alleged they were physically and sexually abused.\n\nA damning United Nations report in September described the region’s “invasive” surveillance network, with police databases containing hundreds of thousands of files with biometric data such as facial and eyeball scans.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region.\n\nProtesters march in Beijing on November 27. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nWhile protests do occur in China, they rarely happen on this scale or take such direct aim at the central government and the nation’s leader, said Maria Repnikova, an associate professor at Georgia State University who studies Chinese politics and media.\n\n“This is a different type of protest from the more localized protests we have seen recurring over the past two decades that tend to focus their claims and demands on local officials and on very targeted societal and economic issues,” she said. Instead, this time the protests have expanded to include “the sharper expression of political grievances alongside concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns.”\n\nThere have been growing signs in recent months that the public has run out of patience with zero-Covid, after nearly three years of economic hardship and disruption to daily life.\n\nIsolated pockets of protest broke out in October, with anti-zero-Covid slogans appearing on the walls of public bathrooms and in various Chinese cities, inspired by a banner hung by a lone protester on an overpass in Beijing just days before Xi cemented a third term in power.\n\nEarlier in November, larger protests took place in Guangzhou, with residents defying lockdown orders to topple barriers and cheer as they took to the streets.\n\nHow have authorities reacted?\n\nWhile protests in several parts of China appear to have largely dispersed peacefully over the weekend, authorities responded more forcefully in some cities on Monday and Tuesday, flooding protest sites to discourage people from gathering.\n\nThe Shanghai protests on Saturday led to scuffles between demonstrators and police, with arrests made in the early hours of the morning. Undeterred, protesters returned on Sunday, where they met a more aggressive response – videos show chaotic scenes of police pushing, dragging, and beating protesters.\n\nThe videos have since been scrubbed from the Chinese internet by censors.\n\nOne Shanghai protester told CNN he was one of around 80 to 110 people detained in the city on Saturday night. He described being transferred to a police station, having his phone confiscated and biometric information collected before being released a day later.\n\nTwo foreign reporters were also briefly detained. BBC journalist Edward Lawrence was arrested in Shanghai on Sunday night, with a BBC spokesperson claiming he was “beaten and kicked by the police” while covering the protests. He has since been released.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows British journalist 'beaten' and detained in China 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\nMichael Peuker, China correspondent for Swiss public broadcaster RTS, was reporting live when he said several police officers approached him. He later posted on Twitter that the officers took him and his cameraman into a vehicle, before releasing them.\n\nWhen a reporter asked whether the widespread displays of public anger would make China consider ending zero-Covid, Zhao replied, “What you mentioned does not reflect what actually happened.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Zhao further defended zero-Covid, claiming Chinese citizens “enjoy various legal rights and freedoms that are fully protected by law. At the same time, any rights and freedoms should be exercised within the framework of the law.”\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nHowever, at State Council press briefing on Tuesday, top health officials appeared to acknowledge the disruptions caused by Covid lockdowns, saying long-term closures “can cause anxiety and life difficulties.”\n\nMi Feng, a spokesperson with China’s National Health Commission, said Covid policies were being rectified to include lifting lockdown “as quickly as possible” to reduce inconvenience.\n\nOfficials at the conference also announced plans to boost vaccinations for the elderly, a step experts had previously said was necessary before any potential relaxation of restrictions.\n\nHow has the world responded?\n\nIn recent days, vigils and demonstrations expressing solidarity with protesters in China have been held around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the United States and Malaysia.\n\nForeign officials and organizations have also voiced support for the protesters and criticized Beijing’s response.\n\n“We’re watching this closely, as you might expect we would,” said US National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday. “We continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest.”\n\nUK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told reporters the Chinese government should “listen to the voices of its own people … when they are saying that they are not happy with the restrictions imposed upon them.”\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union also said on Monday that it condemned “the intolerable intimidation and aggression” directed toward member journalists in China, in an apparent reference to foreign journalists who were detained during protests.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}]}

The House is expected to pass the bill before the end of the year – possibly as soon as next week.\n\n“For millions of Americans, this legislation will safeguard the rights and protections to which LGBTQI+ and interracial couples and their children are entitled,” Biden said in a statement Tuesday evening after Senate passage, hailing it as a “bipartisan achievement.”\n\nWhile the bill would not set a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage, it would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage.\n\nSo, in the event the Supreme Court might overturn its 2015 Obergefell v.

It’s not clear, however, whether the bill can pass the Senate where at least 10 Republicans would need to join with Democrats to overcome the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold.\n\nThe vote comes amid fears among Democrats that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could take aim at same-sex marriage in the future, after the high court overturned Roe v. Wade in a highly consequential reversal of longstanding legal precedent.\n\nThe bill – called the Respect for Marriage Act – was introduced by Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn addition to safeguarding the right to same-sex marriage nationwide, the bill also includes federal protections for interracial marriages. The measure holds that a marriage must be recognized under federal law if the marriage was legal in the state where it took place.\n\nThe bill would also enact additional legal safeguards for married couples intended to prevent discrimination on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity or national origin, including empowering the attorney general to pursue enforcement actions.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said in a statement on the vote, “it is critical to ensure that federal law protects those whose constitutional rights might be threatened by Republican-controlled state legislatures.

Wade has set off a debate over whether other precedents are now in danger.\n\nThe majority opinion from Justice Samuel Alito attempted to wall off its holding in the abortion case from those other rulings, but Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to call explicitly for other rulings to be revisited.\n\n“In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,” Thomas wrote, referring to decisions on contraception and same-sex relationships.\n\nLiberals have said that those rulings are now at risk.\n\nIn their dissent, the court’s three liberal justices wrote “no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.”\n\n“The right Roe and Casey recognized does not stand alone,” they wrote. “To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage.”\n\nThe liberals added: “Either the mass of the majority’s opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other.”\n\nIn a letter to House Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previewed the House votes related to same-sex marriage and contraception as a counter to the Supreme Court.\n\n“This week, the House will pass two more bills to protect freedom in our nation, as extremist Justices and lawmakers take aim at more of our basic rights,” she wrote. “Our Right to Contraception Act will preserve the essential protections found in Griswold v.

Tammy Baldwin tapped twice on the wooden table before her for good luck.\n\n“I’m not a superstitious person,” the Democrat told CNN. “But I still have to do that.”\n\nBaldwin needed not worry; She had not left the rights of LGBTQ people like herself up to fate. The Senate passed the bill 61-36 on Tuesday, five months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and left the left fearful about what six conservative justices could do.\n\nIn an interview at her hideaway office in the basement of the Capitol, Baldwin – the first out LGBTQ member of the Senate – noted two key moments in the passage of the bill, which would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act and establish into federal law that same-sex marriages in one state must be recognized by another.\n\nThe first was on June 24, when the court decided in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization to undo the constitutional right to an abortion. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the court should also reconsider past rulings built from the same legal ground, including those protecting same-sex marriage and access to contraception.\n\nLess than a month later, the Democratic-controlled House passed New York Rep. Jerry Nadler’s bill to protect same-sex marriage. And California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins and Baldwin introduced their bill, known as the Respect for Marriage Act.\n\n“I can tell you that as a member of the LGBTQ community and hearing from both same-sex couples and interracial couples who read Dobbs and read the Thomas concurrence and said, ‘Oh, my God, what is happening,’” Baldwin said. “‘We’ve gone back 50 years with regard to women’s reproductive rights. What’s next for marriage?’”\n\nIf the court hadn’t overturned Roe, “this bill wouldn’t have been introduced,” added Baldwin.\n\nThe second crucial moment occurred on September 15. In the Senate, at least 10 Republicans would have to support the bill to pass it – and Democrats could count on only four: Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Collins.\n\nThat was not enough. And some Republicans said they would not vote for the bill before the midterm elections, leaving Democrats with a dilemma.\n\nIf they pushed the vote, and failed, Democrats could sink their chances of passing the legislation but at least run on the issue before the midterms; 71% of Americans say they support same-sex marriage, according to Gallup. Or they could wait until after the election, when Republicans could win back a chamber of Congress, and trust that a handful of Republican senators would keep their word.\n\nAt a meeting that day in Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office in the Capitol, Baldwin, Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and others said that they didn’t have the votes, but would after the election.\n\n“It was pretty clear,” said Baldwin. “We went to Schumer with evidence. We didn’t name names, and I never will.”\n\nCollins, who was shuttling between hosting a Maine lobster Senate GOP lunch and negotiating in Schumer’s office, said, “Tammy did a great job of reaching out to the Democratic leadership, and emphasizing the importance, and helping to decide, some of the timing, such as waiting ‘til after the election.”\n\n“Her leadership was critical,” added Collins.\n\nAt the meeting, Schumer noted his own personal connection to the issue – his daughter married another woman in 2018 – and agreed to get the bill done after the election. “It was just a helpful reminder at the perfect moment” that “not everything” Congress does is to win, said Baldwin.\n\n“This was never political for us,” she added.\n\nWhen the Senate bill passed on Tuesday, Schumer wore a purple tie – the same one he wore to his daughter’s wedding.\n\n‘Until it’s done, it can’t be done’\n\nThe passage of the Respect for Marriage Act caps a nearly 40-year political career for Baldwin, a 60-year-old low-key, progressive Wisconsinite, who worked her way up from the Dane County Board of Supervisors to the State Assembly to the House of Representatives to the Senate.\n\nShe was out from the beginning. Asked if anyone had ever urged her to hide her sexual orientation along the way, she replied, “I think the answer is basically no.”\n\n“After I ran for the county board in 1986 as an out lesbian, there was no, like, going back into the closet afterwards,” said Baldwin with a laugh. “So anyone who tried to come up to me in 1994 and say, ‘you know, really not great to be running for State Assembly as an out lesbian,’ it’s like eh, too late, done that.”\n\nIn 1998, Baldwin became the first out gay, non-incumbent elected to the House. In 2012, she became the first out LGBTQ member elected to the Senate.\n\n“Until it’s done, it can’t be done,” said Baldwin of making history. “Somebody then does it – and now it’s something that can be done.”\n\nSinema, the first out bisexual person elected to the Senate, called Baldwin “a trailblazer on the issue of LGBT rights for decades.”\n\nTracking Republican support\n\nAfter the September meeting, Democrats like Baldwin and Sinema agreed to a number of religious liberty protections to get Republicans on board.\n\nThe amended bill made clear that marriage was between two people. It said that non-profit religious institutions would not be required to provide any services, goods or facilities for celebrating same-sex marriages, and that their tax status would not be affected. It also stated, “diverse beliefs about the role of gender in marriage are held by reasonable and sincere people based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises,” pushing back on claims that those who don’t support same-sex marriage are bigoted.\n\n“My own first reaction was: this is absolutely unnecessary,” said Baldwin, pointing to the provision related to polygamy, which is illegal. “But if they want clarification in writing, OK, there’s no harm to state the facts.”\n\nWhile all of the changes were not enough for many GOP senators, they appealed to faith organizations like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which opposes same-sex marriage, and swayed enough Republicans. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a Mormon, noted his church’s approval when he announced his support for the bill this month.\n\n“The religious liberty protections in this bill are strong,” said Sinema, who worked with the LDS Church, the National Association of Evangelicals, and other religious groups, and was critical in getting Republican support for the bill.\n\nThe provisions also won over Indiana GOP Sen. Todd Young, who explained to Republicans “disappointed in my decision” how he could support the bill in an Indianapolis Star column.\n\n“I would never try to persuade people to change the teachings of their faith, but I can explain why I think Christians should not be fearful of this legislation,” he wrote.\n\nWyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a conservative Republican, also said she would support the bill despite “a painful exercise in accepting admonishment and fairly brutal self-soul searching” due to her deeply-held, personal religious view that marriage should be between one man and one woman. But she decided to back the bill, she said, since it was important “to tolerate” each other “in order to survive as a nation.”\n\nIn the months-long push to pass the bill, Democrats appeared to lose only one vote – Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s – that they seemed to have.\n\nBefore his reelection earlier this month, Johnson indicated that he would support a bill to codify same-sex marriage. But after he won, Johnson said the legislation did not do enough to protect religious liberties, and attacked Democrats for creating “a state of fear over a settled issue in order to further divide Americans for their political benefit.”\n\nAsked about Johnson’s comments, Baldwin, reflecting her gentle demeanor, declined to comment on her Wisconsin colleague, and turned the conversation toward those who she said would benefit from the new law.\n\nShe did something similar a couple weeks ago, when Baldwin tried to draw attention toward others, putting a picture of her friends Margaret and Denise, and their daughter Maria, on the Senate floor during a speech.\n\n“Visibility has changed people’s hearts and minds,” Baldwin told CNN.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/politics/gop-senators-same-sex-marriage/index.html", "title": "Same-sex marriage bill: Where all 50 GOP senators stand on the bill ...", "text": "Richard Burr of North Carolina is undecided.

He added: “I don’t have any problem with same-sex marriage, but I’m not sure – I want to look at the legislation.”\n\nMike Braun of Indiana told CNN on Wednesday he’s going to wait until the bill is brought to the Senate floor, then he’ll look at it.\n\nJoni Ernst of Iowa is keeping an open mind about the same-sex marriage legislation, and she’ll review the bill should it come before the Senate, according to a spokesperson from her office.\n\nCynthia Lummis of Wyoming said she’s waiting to read the legislation.\n\nRand Paul of Kentucky said he hasn’t had a chance to look at it yet.\n\nMitch McConnell of Kentucky was noncommittal on Tuesday when asked whether he’d vote to in support of the House bill that would enshrine protections for same-sex marriage into federal law, saying, “I’m gonna delay announcing anything on that issue until we see what the majority leader wants to put on the floor.”\n\nMitt Romney of Utah was noncommittal on the bill, telling CNN that the same-sex marriage bill “is not something I’ve given consideration to at this stage” since “I don’t see the law changing.”\n\nMike Rounds of South Dakota said he hasn’t looked at the bill. “I already think that the fact that we’ve got eight to one on the Supreme Court that indicated that it’s not coming up, probably makes it a moot question to begin with,” he said. Asked how he feels about same-sex marriage in general, he responded: “I think there’s a difference between matrimony as a sacrament and a legal marriage and so if someone wants to do that type of partnership, I’m not opposed to it.”\n\nRick Scott of Florida told CNN he wants to wait and see, but believes the Supreme Court has already decided this, when asked if he’d support the bill.\n\nDan Sullivan of Alaska told CNN he “has to review” it. He noted that he accepts the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nJohn Thune of South Dakota, the GOP whip, told CNN he will take a “hard look” at the bill, even though he has previously opposed same-sex marriage. Thune said he expects the legislation will have similarly strong GOP support in the Senate as it received in the House. “As you saw there was pretty good bipartisan support in the House yesterday and I expect there’d probably be the same thing you’d see in the Senate,” he said. Thune also contended the bill is an effort to distract from economic issues and high inflation ahead of the midterms. Asked if his own views have changed, Thune wouldn’t say explicitly. “I got a view on that, that goes back a long ways. But I also respect the decision that was made by the Court in 2015,” Thune said.\n\nPat Toomey of Pennsylvania said he hasn’t looked at the bill yet, when asked whether by CNN whether he’d vote for it.\n\nTommy Tuberville of Alabama told CNN on Wednesday he’d like to wait and look at the entire bill. “But I think people ought to have freedom to do what they want.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina, told CNN Wednesday he “probably will” support the bill. And, importantly, Republican Whip John Thune said he expects the legislation will have similarly strong GOP support in the Senate as it got in the House.\n\n“If and when (Democrats) bring a bill to the floor, we’ll take a hard look at it,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican who cautioned he had not made a decision on the bill. “As you saw there was pretty good bipartisan support in the House yesterday and I expect there’d probably be the same thing you’d see in the Senate.”\n\nAt this point, four Republicans, including Tillis, have signaled their support for the bill while several have said they will vote against it. A number of Republicans have not committed to how they will vote.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said he wants to bring the bill to the floor soon, but did not announce when he would schedule a vote. He added that he was “impressed by how much bipartisan support the bill got in the House.”\n\nThe Senate leaves for its August recess in two weeks, making it unlikely he will be able to get the floor time before then, especially as senators are already trying to pass a bill to boost production of semiconductor chips and a separate economic package. Taking it up after August moves the debate closer to the midterm elections and will allow Democrats to highlight what they believe are key social issues important to voters.\n\nThune, who said he respects the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that legalized same-sex unions, accused Democrats of forcing the issue to distract from high inflation and other economic problems that could hurt them in the midterm elections.\n\nMarriage equality proponents are pressing to quickly pass the Respect for Marriage Act, which also legalizes interracial marriage, after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in an opinion in the recent case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion that the high court might want to reconsider other decisions related to contraception and same sex marriage. Many Republicans have dismissed Thomas’ words and said they don’t expect the Supreme Court to revisit those cases.\n\nRepublican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who is cosponsoring the bill, said holding a vote on this issue sends an “important message,” and that it’s “obvious” Republican views have changed over time.\n\n“When you look at the House vote and you look at just the shifting sentiment about this issue,” he said. “I think this is an issue that many Americans, regardless of political affiliation, feel has been resolved.”\n\nHe noted that his “own personal views on this changed,” over time. Portman publicly announced his support for same-sex marriage after his son came out a few years ago. Asked if they could get 10 Republicans to support the legislation, Portman referenced an anti-discrimination bill that the Senate was able to pass with 60 votes in the last few years. “I think there’s a possibility of it, yeah.”\n\nIn addition to Portman, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is a co-sponsor of the bill, as is Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, the first known gay politician elected to the US Senate.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor, Schumer said he spoke to Baldwin and that “she is talking to Republicans to see where the support is.”\n\nMany Republicans have declined to state their positions on the legislation, saying they want to study the legislation first.\n\n“I’m gonna take a look at what actually gets drafted, and we’ll look at it at that point, but haven’t got any comment until I see what it looks like,” said Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah.\n\n“I’m gonna delay announcing anything on that issue until we see what the majority leader wants to put on the floor,” echoed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, on Tuesday.\n\nOther Republicans who would not commit their position included Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Sen. Todd Young of Indiana.\n\nOther Republican senators canvassed by CNN, including Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, said they will vote against the House-passed bill.\n\nRubio dismissed the effort as a “stupid waste of time” as he walked onto an elevator where Baldwin was standing.\n\nBut GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who is running for reelection in Alaska, said she would like to pass laws in the areas Thomas raised in his opinion to ensure abortion, the use of contraceptives, and same-sex marriage are legalized.\n\n“I have suggested to others that not only would I like to see Roe, Casey, and Griswold on contraception codified but I’ve also made clear my support for, for gay marriage years ago,” she said. “So I will look at what the House is doing and see what that might mean here on the Senate side.”", "authors": ["Ted Barrett Manu Raju", "Ted Barrett", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/29/gay-marriage-rights-senate-vote-expected-respect-marriage-act/10791064002/", "title": "Senate passes landmark legislation protecting same-sex marriage ...", "text": "The Senate took an historic step Tuesday, passing legislation that would enshrine same-sex marriage rights into law and grant gay unions federal protection.\n\nThe vote to pass the Respect for Marriage Act was bipartisan – 61 to 36 – with a significant bloc of Republicans joining every Democrat in approving the landmark bill. It now heads to the House where it's expected to pass as early as next week.\n\nWisconsin Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person to serve in the Senate, said its passage should allay the concerns of same-sex and interracial couples worried their civil marriage could be stripped away.\n\n“The Senate has the opportunity to put those fears to rest and give millions of people in same sex and interracial marriages the certainty, dignity and respect that they need and deserve,” she said before the vote.\n\nSenators approved the bill in response to concerns the Supreme Court – with a 6-3 conservative majority – would reverse its 2015 decision recognizing the legitimacy of gay marriage just as it overturned in June the Roe v.

But bipartisan sponsors of the bill said the religious freedom language inserted in the measure would protect those entities from such infringements.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act would guarantee federal recognition of any marriage between two people if the union was valid in the state where they married.\n\nIt now moves to the House, which approved a similar bill earlier this year with nearly 50 Republicans in support. A vote in the House could take place as early as next Tuesday.\n\nThe bill was drafted in response to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.

Collins: List of religious groups back amended legislation\n\nIn an effort to show the bill would not destroy religious liberty as some Republicans content, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said the Respect for Marriage Act listed several faith-based organizations who have endorsed the amended measure including: the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Seventh Day Adventist Church, the National Association of Evangelicals, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish congregations.\n\n“The leader of one religious group recently wrote that our legislation as amended sends a strong bipartisan message to Congress, the administration and the public that LGTBQ rights can coexist with religious protections,” she said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nSen. Lankford: Respect for Marriage Act will ‘put issue of religious liberty at great risk’\n\nOklahoma Sen. James Lankford introduced another amendment to the Respect for Marriage Act saying the current version of the legislation does not protect the religious liberty of all Americans.\n\nHe raised concerns that it would result in lawsuits related to what defines a partnership.\n\n“I encourage everyone in this body to ask a very simple question of themselves: Is today about respecting the rights of all or is it about silencing some and respecting others?” he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nOhio GOP Sen. Portman urges colleagues to back same-sex bill\n\nOhio Sen. Rob Portman urged his colleagues to provide bipartisan support to pass the Respect for Marriage Act.\n\nPortman pushed back against conservative critics, saying the bill would protect people of faith as well as same-sex married couples.\n\n“The American people want us to settle this issue and millions of American couples who are married, including many in Ohio, are counting on us to recognize and protect their marriage and give them peace of mind,” he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nRepublicans introduce amendments to weaken Respect for Marriage Act\n\nThree Republican senators introduced amendments to the Respect for Marriage Act Thursday afternoon that seek to protect religious freedoms beyond what the bill allows. Utah Sen. Mike Lee introduced one amendment to minimize threats to religious organizations and individuals.\n\nLee said religious organizations, schools and small businesses would be harmed by the bill which requires states that do not recognize the legitimacy of gay marriage to accept same-sex couples who have legally wedded in another state. He said his amendment would prohibit the federal government from discrimination against these entities based on religious beliefs.\n\n“Rabbis, Imans, pastors should never be forced to perform a marriage contrary to their beliefs,” Lee said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nSame-sex vote will be personal for Sen. Chuck Schumer\n\nFor Chuck Schumer, today’s vote in the Senate to enshrine gay marriage is more than just a legislative victory, it’s a personal triumph as well.\n\nThe Senate majority leader’s youngest daughter, Allison, married her wife in 2018 – a union that once seemed ironclad but that came into this summer when the U.S. Supreme Court reversed precedent on abortion access when it overturned Roe. v. Wade. Other precedents, including the court’s 2015 decision recognizing gay marriage, suddenly seemed at risk as well, Schumer said.\n\n“It’s a scary but necessary acknowledgement that, despite all the progress we’ve made, the constitutional right to same-sex marriage is not even a decade old, and exists only by the virtue of a very narrow 5-4 Supreme Court decision,” he said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “And we all know the court has changed since that decision. As we have already seen this year, what the court has decided in the past can be easily taken away in the future.”\n\nSchumer, sporting the same purple tie he wore at his daughter's wedding, said the first call he'll make once the bill passes will be to Allison, who is expecting a baby this spring.\n\n“I want them to raise their child with all the love and security that every child deserves,” he said, choking up. “And the bill we are passing today will ensure their rights won’t be trampled upon simply because they’re in a same-sex marriage.”\n\n– Ledge King\n\nWhat's happening in Congress this week?:Is a government shutdown coming?

Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems.

Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/27/us/houston-boil-water-notice-schools-closed/index.html", "title": "Houston lifts boil water notice after confirming tap water is safe to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe city of Houston on Tuesday lifted the boil water notice issued two days earlier after water quality testing confirmed that tap water now “meets all regulatory standards and is safe to drink,” the city said.\n\nResidents no longer need to boil water before drinking, cooking or making ice, Houston Public Works said in a news release. The boil water notice was issued Sunday “out of an abundance of caution” after a drop in pressure during a power outage at a purification plant, the release said.\n\n“Houston Water has taken the necessary corrective actions to restore the quality of the water distributed by this public water system used for drinking water or human consumption purposes and has provided (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) with laboratory test results that indicate that the water no longer requires boiling prior to use as of Tuesday, November 29th,” the city wrote.\n\nThe boil water notice had been in place for two days and caused Houston schools to close Monday and Tuesday, the district said.\n\nThe power outage at Houston’s East Water Purification Plant Sunday was caused by a failed transformer and failed backup transformer, Mayor Sylvester Turner said Monday. Turner said two transformers at the power plant went offline around 10:30 a.m., and another followed shortly after.\n\nWhen the plant went offline, sensors indicated the PSI, or pounds per square inch, dropped below 20 in 16 of 21 sensors, Turner added.\n\nCarol Haddock, the director of Houston Public Works, said PSI lower than 20 increases the potential for contaminants to be introduced and noted PSI lower than 20 could also affect plants treating and pumping water.\n\nUnder a boil water notice, water for drinking, cooking, washing hands and faces and brushing teeth should be boiled for at least two minutes before using to destroy all potentially harmful bacteria and other microbes, the city said.\n\nHouston’s drinking and wastewater utility serves about 2.2 million customers per day, according to the utility’s website.\n\nHaddock said there was no indication of contamination and the boil advisory was issued out of an abundance of caution.\n\nTurner said he is calling for an overall review of the water plan systems to prevent future transformer failures. He anticipates the boil advisory will be lifted once sampling is approved by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\n“Earlier today, the water pressure dropped below the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s required minimum of 20 PSI during a power outage at the East Water Purification Plant,” a Sunday news release from the city said.\n\nWater pressure has now been restored.\n\n“We believe the water is safe but based on regulatory requirements when pressure drops below 20 psi we are obligated to issue a boil water notice,” Turner’s office said on Twitter Sunday night.", "authors": ["Chris Boyette Rosa Flores Amir Vera Rebekah Riess", "Chris Boyette", "Rosa Flores", "Amir Vera", "Rebekah Riess"], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/us/jackson-water-system-failing-thursday/index.html", "title": "Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis: Repairs have begun at the water ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs Mississippi’s capital city entered a fourth day on Thursday with little or no water flowing from faucets, authorities were scrambling to get a failing water treatment plant plagued by decades of deferred maintenance back online.\n\nThe problem – which comes on top of a boil-water notice in effect for more than a month – has upended life in the city of roughly 150,000 residents, where schools were shuttered this week, businesses are forced to adapt and people have had to wait in long lines for bottled water they can use to drink, cook or brush their teeth.\n\nAfter days of work on the plant – including Wednesday’s installation of a rental pump – “significant gains” were made by Thursday morning, and water pressure is returning in some areas, city officials said. Areas closer to the plant “are experiencing almost normal pressure,” while areas farther away still have low to no pressure, they said.\n\n“We made some positive gains within the system. We are encouraged,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will head on Friday to Jackson, CNN has learned. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Jackson, which the governor said will let Mississippi tap into critical resources to respond to the crisis.\n\nThe tap water problem came to a head Monday, when river flooding nudged an already-damaged main treatment plant to failure, meaning many of Jackson’s faucets were delivering barely – if any – water. In some cases, the water has been brown.\n\nCity residents already had been told to boil their water since late July because of quality concerns, and the water system has been troubled for years.\n\nWater spews Thursday from a drain outside of Metrocenter Mall in Jackson, Mississippi. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe rental pump installed Wednesday at the treatment plant will help add 4 million more gallons of water a day into the system, authorities said they believe. The state also contracted with outside operators to begin work on critical emergency repairs.\n\nThe treatment plant sends treated water to above-ground tanks spread across the city, and those tanks – which send water to homes and businesses – are supposed to be full for optimal pressure, Gov. Tate Reeves has said. Failure of the plant’s pumps led tank levels to drop.\n\nMore than half the tanks “have begun filling back up,” city officials said Thursday in a news release. The plant’s pressure output increased to 78 pounds per square inch as of Thursday morning, while the goal is 87 psi, the release said.\n\nProper pH-measuring also is a challenge, Reeves said Thursday.\n\n“There have been some challenges with the sensors that are measuring the pH balance of the water coming into the facility,” Reeves said, adding operators at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant have worked with and “seen every pH level and they know exactly what they need to add” to normalize imbalances.\n\n“We think there is a potential for a relatively quick fix on that to get those sensors accurate,” the governor said. Officials are not sure the quick fix will work, but state and local officials want to try it, Reeves said.\n\nBut even as fixes are made, service has fluctuated. “There will be future interruptions … they are not avoidable at this point,” Reeves said Wednesday, adding he also urged residents not to drink the water without boiling it.\n\nLumumba was optimistic Wednesday water service could be restored this week, he said then, but “there is a huge mountain to climb in order to achieve that.”\n\nDaily life upended in Jackson\n\nWhile authorities rush to make repairs, get needed parts and deal with staffing shortages at Jackson’s water plants, the crisis is upending daily life.\n\nResidents are seeing cloudy, discolored water coming out of their faucets and are being told it should be adequate for sanitation purposes. They can’t use the water to drink, cook or wash dishes, but they can shower and wash their hands in it, officials said.\n\n“Please make sure in the shower that your mouth is not open,” Jim Craig, senior deputy and director of health protection at the Mississippi Department of Health, told residents Wednesday, adding pets should also not consume the water.\n\nIt’s not known when residents will no longer have to boil water, and that can’t be assessed until the water pressure returns to normal, the mayor has said.\n\nResidents have endured long lines to get bottled water and non-drinking water at distribution sites operated by the city. Some sites this week ran out of water and turned people away. The state Thursday opened seven new sites for distributing bottled water, in addition to city distribution sites, Reeves said.\n\nNational Guard tankers full of nonpotable water are seen Thursday at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds in Jackson, Mississippi. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nJackson resident Anita Shaw, 63, arrived early Thursday at a site where the Salvation Army was to distribute bottled water – a site the group says ran out of 2,700 cases a day earlier before everyone in a long line could get one.\n\nShaw expressed frustration: Residents have been without clean water service for more than a month; not everyone can afford to keep buying bottles, and lines for free water are long. Water coming from her faucet Thursday was light brown, she told CNN.\n\nShe’s still had to pay her $100 water bill, she said.\n\n“I paid $100 … and can’t use the water,” Shaw said. “What good is paying the water bill when you can’t use the water?”\n\nAll Jackson public schools shifted to virtual learning Tuesday. Jackson State University also shifted to online classes this week and set up portable showers and toilets across campus.\n\n“It’s like we’re living in a nightmare right now,” sophomore Erin Washington told CNN. Another student described seeing brown, smelly water coming out of faucets on campus.\n\nBusinesses – many still trying to recover from Covid-19-related setbacks – are also struggling. Most affected is the city’s hospitality industry, said Jeff Rent, president and CEO at Greater Jackson Chamber Partnership.\n\n“Hotels and restaurants, already on thin margins, either cannot open or they have to make special accommodations including the purchase of ice, water and soft drinks,” Rent said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant is seen Wednesday in Ridgeland, north of Jackson, Mississippi. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nLonger-term fixes are needed\n\nThough Jackson has seen numerous water problems over the years, acute problems have cascaded since late July, when cloudy water was noticed at the city’s O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant. The state imposed a boil-water notice for Jackson, because the cloudiness carries higher chance that the water could contain disease-causing organisms.\n\nAround the same time, the main pumps at O.B. Curtis – the city’s main treatment plant – were severely damaged, forcing the facility to operate on smaller backup pumps, Reeves said this week without elaborating on the damage. The city announced August 9 that the troubled pumps were being pulled offline.\n\nCity officials and Reeves’ office have not responded to CNN’s requests for details about the damage and the causes.\n\nLast week, the governor was warned that Jackson would soon fail to produce running water, Reeves said.\n\nThen, flooding: Heavy rains last week pushed the Pearl River to overflow and flood some Jackson streets, cresting Monday.\n\nIntake water from a reservoir was impacted by the heavy rainfall, creating a chemical imbalance on the conventional treatment side of the plant, Craig said Wednesday. This affected particulate removal, causing that side of the plant to be temporarily shut down and resulting in a loss of water distribution pressure.\n\nEven with the installation Wednesday of the temporary pump, substantial mechanical and electrical issues remain due to deferred maintenance, including various pumps and motors that must be replaced and sludge in basins that has accumulated to levels that are “not acceptable,” Craig said.\n\nStaffing issues have further complicated matters, officials said.\n\nQuad Johnson, center, carries packages of bottled water Wednesday to cars at a water distribution site at Grove Park Community Center in Jackson, Mississippi.

We have a large number of rural water associations that run their own water system.

Crews “are working persistently to restore the pressure, to refill the tanks across the city,” Lumumba said.\n\nGov. Tate Reeves tweeted Wednesday that an emergency rental pump that will pump an additional 4 million gallons of water is being installed at Jackson’s water facility.\n\n“More to be done, but the work is happening at an incredible pace!,” Reeves tweeted.\n\nThe governor also declared an emergency and activated the National Guard to help distribute bottled water, and said he sent resources for urgent repairs and maintenance at the plant. Some service already has improved, and truckloads of water are coming for distribution to the public, officials said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who signed a major disaster declaration Tuesday triggering assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, spoke to Lumumba on Wednesday to discuss emergency efforts, the White House said.\n\nLumumba said Wednesday that he spoke extensively with Biden and separately with Harris about the situation in Jackson.\n\n“Both assured me that the eyes of Washington are watching the city of Jackson. They wanted us to know that we should expect the full arm of support from the federal government in every way that they possibly can,” mayor said. “And they assured me their support was going to be demonstrated through long-range and long-term efforts through the EPA.”\n\nCars line up as water is distributed at New Jerusalem Church in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 31.

Italian restaurant and bar and Sal and Mookie’s New York Pizza and Ice Cream Shop, told CNN.\n\nAll three businesses are owned by the management company Mangia Bene Restaurant Management Group Inc.\n\nBlumenthal said the restaurants were able to recover after Covid-19, but the current water crisis has brought on similar staffing issues. Tanya Burns, who has managed BRAVO! for the last 12 years, told CNN that she has seen a 10% to 20% decrease in foot traffic since the boiling water advisory started four weeks ago.\n\n“It feels like Covid to me with the way things are going,” Blumenthal said. “We had to let all of our staff go after Covid and now we’re not letting them go but we’re worried they’ll jump ship and go to another county where they can make money.”\n\nThe most affected business sector is the city’s hospitality industry, said Jeff Rent, president and CEO at Greater Jackson Chamber Partnership.\n\n“Hotels and restaurants, already on thin margins, either cannot open or they have to make special accommodations including the purchase of ice, water and soft drinks,” Rent said.\n\nChairs are seen on tables at Brent's Drugs diner in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 31.

At a distribution event Tuesday at Hawkins Field Airport, residents waited in a line more than a mile long – and some were turned away when the site ran out of its 700 cases of water in just two hours.\n\nSome stores ran thin of supplies. Jackson resident Jeraldine Watts was able to snag some of the last water bottle cases at a grocery store Monday, she told CNN. She and her family have been using bottled or boiled tap water for everything, including cooking and washing dishes.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” Watts said, “and it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to Flint, Michigan, which was hit with a water crisis around 2015 when tainted drinking water containing lead and other toxins was detected in homes and residents reported children suffering from mysterious illnesses.\n\nCorean Wheeler, who picked up a case of water at a local church, said she feels “disenfranchised” by the city’s water crisis.\n\n“You don’t even want to wash your hands in this water,” said Wheeler, 72. “You can’t drink it, you can’t cook with it, you can’t even give it to your pet. We are constantly paying water bills and we can’t use the water. We feel like we are living in a third world country in America and that’s kind of bad.”\n\nJackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center said air conditioning at one facility is not functioning properly because of low water pressure, and portable restrooms are being used at other facilities.\n\nWater crisis interrupts campus life at JSU\n\nAt Jackson State University, there is “low to no water pressure at all campus locations,” and water is being delivered to students, officials said. The university’s head football coach, Deion Sanders, said its football program is in “crisis mode.”\n\nSophomore Erin Washington told CNN, “It’s like we’re living in a nightmare right now.” Washington has already booked her flight home to Chicago.\n\n“The water would be brown and kind of smell like sewage water,” said JSU freshman Jaylyn Clarke, who decided to go back home to New Orleans until the water situation is resolved.\n\nThe university is working to make provisions for the 2,000 students who live on campus, university president Thomas K. Hudson told CNN on Wednesday. Portable showers and toilets have been set up across campus and classes were virtual for the week.\n\nHudson said Jackson State has a stash of drinking water that it keeps for emergencies. The university is also bringing in clean water to keep the chillers operating for air conditioning in the dorms, Hudson said.\n\n“It’s their frustration that I’m concerned about,” Hudson said. “It’s the fact that this is interrupting their learning. So what we try to do is really focus on how we can best meet their needs.”\n\nWhat happened, and what officials say is being done\n\nThough Jackson has seen numerous water issues over the years, acute problems cascaded since at least late July, when the state imposed a boil-water notice for Jackson after high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, were noticed at the city’s O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant. The cloudiness carries higher chances that the water could contain disease-causing organisms, the city said.\n\nAround the same time, the main pumps at O.B.

The city announced August 9 that the troubled pumps were being pulled offline.\n\nA security guard is seen outside of O.B. Curtis Water Plant on August 31. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve.”\n\nThen, flooding: Heavy rains last week pushed the Pearl River to overflow and flood some Jackson streets, cresting Monday.\n\nO.B. Curtis received additional water from a reservoir because of the flooding, and that changed the way the plant treated the water, causing the plant to produce even less than it was, and that severely lowered the water pressure across the city, Lumumba said Monday.\n\nSome improvements have been made at the plant, but more is needed, state officials have said.\n\nOn Tuesday, the plant was pumping about 30 million gallons of a day; it is rated to pump about 50 million gallons a day, Jim Craig, director of health protection at the state health department, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nReeves previewed the installation Tuesday night, saying a rented pump “will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons” more into the system.\n\n“That is progress and will help,” Reeves said Tuesday. It wasn’t immediately clear how long the installation would take or how soon it could impact the city’s water flow.\n\nReeves has said the state would split the cost of emergency repairs with the city.\n\nOn Wednesday, an additional pump was installed at the plant, Lumumba said. Despite some issues with water pressure – which is measured in pounds per square inch (psi) – on Tuesday night, the mayor said the city expects water pressure to increase Wednesday night.\n\n“The goal is to get psi on the surface system to 87psi,” Lumumba said, explaining the pressure at midnight was 40psi.\n\nThe mayor is still asking residents to continue boiling water.\n\n“It is safe to take baths in, it is safe to wash your hands. However, if you are drinking or cooking with it, we ask you to boil that water. If you’re washing the dishes, we ask that you boil the water in that circumstance to make certain that it is safe for you,” he said.\n\nAn aerial view of the O.B. Curtis Water Plant on August 31.

Residents are asked to bring a container, such as a garbage can or a cooler to store the water. This is not water to be consumed, this is the water for sanitary needs of flushing toilets and things of that nature,” the mayor said.\n\nBeginning Thursday, seven mega distribution sites with 36 truckloads of water will be available each a day for the public, Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said Tuesday.\n\nCorporations like Anheuser-Busch, Walmart and Save A Lot, as well as volunteer organizations are also donating water to the city, McCraney added.\n\nThe city is also providing flushing water, Jackson City Councilman Aaron Banks told CNN.\n\n“One of the first things that we realized is that people need to be able to flush, because that becomes a problem as far as making sure that people have that quality of life that they need,” he said.\n\n“At the end of the day, we need a fix and the same attention that was given to Flint, Michigan, we need that same attention given to Jackson,” Banks said.\n\nA local church is also helping to distribute water in the meantime. At New Jerusalem Church in southwest Jackson, Malcolm Pickett was seen Wednesday loading cases of water from a trailer into trunks and backseats. He announced on social media earlier he’d be giving out water at the church led by his father Pastor Dwayne K. Pickett.\n\n“They are scared to use the water and that’s the biggest thing,” Malcolm Pickett said. “We are all about helping people.”\n\nMalcolm Pickett loads water into a resident's car outside of New Jerusalem Church in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 31. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nAt Jackson State, some students are raising money to buy water for Jackson residents in need, and have created a hotline that those residents can call to ask for help.\n\nMaise Brown, 20, a junior at Jackson State, organized the group of about 20 students, called Mississippi Student Water Crisis Advocacy Team. The group launched a social media campaign Tuesday to raise money and to publicize the hotline.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the group raised about $2,000 and received about 10 calls asking for help.\n\n“We had disabled residents calling us … for help,” Brown said. “We also had people who live outside the city call us and ask us to help their elderly parents.”\n\nThe group plans to knock on the doors of homes, hoping to reach people who might not see its social media campaign, Brown said.\n\nLong-standing issues at troubled water system\n\nJackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\nIn early 2020, the Jackson water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection, which found the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites.\n\nIn February 2021, a severe winter storm hit, freezing and bursting pipes and leaving many residents without water for a month.\n\n“Since that time, there has not been a month where we have not experienced no-flow to low-flow in certain areas in south Jackson, and so it’s very frustrating,” Banks, the city councilman, told CNN.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA also recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/09/05/what-you-need-to-know-jackson-ms-water-pressure-stabilizes/65473809007/", "title": "What Jackson residents need to know as water pressure stabilizes", "text": "One week after most people in Jackson lost access to reliable running water, they now have it back.\n\nThat said, a number of questions are still on the minds of residents, including when the water will be safe to drink.\n\nWhen will the boil-water notice end?\n\nState and local leaders have been hesitant to provide a timeline for an end to the boil-water notice, but both Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and Gov. Tate Reeves have said it will likely happen in the coming days.\n\nMore:Jackson's boil water notice could end soon, governor says amid ongoing tension with city\n\n\"I have found that in disasters such as this it is better for leaders to under-promise and overdeliver,\" Reeves said at a news conference Monday. \"I think you will be able to measure that in days, not months or weeks.\"\n\nIn order for the boil-water notice to end, the city will need to see two consecutive days of clean test results from the 120 sampling points located throughout the city. Testing was put on pause when heavy rain moved through Jackson two weeks ago, and has not resumed due to the water pressure issues. At the news conference Monday, Reeves and Mississippi State Department of Health Director of Health Protection Jim Craig said that investigative testing at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant would begin that day, and if those tests went well they would quickly move on to the multi-site testing necessary to end the boil-water notice.\n\nOne of the causes of the boil-water notice is the use of a lime slurry at the Curtis plant. Prior to the water pressure dropping, Lumumba had repeatedly said it was the culprit behind the high turbidity levels in the drinking water. He had said it would be about a year before the plant could switch to solid soda ash, a different treatment method that would cause less turbidity.\n\nCraig said Monday that the state has been able to acquire liquid soda ash, and they hope to be able to use that at the plant well before the timeline the mayor had previously given. The use of soda ash could reduce the chance of future boil-water notices.\n\n\"We may be able to move the mayor's timeline up,\" Craig said.\n\nWill the water be safe once the boil water notice ends?\n\nReeves gave a very simple answer to that question.\n\n\"Yes,\" Reeves said Monday, before calling up Craig to give information.\n\nMany residents are worried that even if there is not high turbidity or dangerous bacteria in the city's water, both of which can cause boil-water notices, it still may not be safe. A Clarion Ledgerinvestigation in 2021 found evidence of lead in the city's drinking water. Despite this, Reeves, Lumumba and Craig have all said they trust the city's water when it is not under a boil-water notice. Lumumba has said he will drink it.\n\nCraig said Monday that some of the investigative testing that the health department does will go beyond looking at bacteria and turbidity.\n\nWhat can be done with the water right now?\n\nJackson remains under the same boil-water notice it has been dealing with for over a month.\n\nResidents are cautioned not to drink, brush your teeth, make ice, cook or wash dishes with tap water unless it has first been boiled for at least one minute. Using an at-home dishwasher is not recommended either.\n\nWhat can be done, now that water pressure is high enough across the city, is bathing, showering, washing hands and cleaning laundry. Those actions are all safe as long as no tap water is swallowed, according to the city.\n\nWhere can you go to get bottled water?\n\nThe city has been distributing bottled water at various sites since the boil-water notice first began. The state began distributing water last week, after activating the national guard, and has distributed about 5 million bottles of water in that time, Reeves said Monday. Faith-based groups and charities have also been organizing a number of bottled water distribution sites.\n\nSome of the state-run distribution sites will be closing tomorrow because they were located at schools. Jackson Public Schools are returning to in-person instruction Tuesday after the restoration of water pressure and efforts from charities to provide them with water. The manpower and equipment that had been used at those schools will be redirected to other distribution sites, which will see their capacities expand.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the state-run water distribution sites will be:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/us/jackson-mississippi-water-crisis-epa-investigation/index.html", "title": "Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis: The EPA is investigating the water ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency is investigating the water crisis that has affected the roughly 150,000 residents of Jackson, Mississippi, who remain under a boil-water advisory.\n\n“I can confirm that the EPA Office of Inspector General began sending personnel to Jackson to collect data and conduct interviews,” Jennifer Kaplan, a spokesperson for the office, told CNN Sunday. Similar investigations into the tainted water crisis in Flint, Michigan, led to criminal charges and a slew of lawsuits.\n\nWeeks after the city’s main water treatment plant began failing, leaving Jackson residents without drinking water, water pressure has been restored. But the liquid coming out of taps is still unsafe to drink.\n\n“There are still concerns around the consumption of that water,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nThe city’s boil-water advisory, issued more than six weeks ago, means tap water must be boiled before being used to drink, cook, make ice, wash dishes or brush teeth. On Friday, Mississippi Today reporter Molly Minta posted a video of dark brown water she said was flowing from the tap in her Jackson home.\n\nThe current acute crisis began when heavy rain caused the Pearl River to flood, affecting treatment processes after pumps at the main water treatment facility were already damaged. Residents had to line up for hours to get cases of water for drinking, cooking and even flushing their toilets.\n\nThe city’s water problems go back years, and boil-water advisories have become almost a fact of life in Mississippi’s capital. In early 2020, the system failed an EPA inspection, which found the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites.\n\nLast year, many residents were without water for a month after pipes froze and burst during a February storm.\n\nThe present boil-water advisory was issued in late July after cloudy water at the O.B. Curtis plant was blamed on high levels of the mineral manganese, “combined with the use of lime,” the city said. In order for the advisory to be lifted, water pressure has to be sustained, and the city needs “two rounds of clear samples,” it said in an update Monday.\n\n“There must be two consecutive days of clear testing (120 samples both days),” Mississippi State Department of Health spokesperson Liz Sharlot told CNN in an email.\n\nThe samples are pulled by the EPA, the Department of Environmental Quality, or the city, she said. A certified lab then runs the tests.\n\n“Investigatory sampling will continue today to monitor water quality,” the mayor said at a news conference Monday. “The distribution system is not ready for full sampling to clear the boil water notice.”\n\n“There is some optimism around those investigatory samples,” he said. “We are optimistic that we’re looking at a matter of days, not weeks, before we can expect the boil-water notice to be lifted.”\n\nAnother setback\n\nOne of two permanent pumps that had been repaired and reinstalled Saturday was found to need more repair, the mayor said Monday.\n\n“This does not affect current plant input,” the city said in an update Monday.\n\nBoth defective raw water pumps are expected to be “coming on site around the same time,” the mayor said, though it’s unknown when that will be.\n\nOutside teams from South Carolina, Michigan and Maryland are on site, helping the plant’s staff, the mayor said, and teams from Ohio will arrive Monday.\n\nSystemic problems\n\nJackson’s water problems are largely systemic – old and leaky pipes, malfunctions at treatment plants and insufficient money to fix the problems, according to a report by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting that the Clarion Ledger newspaper published in January.\n\nStaffing at the plant also has been a problem. EPA staff found during a March visit that the city did not have adequate staffing for the system, leading to routine and preventative maintenance not being carried out.\n\nThe city was allocated some $40 million for its water system from the American Rescue Plan, but Lumumba said Sunday that it had received it in tranches, with the “lion’s share” going toward repairing and replacing critical infrastructure like water lines and treatment facilities. Eight million dollars of the American Rescue Plan money was spent on one pipe alone, he said.\n\nThe mayor said last year the city needs “literally more than a billion dollars to replace our entire system.”", "authors": ["Theresa Waldrop"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/11/16/city-jackson-under-boil-water-notice-public-schools-go-virtual/8636430002/", "title": "City of Jackson under boil water notice; 10 public schools go virtual", "text": "After issuing a city-wide boil water order the same day the Environmental Protection Agency was in town to tout the newly passed federal infrastructure bill, Jackson officials said it could be days before the water is safe to drink from taps.\n\nAbout 15,000 residents and businesses, mostly located in south and west Jackson, were without water Monday and early Tuesday, city officials said.

He warned, though, that water pressure levels would vary based on location and other factors.\n\nAt the height of the emergency, Meszaros said, the city was at risk of losing all water service last week had it not been for facilities in a vast area served by what he called a “central pressure district” fed by two main plants. As it was, large portions of the city suffered one or more days of water loss.\n\n“It was pretty dire,” Meszaros told the American-Statesman. “It could have gotten worse, but the central system kept going and gave us a platform to rebuild from.”\n\nExcept for bursting pipes in individual homes, water had not initially been a critical factor in last week’s winter storm that left millions across Texas — and hundreds of thousands in Austin — without power. But by midweek, faucets began to run dry due to widespread system failures, and officials and residents realized that the icy weather had delivered a second brutal punch.\n\nMore:Can I use my dishwasher during a boil-water notice? And other frequently asked questions\n\nIn Austin, the Ullrich Water Treatment Plant, the city’s main plant, suffered a loss of power Thursday because of what Meszaros said was a “transformer issue.”\n\nAnd it happened as the city’s reservoir storage dipped to 10 million gallons, an amount so low that accurate instrument reading was difficult as pipes ruptured throughout the system.\n\nBy Sunday, that amount had returned to 72 million gallons, but officials say reservoirs must hold 100 million gallons before they can begin lifting boil water notices.\n\nWater outages remained widespread across the state Sunday as thousands of increasingly desperate people sought water at publicly available stations in cities and small towns.\n\nSarah Schlessinger, executive director of the Texas Water Foundation, a nonprofit created to raise awareness of the need for water, said what happened highlights the connection between energy and water — an issue the public might not have realized until now.\n\n“I don’t know that Texas has ever seen this biggest collective experience of water insecurity,” she said. “Having all of your major cities at one time with both a supply and quality issue simultaneously really drives home the significance of water security. I don’t know if that is something Texas has ever experienced before but certainly needs to be thinking about in terms of its future.”\n\nOn Sunday, a map showed that large swaths of Austin still had no water, including parts of North and Northwest Austin and Southwest Austin. Other parts of the city, including much of Central and South Austin, had at least some flow.\n\nMuch of it is based on physics, Meszaros said, and how water travels based on elevation.\n\n“There are a lot of conspiracies out there that we are pushing buttons of who got water and who didn’t,” he said. “They aren’t true.”\n\nMore:How to apply for Texas FEMA assistance, what you need to know\n\nAustin officials said that even though the city continued producing about 200 million gallons of water per day last week, much of it did not travel through the system because of broken water mains and busted private pipes that interrupted the flow.\n\nMeszaros said Sunday that it could take a couple of days for pressure to build up systemwide, and that areas at higher elevations, including Circle C, might have low pressure for longer as the pressure must push water to higher points.\n\n“It will start for some people as a trickle and build up hour by hour,” he said.\n\nHe said he expects that the need to boil water will subside as more pressure comes into the system, and that the requirement probably will be lifted in stages as more water districts receive adequate pressure.\n\nMeszaros said that the system has never faced such a widespread outage and he hopes it can be avoided in years to come.\n\n“We will have water main breaks in neighborhoods, and a few hundred customers may go without water for a few hours,” he said. “But the term ‘water outage’ hasn’t been in our vocabulary until now.”\n\nIn the meantime, the city and Travis County enacted bans on car washing and other outdoor water uses, such as landscape watering and filling pools and spas.

All that water demand needs to continue to occur and every time we have to do some maintenance then we have to offset some of that,” Craig explained.\n\nThe city of roughly 150,000 residents had been under a boil-water notice since July 30 – and then flooding caused by heavy rainfall last weekend led to a chemical imbalance at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.\n\nSince then, the lives of Jackson’s residents have been upended, subjecting them to wait in long lines under a beaming sun in sweltering heat for bottled water they can use to drink, cook or brush their teeth.

It was reduced to 77.2 PSI later in the day, he said.\n\nThe reduction means areas farther from the plant and at higher elevations may still experience low to no water pressure, according to a news release from the city.

Curtis Water Treatment Plant for a few hours.\n\n“It’s like fixing the airplane while you’re still flying. You have to be very careful how you fix it so that you stay flying,” he said. “It’s the same thing as we’re trying to produce water.

Tate Reeves said.\n\nEarlier, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference the city has had “two consecutive days of gains.” Lumumba said the signs of recovery don’t “mean by any stretch that all residents have pressure or water.”\n\nOne of the challenges as the city reestablishes water pressure is the possibility of pipes bursting.\n\n“We know that we have brittle pipes, we have aged pipes, just as our water treatment facilities are aged,” he said.\n\nThe mayor also explained the process before the boil water notice can be lifted, saying, “Once pressure is restored to all residents, then the next stage of that process is that the health department gives the OK, gives the go ahead to start the testing process.\n\n“Once that testing process begins, there are about 120 sites that they begin to take samples from, and you have to have two consecutive days of clear samples before the boil water notice can be lifted.”\n\nWhat led to this week’s outage\n\nThe main pumps at Jackson’s O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant around late July were severely damaged, forcing the facility to operate on smaller backup pumps, the governor said this week, without elaborating on the damage, which city officials also have not detailed.\n\nThe city announced August 9 the troubled pumps were being pulled offline.\n\nThen last week, the governor was warned Jackson would soon fail to produce running water, Reeves said.\n\nAnd then came the flooding: Heavy rains last week pushed the Pearl River to overflow, cresting Monday, and to flood some Jackson streets – while also impacting intake water at a reservoir that feeds the drinking water treatment plant.\n\nA chemical imbalance was created on the conventional treatment side of the plant, Craig said Wednesday.\n\nIt affected particulate removal, causing a side of the plant to be temporarily shut down and resulting in a loss of water distribution pressure, he said.\n\nStaffing problems have further complicated matters, officials said.\n\nA tanker leaves O.B. Curtis Water Plant on Wednesday. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nWhat needs to be done to fix it\n\nA temporary rented pump was installed Wednesday at the plant, and “significant” gains were made by Thursday, the city said, with workers making a “series of repairs and equipment adjustments.”\n\nAs of Thursday, water pressure had been restored to some residents, with those close to the plant having almost normal pressure, the city said. Those farther away and at higher elevations still had little to no pressure.\n\nOn Friday, the pumping pressure at the Curtis treatment plant fell from 85 pounds per square inch to 77.2, Craig said.\n\nA boil-water advisory went into effect in late July – well before Monday’s service disruptions – after cloudy water at the O.B. Curtis plant was blamed on high levels of the mineral manganese, “combined with the use of lime,” the city said. That order has yet to be lifted.\n\nContractors also were making assessments Thursday, according to the city update, and the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers were at the site.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell in Jackson on Friday. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for the city, and it will allow Mississippi to tap into critical resources to respond to the crisis, Reeves said.\n\nHow people are coping without running water\n\nResidents have understandably been angry and frustrated, with no water to drink or brush their teeth or, in many cases, even flush toilets.\n\nSome waited hours in long lines this week for a case of bottled water, only to be turned away when the supply ran out.\n\nJeraldine Watts, 86, was in a line that stretched for 2 miles, she told CNN.\n\nWatts, who was born and raised in Jackson and lives with her daughter and granddaughter, said they have to use bottled or boiled water for everything – even to cook and wash dishes.\n\n“We are constantly paying water bills, and we can’t use the water,” Jackson resident Corean Wheeler said. “We feel like we are living in a third world country in America, and that’s kind of bad.”\n\nSchools switched to virtual learning as of Tuesday, and a medical center was without air conditioning because of a lack of water pressure to feed its chillers, the University of Mississippi Medical Center said Tuesday.\n\nThe governor declared an emergency, and the National Guard was deployed to help distribute water. On Thursday, the state opened seven distribution sites, adding to those operated by the city.\n\nResidents who were getting discolored water from their taps were told it should be used for showering or washing hands only and not for drinking or cooking.\n\n“Please make sure in the shower that your mouth is not open,” Craig told residents.\n\nCity water system problems go back years\n\nAn unreliable water supply is nothing new to Jacksonians. The city’s water system in early 2020 failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection, which found the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites.\n\nResidents were without water for a month when pipes froze and burst during a 2021 winter storm. And the late July boil-water advisory remains in effect.\n\nThe problems are largely systemic – old and leaky pipes, malfunctions at treatment plants and insufficient money to fix the problems, according to a report by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting that the Clarion Ledger published in January.\n\nStaffing at the plant also has been a problem, according to Reeves and the mayor.\n\n“This is something that has been occurring for years, but sometimes it takes these catastrophes to make sure that this disaster comes to light,” Mississippi state Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr., of Jackson, told CNN this week.\n\nThe EPA and the city entered into an agreement last year to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” And that agency recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, though $2 billion is needed for the work, the mayor has said.\n\nAdvocates have pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of Jackson’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources to address them. About 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data.\n\nCities like Jackson suffer the “benign neglect” of those in power, Catherine Coleman Flowers, founder of the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice, told CNN in April. “I am concerned that it’s just another symbol of what I call one of the relatives of the Confederacy where communities that need help are not given the help, especially if they’re marginalized or communities of color.”", "authors": ["Theresa Waldrop"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}]}

Just one point separates them from fourth-place Canada. The top three teams in CONCACAF — currently led by Mexico with 11 points — qualify for the World Cup with the No. 4 team entering a one-game playoff against an as-yet-undetermined opponent from another region.\n\nIn 2017 when the U.S. failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, even though they lost to Trinidad & Tobago in their final game, it was the 2-0 home loss to Costa Rica that was seen as the decisive factor in the USMNT missing out on soccer’s biggest stage for the first time since 1986.\n\nThe recipe for making the World Cup is to win your home games and draw on the road. Not getting a point in Panama on Sunday has amplified the pressure for a young, still relatively inexperienced American squad to get all three points against Costa Rica, or coach Gregg Berhalter and his team will have to sweat through the final eight games of qualification having not yet played Mexico.\n\n“I think we came up short in a number of areas,” Berhalter said after the loss. “Now it’s about rebounding, focusing on the game on Wednesday in Columbus, and having a positive game there and getting three points.”\n\nAfter avoiding a disastrous scenario last qualifying cycle by coming back at Honduras to win 4-1, ending the first three games with five points instead of two, the USMNT started this international window with a solid 2-0 win against Jamaica in Austin, Texas.\n\nBerhalter made seven changes to his lineup at Panama mostly due to a quick turnaround between games, but two of which he was also forced to make due to COVID-19 restrictions for players on English clubs. That backfired.\n\nMidfielder Tyler Adams, winger Brenden Aaronson and forward Ricardo Pepi entered as subs in the second half. Outside back Sergino Dest and center back Miles Robinson didn’t play.\n\nThe Americans had to survive several threatening moments from Panama, and they struggled mightily to connect passes through the midfield and generate scoring opportunities. The Americans had no shots on goal to Panama’s four. The five overall shots for the U.S. were the fewest in 28 World Cup qualifying games since 2013.\n\n“We were really poor with our passing and some of our movement,” Berhalter said. “We performed below the expectations we had for ourselves.”\n\nCosta Rica isn’t as strong as the team that qualified for the 2018 World Cup, and Berhalter will likely have the best of the group that started against Jamaica start again in this important game. Berhalter said Tuesday that midfielder Weston McKennie is progressing, but stopped short of saying he would play. McKennie's status is in question because Berhalter had decided against having him travel to Panama for precautionary reasons after the 23-year-old developed quad soreness.\n\nThe Americans are still in a decent position to qualify. A win would give the U.S. a bullish outlook. A draw — and especially a loss — at home to Costa Rica would throw qualification from likely to questionable. Los Ticos, meanwhile, are two points back of the Americans after a comeback 2-1 win against El Salvador on Sunday.\n\nAs it was when it hosted four straight Dos-a-Cero qualifying matches against Mexico, Columbus is being relied upon to help the Americans get back on track toward a return to the World Cup.\n\njmyers@dispatch.com\n\n@_jcmyers\n\nCosta Rica vs. U.S.\n\nGet more Columbus Crew news by listening to our podcasts", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/football/netherlands-us-qatar-world-cup-christian-pulisic-cody-gakpo-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Netherlands vs. US: Two exciting young teams go head-to-head for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe round of 16 match on Saturday between the US Men’s National Team and the Netherlands is one of the more intriguing clashes in the first knockout round of Qatar 2022.\n\nThough the bookmakers have the Netherlands as the odds-on favorite, this match-up is certainly closer than that and both teams will feel confident of booking a place in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe USMNT gave England real trouble in its group stage match and will likely have come out of that game the more disappointed of the two teams with the 0-0 draw, while a solid win over Iran in a high-stakes, winner-takes-all match showed that Gregg Berhalter’s men can perform under intense pressure.\n\nWith the Netherlands ranked eighth in FIFA’s world rankings – eight places above the US – and boasting world renowned talents like Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk and Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong and Memphis Depay, Saturday’s match will be a tough one for the US.\n\nCan Berhalter’s men reach the last eight for the first time since 2002? CNN Sport takes a look.\n\nUSMNT’s key threat\n\nOf course, the main concern for the US is the fitness of star man Christian Pulisic.\n\nThe Chelsea forward suffered what he called a pelvic contusion while scoring the winner in its crunch match against Iran, but head coach Berhalter said Friday that Pulisic is on track to play on Saturday.\n\nPulisic, dubbed “Captain America” by some US fans, told reporters Thursday that he “will do everything in my power to work with this medical team and make sure that I can play.”\n\nFortunately, for US fans, the USMNT tweeted from its official account late on Friday that Pulisic “has been cleared to play” in the win-or-go-home match against the Dutch.\n\n‘Anything can happen’\n\nThe performance against Iran – a gritty but deserved 1-0 win – will have been incredibly pleasing to Berhalter, in particular as it came against the backdrop of much off-field tension in the buildup.\n\nBerhalter and captain Tyler Adams faced some tough questions from Iranian journalists in a fiery pre-match press conference, fending off accusations of hypocrisy and disrespect.\n\nThat his team was able to focus and deliver when it mattered most will give Berhalter and US fans huge confidence going into Saturday’s match.\n\n“From here, anything can happen,” Berhalter said ahead of the match. “It’s a great opportunity, but it’s not something that we’re going in thinking it’s an honor. We deserve to be in the position we’re in and we want to keep it that way.”\n\nWhile Pulisic is undoubtedly the star of the USMNT, captain Adams has been the team’s engine and heartbeat.\n\nThe Leeds midfielder has shown poise both on and off the pitch, drawing praise for his composure and eloquence in responding to those questions from Iranian journalists.\n\nBerhalter, whose team is yet to concede a goal from open play at this World Cup, heaped praise on his “general” following the win against Iran.\n\n“Tyler fits a very specific role,” Berhalter said. “He is the general, he is the strategist. He’s the guy that goes out there and leads by example. When he talks, people listen.”\n\nThe opponent\n\nIf the US can perform as it did against England and for much of the game against Iran, a place in a first World Cup quarterfinal since 2002 beckons.\n\nThe USMNT will be confident against a Netherlands side that hasn’t quite got it together in Qatar.\n\nLouis van Gaal’s side has failed to impress so far, earning a late win against Senegal thanks to two goalkeeping errors from Édouard Mendy and only tallied a point against Ecuador in a game it was fortunate not to lose.\n\nThe team’s 2-0 win over Qatar was a more convincing performance, but even that comes with the caveat of the Qataris being poor at this tournament.\n\nCody Gakpo has been one of the stars of Qatar 2022. Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters\n\nWhat the coach said\n\nFew would have expected the Netherlands to be a serious contender at this World Cup and it will pleasing to head coach van Gaal, a manager known for his pragmatism, that his side qualified top of Group A despite not yet clicking as a team.\n\nThe 71-year-old, currently in his third spell in charge of the Dutch national team, hit back against claims from one reporter that his team’s performance against Qatar had been “terribly boring” and, in his pre-match press conference for the quarterfinals, lauded a “fanatical and sharp” US team.\n\n“I know from experience that matches against countries such as the United States and Australia, who we encountered at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, are always very difficult,” van Gaal said Thursday.\n\n“They work very hard and they’re good on the ball.\n\n“The USA has demonstrated that it has an excellent team, I would even say one of the best teams, a team that is fine-tuned, [but] it’s nothing we can’t overcome,” van Gaal added Friday, per Reuters.\n\n“The USA that is a very energetic squad, they have physically strong players and that is tough for any opponent, and you can tell from their results, but we will do everything we can to win and to beat USA, that’s it.”\n\nNetherlands’ key threat\n\nThe Netherlands mustered just eight shots on target in its three group stage matches but was clinical in scoring five goals, thanks largely to star youngster Cody Gakpo.\n\nThe 23-year-old has likely greatly increased his transfer value this tournament, much to the delight of Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, scoring his three goals with his right foot, left foot and head to lead the 2022 World Cup golden boot race alongside Kylian Mbappé, Marcus Rashford, Álvaro Morata and Enner Valencia.\n\nReports suggest that Manchester United are among the clubs already chasing Gakpo’s signature following the World Cup and fellow Dutch star van Dijk said the winger’s potential could see him “go to the moon and back.”\n\n“He is a very good player and a good boy too,” the Liverpool defender said. “What we see in training is what you see on the pitch. There is still so much potential and I hope he can carry on showing it for us. We are very happy with him.\n\nVan Gaal added: “Things can change, but Cody has everything it takes to become a star. He has a wonderful personality to become a star player because he is open minded to anything and everything.”\n\nThis team struggled against an athletic Ecuador team, a threat the USA will also pose, and the Netherlands will need Gakpo at his best – along with van Dijk and midfielder de Jong – to progress past a stern test in the Americans.\n\nWhen and where\n\n10 a.m. ET at the Khalifa International Stadium.\n\nHow to watch\n\nUS: Fox Sports\n\nUK: BBC or ITV\n\nAustralia: SBS\n\nBrazil: SportTV\n\nGermany: ARD, ZDF, Deutsche Telekom\n\nCanada: Bell Media\n\nSouth Africa: SABC", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2022/01/27/usmnt-el-salvador-world-cup-concacaf-qualifier-antonee-robinson-goal/9248111002/", "title": "United States men's national soccer team defeats El Salvador in ...", "text": "Tied at zero through 45 minutes with no shots on goal, there wasn’t a single United States men’s national team fan not thinking, “oh no, here we go again.” A draw at home against less-talented El Salvador would have elevated the stakes for the remaining two games this CONCACAF World Cup qualifying window.\n\nThen came Antonee Robinson.\n\nSimilar to his second-half equalizer in the USMNT’s third qualifier last September in Honduras, Robinson scored on a second-chance opportunity to give the Americans the go-ahead goal in the 52nd minute and kept them well positioned to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar in November.\n\nWinger Tim Weah had his initial shot stopped by goalkeeper Mario Gonzalez. The ball came down to striker Jesús Ferreira in the middle of the box and he headed the ball over to Robinson, who smashed the ball into the lower right corner before celebrating with an emphatic cartwheel and backflip.\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW:Stay up to date with our sports newsletter\n\nFollow every match: Live World Cup scores\n\nThe USMNT was far from at the top of its game but was good enough to defeat El Salvador 1-0 at Lower.com Field in the ninth of 14 World Cup qualifiers. The U.S. produced a few chances in the first half but was able to penetrate the El Salvador back line much more in the second half.\n\n\"It wasn't the prettiest game,\" Robinson said. \"There were times we played good football, times when we just had to kind of dig out chances we didn't put away, but we got the win. We're one step closer to our goal of qualifying for the World Cup.\"\n\nUSMNT coach Gregg Berhalter said his team could have done a better job pressing on defense and finishing chances, but was encouraged that they created some early opportunities.\n\n\"I wouldn't say this was our best game. We didn't finish enough of our chances that we had,\" Berhalter said. \"But regarding the goals coming in the first or second half, we had enough chances in the first half to score goals. That's what I'm happy with.\"\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie was dominant through 90 minutes, often propelling the Americans into the attack with excellent through balls and his ability to escape pressure when hounded by El Salvador defenders.\n\nIn his first start with the national team since being injured against Honduras in early September, playmaker Christian Pulisic did not have much of an impact on the game. He had a quality chance inside the first 20 minutes that was blocked at the edge of the box, but Pulisic often dribbled into multiple defenders and gave away the ball far too many times.\n\nPulisic was the first player taken off the field for substitute Brendan Aaronson in the 64th minute. Berhalter said he liked Pulisic's energy, at the same time admitted the U.S. needs to find ways to get him in more scoring positions.\n\n\"It's just about him finding his top form and really finding ways to get him in front of goal because that's really where he shines,\" Berhalter said. \"When he's in front of the penalty box is when he does his best work.\"\n\nThe U.S. controlled possession throughout and combined well in the middle of the field, but ultimately struggled to finish their chances.\n\nIn the first half, the U.S. had 65% possession, completed 92.2% of its passes and had eight chances but couldn’t put a shot on frame. The omission of Ricardo Pepi in favor of Ferreira from the starting lineup left the U.S. without a target forward on crosses, but crossing was mostly poor throughout the opening 45 minutes.\n\nThe USMNT had its best chance of the first half in the 19th minute. On a cross from right back Sergiño Dest, Weah flicked the ball to the back post where Ferreira had an open net from about 6 yards out but missed the net high.\n\nEl Salvador had its best chance in the 28th minute when midfielder Alex Roldan had an open shot at the top of the box just to the right of the semicircle, but he dragged it left of a diving Matt Turner.\n\nOnce Robinson finished his opportunity, the USMNT dominated the rest of the match and killed any potential opportunity for El Salvador. The Americans finished the night with five shots on goal and 16 chances created. Turner didn't have to make a single save.\n\n\"I think the ambition to play forward and get behind them was missing for the 90 minutes,\" Berhalter said. \"We had it in spurts, but overall, I think we could've done that much better.\"\n\nThe USMNT stayed put in second place with 18 points, one point behind Canada, whose win over Honduras brought them to 19 points.

Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nThere weren’t too many signs of early nerves from the USMNT as Berhalter’s side dictated the play in the opening stages – enjoying 65% of the possession – though it took until the 28th minute for it conjure the first chance of note.\n\nJosh Sargeant’s long-range effort took a deflection off an Iranian defender and fell perfectly into the path of Timothy Weah, who perhaps didn’t realize he was all alone in front of goal and rushed a headed effort that Alireza Beiranvand in the Iran goal caught with ease.\n\nOn the half hour mark, Weah once again took up a brilliant position inside the box but skied his effort well over the crossbar after being set up by Sargeant.\n\nThe USMNT’s pressure eventually told seven minutes before half time, taking the lead following an incisive team move.\n\nWeston McKennie’s pinpoint cross field ball was headed back across goal by the marauding Sergiño Dest and bundled home bravely by Pulisic, who suffered a hefty collision with Beiranvand as he turned the ball over the line.\n\nThe USMNT’s delight swiftly turned to worry as it was evident that Pulisic was in significant pain following the clash, limping heavily as he was helped off the pitch by two medics.\n\nPulisic soon re-entered the pitch, but the Chelsea man was clearly still struggling with the knock.\n\nChristian Pulisic is surrounded by teammates after going down injured following his goal.

Just a few days after they were booed after tying Canada in Nashville, they beat Honduras at Estadio Olimpico Metropolitano, a traditionally tough road venue, in San Pedro Sula.\n\nThere are any number of angles from which one might view the 4-1 victory. Perhaps the place to start is here: A star was born.\n\nRicardo Pepi, born in El Paso and raised as a Dallas FC homegrown, had a goal, an assist and figured prominently in each of the four tallies. It was one of the most auspicious debuts in the history of the U.S. Men’s National Team, and it came in a pressure-packed and hostile environment, in a high-stakes game.\n\nRicardo Pepi's emergence for USMNT\n\nPepi, 18, is the second-youngest U.S. player, after Christian Pulisic, to appear in a World Cup qualifier. Suddenly, he has to be the No. 1 striker in the program, and if he’s not, he’s No. 2.\n\nPepi could have played for Mexico. He chose to play for the U.S., in part because coach Gregg Berhalter is a good recruiter. This should not be lost in the cacophony of criticism to which Berhalter has been subjected over the past week. Triple G has overturned and deepened the U.S. roster, made a place for young stars and, presumably, not “lost the room.”\n\nWe can presume Berhalter has not “lost the room” because if he did, his team would not have rebounded after the coach did everything wrong in the first half against Honduras.\n\nBerhalter explained why he started in a 3-4-3 formation, which was a disaster. He said he wanted three in back (or five, when everyone dropped) to protect against Honduras’ counter-attack. The problem was, a number of his players played out of position in a formation that made everyone uncomfortable. It had more gaps in 45 minutes than all America’s indoor shopping malls did in 1980. Tyler Adams disappeared.\n\nA disastrous first half for USMNT\n\nThe inimitable Rog Bennett of Men in Blazers, an expatriated Englishman and new American citizen, aptly summed up the first half in a tweet: “Humiliating to watch as someone that loves the US and dreams of our footballing progress. In massive game, to see our boys so lost and exposed. Truly feel for these young gents. To be flung out in experimental format in this cauldron. Set up to fail in most rudderless fashion.”\n\nThe U.S. had zero shots on goal in the first half.\n\nAt halftime, Berhalter switched back to his usual 4-4-3 and implored his players to up their energy level and win more battles. He inserted Brendon Aaronson for Josh Sargent, Antonee Robinson for George Bello and fresh veteran Sebastian Lletjet for addled veteran John Brooks.\n\nThe U.S. had eight shots on goal in the second.\n\nEach sub scored a goal. Team USA came back from a 1-0 deficit and won on the road in a qualifier for only the third time in 92 years, or since the Hoover Administration. It was like a moon landing.\n\nAmericans recover, move up in CONCACAF standings\n\nInstead of taking a plunge in the octagonal standings, and falling into a hole from which it would be extraordinarily difficult to extricate themselves, the Americans (1-0-2, five points, plus-3 goal differential) moved into third place with 11 games to go in the qualifying cycle.\n\nThe top three teams from CONCACAF get automatic bids to the 2022 Qatar World Cup; the fourth-place team advances to an international playoff.\n\nBerhalter has one of the most scrutinized jobs in the country. He has been preaching that COVID-era qualifying (eight teams and 14 games instead of six and 10 in this hemisphere) is more a marathon than a sprint. He has preached “process” and stuck to his plan.\n\nStill, after the last World Cup cycle, when U.S. went through two coaches and failed, ignominiously, the heat is on. Little else matters beyond winning. There can be no excuses, not coming off the failure in the previous qualifying cycle.\n\nBerhalter went the past week without young stars Sergino Dest (ankle), Gio Reyna (hamstring) and Zack Steffen (COVID). He went most of the past week without one of his best players, Weston McKennie (suspended for violating COVID protocol). His best player, Christian Pulisic, injured his ankle Wednesday night.\n\nBerhalter didn’t help himself with his first-half formational gaffe, but he adjusted — and his players responded. It was a huge moment for Pepi and a monster win that could propel the Americans. They still have yet to lose a game. And they ought to be in finer fettle when the next window opens in October.\n\nAs soccer-headed friend of the column Keith Naas (@Knaas) put it, “This was an unprecedented win. I don’t think Gregg’s job was in jeopardy with a loss, but clearly getting a result finally was more important than the process.”\n\nYou know he’s a footballer when he says “result” instead of “victory.”\n\nmarace@dispatch.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/fc-cincinnati/2021/11/12/usmnt-mexico-cincinnati-tql-stadium-2026-world-cup/6386532001/", "title": "Why the U.S. men's national team vs. Mexico match matters to ...", "text": "Asked why the quadrennial FIFA World Cup qualifying soccer match played between the U.S. men's national team and Mexico occupies such prominent real estate in America's soccer consciousness, USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter offered a historical perspective.\n\n\"I think it’s because they’ve been top dog in the region historically, right? And now we come in and we have something to say about it,\" Berhalter told The Enquirer on Sunday. \"And we, over the years and the early 2000s, we started dominating the matchup. It was something that – no one likes to be taken off their perch and this was something where it became personal and the matchups have been heated. For the U.S. fans, the U.S. loves to see winners and to see the national team start to get some good victories against Mexico, it meant a lot. All that intensified the rivalry. Now, if you’re talking about in the 70s and they’re beating us every game, the rivalry wasn’t as intense, right?\"\n\nUSMNT vs. Mexico FIFA World Cup qualifier:Preview, prediction for Friday at TQL Stadium\n\nWhat you need to know:U.S. men's national team's match with Mexico at TQL Stadium\n\nUSMNT coach Gregg Berhalter:Talks World Cup qualifier vs. Mexico\n\nFollow every match: Live World Cup scores\n\nIt's true that Mexico has historically owned the all-time series between the two soccer federations, but it's also true that since 2000, the U.S. boasts a 15-9-6 record against Mexico.\n\nThat includes two American victories in matches this past summer when trophies were on the line in the Concacaf Nations League and Gold Cup finals, which has left the rivalry on a high simmer since their conclusion.\n\nNothing squelches the simmer like a win in the World Cup qualifier contested by the countries on U.S. soil, which will be staged in the ongoing qualifying Friday at FC Cincinnati's TQL Stadium (9:10 p.m.).\n\nThis iteration of USMNT-Mexico is spiked with an acute sense of Cincinnati pride, and the meaning of the game to the region will go far beyond the final score when the 90-plus minutes have expired.\n\nFor years during FC Cincinnati's rise from the third rung of American soccer to the first-division Major League Soccer, the city was championed as an emerging soccer market.\n\nBut USMNT-Mexico wouldn't be staged in the city if it was still emerging. The fact that the match will be played in the West End neighborhood Friday is a signal the region is now viewed as a bona fide, mature soccer market.\n\nIn fact, U.S. Soccer is banking on that. Cincinnati's passionate fan support has been hailed as part of the rationale for staging the game at FC Cincinnati's first-year, 26,000-capacity venue.\n\nUSMNT needs every advantage it can deploy in the latest chapter of the running feud with Mexico – a point Berhalter reiterated and defended during a Thursday news conference.\n\nBerhalter, who previously managed Columbus Crew of MLS, said he knew Cincinnati would be a suitable site for the match based on his experience on the losing side of a U.S. Open Cup match played at the University of Cincinnati's Nippert Stadium in 2017.\n\n\"We had a working group that got together and evaluated what’s gonna be important for each game. We looked at the weather, we looked at the crowd, we looked at the facilities – both training and stadium,\" Berhalter said. \"We looked at the distance of that game to the next game, and overall, my personal experience here really helped me understand what the fans are like.\n\n\"I’ve mentioned, I referenced the game we had against Cincinnati in the Open Cup and that was one of the best atmospheres I’ve experienced in the United States because of both fan bases in the same stadium in big numbers.\"\n\nHosting USMNT-Mexico is a form of acknowledgement, and it brings with it millions of eyes from throughout the sporting world that will be fixed on Cincinnati for several hours Friday.\n\n\"It is an incredible honor,\" Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley said Wednesday. \"And, of course, we're gonna win ... It's amazing to think that just a few years ago, there was no TQL Stadium. There was no FC Cincinnati, and yet now we are hosting USA and Mexico in Cincinnati.\"\n\nWhat's at stake in USMNT vs. Mexico game\n\nThere is no higher level of soccer than playing in a FIFA World Cup, and Friday's contest is part of the qualifying process for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nIn other words, the stakes couldn't be higher. Victory on Friday is another step toward qualifying. And failing to qualify would be an outright embarrassment, as the U.S. team learned in its failed bid to reach the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nMexico's also flirted with missing the World Cup in the not-too-distant past, so both countries know the weight of the pressure\n\nIn FIFA's Concacaf region, three teams out of eight qualify for Qatar automatically. The fourth-place finisher in the eight-team group plays an intercontinental playoff, so the race for one of the top three spots is intense.\n\n2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying standings - Concacaf 1. Mexico (4-0-2, 14 points)\n\n2. USA (3-1-2, 11 points)\n\n3. Canada (2-0-4, 10 points)\n\n***\n\n4. Panama (2-2-2, 8 points)\n\n***\n\n5. Costa Rica (1-2-3, 6 points)\n\n6. Jamaica (1-3-2, five points)\n\n7. El Salvador (1-3-2, 5 points)\n\n8. Honduras (0-3-3, 3 points) Top three teams in the round-robin, eight-team group qualify directly for Qatar. The fourth place finisher faces a playoff.\n\nWinning the eight-team \"octagonal\" isn't necessary, but both the U.S. and Mexico are typically expected to qualify with style. A win would put either country in a strong position with half the qualifying matches played.\n\nAs expected for a match of this magnitude, Friday's game will be contested by an assemblage of talented players that might never be equaled in TQL Stadium history. Both national teams are stocked full with elite players on contract in the American and Mexican domestic leagues, Europe and beyond.\n\nExposure for Cincinnati and its 2026 World Cup bid\n\nIt's to Cincinnati's strategic advantage to host USMNT-Mexico, and not just its privilege. The city will be on the receiving end of widespread, international recognition as a result of the game.\n\nESPN and other TV networks will help amplify Cincinnati's reach.\n\nJason Williams:Cincinnati is going big on FIFA World Cup bid. Isn't it refreshing?\n\n'Message received':Here's what we learned from the FIFA 2026 World Cup site visit\n\n'It would be the biggest event ever':Can fan power help make Cincinnati a 2026 World Cup site?\n\nESPN alone will dedicate no less than four hours of programming live from TQL Stadium on Friday, and ESPN Deportes on Thursday broadcast with Moerlein Lager House at The Banks as the backdrop.\n\nESPN makes up just a part of the more than 200 national and international media members credentialed for the game. All of those individuals will paint the picture of this historic rivalry with Cincinnati flavoring.\n\nTourism dollars come with hosting the Mexico match, too.\n\nSome locals will be inside TQL Stadium for the match, but tickets for the game were also purchased by individuals in all 50 states, as well as in Washington D.C.\n\nAll of this, along with marshaling the security, law enforcement and logistical resources required to stage the match, is also bolstering the city's bid to host FIFA World Cup matches in 2026 when the event is jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"Hosting this World Cup qualifier – the biggest soccer match in this country every four years – is absolutely a warm-up,\" Berding said during public remarks Wednesday, \"and shows U.S. Soccer, Concacaf and FIFA that Cincinnati is well-positioned to put on a spectacular event with soccer passion and pride and the spirit of the heartland of this country, and we're gonna show that on Friday night.\"\n\nIn line with the upsides to Cincinnati's bid as described to FIFA delegates during an October site inspection, the U.S. men's national team used a discreet hotel located away from Downtown, and had a successful week of training at FC Cincinnati's Mercy Health Training Center in suburban Milford.\n\nMexico trained for part of the week leading up to the match in Indianapolis, and even that underscored aspects of the bid, which is a cooperative, regional effort as it has the support of high-ranking politicians in Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nLocally, multiple city and county departments, the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office, the Department of Homeland Security, the local FBI field office, Cincinnati Police Department and Ohio State Highway Patrol are providing logistical and other support for the event.\n\nPaul Brown Stadium would be the venue for World Cup matches if the city's bid is successful, so the experience of the USMNT-Mexico isn't quite the same undertaking. But as Berding said, it's a warm-up, and the highest-profile one possible.\n\nNot only is Friday an audition for the World Cup but its a chance to make Cincinnati one of U.S. Soccer's favorite homes.\n\nThere's no doubt U.S. Soccer is fond of FC Cincinnati's TQL Stadium. Friday marks the federation's second event at venue since September, when the women's national team thrashed Paraguay in a friendly.\n\nIt stands to reason U.S. Soccer will be back again but the outcomes on Friday – both on and off the field – are consequential to ensuring that happens.\n\n\"It's obviously having a great experience on Friday night, and having a good outcome also helps,\" Berding said. \"But from our point of view, we have the best stadium, the biggest soccer specific stadium (in America), the most premium seating, probably the most passionate fan base when you look at what's been built here in a short period of time, so, look, we have great training facilities ... We just need to continue to grow as a club, which I think we've shown we'll continue to grow. As we continue to develop the area around the stadium, that will be new. I think you'll continue to see new development in FC Cincinnati and in the city, and that's going to continue to reinforce why U.S. Soccer needs to come back.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/25/football/italy-north-macedonia-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Italy fails to qualify for 2022 World Cup, players 'destroyed and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nItaly players are “destroyed and crushed” after failing to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar following a last-gasp defeat to North Macedonia, according to defender Giorgio Chiellini.\n\nAleksandar Trajkovski scored a dramatic 92nd minute winner to stun the European champions in their playoff qualifier semifinal and ensure Italy will not be playing its second straight World Cup having missed out in 2018.\n\n“A great void will remain within us,” Juventus defender Chiellini told Rai Sports.\n\n“We didn’t concede anything tonight apart from the goal.

As the team prepares to play England for its opening World Cup match on 21 November, all eyes will be on its players for more than soccer.\n\nThe protests, referred to by experts as the most significant since the establishment of clerical rule following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after being detained by Iran’s morality police allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.\n\nIranian demonstrators take to the streets of Tehran during a protest for Mahsa Amini in September, days after she died in police custody. AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat began as a clamor for women’s rights has morphed into a movement, still driven by women, demanding the end of a regime that “people no longer believe…is reformable,” Abbas Milani, director of Iranian studies at Stanford University, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour earlier this month. “They want a different social contract without the clergy claiming divine right.”\n\nIranian security forces have unleashed a violent response, killing at least 378 people, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights NGO (IHRNGO) group has claimed, while a UN official says as many as 14,000 people have been arrested across the country, including journalists, activists, lawyers and educators.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify these figures as non-state media, the internet, and protest movements in Iran have all been suppressed. Death tolls vary by opposition groups, international rights organizations and journalists tracking the ongoing protests.\n\n‘The number one sport’\n\nFootball is the “number one sport” in Iran, Iranian-born Canadian coach Mossavat says, giving the team a potentially powerful platform from which to voice its support for the protestors.\n\nIn the past, the national team had been seen as more representative of the Iranian people than the regime, Omid Namazi – Iranian national team’s assistant coach from 2011 to 2014 – told CNN Sport.\n\nWhen the FIFA World Cup Twitter account posted images of the Iranian players smiling and goofing around in a pre-tournament photoshoot, it prompted criticism by some on social media.\n\n“I am so disappointed, so heartbroken by these,” Iranian-born football journalist Sina Saemian tweeted. “The lack of common sense, lack of empathy and insensitivity shown in these pictures is genuinely disheartening. The photo op is absolutely FIFA’s requirement, but the poses are not. There is a clear absence of any sense of awareness.”\n\nAlthough its star forward, Azmoun, has shown his support for the protestors, Namazi says that many of the other national team players have remained relatively quiet, “leaving a bad taste.”\n\n“The perception has really changed about the players, the national team itself,” he adds. “People call it the national team of the Islamic Republic and not the national team of the people of Iran.”\n\nIran's Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz attends a training session at the Al-Rayyan training facility in Doha on November 20, 2022, on the eve of his side's first match. Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAzmoun, who plays for the German team Bayer Leverkusen, posted multiple times to social media, and changed his profile picture to black in support of the protesters, and indicated that it could have cost him a place in the World Cup squad.\n\n“That is worth sacrificing for one strand of Iranian women’s hair,” he wrote in an Instagram story. “Shame on you who kill people so easily. Long live Iranian women.”\n\nAzmoun was ultimately selected to play in Qatar, but Iranwire, an opposition news outlet, reported that Iranian men’s football team manager Carlos Queiroz had come under pressure from Iran’s Sports Ministry to leave him out the squad.\n\nProtesting at the World Cup, on the biggest stage of all for football, carries potentially huge risks for the current players in the national team.\n\n“The players are under a lot of pressure by the government. It affects their livelihood, their future, their earnings,” Namazi says.\n\nNonetheless, players will be free to protest at the World Cup so long as they do not break FIFA rules, their manager Queiroz has said.\n\n“I don’t know if they’ll do anything,” Iranian football fan Payam, who didn’t give his surname for safety reasons, tells CNN Sport.\n\n“We are all hoping they do something…If they don’t, it’s going to be a big egg on their face, to be honest.”\n\nDefender Ehsan Hajsafi became the first member of the national team to speak out at the World Cup in apparent support of anti-government protests at home. “They should know that we are with them. And we support them. And we sympathize with them regarding the conditions,” he told reporters, per Reuters, on Sunday.\n\nSaeed Piramoon imitates cutting his hair during a match.

CNN could not verify the video.\n\nThe build-up to the World Cup has been dominated by discussions surrounding human rights, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nIran faces England in its opening World Cup match. In October the Athletic reported that England didn’t have any plans to “publicly demonstrate its solidarity” with the Iranian protestors. Speaking to CNN, an English Football Association spokesperson said: “We are aware of the protests in Iran, and following the situation. It is obviously worrying, but the best people to comment on it are the Iranian people.”\n\nCNN has also reached out to the Welsh FA and US Soccer, teams also in Iran’s group, but, at the time of publication, had yet to receive a response.\n\n‘Maybe we can show people what’s going on’\n\nIn the wake of the protests and the human rights violations happening in Iran, several groups inside and outside the country have called upon FIFA to ban it from the World Cup.\n\nIn October, a group of prominent Iranian athletes lobbied FIFA via a law firm, urging it to suspend the Iranian Football Federation (FFIRI) and ban it from participating at the World Cup.\n\n“Iran’s brutality and belligerence towards its own people has reached a tipping point, demanding an unequivocal and firm disassociation from the footballing and sports world,” a press release issued alongside the letter reads.\n\nThey were joined in this stance by a human rights group, ‘Open Stadiums,’ which describes itself as “a movement of Iranian women seeking to end discrimination” and allow women to attend football stadiums. “The Iranian FA is not only an accomplice of the crimes of the regime, it is a direct threat to the security of female fans in Iran and wherever our national team plays in the world,” the group wrote in an open letter to FIFA in September.\n\nIranian women were allowed to attend a national football championship match for the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution on August 25, 2022. Hossein Zohrevand/Tasnim News/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Ukrainian Football Association also called on FIFA to “consider excluding” Iran’s national team, citing the “systematic human rights violations” there, and “the possible involvement of Iran in the military aggression of Russia against Ukraine.”\n\nCNN has reached out to FIFA and the FFIRI for comment about calls for Iran to be banned from the Cup but, at the time of publication, had not received a response.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino defended Iran’s participation in the 2022 Qatar World Cup in his pre-tournament press conference, saying it is “two football teams” going head-to-head in matches rather than “two regimes” or “two ideologies.”\n\nInfantino reminded journalists of FIFA’s role as an organization, saying “we’re not the United Nations. We’re not the world police. We’re not… I don’t know the blue helmets.”\n\nSaman Ghoddos, Iran’s only player to play in the English Premier League, and who has publicly supported the protests, also believes that Iran should compete at the World Cup.\n\n“I’ve heard about it and from my point of view, I don’t know if it’s the right direction,” he told CNN’s Don Riddell in October. “Because I always think that football should be outside politics and should not be involved in that.\n\n“But I don’t think it’s the right move to kick out Iran from the World Cup, but maybe we can put a light and show people what’s going on.”\n\nFor Mossavat, the World Cup seems to be operating in an alternate reality to the protests unfolding in his home country.\n\n“While this is happening, I cannot see people being overly excited [about the World Cup] when they’re out on the street fighting for freedom,” Mossavat says. “I think it’s going to be difficult to galvanize people.”\n\nSaman Ghoddos plays for Brentford.

It has canceled five flights to and from Honolulu, Southwest said.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration is “closely monitoring the volcanic eruption and will issue air traffic advisories once the size of the ash cloud is determined,” it said in a statement.\n\nRed hues from the eruption of Mauna Loa illuminated Monday's predawn sky. Courtesy David A. Higgins\n\nReports of lava overflowing into the southwest portion of the volcano’s caldera, or crater, have come in to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency tweeted late Monday morning.\n\nThere is no indication of a threat to nearby communities, and no evacuation orders have been issued, the agency tweeted. As a precaution, two shelters have opened, even as “roughly half” of recorded Mauna Loa eruptions remained in the summit area without threatening populated areas, according to another agency tweet.\n\nAshfall can damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems, and damage or kill vegetation, the weather service says, while abrasive volcanic ash can irritate eyes and lungs.\n\n“People with respiratory illnesses should remain indoors to avoid inhaling the ash particles and anyone outside should cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth,” the Honolulu office warned. “Possible harm to crops and animals. Minor equipment and infrastructure damage. Reduced visibility. Widespread clean-up may be necessary.”\n\nThe observatory said earlier that lava flows do not threaten downslope communities.\n\nAt about 4,000 square miles, Hawaii, or the Big Island, is the largest in size of the Hawaiian chain but has a population of just over 200,000 people, according to the US Census Bureau, or fewer than 50 people per square mile. Most of the population is in cities and communities around the coast.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa eruption can be very dynamic and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the observatory said, adding, “If the eruption remains in Moku’āweoweo, lava flows will most likely be confined within the caldera walls.\n\n“However, if the eruptive vents migrate outside its walls, lava flows may move rapidly downslope.”\n\nRed hues from the eruption illuminated Monday’s predawn sky, according to footage captured at the Kailua Bay & Pier by Matthew Liano, a resident of Kailua-Kona, along the Big Island’s west coast.\n\n“The glow is like nothing I’ve seen here living in Kona for most of my life,” Liano told CNN.\n\nThe eruption began in Moku’āweoweo, the summit caldera of Mauna Loa, on Sunday around 11:30 p.m. HST (4:30 a.m. ET Monday), according to the observatory.\n\nMauna Loa began erupting Sunday. USGS\n\nNearby Kilauea volcano erupting since 2021\n\nMauna Loa, which covers half the island of Hawaii, has erupted 33 times since 1843, the volcano’s first “well-documented historical eruption,” according to the US Geological Survey. It last erupted in 1984, making this prolonged quiet period the volcano’s longest in recorded history.\n\nMauna Loa’s summit crater sits about 21 miles west of Kilauea, a smaller volcano that has been erupting since 2021. Their simultaneous eruptions have created a rare dual-eruption event, according to the park.\n\nKilauea’s eruption is currently confined to its crater. When Kilauea erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nMauna Loa has been in a heightened state of unrest, per the agency, which pointed in an update late last month to elevated seismic activity and increased earthquake rates.\n\nEarthquake activity increased from five to 10 earthquakes a day since June 2022 to some 10 to 20 earthquakes a day in July and August, according to the US Geological Survey. Peak numbers of more than 100 earthquakes a day were recorded on September 23 and September 29, CNN has reported.\n\nThe increased activity prompted Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in October to close the Mauna Loa summit to all backcountry hikers until further notice, though the US National Park Service said the main section of the park has remained open.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the Eastern Time equivalents for the ashfall advisory and eruption.", "authors": ["Monica Garrett Dakin Andone", "Monica Garrett", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/weather/volcano-terms-meaning-xpn-trnd/index.html", "title": "Here's what Pele's hair and the other volcanic terms you're hearing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHawaii’s Mauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, erupted this week for the first time in almost four decades.\n\nWhen volcanoes erupt, they can have disastrous effects on the environment and the communities that live around them. Sunday night’s eruption caused flight cancellations to and from Honolulu and sent lava flowing down the side of the volcano.\n\nIn erupting for the first time since 1984, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in nearly 40 years, joining joined its neighboring volcano, Kilauea, which had been erupting for more than a year. The rare dual-eruption event is expected to attract an influx of visitors eager to see their molten flows, the national park said in a Facebook post.\n\nHere is some of the volcano vocabulary you should know to keep up with the eruptions.\n\nCaldera: A caldera is the large, basin-shaped volcanic depression that forms when a volcano erupts and releases magma stored beneath the surface, causing the overlying rocks to collapse. A caldera is different from a crater, which is a smaller depression formed when a volcano erupts and sends rock exploding outward. Yellowstone National Park is home to a famous caldera, measuring 43 by 28 miles.\n\nLava: Lava is what scientists call magma that breaks through the Earth’s surface – like during a volcano eruption. Lava moves as a fluid or viscous mass, says the US Geological Survey.\n\nLava fountains: A lava fountain is just what it sounds like: a jet of lava sprayed into the air “by the rapid formation and expansion of gas bubbles in the molten rock,” says the USGS. The fountains can reach more than 500 meters (1,640 feet) high.\n\nLava flows: Lava flows describe both the moving masses of lava that spew onto the earth’s surface during an eruption and the solidified deposit they leave behind once they cool down.\n\nMagma: Magma describes the super-hot, molten rock beneath the surface of the Earth, according to the USGS. Stores of magma lie in magma reservoirs or magma chambers underneath volcanoes.\n\nPele’s hair: This term describes long, thin strands of volcanic glass that form from lava fountains and fast lava flows, the USGS says. The strands are named after Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of fire. Swaths of Pele’s hair can remain for years and even decades, according to the service, although the wind will eventually strip them from most surfaces.\n\nTephra: Tephra is a catch-all term for all the fragments of rock that are ejected into the air by an erupting volcano, the geological survey says.\n\nVolcanic ash: Volcanic ash isn’t the same as the ash produced after burning a piece of paper. Volcanic ash, a finer form of tephra, consists of tiny, sharp pieces of rock and glass. It’s hard and abrasive and doesn’t dissolve in water, according to the USGS. Clouds of volcanic ash pose a danger to air traffic because they reduce visibility, can damage flight controls and can even cause jet engines to fail.\n\nVog: Vog, a portmanteau of “volcanic” and “smog,” describes the “hazy air pollution” produced by volcanic emissions, according to the Interagency Vog Dashboard.\n\nThe pollution mostly consists of water vapor, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Vog can pose environmental and health risks, says the USGS.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/cnn10/ten-content-tues/index.html", "title": "Today's news in 10 minutes | CNN", "text": "Story highlights This page includes the show Transcript\n\nNovember 29, 2022\n\nToday on CNN 10, we’re going to begin with news on the economy and one of many people’s favorite topics…shopping!

Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was dealt a major defeat after a federal appeals court on Thursday halted the special master review of documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate. The ruling removes a significant obstacle to the Justice Department’s investigation into the mishandling of government records from Trump’s time in the White House. The panel specifically reversed the order that appointed a special master, or third-party attorney, to sort through thousands of documents found at Trump’s home to determine what should be off limits to investigators. The court said the judge should not have intervened in the first place. Trump’s legal team has not decided whether to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court but is weighing the option.\n\n2. Rail strike\n\nThe Senate on Thursday passed legislation to avert a rail shutdown following a grave warning from President Joe Biden that a strike would cause economic turmoil. The final vote in the Senate was 80 to 15 and the measure is now headed to the president’s desk to be signed into law. Without congressional action, a rail strike could have begun as early as December 9, causing product shortages, spiking prices and halting factory production. It could have also disrupted commuter rail services for millions of travelers a day as well as the daily transportation of thousands of carloads of food and farm products, among other items, according to a collection of business groups. Union leaders, however, are not pleased with the deal brokered by the White House, arguing it did not meet workers’ demands for paid sick leave.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Tapper presses Buttigieg on paid sick leave for rail workers 01:51 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Student loans\n\nPresident Biden’s student loan forgiveness program will remain blocked for now, the Supreme Court announced Thursday, but the justices agreed to hear oral arguments in the case in February, with a decision expected by June. The program would offer up to $20,000 of debt relief to millions of borrowers, but due to a long list of legal challenges, the government stopped taking applications nearly two weeks ago and no debt has been canceled thus far. About 26 million people had already applied to the program before it was frozen. “President Biden will keep fighting against efforts to rob middle-class families of the relief they need and deserve,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement, welcoming the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case.\n\n4. China protests\n\nChinese authorities are using cellphone data to track down protesters who demonstrated against the government’s Covid-19 restrictions, according to a recording of a phone call between a protester and police heard by CNN. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the streets of major Chinese cities over the weekend, calling for an end to the stringent tests and lockdowns. Some also decried censorship and called for the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Since then, protesters have received phone calls from the police inquiring about their participation. Some protesters have also been told to report to police stations for questioning and to sign a written record about their involvement in the demonstrations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Chilling': Protester tells CNN what the atmosphere is like in China 03:57 - Source: CNN\n\n5.

The House would then need to approve the legislation before sending it to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. Supporters of the bill are eager to pass the legislation through the House before the end of the year with Republicans set to take control of the chamber in January. The bill would not set a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage, but it would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage. So, in the event the Supreme Court might overturn its Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage in 2015, a state could still pass a law to ban same-sex marriage, but that state would be required to recognize a same-sex marriage from another state.\n\n2. World Cup\n\nUS and Iranian soccer players will take the pitch for a critical World Cup match today at 2 p.m. ET. At this stage of the tournament, the US Men’s National Team must win or will be eliminated. It will also be a match charged with political tension as the two countries have had no formal diplomatic relations since 1980. This week, Iran’s state media called for the US to be kicked out of the World Cup after US Soccer changed Iran’s flag on its social media accounts to show support for the protesters in Iran. Additionally, a security source said Iran threatened families of its own national soccer team with imprisonment and torture if the players fail to “behave” ahead of the match today. The warning came after Iranian players refused to sing the nation’s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21 to support the protest movement against the country’s regime.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He was imprisoned in Iran.

Rail strike\n\nPresident Biden has called on Congress to pass legislation “immediately” to avert a freight rail shutdown that would “devastate the economy.” The looming rail strike, which could begin as early as December 9, would cause product shortages, spiking prices and factory production issues. Additionally, a strike could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone, according to a new analysis from the Anderson Economic Group. Democratic leaders say they could act as soon as this week by officially adopting a September tentative agreement approved by labor and management leaders. While the railroads say they are hopeful that a strike by more than 100,000 union members can be avoided, they have so far rejected the demands that union negotiators say their members want – including new terms for paid sick days and better working conditions.\n\n4.

In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on the platform and called out the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store.

Its neighbor Kilauea, which is also in Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, has been erupting for more than a year.\n\nOn Tuesday, two new lava flows were seen streaming down Mauna Loa, the US Geological Survey said.\n\nThis annotated view of webcam on Mauna Kea looking toward Mauna Loa shows the flow from Fissure 3 that has moved north to cross the @NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory road overnight.

David Ige to sign an emergency proclamation Tuesday. This allows the state’s director and administrator of emergency management to handle actions such as issuing alerts and warnings as well as facilitating mandatory evacuations where necessary.\n\nAt just 21 miles apart, Mauna Loa and Kilauea have not erupted together since 1984, when Mauna Loa last erupted.\n\nNeither volcano is threatening homes or nearby infrastructure, the national park said. But state health officials warned air quality could be worsened by hazards such as vog, or volcanic smog.\n\nThe rare dual-eruption event is expected to attract an influx of visitors eager to see the molten flows, the national park said in a Facebook post.\n\nFountains of lava as tall as 200 feet burst from Mauna Loa on Monday, the geological survey said. The eruption was concentrated in Mauna Loa’s Northeast Rift Zone, where lava is flowing from at least one split in the volcano, the geological survey said.\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the agency said.\n\nOfficials are keeping a careful eye on the site to monitor any developments.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa rift zone eruption can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the geological survey said in a Monday update.\n\nOnly one of three volcanic fissures that opened on Mauna Loa Monday was still emitting lava Tuesday morning, Hawaii emergency management said. A small, fourth fissure opened overnight and emitted a small amount of lava that cut both power and road access to the Mauna Loa Observatory facility, the agency said.\n\nThough there is no immediate risk to communities, Hawaii’s National Guard is on standby and the state Emergency Management Agency has activated its emergency operations center, Major General Ken Hara, adjutant general for the State of Hawaii Dept. of Defense said during a news conference.\n\nKilauea, a much smaller volcano sitting on Mauna Loa’s southeastern side, has been erupting since September 2021, though its lava is confined to its crater, according to the US Geological Survey. When the incredibly active volcano erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park remains open but cautions visitors hoping to witness the historic eruptions to be aware of the cultural significance the sites have for Native Hawaiians.\n\n“While an eruption is an exciting experience, keep in mind you are observing a sacred event. Kīlauea and Mauna Loa volcano are wahi kapu (sacred landscapes) surrounded with storied places,” the park’s website says.\n\nThe Kilauea volcano lava lake, left, and a magnificent glow from Mauna Loa, upper right, sets the morning sky aglow. Joyce Ibasan/NPS Photo\n\nThe eruption of Mauna Loa prompted the closure of the Mauna Loa Forest Reserve and the Kipuka ‘Ainahou Nēnē Sanctuary for at least 90 days, the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) announced Monday.\n\nThe division expressed concern that if lava changes course and flows into the Puʻu Makaʻala Natural Area Reserve, years of work restoring the land after previous eruptions could be destroyed.\n\nEruption disrupts critical climate equipment\n\nVolcanic eruption at Mauna Loa volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii on November 29, 2022. MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nMauna Loa’s eruption and its subsequent lava flow are affecting the road used to access the Mauna Loa Observatory.\n\nIt has cut off power and access to the critical climate tool used to maintain the so-called “Keeling Curve,” which is the authoritative measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide and vital scientific evidence for the climate crisis.\n\nThe Keeling Curve graph is comprised of daily carbon dioxide concentration measurements taken at Mauna Loa since 1958.\n\n“It’s a big deal. This is the central record of the present understanding of the climate problem,” said Ralph Keeling, a geoscientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego and son of the Keeling Curve creator.\n\nResearchers are now scrambling to find an alternative location for the equipment.\n\nThere have only been a few times when the readings from the tool have been unavailable, including in 1984, when they were interrupted by the last Mauna Loa eruption. During that incident, researchers had to install a generator in the observatory to resume operations.\n\nThis time around, Keeling said the situation is “much worse” and the timeline is unclear.\n\nVolcanic ash impacts air quality, flights\n\nHawaii health officials are warning residents about the possibility of \"vog,\" or volcanic smog. Paradise Helicopter\n\nIge, the state’s governor, cautioned Monday that the wind could carry volcanic gas and ash and asked residents with respiratory sensitivities to take precautions to minimize exposure.\n\nA “trace to less than one quarter inch” of ashfall could accumulate on parts of the island, the National Weather Service in Honolulu said Monday.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Health issued an alert Monday warning residents and visitors should prepare for impacts to air quality, saying the eruptions could cause “vog conditions, ash in the air, and levels of sulfur dioxide to increase and fluctuate in various areas of the state.”\n\nSensitive groups, including children, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions should reduce outdoor activities that cause heavy breathing and reduce exposure by staying indoors and closing windows and doors, should vog conditions develop, the health department said.\n\nVolcanic ash clouds can also pose a serious aviation risk, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail.\n\nSouthwest Airlines stopped operations from Hilo International Monday because of the eruption, the airline announced. It has canceled five flights to and from Honolulu, Southwest said.\n\n“Passengers with flights to Hilo International Airport (ITO) or the Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keahole (KOA) should check with their airline prior to heading to the airport due to the volcanic activity at Mauna Loa,” according to an advisory from the state Transportation Department.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration is “closely monitoring the volcanic eruption and will issue air traffic advisories once the size of the ash cloud is determined,” it said in a statement.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Holly Yan Elizabeth Wolfe", "Amir Vera", "Holly Yan", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/24/us/tracey-meares-black-valedictorian-trnd/index.html", "title": "Black woman named valedictorian nearly 40 years after her high ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA 55-year-old woman has been honored 38 years after her Illinois high school failed to make her its first Black valedictorian.\n\nTracey Meares was awarded the title on April 16 by the superintendent of Springfield Public Schools District 186 after a screening of the documentary “No Title for Tracey,” which recounts her story.\n\nDespite earning superior grades, Meares was shared the title of “Top Student” with a White student at her 1984 graduation.

Gas prices have been rising steadily for the last eight weeks, and this latest milestone marks the 15th straight day that the AAA reading has hit a record price, and the 32nd time in the last 33 days.\n\nThe national average stood at $4.07 when the current run of price increases began April 15. The current price reading from OPIS represents 23% increase in less than two months.\n\nAnd the rising gasoline prices is doing more than just causing pain at the pump for drivers. They are a major factor in the prices paid by consumers for a full range of goods and services rising at the fastest pace in 40 years, according to the government’s inflation report Friday.\n\nInflation caused consumer confidence to hit a record low on Friday, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. Worries about what the Federal Reserve will do to battle inflation has sent US stocks plunging in recent months, wiping out billions in household wealth.\n\nWhile a $5 national average is new, $5 gas has become unpleasantly common in much of the country.\n\nData from OPIS, which collects the readings from 130,000 US gas stations used to compile the AAA averages, showed that 32% of stations nationwide, nearly one of every three, were already were charging more than $5 a gallon in readings Friday. And about 10% of stations across the nation are charging more than $5.75 a gallon.\n\nThe statewide average was $5 a gallon or more in 21 states plus Washington DC in Saturday’s reading.\n\n$6 gas could be next\n\nAnd gas prices are unlikely to stop there. With the summer travel season getting underway, demand for gasoline, coupled with Russian oil shipments cut off due to the war in Ukraine, oil prices are soaring on global markets.\n\nThe US national average for gasoline could be close to $6 later this summer, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said earlier this week about the demand for gas as people hit the road for long-anticipated getaways. “Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations.”\n\nThe highest statewide average has long been in California, where the average stood at $6.43 a gallon in Saturday’s readings. But the pain of higher prices is being felt across the country, not just in California or other high-priced states.\n\nCheap gas hard to find\n\nThat’s partly because the cheapest price wasn’t all that cheap — the $4.47 a gallon average price in Georgia gives it the cheapest statewide average. Less than 300 gas stations out of 130,000 nationwide were charging $4.25 a gallon or less in Friday’s reading from OPIS. For purposes of comparison, before the run-up in prices earlier this year, the record national average for gas had been $4.11, set in July 2008.\n\nAnd even in some states with cheaper gas prices, such as Mississippi, lower average wages mean that drivers there have to work more hours to earn the money needed to fill their tank than drivers in some of the higher priced gas states, such as Washington.\n\nThere are some early signs that people are starting to cut back on their driving in the face of the higher prices, but it’s still a modest decline.\n\nThe number of gallons pumped at stations in the last week of May was down about 5% from the same week a year ago, according to OPIS, even though gas prices have risen more than 50% since then. The number of US trips by car has slipped about 5% since early May, according to mobility research firm Inrix, although those trips are still up about 5% since the start of the year.\n\nThe chief concern is that consumers will cut back on other spending to keep driving which could push an economy already showing signs of weakness into recession.\n\nNumerous reasons for record prices\n\nBeyond the strong demand for gasoline, there is also a supply problem that’s driving up the price of both oil and gasoline. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the sanctions on Russia imposed in the United States and Europe since then is a major factor, since Russia was among the world’s leading oil exporters. But it is only part of the cause.\n\nOil is a commodity traded on global markets. The United States has never imported significant amounts of oil from Russia, but Europe has traditionally been dependent on Russian exports. The EU’s recent decision to ban oil tanker shipments from Russia sent oil prices soaring globally.\n\nThe price of a barrel of crude closed above $120 a barrel Friday, up from just less than $100 a month ago. Goldman Sachs recently predicted the average price for a barrel of Brent crude, the benchmark used for oil traded in Europe, will be $140 a barrel between July and September, up from its prior call of $125 a barrel.\n\nOther factors beyond Russia’s withdrawal from the global market are limiting supply. OPEC and its allies have sharply cut back oil production as demand for oil crashed in the early months of the pandemic, as much of the world’s businesses shut down and people stayed close to home. Global oil futures briefly traded in negative territory due to lack of space to store the glut of oil. Some oil producing nations slashed production in an effort to support prices, and some of that production is back online but not all of it.\n\nUS oil production and refining capacity also have not fully recovered to the pre-pandemic levels. And because prices are even higher in Europe, some US and Canadian refineries that would normally supply the US market with gas are exporting gasoline to Europe.\n\nMany oil companies have been slow to increase production, despite the high price that the oil could fetch, instead using those soaring profits to buy back their own stock in an effort to raise their share price. ExxonMobi has announced it intends to repurchase $30 billion of its stock, more than its total capital spending budget for the year.\n\n– CNN’s Matt Egan and Michelle Watson contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/investing/adidas-q1-profit-china/index.html", "title": "Adidas profit drops 38% due to lockdowns in China | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nAdidas (ADDDF) on Friday blamed poor sales in China for a sharp drop in first quarter profit.\n\nThe German sportswear giant reported net profit of €310 million ($327 million) in the first three months of 2022, down 38% on the same period last year.\n\nThe company said the decline was caused by a “challenging market environment” in China, where sales fell 35%, as well as supply chain disruptions.\n\nWith no end in sight to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy, the outlook for Adidas’ business in China — which accounted for about 20% of the company’s sales last year — is grim.\n\nCovid lockdowns introduced recently have forced a large number of stores to close.

One is the science story, which is this remarkable speed with which the vaccines were developed. But there's also the debates regarding policy, politics and political affiliation. It's one word that carries these two huge stories,\" he said.\n\nThe selection follows \"vax\" as word of the year from the folks who publish the Oxford English Dictionary. And it comes after Merriam-Webster chose \"pandemic\" as tops in lookups last year on its online site.\n\n\"The pandemic was the gun going off and now we have the aftereffects,\" Sokolowski said.\n\nFact check:Vaccines protect against contracting, spreading COVID-19\n\nAt Merriam-Webster, lookups for \"vaccine\" increased 601% over 2020, when the first U.S. shot was administered in New York in December after quick development, and months of speculation and discussion over efficacy. The world's first jab occurred earlier that month in the U.K.\n\nCompared to 2019, when there was little urgency or chatter about vaccines, Merriam-Webster logged an increase of 1,048% in lookups this year. Debates over inequitable distribution, vaccine mandates and boosters kept interest high, Sokolowski said. So did vaccine hesitancy and friction over vaccine passports.\n\nThe word \"vaccine\" wasn't birthed in a day, or due to a single pandemic. The first known use stretches back to 1882 but references pop up earlier related to fluid from cowpox pustules used in inoculations, Sokolowski said. It was borrowed from the New Latin \"vaccina,\" which goes back to Latin's feminine \"vaccinus,\" meaning \"of or from a cow.\"\n\nThe Latin for cow is \"vacca,\" a word that might be akin to the Sanskrit \"vasa,\" according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nInoculation, on the other hand, dates to 1714, in one sense referring to the act of injecting an \"inoculum.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Merriam-Webster added to its online entry for \"vaccine\" to cover all the talk of mRNA vaccines, or messenger vaccines such as those for COVID-19 developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\n\nWhile other dictionary companies choose words of the year by committee, Merriam-Webster bases its selection on lookup data, paying close attention to spikes and, more recently, year-over-year increases in searches after weeding out evergreens. The company has been declaring a word of the year since 2008. Among its runners-up in the word biography of 2021:\n\nInsurrection: Interest was driven by the deadly Jan. 6 siege on the U.S. Capitol. Arrests continue, as do congressional hearings over the attack by supporters of former President Donald Trump. Some of Trump's allies have resisted subpoenas, including Steve Bannon.\n\nSearches for the word increased by 61,000% over 2020, Sokolowksi said.\n\nInfrastructure: President Joe Biden was able to deliver what Trump often spoke of but never achieved: a bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law. When Biden proposed help with broadband access, eldercare and preschool, conversation changed from not only roads and bridges but \"figurative infrastructure,\" Sokolowski said.\n\n\"Many people asked, what is infrastructure if it's not made out of steel or concrete? Infrastructure, in Latin, means underneath the structure,\" he said.\n\nPerseverance: It's the name of NASA's latest Mars rover. It landed Feb. 18, 2021. \"Perseverance is the most sophisticated rover NASA has ever sent to the Red Planet, with a name that embodies NASA's passion, and our nation's capability, to take on and overcome challenges,\" the space agency said.\n\nThe name was thought up by Alexander Mather, a 14-year-old seventh-grader at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia. He participated in an essay contest organized by NASA. He was one of 28,000 K-12 students to submit entries.\n\nNomad: The word had its moment with the 2020 release of the film \"Nomadland.\" It went on to win three Oscars in April 2021, including best picture, director (Chloé Zhao) and actress (Frances McDormand). Zhao became the first woman of color to win best director.\n\nThe AP's film writer Jake Coyle called the indie success \"a plain-spoken meditation on solitude, grief and grit.

It's probably the word by which we'll refer to this period in the future,” he said.\n\nThe word took on urgent specificity in March, when the coronavirus outbreak was designated a pandemic, but it started to trend up on Merriam-Webster.com as early as January and again in February when the first U.S. deaths and outbreaks on cruise ships occurred.\n\nOn March 11, when the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, lookups on the site for pandemic spiked. Site interest for the word has remained significantly high through the year, Sokolowski said.\n\nSearches for \"pandemic\" on March 11 were 115,806% higher than look-ups experienced on the same date last year, Sokolowski said.\n\n\"Pandemic,\" with roots in Latin and Greek, is a combination of “pan,” for all, and “demos,” for people or population. The latter is the same root of “democracy,” Sokolowski noted. The word \"pandemic\" dates to the mid-1600s, used broadly for “universal” and more specifically to disease in a medical text in the 1660s, he said.\n\nThat was after the plagues of the Middle Ages, Sokolowski said.\n\nHe attributes the traffic for \"pandemic\" not entirely to searchers who didn't know what it meant but also to those on the hunt for more detail, or for inspiration or comfort.\n\n“We see that the word 'love' is looked up around Valentine's Day and the word 'cornucopia' is looked up at Thanksgiving,” Sokolowski said. “We see a word like 'surreal' spiking when a moment of national tragedy or shock occurs. It's the idea of dictionaries being the beginning of putting your thoughts in order.”\n\nMerriam-Webster acted quickly in March to add and update entries on its site for words related to the pandemic. While “coronavirus” had been in the dictionary for decades, “COVID-19” was coined in February. Thirty-four days later, Merriam-Webster had it up online, along with a couple of dozen other entries that were revised to reflect the health emergency.\n\n“That's the shortest period of time we've ever seen a word go from coinage to entry,” Sokolowski said. “The word had this urgency.”\n\n\"Coronavirus\" was among runners-up for word of the year as it jumped into the mainstream. \"Quarantine,\" \"asymptomatic,\" \"mamba,\" \"kraken,\" \"defund,\" \"antebellum,\" \"irregardless,\" \"icon,\" \"schadenfreude\" and \"malarkey\" also were runners-up based on search spikes around specific events.\n\nParticularly interesting to word nerds like Sokolowski, a lexicographer, is \"quarantine.\" With Italian roots, it was used during the Black Death of the 1300s for the period of time a new ship coming into port would have to wait outside a city to prevent disease. The “quar” in quarantine derives from 40, for the 40 days required.\n\nSpikes for \"mamba\" occurred after the death in January of Kobe Bryant, whose nickname was the Black Mamba. A mass of searches occurred for \"kraken\" in July after Seattle's new National Hockey League franchise chose the mythical sea monster as its name, urged along by fans.\n\nCountry group Lady Antebellum's name change to Lady A drove dictionary interest in June, and \"malarkey\" got a boost from President-elect Joe Biden, who's fond of using the word. \"Icon\" was front and center in headlines after the deaths of Rep. John Lewis and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster site has about 40 million unique monthly users and about 100 million monthly page views.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/01/03/michigan-university-banished-words-list/9076189002/", "title": "Michigan university releases 2022 Banished Words List", "text": "Wait, what?

It is continuing to evolve and we saw that in many ways.”\n\nThe site offers two definitions for allyship: The role of a person who advocates for inclusion of a “marginalized or politicized group” in solidarity but not as a member, and the more traditional relationship of “persons, groups or nations associating and cooperating with one another for a common cause or purpose.”\n\nThe word is set apart from “alliance,” which Dictionary.com defines in one sense as a “merging of efforts or interests by persons, families, states or organizations.”\n\nIt's the first definition that took off most recently in the mid-2000s and has continued to churn. Following the summer of 2020 and the death of George Floyd, white allies — and the word allyship — proliferated as racial justice demonstrations spread. Before that, straight allies joined the causes of LGBTQ oppression, discrimination and marginalization.\n\n“This year, we saw a lot of businesses and organizations very prominently, publicly, beginning efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Allyship is tied to that. In the classroom, there is a flashpoint around the term critical race theory. Allyship connects with this as well,” Kelly said.\n\nIn addition, teachers, frontline workers and mothers who juggled jobs, home duties and child care in lockdown gained allies as the pandemic took hold last year.\n\nWithout an entry for “allyship,” Kelly said the site saw a steep rise in lookups for “ally” in 2020 and large spikes in 2021. It was in the top 850 searches out of thousands and thousands of words this year. Dictionary.com broadened the definition of “ally” to include the more nuanced meaning. The terms “DEI” and “critical race theory” made their debuts as entries on the site with “allyship” this year.\n\nWhat it means to be an authentic ally has taken on fresh significance as buzz around the word has grown louder. One of the aspects of allyship, as it has emerged, is how badly it can go.\n\nAmong the example's of how to use the word in a sentence cited by Merriam-Webster is this one written by Native activist Hallie Sebastian: “Poor allyship is speaking over marginalized people by taking credit and receiving recognition for arguments that the unprivileged have been making for their entire lives.”\n\nAs global diversity, equity and inclusion executive Sheree Atcheson wrote in Forbes, allyship is a “lifelong process of building relationships based on trust, consistency and accountability with marginalized individuals and/or groups of people.” It's not, she said, “self-defined — work and efforts must be recognized by those you are seeking to ally with.”\n\nAllyship should be an “opportunity to grow and learn about ourselves, whilst building confidence in others,” Atcheson added.\n\nAmong the earliest evidence of the word “allyship,” in its original sense of “alliance,” is the 1849, two-volume work, “The Lord of the Manor, or, Lights and Shades of Country Life” by British novelist Thomas Hall: “Under these considerations, it is possible, he might have heard of Miss Clough’s allyship with the Lady Bourgoin.”\n\nKelly did some additional digging into the history of allyship in its social justice sense. While the Oxford English Dictionary dates that use of the word to the 1970s, Kelly found a text, “Allies of the Negro” by Albert W. Hamilton, published in 1943. It discusses extensively the potential allies of Black people in the struggle for racial equality:\n\n“What some white liberals are beginning to realize is that they better begin to seek the Negro as an ally,” he wrote. “The new way of life sought by the liberal will be a sham without the racial equality the Negro seeks. And the inclusion of the Negro in the day-to-day work, in the organization, the leadership and the rallying of the support necessary to win a better world, can only be done on the basis of equality.”\n\nOn the other side of allyship, Kelly said, \"is a feeling of division, of polarization. That was Jan. 6.” Allyship, he said, became a powerful prism in terms of the dichotomy at a chaotic cultural time during the last two years.\n\nOther dictionary companies in the word of the year game focused on the pandemic and its fallout for their picks. Oxford Languages, which oversees the Oxford English Dictionary, went for “vax” and Merriam-Webster chose “vaccine.” The Glasgow, Scotland-based Collins Dictionary, meanwhile, plucked “NFT,” the digital tokens that sell for millions.\n\nWhile Merriam-Webster relies solely on site search data to choose a word of the year, Dictionary.com takes a broader approach. It scours search engines, a broad range of text and taps into cultural influences to choose its word of the year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/12/15/us-dictionary-names-culture-word-of-the-year/20425623/", "title": "Merriam-Webster names 'culture' word of the year", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — A nation, a workplace, an ethnicity, a passion, an outsized personality. The people who comprise these things, who fawn or rail against them, are behind U.S. dictionary Merriam-Webster's 2014 word of the year: \"culture.\"\n\nThe word joins Oxford Dictionaries' \"vape,\" a darling of the e-cigarette movement, and \"exposure,\" declared the year's winner at Dictionary.com during a time of tragedy and fear because of Ebola.\n\nMerriam-Webster based its pick and nine runners-up on significant increases in lookups in 2014 compared to 2013 on Merriam-Webster.com, along with interesting, often culture-driven — if you will — spikes of concentrated interest.\n\nIn the No. 2 spot is \"nostalgia,\" during a year of big 50th anniversaries pegged to 1964: the start of the free speech movement, the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the birth of the Ford Mustang and the British Invasion heralded by the landing of the Beatles on U.S. soil for the first time.\n\nNostalgia was followed by insidious, legacy, feminism and a rare multiword phrase that can be looked up in total, in a foreign language at that: the French \"je ne sais quoi,\" or \"a pleasant quality that is hard to describe.\"\n\nThe Springfield, Massachusetts-based dictionary company filters out perennial favorites when picking word of the year, but does that formula leave them chasing language fads?\n\n\"We're simply using the word 'culture' more frequently,\" said Peter Sokolowski, editor at large for Merriam-Webster. \"It may be a fad. It may not. It may simply be evolution.\"\n\nSokolowski noted that the reasons words are looked up aren't just about not knowing what they mean. Sometimes, he said, we seek inspiration or a way to check in on ourselves. Of an estimated 100 million lookups on the website each year and a similar number on the company's app, culture enjoyed a 15 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nPercentage-wise, it doesn't sound like much, but the raw number in that stratosphere is large, Sokolowski said. He wouldn't disclose actual numbers, though, citing the proprietary nature of that data for a company still privately held.\n\nSokolowski is a lexicographer, not a mind reader, so his observations about why any single word takes off in terms of lookups is well-informed but theoretical.\n\n\"The word 'culture' (has) got a cultural story. We have noticed for years that 'culture' has a cyclical spike every year at around Labor Day. That is to say back to school time during the month of September, so we've been watching this word spike at that time for years,\" he said by telephone from Springfield. \"In recent years, we've seen similar spikes at the end of semesters during finals.\"\n\nBut traffic throughout the year indicates that the word \"culture\" is a \"chameleon,\" Sokolowski said. \"When you put it next to another word it means something very different. For example, 'consumer culture' or 'rape culture,' which we've been reading about lately.\"\n\nThere's the \"culture of transparency\" in government and business, and \"celebrity culture,\" and the \"culture of winning\" in sports, he noted. \"It's a word that can be very specific, like 'test prep culture,' or it can be very, very broad, like 'coffee culture.'\"\n\nOne standout reference that caught Sokolowski's eye in The New Yorker magazine's December issue is from a new book, \"How Google Works,\" which includes a description of a software fix by a few engineers that made ads more relevant on the search engine.\n\n\"It wasn't Google's culture that turned those five engineers into problem-solving ninjas who changed the course of the company over the weekend,\" wrote the authors, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and former head of product development Jonathan Rosenberg.\n\n\"Rather it was the culture that attracted the ninjas to the company in the first place.\"\n\nBefore the word \"culture\" exploded, Sokolowski said, \"we used to talk about 'society' a lot. Certain groups are taking 'society' out of their names now. It seems to be receding. Part of that seems to be because it's elitist. We're using the word 'culture' more frequently in that place.\"\n\nNot all lookup spikes are quite that complex. The reason \"je ne sais quoi\" landed at No. 6, for instance, is \"dead simple,\" he said.\n\nThe fast-food drive-in chain Sonic, known for TV spots featuring two goofy dudes eating in a car, had them munching on boneless chicken wings in September.\n\n\"I've finally found myself a wingman,\" goofy guy No. 1 says of the wings he hopes will make him a chick magnet.\n\n\"Oh right,\" sneers goofy guy No. 2, \"gonna give you that certain je ne sais quoi.\"\n\nResponds No. 1: \"Jenna said what?\"\n\nThey mine the word play a couple more times, but you get the picture.\n\n\"Since September when this ad came out this word has been close to the Top 10 or in the Top 10 of our lookups almost every single day,\" Sokolowski said.\n\nFast-food aside, he called this year's list a relatively sober one.\n\nInsidious, for example, received a bump early in the year when a new trailer was released for \"Insidious: Chapter 3,\" a prequel in the horror film franchise \"Insidious,\" out in June. The word surfaced in a big way again, on Oct. 8, when a Texas hospital released a statement on the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first confirmed Ebola patient in the U.S.\n\nThe statement spoke of his courageous battle and the hospital's profound sadness when he \"succumbed to an insidious disease, Ebola.\"\n\nRounding out the Top 10 are innovation, surreptitious, autonomy and morbidity.\n\n\"This is a fairly sober list.

This will be the first state visit of the Biden-Harris administration,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during Monday’s press briefing.\n\nThe state visit, which will include a state dinner, “will underscore the deep and enduring relationship between the United States and France – our oldest ally,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\n“Our close relationship with France is founded on our shared democratic values, economic ties and defense and security cooperation. The leaders will discuss our continued close partnership on shared global challenges and areas of bilateral interest,” she added.\n\nBiden is holding his first state dinner more than halfway through his term in office – later than previous US presidents. Jean-Pierre acknowledged Monday that “Covid certainly has delayed many of the in-person events a president traditionally hosts at the White House,” but highlighted previous White House visits by world leaders earlier in Biden’s term.\n\nThe tradition of the White House state visit – which is typically a multi-day affair that entails formal ceremonies, meetings and a glitzy black tie dinner – has been dwindling.\n\nThe Trumps welcomed the Macrons for their administration’s first state dinner in 2018. Their second and final state visit took place in 2019, when the White House hosted then-Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Trumps were also slated to host the King and Queen of Spain in 2020 – an event that was postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic.\n\nMacron and Biden have spoken to one another several times since Biden took office in January 2021. Most recently, they met last week in New York as world leaders gathered for the United Nations General Assembly. The two discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, Iran, the Indo-Pacific and challenges posed by China, according to the White House.\n\nBiden and Macron held their first formal meeting in June 2021 during the G7 Summit in England, walking away having relayed that they were on the same page. Macron heaped praise on Biden as being “part of the club” following a more fraught relationship with former US President Donald Trump.\n\nMacron, now in his second term, has emerged as the leading voice to advocate for the European Union. Since the warm G7 meeting, a number of global challenges have emerged, setting Macron up to distinguish himself on the world stage.\n\nA failed deal for France to produce nuclear-powered submarines for Australia caused a major international rift.\n\nIn September 2021, the French government recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia for consultation in response to an announced national security partnership that would provide the US-produced submarines to Australia – abandoning a $90 billion existing deal with France to provide their submarines to the country.\n\nLater that fall, Biden admitted that his administration was “clumsy” in its handling of the deal, saying he was “under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through.” And earlier this summer, France’s defense minister said the country aimed to rebuild its relationship with Australia.\n\nWestern leaders, including Biden and Macron, have broadly united in their opposition to combat Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine.\n\nFrance has also been a key player in negotiations to curb Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nPressed on Monday whether the decision to host France was about mending ties following some rifts earlier in Biden’s term, Jean-Pierre responded, “We deeply value our relationship with France. … We work closely with France on the full range of global challenges, as you all know, including the war in Ukraine. It is for these reasons that the President and first lady thought it was important to welcome this close and valued partner to the White House for their first state visit.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Jim Acosta", "Maegan Vazquez", "Jim Acosta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/politics/joe-biden-mohammed-bin-salman/index.html", "title": "White House working towards first presidential meeting with Saudi ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, could meet for the first time as soon as next month, multiple sources told CNN. A meeting would come after months of diplomatic heavy lifting and represent a turnabout for a US president who once declared Saudi Arabia a “pariah” with “no redeeming social value.”\n\nBiden administration officials are in talks with the Saudis about arranging a potential in-person meeting while the President is overseas next month, current and former US officials said. Saudi Arabia currently holds the presidency of the Gulf Cooperation Council, so any engagement between Biden and bin Salman, known as MBS, would likely coincide with a meeting of the GCC in Riyadh, the sources noted.\n\n“You should count on something like this happening, it just comes down to when, not if,” a former US official familiar with the discussions said. Saudi officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA meeting between American and Saudi leaders would have once been considered routine, but now marks a significant shift due to the recent strain in the relationship. It would also likely spark some controversy at home for Biden, who has been highly critical of the Saudis’ record on human rights, its war in Yemen, and the role its government played in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nFor Biden, a return to better relations with Saudi Arabia reflects the sometimes uncomfortable choices a leader must make when navigating the complex politics of oil, human rights and the web of Middle Eastern relations.\n\nTalk of a rapprochement with the Saudis, the world’s largest exporter of crude oil, comes as gasoline prices continue creeping higher in the US.\n\nThe balance is particularly difficult because Biden repeatedly criticized his predecessor, Donald Trump, for his cozy relationships with the world’s strongmen and dictators – including MBS of Saudi. Biden entered office vowing to restore democratic values to US foreign policy and had sought to recalibrate relations with Riyadh.\n\nBiden has not engaged directly with MBS, considered the day-to-day ruler of Saudi Arabia, since taking office, opting instead to speak directly with MBS’s father, King Salman, the ailing 86-year old monarch.\n\nThe President was opposed to engaging with Prince Mohammed as a matter of principle because of his role in the murder of Khashoggi, US officials said. Just three months into Biden’s presidency, his chief of intelligence released a declassified report stating that MBS was ultimately responsible for Khashoggi’s grisly murder.\n\nThe Biden administration sanctioned Saudi officials who were part of the hit team but stopped short of penalizing MBS himself. Officials said Biden believed taking action against the prince directly could cause irreparable damage to a relationship that is critical for counterterrorism and confronting Iran.\n\nBiden did, however, announce in February 2021 that he was ending US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen and also reversed the Trump-era decision to designate the Iran-backed Houthi rebels as terrorists.\n\nPost-Ukraine reset\n\nBiden himself has remained cautious in how to approach Saudi Arabia, officials said, hoping to both avoid a full breakdown in relations while still maintaining his commitment to promoting democracy abroad.\n\nWith that dynamic as a backdrop, the National Security Council’s Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk and the State Department’s Senior Adviser for Global Energy Security Amos Hochstein have been working behind the scenes to repair the relationship. The pair have traveled to Saudi Arabia four times since December, one senior official told CNN, most recently to Riyadh in February where they met with MBS directly to try to build diplomatic goodwill and lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Biden and the crown prince.\n\nDiscussions have become more urgent over the last two months, as the US has tried to isolate Russia globally over its attack on Ukraine – only to see MBS refuse to condemn the Russians and repeatedly decline, on behalf of OPEC, to increase oil output.\n\nOn Tuesday, MBS’ younger brother Khalid bin Salman traveled to Washington, DC and met with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Hochstein and other officials. KBS, as he is known, is also co-chairing a meeting of the US-Saudi Arabia Strategic Joint Planning Committee this week at the Pentagon.\n\nAs Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to roil global energy markets and the West is forced to rely on other sources of oil – from allies and foes alike – there have been increased debates within the administration about the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with Saudi Arabia, despite its egregious human rights record.\n\nSome in the White House, including Chief of Staff Ron Klain, have repeatedly emphasized how high gasoline prices are hurting the President politically.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has sought to undercut US attempts to build back its relationships with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries. The Kremlin has in recent weeks proposed hosting a meeting of its own of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which would cut out the United States, two sources familiar the deliberations told CNN.\n\nBalancing act\n\nAt the same time, some officials have voiced a desire to avoid the appearance that Biden is backing away from his pledge to keep democratic values at the forefront of his foreign agenda. The White House is highly attuned to what would likely be bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill to a full rapprochement with Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn top of the high-profile killing of Khashoggi, who was a US resident, the Biden administration has repeatedly expressed alarm over Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses of its own citizens. The administration is also tracking at least three Americans who are unable to leave the Kingdom because they are under a Saudi travel ban. US lawmakers from both parties have reached out to Biden to ask him to work to release Sarah and Omar Aljabri, the children of former senior Saudi counterterrorism official Saad Aljabri, who have been imprisoned.\n\nAljabri, who worked for years with US national security officials and maintains close relations with them, has accused MBS of sending assassins to Canada to kill him. The head of US intelligence, Avril Haines, intervened last year in a case brought against Aljabri by MBS-backed companies that accused him of embezzlement because she said it threatened to reveal US national security secrets.\n\nIn a recent plea to the White House, Aljabri offered to settle all financial and legal disputes with Saudi Arabia if his children are returned.\n\nThe Iran question\n\nDiscussions over a Saudi meeting come at the same time the Biden administration is trying to wrap up negotiations with Saudi Arabia’s regional archrival, Iran, on a new nuclear deal.\n\nSaudi Araba has been waging war in Yemen against Iran-backed rebels, the Houthis, in a devastating conflict that the US has supported militarily. In January, the Houthis claimed an attack on Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, which UAE leaders felt the US did not respond to aggressively enough.\n\nThis week, the US sent a high-level delegation led by Vice President Kamala Harris to the UAE for the funeral of its president, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a deliberate attempt to smooth things over, observers said.\n\nFor those who have worried that the Biden administration has weakened security partnerships with two key Arab allies, a potential meeting between Biden and GCC leaders this summer would be a welcome change.\n\n“Because of our multiple shared national security interests, [a meeting] is a good thing,” said the former US official familiar with the meeting discussions.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Alex Marquardt Kevin Liptak", "Natasha Bertrand", "Alex Marquardt", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/middleeast/biden-visits-saudi-mbs-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Don't expect sword dances when Biden visits Saudi | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN —\n\nFrom having “no redeeming social value” to being a “strategic partner” of the United States. That’s how far Saudi Arabia has come in President Joe Biden’s eyes since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw oil prices soaring to eight-year highs.\n\nRelations between Saudi Arabia and the US have deteriorated significantly since Biden replaced Donald Trump in the Oval Office. But that’s changing now as Biden makes his first visit to the kingdom as President this week and is likely to rub shoulders with the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS).\n\nBoth former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump were ridiculed for bowing to the Saudi king during trips to the kingdom. Trump even made history by picking Saudi Arabia for his first presidential visit, which was characterized by sword dances, glowing orbs and pomp.\n\nBiden is keen to save face by carefully choreographing the optics. In stark contrast to his predecessors, he isn’t even going to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, opting instead to hold a multilateral summit with regional leaders in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. The message is clear: This isn’t a state visit.\n\nBoth sides are going to spin the trip for their own political advantage, but the body language, handshakes and public statements will be most telling.\n\nTo get a real sense of where relations stand, here’s what to watch out for:\n\nA call for Saudi Arabia to pump more oil\n\nFaced with high gas prices and inflation that’s rising at the fastest pace since 1981, Biden needs to sell his trip domestically as being in the interest of the American public. The White House has said the visit would be “delivering results for the American people.”\n\nBut the administration is also keen to dispel the notion that Biden is going to Saudi Arabia hat-in-hand for more oil. Energy will be discussed given that Saudi Arabia is the chair of the OPEC oil cartel and its largest exporter, the White House has said, but that won’t be the primary purpose of the trip. The administration will convey its “general view” that there needs to be “adequate supply in the global market,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday.\n\nGulf Arab oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia, have been insisting that there’s no shortage of oil supply on the global market, and have opted to stick to OPEC’s alliance with Russia to control output.\n\nWatch out for: Biden publicly calling for more oil productio n; Saudis saying the market needs more oil; Saudi comments on the future of OPEC’s alliance with Russia.\n\nAcknowledgment of MBS’ leadership\n\nLess than a month into his presidency, the White House said Biden would interact with Saudi Arabia on the head-of-state level, as the relationship with the kingdom would be “recalibrated.” The message was that MBS – the de facto ruler of the kingdom – would be shunned and dealings would only be with the king.\n\nAs recently as last month, the White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the President’s position on Saudi Arabia “still stands,” responding to a reporter’s question on whether Biden considers the kingdom to be a “pariah.”\n\nBut that could be about to change. The Biden administration says it plans to “reset” its relationship with Riyadh, and that the President’s meetings with Saudi officials will “include” MBS. But the White House has been vague on whether Biden and MBS will have a one-on-one meeting, or even if they’ll shake hands.\n\nWatch out for: A public handshake between Biden and MBS, or a photo-op; Biden directly addressing MBS as a leader of Saudi Arabia ; a one-on-one meeting between the two.\n\nCommitment to Saudi security\n\nSaudi Arabia has been frustrated by what it sees as the US’ waning interest in its security – but that view predates the Biden presidency. When Saudi oil facilities were bombed in a 2019 attack the Trump administration blamed on Iran, the US chose not to act, despite the event leading to the biggest jump in oil prices on record.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also begun strengthening its military ties with Washington’s foe, China, a move that has raised eyebrows in Congress.\n\nBut the US has stepped up its rhetoric in support of Gulf security of late. It has however maintained a ban on the sale of offensive weapons to the kingdom since February last year due to its war in Yemen, but there’s a truce in place in Yemen now, and the US has praised Saudi efforts to achieve it.\n\nUS officials have told CNN that Saudi Arabia is seeking a viable strategy to deal with Iran as well as US security commitments should nuclear talks with Tehran fail. And Israel has said that it is working with regional partners to build a US-led Middle East air defense alliance. It’s not clear which other countries will be involved.\n\nBiden is also expected to make a “major statement” on the administration’s strategy for the Middle East, Sullivan said on Monday.\n\nWatch out for: The US overturning the ban on the sale of offensive weapons; a new strategy to protect Gulf states from Iran; an official announcement of a US-led Middle East air defense alliance.\n\nSaudi-Israel relations\n\nUS officials have told CNN that relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, who don’t have official diplomatic relations, are steadily improving and that discussions are underway to expand Israeli commercial planes’ access to Saudi airspace.\n\nLast month Israel’s then-Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told a news conference that Israel expects Biden’s visit will bring some small steps toward closer ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Biden himself has his administration is working to “deepen and expand” normalization between Israel and Arab nations.\n\nMBS has made it clear he doesn’t view Israel as an enemy, but rather as a “potential ally, with many interests that we can pursue together,” according to state media.\n\nWatch out for: Statements from Biden or Saudi Arabia on potential relations with Israel, Israeli overflights or economic cooperation between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nHuman rights and the Yemen war\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the administration needs to “move past” the murder of Jamal Khashoggi “for the sake of achieving peace and stability in the Middle East.”\n\nUS sources have told CNN that the President nonetheless plans to raise the Khashoggi murder directly with MBS. On Monday, Sullivan said Biden’s human rights agenda “will be on display” during his trip.\n\nThe Biden administration had also been frustrated at the lack of significant progress in the Yemen war and the humanitarian disaster it has caused, but it has been working with Saudi Arabia to extend a ceasefire in the country.\n\nWatch out for: A public mention from Biden of Khashoggi or Saudi Arabia’s human rights record ; new efforts or commitments to end the Yemen war.\n\nThe digest\n\nPutin announces trip to Iran\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will travel to Tehran on July 19, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, and will hold talks with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nBackground: “President Putin’s trip to Tehran is being prepared. There will be a meeting of the heads of guarantor states of the Astana process, a process to promote Syrian regulation,” Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday. “Putin, [Raisi] and Erdogan will hold a meeting,” Peskov said, adding that, in addition to the trilateral meeting, there will also be a bilateral meeting between Putin and Erdogan.\n\nWhy it matters: As Western sanctions clamp down on Russia to cripple its war effort in Ukraine, alliances with other US-sanctioned states are on the rise. A member of NATO, Turkey has refused to sanction Russia and has tried to play a mediating role in its conflict with Ukraine. Iran, on the other hand, has been highlighting its close friendship with Russia, with the White House on Monday saying that Iran is preparing to supply Russian forces with drones and training.\n\nIran to supply Russia with weapons-capable drones, White House says\n\nThe US has information indicating that Iran is preparing to supply Russia with “several hundred” drones – including weapons-capable drones – and begin training Russian forces on how to operate them as early as this late July, National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Monday. When asked about the accusations during a conference call with journalists on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian Presidency had “no comments on this matter.” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Tuesday there are “no new developments” regarding Iran’s supply of “modern technologies” to Russia.\n\nBackground: Sullivan told reporters at the White House news briefing as the war on Ukraine has continued, Russia has incurred “severe costs” on the battlefield, with efforts to establish territory in the east “coming at a cost to the sustainment of its own weapons.”\n\nWhy it matters: Iran’s armed proxies in Yemen have previously launched drone attacks on oil-giants Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who have expressed concerns, along with Israel, over an emboldened Iran following the signing of a renewed nuclear deal. Sullivan told reporters that “this is just one example of how Russia is looking to countries like Iran for capabilities that … have been used before we got the ceasefire in place in Yemen to attack Saudi Arabia.”\n\nClick here to watch Becky Anderson’s interview with expert Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi on Iran’s drones.\n\nUS, Israel to sign “Jerusalem Declaration” during Biden visit, Israel says\n\nThe US and Israel will release a joint memorandum of understanding during President Joe Biden’s visit in Jerusalem this week that will serve as a “blueprint” for the bilateral relationship over the next few years, senior Israeli officials told reporters on Tuesday. Dubbed the “Jerusalem Declaration,” it will highlight areas of joint interest and concern among the two countries, the officials said, with Iran being foremost among those concerns.\n\nBackground: The potential declaration would come as Biden makes his debut trip to the Middle East as President, which will see him meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders before traveling to Saudi Arabia. Prospects for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians aren’t high on the administration’s agenda but Biden instead plans to focus on expanding and deepening Israel’s ties to Arab states.\n\nWhy it matters: The document will also make clear the United States’ readiness to promote further normalization of ties between Israel and Arab countries. A senior Israeli official said Saudi Arabia is an integral part of the “transformation of the Middle East,” adding that Biden’s trip will be the first steps toward normalizing ties between Israel and the Kingdom.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nMore than 20 million tons of grain are stuck in Ukraine, as food exports face major disruptions amid Russia’s war on its neighbor.

It’s the third time in recent months – including during a CNN town hall in October – that Biden has said the US would protect Taiwan from a Chinese attack, only to have the White House walk back those remarks.\n\nDuring a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, Biden was asked if the US would be willing to go further to help Taiwan in the event of an invasion than it did with Ukraine.\n\n“You didn’t want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?” a reporter asked.\n\n“Yes,” Biden replied. “That’s the commitment we made.”\n\n“We agree with the One China policy. We signed on to it, and all the attendant agreements made from there, but the idea that it can be taken by force, just taken by force, is (just not) appropriate,” he said.\n\nUnder the “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. The US provides Taiwan defensive weapons, but has remained intentionally ambiguous on whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden's balancing act amid tensions between mainland China and Taiwan 02:41 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden’s strong warning was made right on China’s doorstep during his first trip to Asia as President. The visit is aimed at uniting allies and partners to counter China’s rising influence. It also came a day before Biden is scheduled to attend the second in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) – an informal grouping between the US, Japan, Australia and India that has alarmed Beijing.\n\nSeveral of Biden’s top administration officials were caught off-guard by the remarks, several aides told CNN, adding that they were not expecting Biden to be so unequivocal.\n\nIn a statement following Biden’s comments, a White House official said the US’ official position remained unchanged.\n\n“As the President said, our policy has not changed. He reiterated our One China policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself,” the official said.\n\nChina expresses ‘firm opposition’ to comments\n\nWithin hours, China had expressed its “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition” to Biden’s comments, saying it will not allow any external force to interfere in its “internal affairs.”\n\n“On issues concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and other core interests, there is no room for compromise,” said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\n“We urged the US side to earnestly follow the One China principle … be cautious in words and deeds on the Taiwan issue, and not send any wrong signal to pro-Taiwan independence and separatist forces — so it won’t cause serious damage to the situation across the Taiwan Strait and China-US relations.”\n\nChina’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian added, “We urge the US to stop saying or doing anything in violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués. … Those who play with fire will certainly burn themselves.”\n\nTaiwan lies fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) off the coast of China. For more than 70 years the two sides have been governed separately, but that hasn’t stopped China’s ruling Communist Party from claiming the island as its own — despite having never controlled it.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has said that “reunification” between China and Taiwan is inevitable and refused to rule out the use of force. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they’ve been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island.\n\nJoanne Ou, a spokesperson for Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN that it “expresses sincere welcome and gratitude to President Biden and the United States government for reiterating its rock solid commitment to Taiwan.”\n\nBiden compares potential invasion of Taiwan to Ukraine war\n\nBiden on Monday compared a potential invasion of Taiwan by China to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, warning, “It will dislocate the entire region,” and emphasizing “Russia has to pay a long-term price for its actions.”\n\n“And the reason I bother to say this, not just about Ukraine – if, in fact, after all (Russian President Vladimir Putin has) done, there’s a rapprochement … between the Ukrainians and Russia, and these sanctions are not continued to be sustained in many ways, then what signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting, attempting to take Taiwan by force?”\n\nBiden said that China is “already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the maneuvers they’re undertaking.”\n\n“But the United States is committed, we made a commitment, we support the One China policy, we support all we’ve done in the past, but that does not mean, it does not mean that China has the ability, has the, excuse me, jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan,” he added.\n\nAt the press conference, Kishida also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“Attempts to change the status quo by force, like Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, should never be tolerated in the Indo-Pacific, above all, in East Asia,” he said.\n\n“As the regional security environment becomes increasingly severe, I reaffirmed with President Biden that we need to speedily strengthen the deterrence and response of the Japan-US alliance,” he said, adding that he conveyed his determination to “fundamentally strengthen Japan’s defense capability.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Donald Judd Nectar Gan", "Kevin Liptak", "Donald Judd", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/joe-biden-consequential-week/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden's hugely consequential Covid isolation | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA fatigued, runny-nosed President Joe Biden entered Covid solitude on July 21 with his legislative agenda stalled, a standoff brewing with the House speaker and an unfinished plan to kill the world’s top terrorist with a drone.\n\nMore than two weeks later, Biden’s second stint in isolation appears to be ending, with his agenda suddenly revived, tensions with China dramatically ratcheted up and the terrorist dead.\n\nThe two-plus weeks Biden has spent with just his German Shepherd for company have proved some of the weightiest of his presidency, with his once-bleak legislative fortunes enjoying a surprise turnabout and his foreign policy shaken by events across the globe.\n\nEven some White House staffers said they felt a certain degree of whiplash, and Biden himself has mused to confidants at the sudden turn of events.\n\n“It’s been an extraordinary few days for the nation,” he told a virtual gathering of Democrats on Wednesday.\n\nLeft unsaid was how extraordinary those days had been for Biden himself, who oversaw almost all of it from the White House residence, isolating alone with only a bare-bones, in-person staff.\n\nThe brutal months that came before had lent the Biden presidency a sense of gloom, fueled by high prices, abysmal approval numbers and swirling questions about the President’s ability to lead. Many problems – like a growing outbreak of monkeypox, the war in Ukraine and shortages of baby formula – still persist, and a new crisis is emerging with China. Democrats running for office this year are still putting distance between themselves and the President.\n\nYet Biden and his allies are now enthused at the string of victories, which includes passage of major pieces of legislation, a long-sought agreement on a climate and taxation bill, a steady decline in the price of gasoline and a surge in hiring. A primary election this week in Kansas also gave Democrats new hope for the midterms.\n\nBiden, who tested negative for Covid-19 on Saturday, is preparing a victory lap of sorts, with major White House bill signings scheduled for several days next week in the Rose Garden – the type of ceremony that had eluded him for much of the past year – once he leaves isolation, pending a second negative test.\n\nMonday, July 25\n\nWhen Biden’s top Cabinet officials and national security advisers met with him on his fourth day of Covid isolation, the President’s nose had mostly stopped running. His voice seemed less raspy.\n\nAnd he had some questions.\n\nThe team had come prepared with a final intelligence assessment showing the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was living on the third floor of a safe-house in an upscale neighborhood of Kabul. A plan was nearly ready for the CIA to take him out with a Hellfire missile when he stepped onto his balcony.\n\nBut Biden wanted to know what lay behind the windows and door to the small outdoor patio. He asked about the layout of the rooms near where his team was proposing Zawahiri be killed. And were there any other options that would reduce the potential for civilian casualties?\n\nHe’d already spent time examining a small-scale model of the house that intelligence officials constructed and carried to the White House Situation Room in a worn wooden box. But he still needed to be convinced the mission wouldn’t come with collateral damage.\n\nThe meeting went on for several hours, one official said. Biden “pressed at a granular level,” another senior administration official added.\n\nThe meeting concluded with Biden going through each of his top advisers and asking their recommendation. Eleven years ago, during a similar go-around-the-table before the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Biden told then-President Barack Obama to hold off.\n\nThis time, Biden heard no opposition. And he authorized the strike.\n\nWednesday, July 27\n\nAt 9:12 a.m. ET, Biden swiped his nose with a cotton swab and hoped for the best. It was officially his sixth day isolating with Covid-19. His symptoms had disappeared. He’d started working out again in the White House gym.\n\nWorking mostly from the second-floor Treaty Room, an enormous oil painting of President William McKinley looking on, Biden had been going stir crazy during his isolation. The strike he’d authorized two days earlier was still in the works as operatives waited for the right moment.\n\nPresident Joe Biden removes his face mask as he arrives to speak about the economy during a meeting with CEOs in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 28, 2022. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Susan Walsh/AP\n\nHe’d taken to strolling out to the White House balcony to wave at visitors below.\n\nFifteen minutes later, only one pink line showed up on the Abbot rapid Covid-19 test: negative. Biden was thrilled. He joked his aides might be less so.\n\n“As I was walking out, I thought I heard a rumbling in my staff saying, ‘Oh, he’s back,’” he joked in the Rose Garden, buoyant at successfully weathering the virus that he’d spent more than two years trying to avoid.\n\nIt turned out beating Covid – or at least the initial bout – was not the biggest surprise that Wednesday. As Biden was returning to work in the Oval Office, a plan was being finalized on Capitol Hill that could amount to a dramatic reversal of fortune for a domestic agenda many had left for dead.\n\nStruck in total secret between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, the chamber’s most moderate Democrat, the climate and taxation bill came as a surprise to many inside the White House, though some officials had a general awareness the two men had restarted talks.\n\n“They were basically kept apprised of what was going on to a certain extent,” Manchin would tell reporters.\n\nWhen Biden learned the men had struck an agreement that afternoon, he placed a phone call to Manchin – who was isolating himself in the mountains of West Virginia following a Covid diagnosis – for their first formal talks about the President’s agenda since December.\n\nGathered in the dining room adjacent to the Oval Office for the first time in seven days with members of his staff — all masked just in case Biden’s Covid came back — the President turned on the television to watch another long-stalled piece of legislation pass the Senate. The bill investing in domestic computer chip production and scientific research was meant to bolster competitiveness with China.\n\nIt was China that was quickly becoming Biden’s next problem.\n\nThursday, July 28\n\nSitting behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, an open binder and stacks of loose briefing cards strewn in front of him, Biden had a message for Chinese President Xi Jinping: Nancy Pelosi would decide on her own whether to visit Taiwan.\n\nAlready, her potential visit was drawing fierce recrimination from Beijing and warnings from Chinese officials to other members of Congress not to join her.\n\nA day before he tested positive for Covid, Biden had informed reporters the military didn’t think it was a good moment for the woman who’s second in line to the US presidency to visit the self-governing island.\n\nHis defense secretary had spoken personally to the speaker to provide his assessment of the security situation.\n\nAnd two weeks earlier, the prospect of Pelosi’s visit arose in a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Chinese counterpart in Bali, according to a senior State Department official.\n\nSitting in the Oval Office for the marathon two-hour 17-minute phone call, Biden listened carefully as an interpreter translated a warning from Xi: “If you play with fire, you get burned.”\n\nMembers of his team inside the room – Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, the NSC Asia Coordinator Kurt Campbell and Senior Director Laura Rosenberger – weren’t surprised at the rhetoric. Xi had used similar turns of phrase on earlier phone calls.\n\nAs the call was concluding, Biden and Xi remarked at how much work they had created for their teams, a senior administration official said.\n\nSaturday, July 30\n\nAfter 11 days without leaving the White House, Biden was ready to break free. His home in Delaware – and his wife, whom he hadn’t seen in more than a week – were beckoning.\n\nThe rapid tests he’d been taking daily had all come back negative. He was back to his regular schedule in the gym. And he was planning a surprise visit to Capitol Hill, where protesters had been gathering after Republicans blocked a bill that would dramatically expand government benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\n\nSo, the news delivered by the White House medical team was less than welcome: “By the way,” Biden recounted being told, “it’s back.”\n\nA rebound infection was always viewed by Biden’s physician as a possibility, given similar incidents among those who took the antiviral drug Paxlovid. Beyond a cough, Biden’s symptoms never returned.\n\nBut it foiled his plans to escape the White House, a building he’d already come to view as a gilded cage, even before he was stuck there alone for more than two weeks.\n\nBiden dispatched his Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough with pizzas for the protesters at the Capitol and spoke to them on FaceTime.\n\n“I’ll tell you what, as long as I have a breath in me, I’m going to fight to get this done. As long as I have a breath in me,” he told them.\n\nWhile he was on FaceTime on the Truman Balcony, his team in the Situation Room was determining conditions were right for the strike on Zawahiri. Biden was informed as the sun was setting that the mission was underway. Twelve minutes before 10 p.m. ET, Zawahiri was dead.\n\nMonday, August 1\n\nThe dry cough was back. And Biden was staring down the possibility of a brand-new crisis.\n\nPelosi was hours from arriving in Taiwan, where the island’s leadership was preparing a lavish welcome. China had conducted live-fire exercises over the weekend on short notice, a sign of their extreme displeasure.\n\nAt the White House, national security officials saw indications that Beijing was positioning itself for further provocations, including firing missiles and sending fighter jets across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nAfter working over the previous weeks to apprise Pelosi of the risks of visiting Taiwan, including in briefings from Pentagon and other administration officials, there was a recognition by Monday she wouldn’t be scrapping the stop.\n\nBiden did not believe it was his place to tell Pelosi she should not go, and the two never spoke about it. He had avoided commenting publicly about her trip at all since his initial statement on July 21. At a certain point, administration officials determined it would be more damaging to be seen as against the trip than to have her go, whatever risks that entailed.\n\nIn any case, Biden was focused on another matter: announcing the death of Zawahiri. By Monday, officials were certain the man struck by two Hellfire missiles in Kabul on Saturday night was, in fact, the terror leader.\n\nThey didn’t have DNA test results, instead relying on visual confirmation. One official said they would never have Biden address the nation unless the identification was 100% certain.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House Monday, Aug. 1, 2022, in Washington, as he announces that a U.S. airstrike killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri in Afghanistan.

Biden once hoped to harness it in Michigan, planning a visit there for Tuesday to sign the China competitiveness bill.\n\nPresident Joe Biden appears on screen as he listens to SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, fourth from right, speak during a virtual meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, July 26, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Susan Walsh/AP\n\nThe trip got pulled down when Biden’s rebound case emerged. And while he met with semiconductor producers virtually instead, there is open fretting among some Democrats that his persistent struggle in selling his accomplishments will hamper any upside to his recent victories.\n\nDemocrats anxiously awaiting their fate in November’s midterms saw a glimmer of optimism that night when Kansas voters overwhelming rejected a measure that would have removed abortion right protections from the state constitution. Biden, whom activists accused of being caught flat-footed by the US Supreme Court’s decision to reverse Roe v. Wade, seized on the result almost immediately.\n\nYet of all the issues pending in Washington, it was the veterans bill that was the most personal to the President. He has long suspected his son Beau’s fatal cancer was linked to burn pit exposure in Iraq.\n\nWhen he watched the vote finally pass the Senate on Tuesday evening from the Treaty Room, Beau’s memory was palpable. Family photos, including from Beau’s childhood, line the wooden shelves where the television sits.\n\nAs Biden watched the vote pass, he pumped his right fist. In his left hand, he was clutching a baseball cap from the Beau Biden Foundation.\n\nThursday, August 4\n\nThe long huddle on the Senate floor was drawing attention. Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema – the Arizona Democrat who was a last remaining holdout on the climate and tax bill – sat and talked at length, Manchin gesturing and laughing as Sinema spoke.\n\nNeither revealed details of their talk. But a few hours later, as a thunderstorm ranged outside the White House, Sinema broke her week-long silence on the bill: She would support it after tweaks to some of the tax provisions.\n\nFILE - Sen.

Scott Applewhite, File) J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe long-stalled plan was finally headed for votes. Yet if the year-long saga of Biden’s agenda seemed to be resolving itself, the standoff with China prompted by Pelosi’s 17-hour visit to Taiwan was worsening.\n\nBeijing had sent more of its warships and planes near Taiwan. And at the White House, the Chinese ambassador to Washington had been brought in for a formal protest. Campbell, the NSC Asia coordinator, condemned the escalations during a tense meeting.\n\nFriday, August 5\n\nThe cough was mostly gone. The five-day isolation period was up. And after 16 days without leaving the White House, Biden hoped a surprisingly strong employment report – 528,000 jobs added in July – might be the perfect opportunity to finally break his isolation.\n\nAfter all, strong hiring has been the White House’s strongest bulwark against recession fears. Aides made initial preparations to turn a virtual event in the afternoon into an in-person affair.\n\nBut the test was still positive.\n\nSaturday, August 6\n\nAs the Senate appeared on track to advance Democrats’ climate and tax bill, the White House announced that Biden had tested negative for Covid-19.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/politics/joe-biden-london-queen-elizabeth-liz-truss/index.html", "title": "Biden in London: Queen Elizabeth II was 'decent, honorable and all ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Sunday paid their respects to Queen Elizabeth II, visiting her coffin lying in state at London’s Westminster Hall and signing condolence books at Lancaster House.\n\nThe President on Sunday said the Queen was “the same in person as her image – decent, honorable and all about service.”\n\n“We’ve had an opportunity to meet with an awful lot of consequential people. But I can say that the ones who stand out in your mind are those whose relationship and interaction with you are consistent with their reputation,” Biden said after signing a condolence book Sunday evening.\n\nBiden, who has often spoken out his own losses, also expressed condolences to the Royal Family and the entire United Kingdom, saying, “It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole, and sometimes you’ll think you’ll never overcome it. But as I’ve told the King, she’s going to be with him every step of the way.”\n\nBiden said the Queen reminded him of his late mother because of her mannerisms, saying, “She had that look, like, ‘Are you okay? Is there anything I can do for you? What do you need?’ Also, ‘Make sure you’re doing what you’re supposed to do.’”\n\nBiden took his time signing a lengthy message in the condolence book, writing in part, “She treated everyone with dignity and respect. Jill and I were honored to have met with her and feel her warmth. Our hearts go out to the Royal Family and the people of the United Kingdom.”\n\nJill Biden, who told CNN on Sunday she is overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and respect she is witnessing for the Queen in London, signed a separate condolence book for leader spouses at Lancaster House. She wrote, in part, “Queen Elizabeth II lived her life for the people she served with wisdom and grace. We will never forget her warmth, kindness, and the conversations we shared.”\n\nThe Bidens were joined earlier during their visit to Westminster Hall by Jane Hartley, the US ambassador to the UK. The President was seen making the sign of the cross.\n\nThe Bidens also attended a reception on Sunday evening at Buckingham Palace for visiting foreign leaders hosted by Britain’s new king, Charles III.\n\nJill Biden told CNN that her conversations with Charles and the royal family at the reception were strictly about the Queen.\n\n“We really talked about the woman, and who she was, and what she meant really to the whole world,” Biden said, adding that she noted to Charles the human toll of grief.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, signs a condolence book at Lancaster House in London. Jonathan Hordle/Pool/Reuters\n\nThe President arrived in London late Saturday for a two-day visit honoring the long-reigning monarch, whom he says “defined an era.”\n\nBiden is joining leaders from dozens of other nations to pay their respects to the late sovereign, whom he met last year and declared afterward reminded him of his own mother.\n\nFor Biden, it is a moment to reflect on a monarch who embodied a commitment to public service and whose life charted the major historical events of the last 100 years.\n\nBiden and the Queen first met in 1982, when as a young senator, Biden’s own Irish American mother instructed him: “Don’t you bow down to her.”\n\nHe didn’t bow down then, or when he met the Queen as president last year while attending a Group of 7 summit in England. But his respect for a woman whose constancy on the world stage over the last century was unparalleled has been plain.\n\n“She was a great lady. We’re so delighted we got to meet her,” Biden said on the day that she died.\n\nThe Queen’s surprise decision last year to travel to the Cornish coast to meet world leaders at the G7 summit was a signal of her desire to remain engaged in global affairs.\n\nLater that week, when she hosted Biden and the first lady for tea at Windsor Castle, she inquired about two authoritarian leaders, Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia, the President told reporters afterward.\n\n“I loved her sense of curiosity,” Jill Biden told CNN on Sunday of the time they spent alone with the Queen. “She wanted to know all about American politics, so she asked Joe question after question.”\n\nAt Sunday evening’s reception, the President saw Charles for the first time since he became King. The two men have met previously and spoke last week by phone.\n\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles was a passionate campaigner for certain issues Biden has also championed, including combating climate change. It remains to be seen how involved the new King will be on those issues going forward.\n\nRelatively close in age – Charles is 73, Biden is 79 – the two men have a shared experience of being in the public eye for decades before assuming their current roles as heads of state.\n\nOn his call with the King, Biden “conveyed the great admiration of the American people for the Queen, whose dignity and constancy deepened the enduring friendship and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,” the White House said. “President Biden conveyed his wish to continue a close relationship with the King.”\n\nSecurity in the British capital is at its highest level in memory as Biden and dozens of other world leaders convene to remember the late Queen, who met 13 sitting US presidents during her reign.\n\nWhite House aides have declined to provide specific security details for the President’s visit but say they are working well with their British counterparts to ensure the demands of presidential security are met.\n\nPlans for the Queen’s funeral have been in place for years, allowing US advisers greater insight into precisely what will happen over the coming days as they make security arrangements. The White House said it received an invitation only for the President and first lady, making for a slimmed-down American footprint.\n\nBiden traveled with his national security adviser, communications director and other personal aides aboard Air Force One to London.\n\nWhen reports emerged last week that world leaders would be required to ride on a bus to the funeral, US officials were skeptical and shot down the suggestion Biden that would travel to Westminster Abbey in a coach.\n\nIn 2018, when other world leaders traveled together in a bus to a World War I memorial in Paris, then-US President Donald Trump traveled separately in his own vehicle. The White House explained at the time that the separate trip was “due to security protocols.”\n\nThe Queen’s death came at a moment of economic and political turmoil for the United Kingdom. A new prime minister, Liz Truss, entered office after months of uncertainty following the decision of her predecessor, Boris Johnson, to step down.\n\nTruss invited several visiting world leaders to meet individually at 10 Downing Street this weekend. In the role for only a little more than a week, it will be Truss’ first time meeting face to face with many of her foreign counterparts.\n\nWhile her office initially said Biden would be among the leaders visiting Downing Street, it was later announced that Truss and the President would meet for formal bilateral talks on Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nA host of issues are currently testing the US-UK “special relationship,” which has been heralded repeatedly in the days since the Queen’s death.\n\nIt was only two days after Truss traveled to Balmoral Castle in Scotland to formally accept the Queen’s appointment as prime minister that the long-reigning monarch passed away. Since then, the country has been in a formal period of mourning.\n\nTruss inherited a deep economic crisis, fueled by high inflation and soaring energy costs, that has led to fears the UK could soon enter a prolonged recession. The challenges have been aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has caused volatility in oil and gas markets.\n\nWhile few in the Biden administration shed tears at Johnson’s resignation– Biden once described him as the “physical and emotional clone” of Trump – the US and the UK were deeply aligned in their approach to Russia under his leadership.\n\nWhite House officials expect that cooperation will continue under Truss, even as she comes under pressure to ease economic pressures at home.\n\nLess certain, however, is whether Truss’s hard-line approach to Brexit will sour relations with Biden. The President has taken a personal interest in the particular issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement that requires extra checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThe rules were designed to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland open and avoid a return to sectarian violence. But Truss has moved to rewrite those rules, causing deep anxiety in both Brussels and Washington.\n\nBiden, who makes frequent references to his Irish ancestry, has made his views clear on the issue, even though it does not directly involve the United States. Congressional Democrats have similarly expressed concern over any steps that could reignite the Northern Ireland conflict.\n\nIn their first phone call as counterparts earlier this month, Biden raised the matter with Truss, according to the White House. A US readout of their conversation said they discussed a “shared commitment to protecting the gains of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and the importance of reaching a negotiated agreement with the European Union on the Northern Ireland Protocol.”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez Allie Malloy", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez", "Allie Malloy"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/19/politics/joe-biden-mohammed-bin-salman-meeting/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden's meeting with Saudi officials will 'include' Crown Prince ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe White House said Sunday that President Joe Biden’s upcoming meeting with Saudi officials will “include” the kingdom’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, hours after Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm suggested there would be a one-on-one meeting.\n\nGranholm said Sunday on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that it was her “understanding” that Biden would meet one-on-one with the crown prince next month during his planned trip to Saudi Arabia that amounts to a reversal of the President’s earlier pledge to make the country a “pariah” for its role in Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder in 2018.\n\nAsked by CNN’s Dana Bash whether Biden would meet with Crown Prince Mohammed to talk about oil prices, Granholm initially said that he was “going for the purpose of this international conference” – a reference to the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to be held in Jeddah – before adding that she thought the President would meet with the de facto Saudi leader.\n\n“I think he will meet with the Saudi crown prince,” Granholm said. “He has asked for all suppliers around the globe to increase production. That includes [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries], that includes our domestic oil and gas producers. He is asking for an increase like other leaders around the globe.”\n\nPressed by Bash to clarify if the meeting would be one-on-one, Granholm said: “That’s my understanding, that they – he will be meeting. But there’s a series of meetings around energy overall.”\n\nThe secretary’s comments stood in contrast with Biden’s remarks Friday.\n\n“I’m not going to meet with MBS, I’m going to an international meeting. And he’s going to be part of it just like there were people part of a big discussion today,” the President said at the virtual leader-level meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Leadership and Climate that took place Friday and referring to the crown prince by his initials.\n\nAsked by CNN later Sunday for clarification over Granholm’s comments, a National Security Council spokesperson stuck close to administration talking points.\n\n“The President will be in Saudi Arabia at the invitation of King Salman together with eight additional heads of State for the GCC+3 Summit,” the spokesperson said, referring to the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, plus Egypt, Jordan and Iraq.\n\n“As we’ve said, there will be a bilateral meeting with King Salman and his team. That meeting will include the crown prince and other Saudi officials,” the NSC spokesperson added. “The President will see over a dozen counterparts over the course of this trip to the Middle East next month.”\n\nThe trip, set for mid-July, will also include Biden’s first stop in Israel as President as well as a visit to the Palestinian West Bank.\n\nOfficials have said Biden approved the visit to Saudi Arabia after some initial reluctance to back off his vow to make the kingdom pay a price for its role in Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nBiden since taking office has avoided directly engaging with Crown Prince Mohammed, instead choosing to speak to his father, King Salman, who is 86 and in failing health. The White House said in February 2021 that Biden was aiming to “recalibrate” relations with Riyadh, including by shunning the crown prince, whom US intelligence agencies have deemed responsible for Khashoggi’s killing.\n\nBut with Russia’ invasion of Ukraine, a global spike in energy prices and an increasing nuclear threat from Iran, the US has been trying to build back its relationships with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries.\n\nThe trip and meeting with Prince Mohammed has drawn criticism, including from some of Biden’s allies in Congress.\n\nAsked by Bash to explain to the American people why it was appropriate for Biden to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed after Khashoggi’s killing, Granholm defended the President.\n\n“Obviously, the President is a strong believer in human rights and has condemned Saudi Arabia,” the secretary said, adding that Biden was “very concerned” about Khashoggi’s murder.\n\n“I’m sure we’ll raise that issue. But he’s also very concerned about what people are experiencing at the pump, and Saudi Arabia is head of OPEC, and we need to have increased production so that everyday citizens in America will not be feeling this pain that they’re feeling right now,” she added. “So all around the world is asking for people to increase production, but especially our own oil and gas producers.”", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/politics/harris-asia-trip/index.html", "title": "Harris dives into Asian diplomacy amid questions back home about ...", "text": "Palawan, Philippines CNN —\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is sticking close to her script when responding to what Democrats hope will once again be their greatest electoral mobilizer: Donald Trump and his third White House bid.\n\n“The president said he intends to run and if he does, I will be running with him,” she told CNN on Tuesday – the first time she’d been asked about Trump’s 2024 candidacy, which he announced last week.

The President is expected to consider the decision over Thanksgiving and upcoming holidays with family, whose advice he’ll seek about running for reelection.\n\nHarris’ trip to Asia – her third to the region since taking office – was another chance for America’s first South Asian vice president to showcase her ability to lead in the traditional ways of the vice presidency without overstepping her role as No. 2.\n\nShe attended a series of bilateral meetings and greetings with Asian prime ministers and presidents alike, including China’s President Xi Jinping, called a last-minute high-profile meeting with Indo-Pacific countries after North Korea launched a long-range ballistic missile hours before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ summit began and went on a symbolic visit to the Philippines’ archipelago island of Palawan, which could potentially heighten tensions with China.\n\nWith Biden in Washington, DC, for his granddaughter’s wedding, Harris continued her role as his top-ranking envoy in a trip meant to deepen ties to mostly friendly Asian nations and cast the US as the region’s best option for economic stability –part of an ongoing effort to counter China’s growing influence.\n\nThe vice president called the trip a success, as she brandished her policy chops in the region, attempting to fashion herself as a deft leader who speaks for Biden in his absence.\n\n“It is very important that we were here today to restate the United States commitment to international rules and norms. This trip and this visit in particular has also been about demonstrating the strength and importance of our relationship with the Philippines both as it relates to economic issues and also security issues,” Harris said in Palawan, in a speech where she rejected China’s aggression in the South China Sea and announced funding initiatives ameant to beef up the country’s systems and deepen security ties.\n\nStill, Harris’ events were tightly scripted and the trip itself, highly choreographed.\n\nHarris’ “brief greeting” with Xi, as her office described it, was her first face-to-face meeting with the world leader, happening on the margins of APEC. It was likely Harris’ most high-profile moment of the trip, despite the lack of US press in the room to witness it. The vice president met with him just a week after Biden’s first in-person bilateral with Xi, which lasted three hours.\n\nBut unlike the president, who can share as much of a conversation as he pleases, there was an obvious limit to how much Harris felt comfortable sharing. She repeatedly declined to go far beyond what was written in a carefully calculated statement on her meeting with Xi.\n\n“We discussed that we are keeping open lines of communication, that we do not seek conflict or confrontation, but we welcome competition,” Harris told reporters in a press conference wrapping up her trip to Thailand, dodging twice whether that conversation touched on North Korea or Taiwan.\n\nIf the goal was to remain gaffe free, the planning seems to have paid off. The Republican National Committee only clipped on Twitter moments thatmay have been awkward but didn’t lend themselves to real criticism –unusual treatment for one of their most attacked Democrats.\n\nHarris’ diplomatic efforts\n\nOn the first day of APEC, a “deeply concerned” Harris rushed aides to convene a last-minute unannounced multi-lateral emergency meeting with Indo-Pacific region allies, according to a senior administration official, after North Korea launched a long-range ballistic missile Friday morning– her second most high-profile moment of the trip.\n\nHarris directed her team once she was briefed on the latest launch, a White House official said utilizing the Indo-Pacific nation’s presence at the APEC Leaders Summit to do so. At the head of a u-shaped table inside a small room in the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center, the vice president accused North Korea of “brazen violation of multiple UN security resolutions.”\n\n“This conduct by North Korea most recently is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security resolutions. It destabilizes security in the region, and unnecessarily raises tensions. We strongly condemn these actions, and we again call North Korea to stop further unlawful destabilizing,” Harris said. “On behalf of the United States, I reaffirmed our ironclad commitment to our Indo Pacific Alliance.”\n\nHer statement closely tracked one the National Security Council issued hours earlier on Biden’s behalf, almost to a tee.\n\nThe last-minute nature of the meeting caused aides to move quickly to corral the US press, but without time to pre-set cameras, press from the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Korea were fighting for an angle – causing the photo-op visuals to be at times shaky and askew.\n\nStill, it was a moment that looked almost presidential for Harris as it was reminiscent of the emergency in-person meeting Biden convened with top allies during his final day at the G20 in Indonesia, when a Russian-made missile fell inside the borders of a NATO ally.\n\nBut the presidential posturing had limits. During the weeklong trip, the vice president only answered political and policy questions on two separate occasions from the group of all women reporters traveling with her from Washington – taking two or three questions each time.\n\nHarris didn’t stray from talking points in her answers, careful not to move beyond Biden’s position on a multitude of issues.\n\nHarris focuses on women\n\nHarris has long sought opportunities to showcase her own interests and craft her own lane as a younger vice president with potential presidential ambitions.\n\nDomestically, she has taken the lead for the administration on abortion rights. And on foreign trips, Harris has told aides she wants to go outside of the box when it comes to the schedule. A major part of that has been to meet with women and families in different countries.\n\nThat directive was evident in Manila, when she participated in a moderated conversation about women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship inside a ballroom in the Sofitel.\n\n“On the issue of the economic wellbeing of women, I think we all know, and I feel very strongly, you lift up the economic status of a woman, her family will be lifted. Her community will be lifted,” Harris said as the Filipino women nodded in agreement. “All of society will benefit. Lift up the economic status of women, and all of society benefits.”\n\nIn the Palawan fishing village of Tagburos, Harris watched women clean fish in front of a picturesque backdrop to talk about the devastation climate change and illegal fishing has had on the village.\n\n“Hi ma’am,” they yelled as she approached. Harris’ translator introduced the women as her best friends.\n\n“Best friends,” Harris said, with a laugh and a wave.", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/politics/biden-europe-trip-takeaways/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from Biden's trip to Europe | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden used a last-minute trip to Europe this week to rally the world’s democracies and announce more actions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, while also causing a geopolitical stir with one of the final lines from his speech in Poland.\n\nThe President’s four-day stint began in Brussels, where he attended snap summits and held bilateral meetings with other world leaders. Biden then traveled to Poland, where he met with American troops stationed just west of Ukraine, spoke with humanitarian workers and refugees, and held talks with Polish President Andrzej Duda. It ended with what will become one of the signature speeches of the President’s career as he evoked European history to make the case for democracy and said Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” a seismic statement that the White House quickly tried to downplay.\n\nThroughout his visit, Biden sought to reinforce his broad-reaching foreign policy framework, discussing his heartbreak about the humanitarian crisis at hand and telling American troops in Poland that they were “in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs.”\n\nThe trip was a test of what the United States could do to rally alliances following years of absent leadership, proving to also be an assessment of just how much the Western alliances can achieve when they are fully united.\n\nHere are eight takeaways from Biden’s visit to Belgium and Poland:\n\nBiden says Putin ‘cannot remain in power’\n\nAt the end of his address from Warsaw, capping off his trip, Biden made a major declaration that quickly sent shock waves across Europe and through the White House press office.\n\n“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden announced at the very conclusion of a capstone address delivered outside the Royal Castle in Warsaw.\n\nFor a few moments, it appeared to be a clear call for regime change in Russia, and the Kremlin reacted quickly to the President’s words, with Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying, “This is not to be decided by Mr. Biden. It should only be a choice of the people of the Russian Federation.”\n\nHowever, before Biden’s plane had taken off for Washington, the White House was already downplaying the comments. A White House official said Biden wasn’t referencing regime change when he said Putin “cannot remain in power.”\n\n“The President’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” a White House official said.\n\nIt was a response that attempted to put the President’s speech in line with larger US policy. American officials had said previously that removing Putin from power was not their goal.\n\n“For us, it’s not about regime change. The Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month.\n\nA separate White House official told CNN after the speech that the line was not in Biden’s prepared remarks.\n\nWhite House forced to clean up multiple other Biden comments that raised eyebrows\n\nThe line at the end of Biden’s speech in Warsaw will be the one that is longest remembered, but it was not the only time that the White House needed to clarify some of the President’s remarks during his four-day swing through Europe.\n\nOn Thursday, during a news conference in Brussels, Biden said the United States would respond “in kind” if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine. When asked by a reporter on Friday if that meant the US would use chemical weapons on Russia, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States had “no intention of using chemical weapons period – under any circumstance.”\n\nAsked about Biden’s comments, Sullivan said the President also said the United States would respond “accordingly.”\n\nSullivan added, “Meaning we will elect the form and nature of our response based on the nature of the action Russia takes, and we’ll do so in coordination with our allies, and we’ve communicated to the Russians as the President said publicly a couple of weeks ago that there will be a severe price if Russia uses chemical weapons, and I wont go beyond that other (than) to say, ‘The United States has no intention of using chemical weapons period under any circumstances.’”\n\nOn Friday in Poland, Biden made an apparent slip by suggesting the US troops he was speaking to would see Ukrainians in action. Biden has made clear that US troops will not fight in Ukraine, and his remark did not appear to be anything other than a slip.\n\n“The average citizen, look at how they’re stepping up. And you’re going to see when you’re there, I don’t know if you’ve been there, you’re going to see women, young people, standing in the middle of the damn tank, saying ‘I’m not leaving. I’m holding my ground’,” Biden said.\n\nA White House spokesperson responded to the comment, saying, “The President has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.”\n\nBiden warns the world’s democracies that a time is coming for resolve and unity\n\nThe end of the Warsaw speech will be the most memorable line from an address that widely called for democracies to steel themselves against the threat of autocracies in the years and decades to come. Biden has often said that the defining battle of the coming era is democracy versus rising autocracies, and he said Ukraine was the front line in that fight.\n\nBiden, standing along NATO’s eastern edge, in Poland, issued a stern warning during his speech, telling Putin: “Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.” He said the US was committed to the collective protection obligations laid out in NATO’s charter “with the full force of our collective power.”\n\nIn a message to the Poles and other NATO allies, Biden used a Cold War-era cry from the late Polish-born Pope John Paul II to rally a nation facing new threats.\n\n“Be not afraid,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing about that battle for freedom was simple or easy. It was a long, painful slog, fought over not days and months but years and decades,” Biden told the crowd in Warsaw. “We emerged anew in a great battle for freedom, a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression.”\n\nHe said the same lessons must be applied to the current threat from Russia.\n\n“This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead,” Biden said.\n\nBiden announces new sanctions and measures to help Ukrainian refugees\n\nMuch like other leaders at the summits, Biden used his meetings on Thursday and Friday to announce a slew of new actions aimed at punishing Russia and aiding Ukrainians.\n\nOn Thursday, his administration issued sanctions against hundreds of Russian politicians, business leaders and defense companies. The new restrictions target 328 members of the 450-seat Russian State Duma, the lower house of the two-tiered Russian Parliament, and cut off 48 Russian defense and materiel companies from Western technology and financing. The US also sanctioned Herman Gref – the head of Sberbank – who has worked with Putin since the 1990s, when both men worked in the mayor’s office of St. Petersburg.\n\nThe US also put sanctions on longtime Putin associate Gennady Timchenko – his companies, family members and yacht – as well as 17 board members of Russian financial institution Sovcombank, according to the White House.\n\nBiden announced that the US will accept up to 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, with an emphasis n protecting the most vulnerable among the refugee populations, including members of the LGBTQ community, those with medical needs, journalists and third-country nationals. A senior administration official said a “full range of legal pathways” would be utilized to welcome the refugees.\n\nOn Friday, Biden and his counterpart at the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, unveiled a joint task force aimed at weaning Europe off its dependence on Russian oil and gas. The panel is aimed at finding alternative supplies of liquified natural gas and reducing overall demand for natural gas moving forward.\n\nThe United States will work toward supplying Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas in 2022, in partnership with other nations, the White House said.\n\nRussia hits Lviv with airstrikes after days of Western allies meetings on the war\n\nAfter days of Western allies meeting and talking about how to punish Putin and Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military appeared to send a message to Biden with an airstrike on a fuel depot in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.\n\nLviv is the city to which many displaced Ukrainians have fled and is where many Western media outlets have made their home base to cover the war. While Russian military officials said that they intended to focus their campaign in the disputed eastern parts of Ukraine, the attack on Lviv was conspicuously timed, coming just before Biden was to speak in Warsaw, about 200 miles away in Poland.\n\nRussian military officials also used the trip as a moment to put their own spin on how the conflict is going. Russian Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy on Friday claimed that Russian forces had encircled cities around Ukraine in a deliberate effort to tie down Ukrainian forces and prevent them from focusing on the separatist regions of Donbas before Russia “liberates” them. Putin has stated that the goal of the conflict is the complete demilitarization of the country and has said that the war is going according to plan.\n\nHowever, Russian forces have incurred serious losses. And military analysts and observers say Russian advances appear to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities, such as Kyiv and Kharkiv.\n\nFollowing world leaders’ meetings in Brussels, Putin said in a videoconference with workers of arts and literature on Friday that the West was trying to “cancel” Russia.\n\n“J.K. Rowling has recently been canceled because she … did not please the fans of the so-called gender freedoms,” Putin, who has railed against transgender and gay rights, said, referring to the “Harry Potter” author.\n\n“Today, they are trying to cancel a whole thousand-year-old country, our people. I am talking about the increasing discrimination of everything related to Russia, about this trend, which is unfolding in a number of Western states,” he added.\n\nZelensky left frustrated by unmet requests from NATO\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky virtually addressed leaders gathered in Brussels several times during the summits, repeatedly calling them out and asking them to do more to protect his country.\n\nZelensky told NATO leaders that Ukraine – which is not a NATO member – needs just a fraction of the alliance’s combined firepower, saying, “You can give us 1% of all your planes. One percent of all your tanks. One percent!”\n\n“You have thousands of fighter jets, but we have not been given one yet,” he added.\n\nZelensky argued that NATO leaders should acknowledge what Ukraine’s armed forces have demonstrated in the war against Russia, telling the group, “Please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards.”\n\nOn another videoconference, Zelensky asked the G7 countries how many urgent summits would need to be held until the problems created by Russia could be solved, calling on the nations to issue a “full embargo to trade” with Russia.\n\nZelensky separately thanked European Council members for putting sanctions on Russia but lamented that “it was a little late.”\n\n“You blocked (the) Nord Stream 2 (pipeline). We are grateful to you. And rightly so. But it was also a little late, because if it had been in time, Russia would not have created a gas crisis. At least there was a chance,” he told the council.\n\nSpeaking to the council, Zelensky issued pointed remarks to Hungary, calling on the country’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, to “decide already” on its treatment of Russia.\n\n“You hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not? And you hesitate whether to let weapons through or not? And you hesitate whether to trade with Russia or not? There is no time to hesitate. It’s time to decide already,” Zelensky said.\n\nPossible Russian use of chemical weapons in Ukraine looms over summits\n\nIn Brussels, Biden met with global leaders on how the world would respond if Russia deploys a chemical, biological or nuclear weapon.\n\nThe use of such weapons would force NATO into a new posture, officials have acknowledged. But exactly how NATO would respond to the provocation remains unclear.\n\nWhen asked on Thursday if the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine would trigger a military response from NATO, Biden said it would trigger a response “in kind.”\n\nThe answer led Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, to clarify that the US response to a potential chemical weapons attack by Russia would be done in coordination with allies.\n\nSullivan would not say what the response would entai, but said that Russia would pay a “severe price” and emphasized that “the United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period – under any circumstances.”\n\nThe G7 issued a warning in its final joint statement against such an action. And NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg – whose tenure was extended a year amid the current crisis – said use of a chemical weapon would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict.\n\nBiden’s meeting with refugees touches an emotional nerve\n\nOn the trip, Biden repeatedly sought to highlight the refugee crisis that has ensued as a result of the war, a crisis he saw firsthand when visiting Ukrainian refugees on Saturday.\n\nOne woman Biden spoke with told him she was there with her daughter, but her husband and son were back in Ukraine fighting. The woman, via a translator, spoke about the horror her family has endured and remarked of Putin: “We Ukrainian mothers are ready to strangle him with our bare hands.”\n\nThe President also met with chef José Andrés and other volunteers in Warsaw at a food distribution site for Andrés’ World Center Kitchen, the nonprofit devoted to providing meals in the wake of disasters. Biden met with some of the volunteers, some from Europe and some from the United States.\n\n“God love ya,” the President could be heard saying to them and asking if he could help them.\n\nMore than 3.5 million refugees have now fled Ukraine, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency released on Tuesday. Poland, a nation that has seen more than 2 million refugees from Ukraine enter its borders, has sought to get more US resources and flexibility in immigration policies to aid with the influx.\n\nAfter meeting with the refugees, Biden was asked his opinion of Putin as he deals with the Russian leader every day. Biden responded, “He’s a butcher.”\n\nDuring the brief Q&A session with reporters, Biden recounted how he had been to similar places in his life but that he is always surprised by “the depth and strength of the human spirit.”\n\n“It’s incredible, it’s incredible. See all those little children. Just want to hug, just want to say thanks. I mean, it’s, just makes you so damn proud,” he said.\n\nHe added, “Each one of those children said something to the effect, ‘Say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother who’s back there fighting.’ And I remember what it’s like when you have someone in a war zone. Every morning you get up and you wonder. You just wonder. And you pray you don’t get that phone call.”\n\nUpon his arrival in Poland on Friday, Biden met with humanitarian workers to discuss their efforts, saying he would have preferred to see the crisis from an even closer perspective but was prevented by security concerns.\n\n“They will not let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at what’s going on in Ukraine,” he said. The White House has said it did not explore a visit to Ukraine.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kyle Feldscher", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kyle Feldscher"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/biden-g20-summit-bali/index.html", "title": "G20: Biden steps into summit in Indonesia aiming to unite leaders in ...", "text": "Bali, Indonesia CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is confronting competing issues at home and abroad while he’s at the Group of 20 Summit in Bali this week, using the moment on the world’s stage to lean into international support for condemning Russia’s aggression while also facing the prospect of hearing Donald Trump announce his next run for the presidency.\n\nAdministration officials previewing Biden’s G20 summit activities had their sights set on the coalition’s efforts to voice its opposition against the war in Ukraine, which could send a powerful signal amongst a group that’s so far had fragmented approaches to the Kremlin’s aggression.\n\nThis marks the first time the group has gathered in-person since the start of the invasion, and most G20 members are expected to sign onto a statement condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine “and the human suffering it has caused both for Ukrainians and for families in the developing world that are facing food and fuel insecurity as a result,” a senior administration official said.\n\nSuch an expression of condemnation has been the work of months of diplomacy between G20 leaders. However, it’s not clear yet exactly which countries will sign onto the declaration.\n\nAlthough the G20 is comprised of world powers who have long backed Ukraine during the war, it also includes other nations that have been tepid in their response to Russia’s aggression – including India, China, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, the host of this year’s summit. The coalition, which is broadly focused on the global economy, also includes Russia itself. But Russian President Vladimir Putin is not making an appearance at the summit this year.\n\nSince the spring, US officials have anticipated a showdown at this year’s G20 over the war. Biden has stated Russia should no longer be a member of the bloc, though expelling Moscow would require support from all of the G20’s members.\n\nAs of now, no official “family photo” is listed on a schedule, a sign of the deep acrimony within the G20 spurred by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe president’s diplomatic Tuesday – a day working alongside leaders, including a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – is expected to precede a 2024 presidential campaign announcement by Biden’s predecessor, Trump, from the other side of the world. The prospective announcement would set the stage for a two-year battle for the American presidency, having the power to cast a shadow over Biden’s efforts to unify world leaders – some already personally stung by Trump’s nationalist approach.\n\nBiden and his team have already spent time during his multi-leg, cross-continental trip abroad addressing domestic politics, suggesting the issue has not only loomed on their minds, but also among their foreign counterparts in meetings throughout their travels.\n\nOn Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that “many leaders” at the ASEAN Summit addressed the midterms with Biden, that many leaders were “following them closely” and that the president now feels he has a strong position on the international stage.\n\nVote counts for midterm races last Tuesday continue to trickle in, with Democrats only securing their continued majority in the US Senate this past weekend and the future of the US House of Representatives remaining up in the air. But Biden – who has frequently cast the US’ dynamic with other world powers as a global fight between democracy and autocracy – brought up the political headwinds working in his favor on Monday in Bali after he took part in a roughly three-hour meeting with Xi Jinping.\n\nAt a news conference after his meeting with Xi, Biden sought to cast the election results seen so far as a victory for the future of American democracy – a matter he had said was at stake at the polls.\n\n“The American people proved once again that democracy is who we are. There was a strong rejection of election deniers at every level from those seeking to lead our states and those seeking to serve in Congress and also those seeking to oversee the elections,” Biden said at the start of his remarks after the Xi meeting.\n\nThe president also met with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy. The meeting with Meloni was Biden’s first chance to confer with the new Italian prime minister in person since she took office in October – when she became the country’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.\n\nIn a readout, the White House said the pair discussed a range of issues, but most notably the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The two leaders also discussed their commitment to continue providing Ukraine the support it needs to defend itself and to holding Russia accountable for its aggression,” a US readout said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden participated in working sessions and a luncheon with leaders at the summit. He also co-hosted an event on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which the White House said “aims to mobilize $600 billion in the next five years with G7 partners to deliver sustainable infrastructure and advance U.S. national security and economic security interests.”\n\nBiden spoke about a range of investments by the US and multilateral institutions around the world at the event, saying that “this is something that we have an obligation to do.”\n\nBiden ticked through investments announced previously by a group formed by the Group of 7 nations, widely seen as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. “I want to emphasize the word ‘investments.’ Investments that are driven by local needs,” Biden said.\n\nBiden then announced the Just Energy Transition Partnership with Indonesia (the White House has released a fact sheet), which seeks to mobilize $20 billion in public and private money “to support Indonesia’s efforts to reduce emissions” and transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\n\nThe global infrastructure initiative event follows a launch in 2021 amongst G7 partners to better position the US and its allies to compete with China. China’s Belt and Road Initiative, first announced in 2013 under Xi, aims to build ports, roads and railways to create new trade corridors linking China to Africa and the rest of Eurasia. The Chinese-funded, cross-continental infrastructure initiative has been seen as an extension of the country’s sharp ascent to global power.\n\nOther topics at the summit, the senior administration official said, include economic coordination, climate change, and the Covid-19 pandemic, with new announcements expected on digital infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific and solar power in Honduras.\n\nBiden ended up skipping a leaders dinner on Tuesday to attend to other matters, an administration official said.\n\n“It’s not Covid,” the official made clear. Biden had tested negative earlier Tuesday after coming into contact with the Cambodian prime minister, who tested positive for the virus.\n\n“He just had spent a full day in meetings and needed to attend to a few things tonight (nothing urgent!),” the official said. Biden spoke to Indonesian President Joko Widodo to send his regrets for not attending the dinner.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kevin Liptak Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}]}

But he's not the only one to make headlines.\n\nFrom buying a $200,000 Lamborghini SUV as an anniversary gift to reportedly turning away hurricane evacuees, these 10 televangelists have caught flak for their actions and sermons.\n\nKenneth Copeland\n\nCopeland justified his jet-setting by saying that he could not evangelize without the aircraft. \"If I flew commercial, I'd have to stop 65% of what I'm doing,\" he told journalist Lisa Guerrero.\n\nGuerrero then pressed Copeland on a statement he made in 2015 in which he compared flying in commercial class to getting \"in a long tube with a bunch of demons\" to fellow televangelist Jesse Duplantis.\n\n\"No, I do not, and don't you ever say that I did,\" he responded, pointing a finger at the journalist.\n\nHe owns an airport close to his Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth.\n\nJesse Duplantis\n\nLouisiana minister Jesse Duplantis, who himself was implicated in Copeland's jet scandal, has been in hot water for his own jet-setting lifestyle. He claims God told him he needs a private jet – specifically, a Falcon 7X, capable of carrying 12 to 16 passengers at speeds up to 700 mph.\n\n\"Now, some people believe that preachers shouldn't have jets,\" Duplantis said in a video posted in 2018.\n\n\"I really believe that preachers ought to ... have every available outlet to get this Gospel preached to the world.\"\n\nIn the same video, he showed off a photo of the three planes owned by his ministry that bore the caption \"It's not about possessions, it's about priorities.\"\n\nGloria Copeland\n\nKenneth Copeland's wife, Gloria, is a preacher herself. She co-founded Kenneth Copeland Ministries with her husband and served as one of President Donald Trump's evangelical ministers.\n\nIn a video published on the ministry's Facebook page, she proclaimed that children do not need a flu shot because Jesus had already \"bore our sickness.\"\n\n\"We don't have a flu season,\" she said. \"And don't receive it when somebody's threatening you with 'Everybody's getting the flu.' We've already had our shot. He bore our sicknesses and carried our diseases.\"\n\nUpon drawing widespread criticism, Copeland Ministries shared a list of scriptures on its website with the claim that it would help followers \"stand strong against\" the flu.\n\nFranklin Graham\n\nFranklin Graham, son of famed preacher Billy Graham, was recently the target of criticism after inflammatory comments he made about Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\"As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.\" His tweet was in response to remarks Buttigieg made on CNN in which he said, \"God does not have a political party.\"\n\nPat Robertson\n\nAs host of The 700 Club, Pat Robertson is one of the more visible televangelists to emerge on the national stage. In his extensive career, he has drawn controversy for comments regarding everything from the 9/11 attacks to working with Buddhists.\n\nIn recent years, Robertson, 89, defended Trump before the 2016 election after a videotape emerged of Trump making vulgar comments about women. Brushing it off as \"macho\" talk, Robertson compared Trump to a phoenix. \"They think he's dead, he's come back. And he came back strong,\" he said on his show.\n\nMore recently, he called Alabama's abortion ban \"extreme\" and \"ill-considered\" on The 700 Club – though he has been a vocal opponent of abortion in the past.\n\nJim Bakker\n\nTelevangelist Jim Bakker was sentenced to five years in prison in 1989 on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy after misappropriating funds from followers for his own use. More recently, Bakker has attempted to sell properties at his Christian-themed Morningside development southwest of Branson, Missouri.\n\nBakker said his development, located in the Ozark mountains, is the safest place to live when the apocalypse comes. \"Where are you going to go when the world's on fire?\" he said in a 2018 broadcast. \"Where are you going to go? This place is for God's people, and this place, we need some farmers to move here.\"\n\nJoel Osteen\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, preacher Joel Osteen – who helms one of the largest churches in America with 50,000 members and a 600,000-square-foot stadium – was criticized for not welcoming hurricane evacuees into his Lakewood megachurch.\n\nA social media post from the megachurch claimed the building was inaccessible because of \"severe flooding.\" But locals said otherwise, posting photos around the church showing streets that were easy to get to.\n\nRegardless of what happened, it brought negative publicity to the church and Osteen, who has a reported net worth of more than $50 million.\n\n\"We have never closed our doors,\" Osteen said amid the controversy. \"We are prepared to house people once shelters reach capacity. Lakewood will be a value to the community in the aftermath of this storm.\"\n\nJohn Gray\n\nSouth Carolina megachurch pastor John Gray gave his wife a $200,000 Lamborghini SUV for their eighth anniversary in 2018. A flood of negative responses followed.\n\n\"God helped me to make my wife's dream come true,\" he wrote in an Instagram post showing off the luxury automobile.\n\nWithin days of the original post, he defended his purchase online – alleging it was bought with \"not a nickel, not a penny\" of church funds, including his salary, in a tearful video.\n\n\"My wife has pushed for my dreams and my vision, and she has toiled with a man who is still trying to find himself,\" Gray said. \"That carries a weight. I wanted to honor her for how she’s covered me.\"\n\nRobert Jeffress\n\nPastor Robert Jeffress has elicited much controversy for his sentiments toward the LGBT community, Mormons and Muslims, claiming Muslims practice a religion that \"promotes pedophilia.\" The statements resulted in Tim Tebow canceling an appearance at his First Baptist Dallas Church in 2013.\n\nHe was appointed one of President Trump's evangelical advisers and gained national attention when he claimed that \"God has given Trump authority to take out Kim Jong-Un,\" invoking the Bible's book of Romans to do so.\n\nJohn Hagee\n\nThe controversial founder of Texas' Cornerstone Church has been in the news repeatedly for statements connecting natural phenomena to God's plan.\n\nHe said in 2014 that a tetrad – or four consecutive and complete lunar eclipses over the span of two years – of blood moons signaled the End Times.\n\n\"God is literally screaming at the world 'I'm coming soon,'\" he said.\n\nIn 2008, he suggested Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for New Orleans planning a gay pride rally for the LGBT community.\n\nAfter a wave of criticism, he later apologized: \"Ultimately neither I nor any other person can know the mind of God concerning Hurricane Katrina.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/football/neymar-jair-bolsonaro-brazil-elections-football-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Neymar Jr.: Brazilian soccer star faces criticism for Bolsonaro ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJust days ahead of Brazil’s national elections on Sunday, soccer star Neymar Jr. has appeared in a campaign video endorsing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe Paris Saint-Germain forward and Brazil captain appeared on a TikTok video singing Bolsonaro’s campaign jingle in which he lip synchs, “Vote, vote, and press ‘confirm’ for 22, that’s Bolsonaro,” in reference to the Brazil president’s official ballot number.\n\nThe video was also posted to Neymar’s personal TikTok account on Thursday.\n\nNeymar’s endorsement comes a day after Bolsonaro visited the footballer’s non-profit organization, Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr, in the state of Sao Paulo.\n\nThe video of Bolsonaro touring the institute, which looks to create opportunities through education and sports initiatives for low-income families and children in the city of Praia Grande, was posted on the Institute’s official Twitter account.\n\nAlthough Neymar was not able to host the President in person, he sent him a video message from Paris, where he had just played in a friendly with the Brazilian national team, helping secure a 5-1 victory against Tunisia, which was Brazil’s final game ahead of the World Cup in Qatar later this year.\n\nHowever, Neymar’s show of support has sparked criticism, with Brazilian comedian Yuri Marçal drawing attention to Bolsonaro’s historically antagonistic relationship with indigenous Brazilians.\n\nResponding to the criticism he has faced for his support of Bolsonaro, Neymar tweeted on Friday that, “They talk about democracy and a lot of things, but when someone has a different opinion they are attacked by the very people who talk about democracy. Go figure.”\n\nBolsonaro has been in full campaign mode just days ahead of the election. Rodrigo Paiva/Getty Images\n\nShirt controversy\n\nThe Brazil team’s distinctive yellow jersey is a symbol that unites the country through a love of football and national pride, but in recent years the shirt’s adoption by right wing supporters of Bolsonaro, who wear it at protests and rallies to show their political allegiance to the Brazilian president has provoked controversy.\n\nWalter Casagrande, a former footballer for the Brazilian national team and the São Paulo club Corinthians, remembers the feeling of scoring a goal while wearing the yellow jersey in his first match with the “Selecao” in 1985.\n\n“It was a magical thing,” Casagrande told CNN Sport in 2020, “like an enchanted object that gave me huge emotion.\n\n“Now I consider the Brazilian yellow jersey to have been kidnapped and appropriated by the right wing, so we cannot use it,” added Casagrande, whose sentiments lie on the left side of the political chasm.\n\nCasagrande said that for him the power of the yellow shirt used to be that it represented democracy and freedom.\n\n“Brazil is appearing horribly to the world right now,” he said two years ago. “It’s the first time in my life I’m seeing the yellow jersey being used against democracy and freedom.”\n\nBolsonaro's base comes from pro-traditional values and pro-military Brazilians. Andre Penner/Associated Press\n\nNeymar’s support for Bolsonaro could be timely given a nationwide opinion poll released on Thursday that says former Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva is ahead of the incumbent president by 14 points for the first round of voting in the country’s upcoming presidential elections on October 2.\n\nThe nationwide poll from Datafolha Institute released by Folha de S. Paulo newspaper shows Lula would win 50% of votes versus Bolsonaro’s 36% excluding invalid and blank votes and undecided voters.\n\nWhoever gets 50% plus one vote would win the election outright without the need for a second-round runoff.\n\nIn 2014, on the eve of the presidential first round vote, Neymar recorded a video declaring his support for Aécio Neves of the centrist PSDB party, who was defeated by Dilma Rousseff of the left-wing Worker’s Party in the second round.\n\nIn 2010, Neymar publicized his meeting with Lula, then president, on his social networks.\n\n“Me and Paulo Henrique Ganso just met the President of the Republic, very cool!

Instead, he emerges from Tuesday’s underwhelming election night facing questions about his political future and with the momentum behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, potentially his potential chief nemesis in a 2024 primary.\n\nWith key races still too early to call in Arizona and Nevada, and with Georgia heading to a Senate runoff, Trump entered Wednesday with few victories to tout and the possibility that they might soon be overshadowed by further losses.\n\nHis chosen candidates for open Senate seats in Ohio and North Carolina prevailed, as did incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But he lost a critical Senate contest in Pennsylvania, where Mehmet Oz, whom he backed in the primary despite widespread concerns about his electability, was defeated by Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. In Michigan, Trump’s candidate in the governor’s race failed to unseat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. And while Republicans still appear to be on track to capture a House majority, it is likely to be far slimmer than initially thought.\n\nAs powerful as Trump is in the Republican Party, we learned that he cannot anoint anyone a winner. You still need candidates who have the fundamentals,” said Bryan Lanza, a longtime Trump adviser.\n\nOthers were more blunt in their assessment of Tuesday’s known outcomes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ex-Trump official: Election shows that Trump is holding GOP back 00:49 - Source: CNN\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican who won reelection and was endorsed by Trump, appeared to cast the former president as a drag on other GOP candidates in a radio interview Wednesday.\n\n“There’s just a lot of negative attitudes about Trump,” Nehls said. In a statement to CNN after this story published, the congressman said he remains supportive of Trump and “will support him as the 47th president.”\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning, a current Trump adviser, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, conceded that Trump “is in a tough spot coming out of tonight.”\n\n“Two narratives are going to take hold over the next week and neither one is going to be easy to dispel,” the adviser said.\n\nAcutely aware of his unprecedented involvement in Republican primaries earlier this year, this adviser and other Trump allies said they expect the former president will be blamed for elevating flawed candidates in some of the party’s most important contests – especially Oz, a daytime talk show host who had barely resided in Pennsylvania before launching his Senate campaign there.\n\nTrump’s disappointment was palpable inside the gilded ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where he gathered with dozens of aides, allies and donors to watch returns on Tuesday evening. When he returned to the party halfway through the night following a private dinner, his mood had visibly shifted.\n\n“Interesting evening,” he shouted to reporters before taking the stage for brief and unenthused remarks.\n\nAs the crowd dwindled, Trump sat at a table in front of a television tuned to Fox News with just a handful of advisers. Meanwhile, several guests whose names appeared on a VIP list that one Trump adviser circulated to reporters were nowhere to be found, including some who apparently decided to skip the event – surfacing as television pundits throughout the night from studios elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe end result was the exact scenario Trump’s advisers had hoped to avoid: an election where his top recruits fizzled or flopped and his primary Republican rival soared to new stardom.\n\nSources familiar with the matter said Trump left the party at the end of the night in a sour mood and resentful of the attention on DeSantis, who won reelection with a monstrous margin of victory and became the first Republican governor to carry Miami-Dade County, a densely populated and diverse area, for the first time in two decades. Just hours before the Florida governor’s victory, Trump had trashed DeSantis in comments to reporters aboard his 757 plane, threatening to dish unflattering information about him and suggesting he could have been more “gracious” for Trump’s endorsement in his 2018 bid for the governor’s mansion.\n\n“It wasn’t a great night for Trump and makes 2024 more competitive,” said one Republican operative.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Trump was in touch with allies in early 2024 voting states as he worked to develop a message that could carry him forward, according to two people briefed on those talks. In Iowa, Trump plans to tout Republican Brenna Bird’s defeat of incumbent Democratic Attorney General Tom Miller even though he didn’t endorse Bird until November 5, three days before her election.\n\nAs he works to plot his next steps, one of the biggest questions he is grappling with is how to approach DeSantis, sources said.\n\nBefore his resounding success on Tuesday, the Florida governor “was already having a moment but the spotlight just quadrupled in intensity,” said one Trump adviser.\n\n“We’ve got to figure out how to get it back before next Tuesday,” the Trump adviser added, referring to the “big announcement” Trump has teased for November 15, when he is expected to formally declare his third campaign for the White House. DeSantis’ strength was reflected in CNN exit polls on Tuesday, which showed the Republican governor exceeding President Joe Biden’s 2020 margin of victory among Latino voters in Florida and maintaining a small edge among independents, which Biden carried in the state by 11 points two years ago.\n\nBoth data points could prove compelling GOP primary between DeSantis and Trump, who made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in some 2020 states but not to the degree of the Florida Republican.\n\nTwo people close to the former president said he backed himself into a corner by publicly setting a date for his expected campaign announcement before the outcome of the midterm elections was known, something he did at an Ohio campaign rally on election eve to compromise with allies who did not want him to use the event as the launch site for his campaign.\n\n“He has to [announce],” said a source close to Trump, adding that it is too late for him to back out. “It would be embarrassing.”\n\nAnother Trump ally noted it would be “less embarrassing to delay than to get out there to a bunch of silence.”\n\nSome in Trump’s circle hoped a runoff in Georgia could help the former president delay the announcement and save face.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller said that Herschel Walker – who will face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a December 6 runoff, CNN projected Wednesday – should be the priority.\n\n“I’ll be advising him to delay it until after the Georgia runoff, assuming that’s where the race is still trending,” Miller said.\n\nOthers expect that advice will fall on deaf ears. One source noted that Trump had so far been resistant to arguments that he should postpone his announcement and as of Wednesday morning, it was still unclear to some of the former president’s closest aides how he would handle his 2024 ambitions. Would he proceed defiantly – launching a campaign with disregard for the potential obstacles that lie ahead – or entertain a rare recalculation?\n\n“I could see him claiming that Republicans didn’t turn out in droves because he wasn’t on the ballot and blaming everyone but himself,” said one of his advisers.\n\nDesire to be a kingmaker\n\nFor Trump, Tuesday’s underwhelming results followed months of intense engagement in a midterm cycle that marked a notable departure from the post-presidential activities of his modern predecessors. As early as last summer, he began working to recruit candidates for key Senate contests who would advance his false claims about the 2020 election.\n\n“He wanted to be seen as a legendary kingmaker,” said a former Trump campaign official.\n\nBy this spring, Trump was directly meddling in contested primaries – endorsing candidates he deemed to be the most MAGA, criticizing their opponents in statements and Truth Social posts, and patently ignoring advice from some of his advisers to remain on the sidelines until the general election began. Trump often argued that his involvement would pay dividends in the end, not only ushering in majorities in both congressional chambers but ensuring elected officials loyal to him – not the party – were installed in Washington and key governor’s mansions.\n\nIn many cases, even candidates that Trump didn’t endorse emblazoned their campaign websites with his image or familiar phrases like “America First” or “MAGA fighter.” Throughout the cycle, GOP contenders regularly trekked to Mar-a-Lago to seek his support. Others shelled out thousands of dollars to host fundraising events at the waterfront property, hoping the former president would take note of their devotion and reward them with an endorsement.\n\nTrump ended the cycle by spending more than $16 million through his MAGA Inc. super PAC in the final weeks to boost many of his hand-picked candidates and link his top Democratic targets to Biden, who has grappled with sinking favorability during his first two years in office. Hours before results began pouring in on Tuesday, Trump’s team circulated a memo touting his “unprecedented success in 2022” that quantified his campaign trail appearances and assistance to Republican candidates.\n\n“President Donald J. Trump has endorsed over 330 candidates this election cycle,” the memo read, adding that Trump has “raised nearly $350 million” for GOP candidates and the party overall since leaving office.\n\nWith votes still being tabulated in some states, it is unclear just how many of the hundreds of candidates who earned Trump’s endorsement prevailed on Tuesday. What is clear is that Trump allies entered Tuesday night believing it would be an undeniable success for the 45th president.\n\nAs he gathered with other Trump campaign alums at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Miller described the former president as a “juggernaut” at the beginning of the evening.\n\n“It will be a much different-looking party now because of the Trump MAGA movement,” Miller had predicted.\n\nAsked about the 330 endorsements that could make or break his political future, Trump himself began the night suggesting that he should emerge on the other side of the midterms unblemished, telling NewsNation hours before polls closed, “I think if they win, I should get all the credit. If they lose, I should not be blamed at all.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional statement from Rep.

But Rinke’s assertion about dead people always voting for Democrats should still be taken seriously.\n\nAfter the 2020 election, in which President Joe Biden fairly won Michigan by more than 150,000 votes, prominent Republicans including former President Donald Trump spread false allegations about Democrats having used deceased residents to steal victory in the state. And Rinke’s ad bashes Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for supposedly failing to do anything to “fix voter fraud.”\n\nVoter fraud is exceedingly rare in Michigan and every other state. And Rinke’s claim about dead people and Democrats is flat-out false.\n\nFacts First: It’s just not true that votes cast in the names of dead people are always cast for Democrats. Though the number of voter fraud cases involving the ballots of deceased people is tiny, there are recent cases in which such ballots were fraudulently cast either for Republican candidates – including Trump – or by registered Republicans.\n\nSince voters’ ballot choices are secret, the public sometimes never learns which political party an unlawful ballot was cast for; in some cases, we know the name and party registration of the person who committed the fraud but not who they actually supported in the deceased person’s name. Still, the available record makes it abundantly clear that there is no truth to Rinke’s suggestion that this kind of fraud is committed only by Democratic voters.\n\nWhen CNN asked Rinke’s campaign for evidence to support that claim, spokesperson Katie Martin didn’t provide any. Rather, she said in an email that “a quick Google search will show multiple news articles on deceased voters voting in elections.”\n\nCorrect – but that same quick Google search also disproves Rinke’s claim that “dead people always vote Democrat.”\n\nRepublican fraud cases in 2020\n\nConsider five of the proven or alleged “dead people” cases that emerged out of the 2020 general election:\n\nA Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty after casting a vote for Trump in the 2020 general election with an absentee ballot under the name of his late mother, who had been deceased for more than a decade. (The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the man said in court that he had “listened to too much propaganda” during the isolation of the pandemic “and made a stupid mistake.”)\n\nA Colorado man is charged with casting his missing wife’s mail-in ballot for Trump in the 2020 general election. The man allegedly told FBI agents that he submitted the ballot because he thought “all these other guys are cheating,” that his wife would have voted for Trump anyway, and that he didn’t know that you can’t legally cast your spouse’s ballot. (Prosecutors had also charged the man with murdering his wife, whose body has not been found, but they dropped the charges in April; they could still pursue charges in the future.)\n\nA registered Republican local official in Ohio, a township trustee, pleaded guilty after casting an absentee ballot in the 2020 general election under the name of his recently deceased father. (He told NBC News it was an “honest error” and also that he had simply been “trying to execute a dying man’s wishes.”)\n\nA registered Republican businessman in Nevada pleaded guilty after casting a mail-in ballot in the 2020 general election under the name of his late wife, who had been dead for about three years. (The man, who had initially claimed “disbelief” about supposedly learning that someone had cast his wife’s ballot, said in court that “I accept full responsibility for my actions and regret them,” Las Vegas television station 8 News Now reported.)\n\nA registered Republican woman in Arizona pleaded guilty after mailing in a ballot in the 2020 general election under the name of her recently deceased mother.\n\nThere are also cases from the 2020 election in which registered Democrats have been charged with requesting ballots on behalf of dead relatives, plus cases in which the party preference of the accused person is not publicly known. So this minuscule problem isn’t exclusive to Republicans – but it certainly isn’t exclusive to Democrats, either.\n\nThe Michigan picture\n\nA review by Michigan’s auditor general found that 1,616 votes in the 2020 general election in the state were cast by people who were dead as of Election Day.\n\nThat is about 0.03% of the 5.3 million total votes. It’s not close to the “18,000,” “17,000” and “10,000” Michigan dead people Trump had variously cited in complaining about the results. There is no indication that all of the 1,616 votes in question were cast for Biden, who won Michigan by 154,188 votes.\n\nAnd, critically, the auditor’s review did not conclude that the 1,616 votes were fraudulent.\n\nThe review noted that about 99% of the 1,616 votes, all but 20 of them, were cast by voters who died during Michigan’s 40-day absentee voting period – suggesting the votes may have been cast by people who lawfully submitted ballots and then happened to die shortly afterward but before Election Day.\n\nEven those votes are not supposed to be counted in Michigan results – more than 3,400 were rejected in 2020, according to state data – but they are not phony.\n\nIn addition, the auditor’s review noted that even some of the voters recorded as having died 41 days or more before Election Day may actually be living people who were incorrectly marked as deceased because they have a common last name like Smith or a suffix like Jr.\n\nSo Rinke and others are free to urge Michigan authorities to improve their administration of the voter rolls. But there just isn’t any sign of widespread voter fraud in the state, involving dead people or anybody else.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/politics/schools-covid-politics/index.html", "title": "Why schools are taking center stage in the culture wars | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe pressures of the coronavirus pandemic are reconfiguring the politics of education, dividing Democrats and creating new openings for Republicans.\n\nBoth sides of that equation will be on display Tuesday in a recall election for three school board members in San Francisco, one of the nation’s most liberal cities. The recall, which has split local Democrats, has combined genuine grassroots discontent over extended school closings during the coronavirus outbreak with massive funding from longtime critics of public education and some big supporters of Republican political campaigns. Divisions among Democrats are also sharpening in the accelerating blue state debates about how quickly to lift school mask mandates and other public health restrictions as coronavirus caseloads plummet nationwide.\n\nYet these internecine struggles between liberals are obscuring a much more expansive and explosive conflict spreading across the red states: an aggressive drive by Republicans to censor how public school teachers talk about race, gender, sexual orientation and other sensitive topics. That effort amounts to the most intrusive attempt to set legislative limits on the specific content of classroom instruction since the spate of state laws barring the teaching of evolution during the 1920s and the anti-Communist loyalty oaths for teachers that proliferated during the Joe McCarthy era after World War II.\n\nSponsors such as Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin in Virginia, Ron DeSantis in Florida and Greg Abbott in Texas are advancing these restrictive laws under the banner of “parents’ rights,” attempting to frame them as part of a broader parental demand for greater input after all the uncertainties of school closings and masking and quarantine policies during the long pandemic. Yet many observers, including some critics of how public schools have handled that challenge, say Republicans are trying to divert concerns about safety and student achievement during the pandemic to advance the preexisting goals of culturally conservative, predominantly White parents long resistant to open discussions of race and other controversial topics.\n\nBased on the group’s national polling and meetings with parents all over the country, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, says restricting how teachers can talk about race or gender “is really at the bottom of the list” of parental priorities. “This is political opportunism to hijack this momentum we are seeing from parents and families who are panicked and filled with anxiety and concern,” she says.\n\nResults from the latest CNN national poll underscore her perception. While the share of adults who said education would be an important factor in their votes during November’s midterm elections soared past 80%, only about 1 in 4 of them said the content of the curriculum was their major educational concern – and self-identified Republicans were far more likely to do so than other adults. A bigger share of those who said education would be important to them cited more traditional concerns about the broad social benefits of educating the next generation.\n\nMichelle Wong makes a sign during a rally in support of the San Francisco School Board recall at Carl Larsen Park, San Francisco, Saturday, February 12, 2022. Stephen Lam/The San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\n\n“It is a very small percentage of parents and mostly it is White parents in a position of privilege who are leading that conversation” about restricting classroom content, says Rodrigues. “These are the same people who are always hogging the mic … but that is certainly not reflective of the concerns of all parents.”\n\nThe pandemic has produced arguably the greatest challenge to the operation of the nation’s public schools since the Civil War. As American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten noted in an interview, schools were able to stay open even during major earlier disruptions to American life, such as the Depression and World War II, but they faced unprecedented questions – and few clear answers – when the pandemic struck. “When did you ever have a situation that we had in March 2020 through June 2020 that schools within a 24-, 48-hour period of time all went remote?” she said.\n\nThe pressures of adapting to that sudden new reality – and the long struggle to return to anything approaching normalcy – have imposed enormous strains on everyone connected to the school system, from administrators and teachers to parents and students. And in that crucible, new fault lines have opened in the politics of education.\n\nParents want schools open\n\nTwo years into the pandemic, the clearest note in public opinion may be that parents, and the public more broadly, want schools open for in-person learning wherever possible. In a January NBC national survey, about two-thirds of all adults, and an even higher percentage of parents of children younger than 18, said they were more concerned about kids falling behind academically from not attending school in person than they were about them spreading Covid-19 during in-person instruction. (Black parents were a notable exception, with a slight majority more concerned about spreading Covid, according to detailed results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican firm that co-manages the survey.)\n\nFrustration over extended school closings was the initial spur for the recall effort against three San Francisco school board members that voters will decide Tuesday. The city kept its schools closed for in-person learning longer than almost any other major jurisdiction.\n\nThe San Francisco experience shows how the pandemic has divided Democrats: The city under Democratic Mayor London Breed eventually sued the board – which was engaged in marathon negotiations with the local union over the safety standards for moving teachers back into the classroom – to force it to reopen the schools; Breed has endorsed the recall effort, which some other progressives in the area oppose. Yet the fight also shows how the left’s disagreements about responding to the pandemic have created new openings for longtime critics of public education on the right: Beyond its grassroots support, the recall movement has attracted substantial funding from conservatives, including William Oberndorf, a close ally of former President Donald Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos.\n\nWe had this catastrophic failure of our public education system: They were not ready, they were not prepared for this moment and parents had to scramble. We went to the promised land of choices and options … and now that we have been there, you can’t put that toothpaste back in the tube. Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president, National Parents Union\n\nThe San Francisco stew is in some respects a miniature of the complex situation nationally: genuine grassroots discontent, Democratic divisions and an aggressive new push from conservatives.\n\nAs Republicans like Youngkin and DeSantis rally under the banner of “parents’ rights,” a national CBS poll released Sunday, like earlier surveys, found that many parents are indeed concerned about the impact of the pandemic on their kids’ academic and emotional well-being. But in an Ipsos/Axios poll in November, the vast majority of parents of school-age children praised how their schools have balanced health and academic concerns – a finding that both the National Parents Union and the American Federation of Teachers, which have at times been at odds over the pandemic, say their own private polling has echoed.\n\nPolling also belies the perception of a widespread backlash against mask requirements in the schools. Citing declining caseloads, several Democratic governors have recently announced they will rescind mask requirements in the coming weeks for public school students, joining Republican states that either have already revoked their rules or never set them. (California on Monday reaffirmed its school mask requirement at least through the end of February.) Yet the CBS News poll released Sunday found that nearly three-fifths of parents of school-age children still believe that schools should require masks.\n\nThe broadest movement that has emerged from the pandemic’s turmoil is the effort by Republican-led states to censor how teachers talk about present and historic racial and gender inequities. In 2021, nine Republican-controlled states passed such laws and four others imposed restrictions through state boards of education. This year so many proposals have proliferated that Jeffrey Sachs, a political scientist who tracks the laws for the free speech group PEN America, told me his “gut instinct” is that ultimately all 23 states where Republicans hold unified control of the governorship and state legislature will approve some version of these measures.\n\nParents’ concerns? Achievement and safety\n\nThese proposals are not only expanding to more states but also broadening in their reach. In a news briefing on Monday, PEN America said eight states this year are considering legislation that would limit (or fully prohibit) how teachers and schools talk about sexual orientation and gender identity – with the most prominent of those efforts the legislation advancing in Florida that critics have dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill. Other states are proposing to impose greater surveillance on teachers, such as the Iowa bill that would install video feeds in every classroom. Youngkin has established a “tip line” allowing parents or others to charge teachers with improperly addressing “divisive” topics. Book bans are spreading across red states and school districts as well.\n\nAdapting the tactic employed in Texas’ new anti-abortion law, the Florida bills limiting how teachers can talk about race or sexual orientation would authorize private lawsuits by parents against schools. These measures threaten “to turn Florida into a censorship and surveillance state,” Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ rights group, charged in the PEN briefing.\n\nDeSantis, who along with Abbott has been among the most visible advocates of these restrictive laws, has defended them as a way of ensuring parental input into the curriculum. “You have politicians saying parents have no role in the education of their kids. Give me a break,” DeSantis said last week while embracing the “don’t say gay” legislation. “We want parents to be able to have access to what’s going on in the classroom.”\n\nYet polling suggests that the demands for restrictions on how schools address race, gender, sexual orientation and other controversial subjects are preponderantly a concern of one group of parents: Republicans. In last week’s national CNN survey, only about 1 in 6 adults thought parents should have the principal say on how schools teach race and only about 1 in 8 thought they should have the most influence either on how history is taught or which books are allowed in school libraries. Big majorities instead thought that authority should be shared among parents, teachers and school officials. Republicans were much more likely than others to argue that parents should have decisive authority, but even among GOP partisans that was a minority position.\n\nSponsors of the laws limiting the teaching of racism tout them as a means of defusing racial conflict. Reihan Salam, president of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has been among the most ardent promoters of these proposals, recently argued that they will promote greater racial harmony. “If we’re going to build a successful multiethnic democracy, it’ll be because we’ve lowered the salience of race in people’s lives,” he recently declared.\n\nBut critics of these plans see in them precisely the opposite goal: to suppress the social and political influence of historically marginalized groups that are growing in numbers. These bills to restrict how schools discuss race or sexual orientation are coming precisely as the 2020 census found that kids of color, for the first time, constitute a majority of the under-18 population, and a 2021 Gallup Poll found a far larger percentage of Generation Z (nearly 1 in 6) identifying as part of the LGBTQ community than people in older generations. “They are attacking any place where they can see the diversity rise,” George Johnson, author of “All Boys Aren’t Blue,” his 2020 memoir as a gay Black man, which has been banned from school libraries in multiple states, said Monday on the PEN briefing call.\n\nCritics of these proposals like Ruthanne Buck, a senior adviser to the Campaign for Our Shared Future, a group opposing them, see proponents operating a kind of “bait and switch” with parents. Focus groups with parents across the ideological spectrum, she says, show the pandemic has in fact exacerbated frustration with the quality of public education. “The general feeling is that Covid was a final straw to an educational system that was already struggling,” she says.\n\nBut, echoing the results of the CNN poll, she says those concerns are centered not on whether students are learning too much about controversial subjects, but on academic achievement, the quality of communication between schools and parents, maintaining safety amid the persisting pandemic, and mental health supports for children.\n\n“Across the board, parents do not think state legislators should be passing laws telling public schools what they can and cannot teach,” Buck says. “They think decisions about education should be left to school boards, parents and teachers. … We asked what’s the most important thing to you as a parent, and across the board, it was kids being able to think for themselves, show respect for others, think critically.”\n\nPandemic unleashed frustrations over schools\n\nWeingarten, the American Federation of Teachers president, similarly argues that parents, especially after watching their children learn at the kitchen table during the pandemic’s many months of remote instruction, are legitimately displaying more interest in school curriculums.\n\n“Of course, parents have a role,” she says. But she argues that “there’s a big difference between a gotcha proposal, without any kind of due process, without any kind of guardrails,” such as establishing a tip line for complaints about teachers, and measures that can instill more genuine cooperation, such as “having open school nights where parents are talking to teachers … about curriculum.”\n\nWeingarten argues that the goal of the bills restricting the teaching of race or sexual orientation is to “chill” classroom discussions of the underlying changes in American society. She likens the wave of restrictions to the measures that Southern states passed in the 1920s barring the teaching of evolution and the requirements for teachers to swear loyalty oaths and avoid teaching critical of the US government during the “red scare” years after World War II.\n\n“We are really backsliding,” she says. “The exploitation of fear in the aftermath of Covid is being used to try to turn the clock back to the 1950s in this country.”\n\nRepublicans are tapping into frustrations real and imagined, but we have left a vacuum. We have no reform agenda. Our party is seen as propping up a bureaucratic status quo that many parents thought didn’t perform well during the pandemic. You can’t just point to Republican demagoguery about race and books and win the argument. You have to make voters a counteroffer. Will Marshall, founder and president, Progressive Policy Institute\n\nRodrigues largely agrees with that part of Weingarten’s analysis. The proliferating red state restrictions on teaching “are creating a toxic environment for Black and brown children in this country,” she says. But she also says it is a mistake for Democrats and union leaders to ignore the other side of the equation: that a significant number of parents are concerned about the education system’s quality after getting a closer look at it during the pandemic.\n\n“We had this catastrophic failure of our public education system: They were not ready, they were not prepared for this moment and parents had to scramble,” Rodrigues says. “We went to the promised land of choices and options … and now that we have been there, you can’t put that toothpaste back in the tube.”\n\nWill Marshall, founder and president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank long critical of teachers’ unions, sees the same dual-edged message for Democrats in the broadening conflicts over education.\n\n“Republicans are tapping into frustrations real and imagined, but we have left a vacuum,” he says. “We have no reform agenda. Our party is seen as propping up a bureaucratic status quo that many parents thought didn’t perform well during the pandemic. You can’t just point to Republican demagoguery about race and books and win the argument. You have to make voters a counteroffer.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s administration has not set a sharply defined course through these swirling waters. It has consistently advocated for schools to reopen (and won the funding of substantial federal spending to support that), but it has neither identified with the centrist Democrats like Marshall advocating for school reforms to improve student performance nor consistently opposed the restrictions on teaching that are exploding in the red states. (Biden has directly criticized Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill.)\n\nStaying mostly on the sidelines may grow less plausible for the President as the education wars escalate from coast to coast – from the intramural liberal conflict on display Tuesday in San Francisco to the battle between DeSantis and his GOP allies with free speech and LGBTQ rights advocates in Florida.

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN —\n\nCholera is making a comeback in the Middle East and Africa, and its rapid rise has experts sounding alarms about the damage it is causing.\n\nThe disease had been in decline for years, but 2022 witnessed what the United Nations called “a worrying upsurge” around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that since January, 29 countries have reported outbreaks. For the previous five years, fewer than 20 countries on average reported outbreaks. The leading cause of the rise, says WHO, is water contamination.\n\nThe illness can be brutal, and is an indicator of poverty and social inequity, experts say.\n\nToday, numbers are rapidly increasing as the disease spreads in parts of the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThat has led the International Coordinating Group (ICG), the WHO body that manages emergency supplies of vaccines, to “temporarily suspend the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in cholera outbreak response campaigns, using instead a single-dose approach,” WHO said last week.\n\nThe suspension of the two-dose approach allows for the vaccine to reach more parts of the world, it said. While the one-dose strategy has been proven to be effective, said WHO, protection appears to be lower in children.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that a one-dose vaccination can provide immunity for six months on average, Salim Oweis, communication officer at UNICEF’s Middle East and North Africa office, told CNN, adding that this “can be enough for stopping transmission during an epidemic.” The two-dose regimen, with a 15-day interval, offers protection for three to five years.\n\nThe rapid rise in cases has put a strain on WHO and its partners’ ability to respond quickly, said Dick Chamla, emergency preparedness manager for the Africa region at WHO. “The situation is made worse by the overlap between these epidemics and ongoing humanitarian crises and other catastrophes,” Chamla told CNN.\n\nMarked by sudden and acute watery diarrhea, cholera can kill within hours if left untreated, warns WHO. It can, however, sometimes be treated with oral rehydration solutions in mild infections.\n\nFirst documented in the 19th century, it went on to rise into six pandemics. Some parts of the world have been living through the seventh pandemic since the 1960s and 1970s, including countries in South Asia and Africa, says WHO.\n\nUNICEF on Monday called for immediate action as cholera spreads through Syria and Lebanon, saying the disease is threatening the survival of children.\n\n“Malnourished children are more vulnerable to developing severe cholera disease,” Bertrand Bainvel, UNICEF’s deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in the statement.\n\n“In the Middle East, more and more people suffer from food insecurity and malnutrition due to different factors linked to conflict, [economic] crisis, drought and water scarcity, making them more vulnerable in case of cholera epidemic,” said Oweis.\n\nLebanon, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees, recorded its first case in three decades in October. It has since reported 718 cases and 11 deaths as of October 24, according to the Lebanese ministry of health.\n\n“In refugees’ camps and informal settlements, the population is mostly composed of women and children living often in precarious situations with inadequate health, water and sanitation facilities,” said Oweis, adding that as of October 22, more than half of the suspected cholera cases were children under 15 years old “living in fragile settings.”\n\nWar-torn Syria has seen one of this year’s worst outbreaks. The disease has spread through the country’s northwest and northeast, and is linked to contaminated water near the Euphrates River, according to a report by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders. More than 13,000 suspected cases have been reported across the country, added MSF, including 60 deaths as of October 14.\n\nUNICEF has made an urgent appeal for $40.5 million to expand its response in Syria and Lebanon alone.\n\nSome African countries are also experiencing worsening outbreaks, including those who have already been struggling with the disease for years. Communities in Somalia, Cameroon, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin have all reported a surge in cases, according to disease outbreak reports by WHO.\n\nIfedayo Adetifa, director general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC), whose country has been dealing with a rise in cholera cases amid the worst flooding in a decade, called for international help for nations struggling with the disease.\n\n“Global health is supposed to be about solidarity,” Adetifa told CNN. “And by solidarity we don’t mean absolving governments of their responsibility, but it means that it is important that the countries that are less affected, and that have resources to spare, also come in and help,” he added.\n\nInternational support, he said, can come in the form of vaccine programs and other investments in sanitation and hygiene.\n\nIran protests\n\nKurdish rights group Hengaw released a video showing what appear to be security forces in Saqqez, the hometown of Mahsa Amini in Iran’s Kurdistan region, late Tuesday, the night before the 40th-day marker of her death.\n\nIn Iranian culture, the 40th-day mark after someone’s passing is an important day of mourning. In the lead up to Wednesday, Hengaw said security forces had “been deployed in several areas in Saqqez.”\n\nMeanwhile, Iran’s state-run news agency IRNA says that Amini’s family has made a statement to say they will not be marking her passing on Wednesday.\n\nHere’s the latest on this developing story:\n\nAll schools and universities in Iran’s Kurdistan region will be closed on Wednesday due to “increasing cases of the influenza virus,” IRNA reported.\n\nTehran’s Sharif University of Technology announced that classes of new students will “continue to be held virtually until further notice” due to the “persistence of some problems and the lack of a calm environment,” IRNA said.\n\nStudents at a university in the Shiite holy city of Qom disrupted a speech by the government spokesman on Tuesday, and could be heard chanting “women, life, freedom, man, country, prosperity.”\n\nOn Monday, Iranian education authorities said students at a girls’ school in Tehran were injured after a dispute between students and officials over mobile phones in the classroom, state-aligned Tasnim news agency said.\n\nNorway-based rights group Iran HR said that at least 234 people, including 29 children, have been killed since protests started last month. CNN cannot independently verify the death toll.\n\nThe digest\n\nQatar ruler says nation faced unprecedented criticism as host country of World Cup\n\nQatar has faced unprecedented criticism since it was picked as the host of the 2022 World Cup, some of which has amounted to slander, the country’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said on Tuesday. “We initially dealt with the matter in good faith, and even considered some of the criticism as positive and useful in helping us to develop aspects of ours that need to be developed,” he said.\n\nBackground: Qatar, the first Muslim nation to host the tournament, has been the subject of criticism for its treatment of migrant workers and its anti-homosexuality laws. Players participating in the tournament have spoken out against the country. It expects 1.2 million visitors during the tournament, creating a huge logistical and policing challenge for the tiny country.\n\nWhy it matters: The emir said that it appears that “the campaign is continuing and expanding and contains slander and double standards.” The emir said that the “fabrications and double standards” in the “ferocious” campaign against the country have prompted people to question the real motives behind the campaign. Doha has introduced reforms including rules to protect workers from heat and a monthly minimum wage of 1,000 riyals ($275), and says it continues to develop its labor system.\n\nIsraeli raid targeting Lion’s Den turns into deadliest day for Palestinians this year\n\nAt least six Palestinians were killed on Tuesday during an Israeli military operation targeting the Lion’s Den group and other militants. Five were killed in the old city of Nablus during an Israeli raid there, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. A sixth person was killed in Nabi Saleh by Israeli live fire, the ministry added, when Palestinian protestors took to the streets.\n\nBackground: Israel said it was targeting Lion’s Den, a new militant group which emerged in Nablus this year and has targeted Israeli soldiers, killing at least two. Israel’s Prime Minister Yair Lapid said, “our goal was and remains to inflict severe and lasting damage on terrorism and its agents in Jenin and Nablus and anywhere else where terrorist nests grow.” He added that the head of the Lion’s Den and other militants were assassinated in the raid and that the “terrorist laboratory of Lion’s Den was severely damaged.”\n\nWhy it matters: Tuesday was the deadliest day of violence in the occupied West Bank this year, CNN analysis of official Palestinian data showed. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the killings as a “war crime” while calling on the United States to stop Israeli “aggression” in the West Bank before things “reach a very critical point,” according to his spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh.\n\nGlobal energy transition might take 30 years, Saudi finance minister says\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said on Wednesday that the world’s energy transition away from fossil fuels could take as long as 30 years, necessitating continued investment in conventional resources to ensure security of supply, Reuters reported.\n\nBackground: Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, and fellow OPEC producers have warned of underinvestment in hydrocarbons, especially while spare production capacity is thin and demand still relatively healthy despite strong economic headwinds.\n\nWhy it matters: Some of the biggest energy-consuming nations have been trying to wean themselves off fossil fuels to reach targets of zero net carbon emissions. Jadaan said the thinking about energy and climate change has now become “more realistic” in that transition will actually take “not only a year, not 10 years, [but] possibly 30 years.”\n\nWhat to watch\n\nSaudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, rejected the accusation that the kingdom is cooperating with Russia, saying it engages with “everybody across the board, those we agree with and those we disagree with.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson, Princess Princess Reema welcomed the Biden administration’s review of its relationship with Riyadh, because “the kingdom is not what it used to be five years ago.”\n\n“Our relationship is more than the sale of arms and it is more than the exchange of oil,” she said.\n\nWatch the interview here:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN anchor asks Saudi ambassador to US: Is the kingdom siding with Russia? 02:44 - Source: CNN\n\nWhat’s trending\n\nEgypt: #Death_Game\n\nEgypt has warned against a dangerous social media challenge that has gone viral among children.\n\nThe challenge, known as the “death game,” involves a person taking several deep breaths then proceeding to hold their breath while another presses on their chest. The subsequent loss of consciousness is meant to temporarily replicate the feeling of death.\n\nSocial media challenges, or internet challenges, are viral videos where users film themselves doing a difficult task and distribute the video, daring others to repeat it. They are often done to raise awareness for charitable causes, but some have resorted to dangerous methods.\n\nEgypt’s Ministry of Education said that a number of school children had exposed themselves to danger by playing the game to post on social media, Egyptian news sites reported. The ministry called on schools to monitor children’s behavior and prevent such practices in their facilities, while also asking parents to keep track of the content their children consume.\n\nIn one widely shared video that caused outrage in Egypt, a girl in a school uniform is seen holding her breath as another girl presses on her chest with both hands. The girl holding her breath eventually collapses.\n\n“We live in a terrifying era,” tweeted a user, commenting on the video. “May God protect all our children.”\n\nThe phenomenon has captivated Egyptian television talk shows and social media, amid calls for parents and schools to raise awareness about the danger associated with the challenge.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/politics/republican-states-book-ban-race-lgbtq/index.html", "title": "Book bans move to center stage in the red state education wars ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe escalating red-state efforts to ban more books mark a new stage in the struggle to control the educational experience of America’s kaleidoscopically diverse younger generations.\n\nSince 2021, more than a dozen Republican-controlled states have passed laws or approved executive branch policies that restrict how public school teachers can talk about race, gender and sexual orientation, as in the case of the bill critics call “don’t say gay,” which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last week. But now, even as National Library Week arrives this week, the attempt to limit what materials are available to young people is spilling out from the classroom into the library.\n\nThough battles over access to controversial titles traditionally have been fought district by district, and even school by school, Republican-controlled states including Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas are now pushing statewide rules that make it easier for critics to remove books they dislike from school libraries in every community.\n\nAt the same time, although none have yet passed, more red states are seriously debating proposals that would make it easier for critics to force the removal of books even from public libraries serving the adult population.\n\n“The primary target still is school libraries and school librarians, K-12 teachers, but we are seeing this bleed over to public libraries,” says Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association.\n\nTo the conservatives pushing this agenda, these new restrictions on libraries – like the parallel red-state laws limiting certain discussions in the classroom – are a means of protecting parental rights.\n\n“Parents want education for their kids: They are not interested in indoctrination through the school system,” DeSantis argued late last month when signing a bill facilitating efforts to remove books from school libraries.\n\nBut to a wide array of civil rights, civil liberties and free expression groups, these restrictions represent an effort to enshrine the values of one particular group of parents – conservative Whites – over the priorities and experiences of an increasingly diverse society in which kids of color now compose a clear majority of the public school student body nationwide.\n\nThere is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information. Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project\n\nThe parallel battles over how teachers address race, gender and sexual orientation and how libraries regulate access to books represent the broadest attempt to limit what students are taught since the “loyalty oath” demands on teachers during the red scare period of the 1950s, or even the “Scopes trial”-era laws banning the teaching of evolution during the 1920s.\n\n“There is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information,” says Vera Eidelman a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. On both fronts, she says, critics are “targeting the same set of viewpoints and experiences and aspects of education,” primarily materials relating to race, gender roles and the experiences of LGBTQ individuals.\n\n‘Parallel movements’\n\nThe torrent of laws approved in Republican-controlled states since 2021 to limit how teachers can discuss race, gender or sexual orientation has been part of a much broader current. Since the 2020 election, the 23 states in which Republicans control both the governorship and the state legislature have approved a surge of statutes restricting abortion rights, making it more difficult to vote, barring transgender girls and women from participating in grade school or college sports, banning transgender care for minors and increasing penalties for public protest. Cumulatively, as I’ve written, these proliferating red-state measures constitute an attempt to reverse what legal analysts call the “rights revolution” of roughly the past 60 years, in which Congress and the Supreme Court have generally expanded the circle of basic civil rights and liberties guaranteed to all Americans and reduced the ability of states to curtail those rights.\n\nCritics of the new wave of red-state measures see an especially powerful through line connecting the laws that make it more difficult to vote and increase the legal penalties for disruptive public protest with the bills that censor classroom instruction or empower critics to ban books in school libraries. All three thrusts make it more difficult for opponents to mobilize opposition to the agenda the red-state Republicans are advancing.\n\n“There are parallel movements across voting rights and protest rights and education rights,” says Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors. “In each case, you have a kind of flowering of experimentation of legislation to see what kind of things can fit to make it harder for people to vote, to make it more costly to protest and what would make it harder to access information in school.”\n\nThe restrictions on classroom teaching have exploded across the red states since 2021. Jeffrey Sachs, a political scientist at Acadia University in Nova Scotia who tracks these proposals for PEN America, counts at least 13 Republican-controlled states that have approved laws censoring how teachers talk about “divisive concepts,” such as systematic racial inequity, and five more states with GOP governors that have imposed administrative limits on such teachings through state boards of education or other bodies.\n\nThe conservatives pushing these bills portray them as a necessary barrier against liberal attempts to “indoctrinate” students through concepts such as critical race theory, an academic analysis of systemic discrimination, or the 1619 Project, a New York Times project that stressed the impact of slavery on American society. At a recent event with DeSantis, Alicia Farrant, a mother and school board candidate in Orange County, Florida, described her state’s version of these proposals as proof that parents “will not cower to the divisive agendas that are infiltrating our public schools in order to corrupt and destroy the educational foundations of our great nation.”\n\nThis wave does not appear to have crested. The Florida legislation barring discussion of sexual orientation in the youngest grades and limiting it in older grades has spawned copycat bills in other Republican-controlled states. More states are also considering laws that would extend the classroom censorship to public colleges and universities. Other GOP-controlled states, including Missouri, are considering their own bills on race and gender, and some of the states that have already passed such laws are doubling back with new proposals – such as a proposed amendment to the state constitution in Arizona to ban the teaching of critical race theory.\n\n“The level of focus and unity of language that we are seeing across all of these different bills is pretty extraordinary,” Sachs says. “There is an incredible amount of overlap, down to the punctuation of these bills, so we can definitely consider this a national campaign and not one that is responding to the specific context of each state.”\n\nPublic libraries are not immune\n\nThis campaign has developed so much momentum that it has overflowed the classroom to reach the library – particularly those in schools, but now also, for the first time, lapping at the doors of those that serve the public.\n\nIn recent decades, these fights have unfolded mostly locally, with challenges to specific books at individual libraries. Those fights are clearly intensifying: On Monday, the American Library Association reported that in 2021 it had recorded 729 such efforts to ban books at school or public libraries, the most since it began cataloging these efforts in 2000. The most-challenged books, the group reported, were from Black or LGBTQ authors or centered on characters from those communities.\n\nBut this struggle is also expanding to a new level, with multiplying red-state efforts to create statewide policies designed to lead to the removal of more books. In Texas, for instance, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is pressuring school boards to remove what he calls “pornography” from school libraries. Abbott’s letter followed a more detailed complaint from a Republican state legislator who sent districts a letter inquiring about the presence of 850 books, including several by prominent Black or LGBTQ authors.\n\nIn Florida, DeSantis signed a bill late last month that requires school libraries to post more information about their collections and seek community input on materials they acquire. Most importantly, the new law requires the state Department of Education to collect and publish a report on which books have been removed in any district across the state.\n\nAt the bill-signing ceremony, DeSantis said these provisions would ensure that students are exposed only to age-appropriate books. The new measures will increase schools’ “ability to choose what is appropriate for different age groups,” he argued. “Parents are going to have the ability to have their voices heard.”\n\nBut opponents of the legislation say the requirement for the state Education Department to publish a list of books removed in any district provides a road map for critics to demand the removal of such books in all districts.\n\nFlorida, as is the case with many of the cultural flashpoints now dominating red-state legislatures, has moved fastest and furthest. But Georgia’s Republican-controlled legislature last week passed its own bill facilitating challenges to books in school libraries; measures targeting school libraries have also passed one chamber in the GOP-controlled legislatures in Kansas and Tennessee, though they face uncertain prospects of final approval. Similarly motivated bills have surfaced in Nebraska and Oklahoma as well.\n\nIn another escalation to the book wars, red state proposals are now emerging to ease the removal of books even in public libraries serving the adult, as well as the youth, population. These proposals generally would strip away the protection for librarians (and educators) from state obscenity laws, allowing officials to criminally charge librarians if they stock materials that a prosecutor considers obscene.\n\nWe all live in diverse communities these days … and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone’s lives in the library collection. Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association\n\nRepublican legislators have introduced bills to eliminate those protections in more than half a dozen states, according to the American Library Association’s tracking. None have yet passed into law, though one has cleared the state House in Idaho. Yet given the pace at which ideas once on the fringe, such as bans on gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, are advancing through the red states, Caldwell-Stone says the library association is “deeply concerned that one of these bills will eventually pass and will be used as a means of both intimidating librarians or actually charging them with crimes – based on this falsehood that mainstream materials, published by mainstream publishers, are somehow illegal speech unprotected by the First Amendment.”\n\nLast fall, a library faced such an investigation in Campbell County, Wyoming, after a local church complained about the presence of LGBTQ and sexual education materials there; a special prosecutor appointed by the county ultimately decided not to press charges.\n\nAll these confrontations underscore the cultural chasm between increasingly diverse younger generations and the socially conservative, predominantly White and Christian, Republican coalition that holds power in the red states. Children of color have constituted a majority of the public school K-12 student body since 2014, according to federal statistics, and now make up nearly 55% of the total. Gallup recently reported that 1 in 5 members of Generation Z, as well as 1 in 10 millennials, identify as LGBTQ, far more than in older generations. And the Public Religion Research Institute has found that more than a third of young adults identify as secular, without affiliation with any organized religion.\n\nSupporters of the efforts to restrict classroom teaching and/or ban books, by contrast, often cite a threat to “traditional” morality as a justification. When DeSantis signed the bill easing challenges to school library collections, one of the speakers he brought to the podium was a mother who had been prominent in protests against school masking requirements in Volusia County. She said her concern about school libraries was prompted in part by a picture book called “Red: A Crayon’s Story,” in which a crayon labeled red discovers that it’s really blue. The mother, Rebecca Sarwi, said she objected to “subliminal messaging for kids that young” that “normalizes them to believe” that they may be “something other than the unique individual that God created them to be.”\n\nServing ‘the needs of everyone’\n\nSuch arguments highlight what may be the core issue in this intensifying dispute: Though the classroom and library restrictions are being portrayed as an effort to strengthen “parents’ rights,” in practice they mean giving one set of parents a veto over educational content not only for their own kids, but others’ as well.\n\nLibrarians “don’t disagree with parents who want to guide their children’s readings … but they stand firmly opposed to one family dictating what is available to everyone else in a school library or a public library,” Caldwell-Stone told me. “We all live in diverse communities these days … and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone’s lives in the library collection.”\n\nPolls have generally found broad skepticism about the new classroom and library restrictions. A recent CBS survey found that more than four-fifths of Americans opposed banning books because they criticized American history or discussed race. A recent Grinnell College national poll found more than 70% of Americans trusted school officials to decide what materials were appropriate for their libraries. In a recent CNN poll, only about 1 in 6 adults thought parents should have the principal say on how race is taught in schools.\n\nOne element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students. I don’t think it’s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world. Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America\n\nOpponents of the restrictive measures are trying to organize greater resistance to them. Red Wine and Blue, a nationwide group of suburban Democratic-leaning women fighting the red-state proposals, has organized a nationwide “read-in” of banned books on Thursday hosted by Dolly Parton’s sister Stella that features the authors of targeted books such as “I Am Rosa Parks” and “Heather Has Two Mommies.” That same day, a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee is holding a hearing on the book ban efforts, which could signal a turn toward greater attention to the issue from national Democrats.\n\n“After a long time of banging my head on the kitchen counter, I do feel like there’s progress and we are seeing some results,” says Katie Paris, Red Wine and Blue’s founder.\n\nParis says thousands of women have gone through the group’s training, which is designed to counter the organizing of the conservative organizations supporting the restrictions, such as Moms for Liberty. Though the number of proposed book bans continues to rise, Paris says, a smaller share of them have been approved in recent months by districts or school administrators, according to the group’s figures. In several cases, others note, students themselves are taking a more visible role in opposing these measures – as in the widespread walkouts in Florida against the “don’t say gay” bill and a lawsuit brought by Missouri students against a book ban in their school.\n\n“One element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students,” says Friedman. “I don’t think it’s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world.”\n\nStill, even with occasional setbacks, the drive to control the flow of information to young people is demonstrating enormous energy in red states. With Congress unlikely to pass any national legislation combating this trend, opponents’ best chance to slow the tide are legal challenges, some of which are already working through the courts. In the 1982 Pico decision upholding the First Amendment rights of students, the Supreme Court ruled, as the ACLU’s Eidelman puts it, “schools cannot remove books from their shelves merely because they disagree with the ideas expressed in those books.”\n\nYet many observers note it’s unclear whether this more conservative Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority would uphold that standard. What is clear is that more of the red states appear intent on testing the boundaries of what the Supreme Court will allow through new laws facilitating the banning of books from school, or potentially even public, libraries.\n\n“This is one of the key characteristics of the era in which we live,” says Paris. “I think we’ve had to learn there are no bounds.

But there’s no doubt the ruling has major implications for the Biden administration’s border strategy.\n\nUS District Judge Emmet Sullivan’s Tuesday decision requires officials to end a controversial Trump-era policy – something that officials predicted earlier this year would lead to a new influx of migrants trying to cross into the United States.\n\nThe Biden administration had criticized and vowed to end the use of Title 42 at the border, but more recently came to rely on the policy.\n\nBorder authorities used the public health restrictions to expel migrants nearly 2.5 million times in less than three years. And just last month officials announced they were expanding the policy.\n\nNow, after another ruling from the judge Wednesday, they have just over a month before they’ll have to end it.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the key questions and answers about Title 42’s history, the judge’s ruling, what’s happening on the ground and what could happen next.\n\nWhat is Title 42, and why are people talking about it again?\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order that officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The order allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants at US land borders. The policy is widely known as Title 42, for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC director to issue it.\n\nThe border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them. Immigrant rights advocates argued officials were using public health as a pretext to keep as many immigrants out of the country as possible. Public health experts also slammed the policy, saying it wasn’t justified by the circumstances.\n\nIn April, the policy became a political lightning rod and a topic of fierce debate as the Biden administration announced plans to end it. But ultimately, the policy remained in place after a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the administration’s plans to roll it back.\n\nAnd the national political conversation moved on to other targets. Immigration and border enforcement remained big points of contention, and a major theme that many Republicans emphasized in midterm election campaigns. But Title 42 was no longer the focus of debate.\n\nSullivan’s ruling places the issue front and center once again, and raises major questions about what will happen next at the border.\n\nWhat did the federal judge find, and what does it mean?\n\nSullivan, a federal judge in the District of Columbia, found the Title 42 order to be “arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.” That act governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.\n\nHe faulted the CDC for “its decision to ignore the harm that could be caused” by issuing the policy, and said the CDC had failed to consider alternative approaches. Sullivan also concluded that the policy did not rationally serve its purpose, given that Covid-19 was already widespread throughout the United States when it was rolled out.\n\nThe bottom line: Based on Sullivan’s ruling, the government can’t use the coronavirus pandemic as a justification to expel migrants anymore, and it never should have in the first place.\n\nImmigrants from Haiti, who crossed through a gap in the US-Mexico border barrier, wait to be processed by the U.S. Border Patrol on May 20, 2022, in Yuma, Arizona. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nDoes the administration have to comply?\n\nYes, and officials have indicated they will. But they asked the court for a five-week reprieve – a request the judge said he was granting Wednesday with “GREAT RELUCTANCE.”\n\nSullivan’s ruling striking down Title 42 will be on hold until December 21.\n\n“The delay in implementation of the court’s order will allow the government to prepare for an orderly transition to new policies at the border,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.\n\nHow could this change what’s happening at the border?\n\nMigrants encountered under Title 42 are either expelled to their home countries or into Mexico. Under Title 42, authorities have expelled migrants at the US-Mexico border nearly 2.5 million times in less than three years, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. And the vast majority of those expulsions – more than 80% – have occurred under the Biden administration.\n\nBut migrants haven’t stopped trying to cross the US-Mexico border – a detail people on both sides of the debate have pointed to, with very different arguments about what it shows.\n\nThose who support Title 42 point to border arrests as they argue how essential the pandemic policy has been for blocking illegal immigration. Those who oppose the policy argue official statistics about encounters at the border inflate the severity of the situation, because the data include people crossing the border multiple times. They argue Title 42 has actually caused more border crossings.\n\nIf the order is lifted, the way migrants are processed at the border would go back to how it was before 2020. Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.\n\nOfficials earlier this year said they expected lifting Title 42 would prompt a new influx of migrants trying to cross into the United States. At the time, they said they were preparing for different outcomes, including a worst-case-scenario possibility that up to 18,000 migrants a day could try to cross the border.\n\nThe number of migrants at the border can fluctuate seasonally, and the administration hasn’t released updated estimates since Sullivan’s ruling or revealed what new policies they plan to implement. But the Department of Homeland Security stressed in its statement Tuesday evening that even though Title 42’s days are numbered, it will remain in place “for some period.”\n\nAnd officials seemed to allude to the possibility that the court ruling could become fodder for smugglers trying to convince migrants to make the dangerous journey to the US.\n\n“We know that smugglers will lie to take advantage of vulnerable migrants, putting lives at risk,” the DHS said.\n\nWho has been subjected to Title 42?\n\nEarlier this year, the policy drew attention when authorities at first were using it to turn away Ukrainians at the border, then largely started granting exceptions that allowed thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge to cross.\n\nAdvocates argued a racist double standard was at play as many migrants from Central America and Haiti continued to be turned back under the policy. Federal officials denied that accusation and said each exemption is granted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn August, a CNN analysis found that migrants from outside Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were far less likely to be subjected to Title 42.\n\nBut for some migrants, that’s starting to change. Nearly 6,000 Venezuelan migrants were expelled under Title 42 in October after the Biden administration announced a new policy toward migrants from the South American nation.\n\nAdvocates say for many of those who are expelled, the situation is dire.\n\nSince Biden took office, Human Rights First says it’s identified nearly 10,000 cases of kidnapping, torture, rape or other violent attacks on people blocked or expelled to Mexico under Title 42.\n\nHow are critics and defenders of the policy reacting to the ruling?\n\nLee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney who argued the case before Sullivan, praised the ruling.\n\n“Title 42 was never about public health, and this ruling finally ends the charade of using Title 42 to bar desperate asylum seekers from even getting a hearing,” he said in a statement.\n\nImmigrant advocacy organizations and some Democratic lawmakers echoed those sentiments and called for the administration to swiftly dismantle the policy.\n\n“Asylum is a human right. Title 42 was a cruel, inhumane policy,” Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Illinois, said on Twitter.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republicans were swift to condemn the judge’s decision.\n\n“This will further signal to cartels, human smugglers, & illegal immigrants that the border is wide open—inciting more violence & lawlessness. Disastrous,” Abbott wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhat’s the Biden administration’s stance on Title 42?\n\nThe Biden administration has sent mixed messages on Title 42, but lately had seemed more favorable towards the policy. Officials have been using Title 42 to try to change the conversation around the border and the situation on the ground.\n\nMany advocates expected President Biden would lift the order as soon as he took office, given his campaign promises to build a more humane immigration system. Instead, his administration extended the policy more than a year into his presidency and defended it for months in court.\n\nIn April 2022, the administration announced plans to end the policy, stating that it was no longer necessary given “current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight Covid-19.”\n\nAfter the federal judge in Louisiana blocked that effort, the Justice Department vowed to appeal.\n\nBut months later, facing mounting political pressure over a marked increase in migrants crossing the border the administration announced in October that it was expanding the use of Title 42 to expel Venezuelans into Mexico.\n\nJust hours before Sullivan’s ruling, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers the policy remained in place.\n\nMonths ago we heard officials allude to the plans they had for managing migration at the border once Title 42 was lifted. Now the judge’s ruling forces the Biden administration’s hand.\n\nWithout Title 42 at its disposal, it’s unclear what new steps the administration will take at the border. Whatever happens next is sure to face intense political scrutiny.\n\nAlready the judge’s decision is intensifying debate over the border once again.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Ashley Biden’s public debut is unfolding without the usual tight choreography of a White House production, and she has appeared in public without political staffers in attendance or reaching out eagerly to reporters with the customary spin. The White House declined to comment for this story, as did Ashley Biden.\n\nBut Biden is making it clear she’s ready to tell her own story, no small matter for a person whose personal diary was once stolen and peddled for sale to her father’s political detractors.\n\n“I finally feel like I’m in a place where I really know who I am, I know my worth, I know my family – who are honestly some of the most incredible, kind, compassionate humans, who have given up their life, really, for service to the American people,” said Biden, speaking on the record last week to a small group of invited guests at a question-and-answer event at a hip DC hotel.\n\nThe public confessions come at a moment important for Ashley Biden, whose father and mother, Dr. Jill Biden, continue to weigh a reelection run in a country that remains roiled by political division. The gloves-off campaign style of the last several years has not gone unnoticed by Ashley Biden.\n\n“I grew up with Dad kind of always – I always saw him work with the other side of the aisle,” said Biden last week. “Now, since (former President Donald) Trump, I’m sorry, but this is just a whole disgusting ballgame. It is like nothing I’ve ever seen because he gave air to hate. And it’s always been there, right? But it was not as visible as it is today.”\n\nAshley Biden’s most recent remarks are the most forthcoming, lengthy and personal since her father took office, but her public momentum has been building. Last month, she stepped out at a splashy magazine party in Washington, headlined by supermodel Christy Turlington; several days later, Biden was in San Francisco, hosting a roundtable on mental health and traumatic recovery centers, and participating in an interview with the Bay Area NPR station.\n\nOn October 24, Biden joined her parents at the White House for a reception to celebrate the Indian holiday Diwali, standing beside the first lady as she made remarks. Jill Biden wore a green, printed dress; Ashley Biden wore a three-piece, peach-colored sari.\n\nOctober 24, 2022, Washington, District of Columbia, USA: First lady Dr. Jill Biden introduces her daughter Ashley Biden at a reception to celebrate Diwali in the East Room in the White House in Washington, DC, October 24, 2022 Chris Kleponis/CNP/Zuma Press\n\nShe had previously popped up from time to time – that was her this summer on the beach in Rehoboth, Delaware, pulling her father away from the press during a walk with a sharp, “Nope, like, no more – no more questions.” Biden joked, “That’s my press secretary daughter.”\n\nBut she is not a ubiquitous West Wing presence like her presidential first daughter predecessor, nor is she consistent tabloid fodder, like her older brother, Hunter Biden.\n\n“When I was growing up, kids were off limits, right?” said Biden at last week’s event, discussing an earlier time when campaigns practiced more civility. “You weren’t allowed. It was kind of a mutual understanding that you just didn’t really go after people’s children. You know? … I-I- don’t – that’s not what I signed up for.”\n\nA ‘strategic’ public emergence\n\nFour people familiar with Ashley Biden and her family told CNN it’s not clear to them why she is choosing now to make a more public emergence with politically charged statements.\n\n“She has had periods of being more vocal,” says one person who worked with the Bidens for several years. “But she has also had times of being almost reclusive, and not participating.”\n\nAnother person added that while Ashley Biden’s parents are supportive of her and her convictions, there is always a “bit of stress” when either of their children are in the public eye.\n\nAsked whether the recent comments from Biden are being sanctioned, or even monitored, by the White House – as is the tendency for most administrations when presidential family members make public speaking engagements – another person was doubtful. “She has always been her own person,” said the source.\n\n“I’m authentic, I’m kind, I’m honest. I care, I’m compassionate. And I’m really strategic,” Biden said last week, exaggerating the Ls in “really.”\n\nA third person who has known Ashley Biden and the Biden family for more than a decade said it is typically not like the Biden family to “restrict” or “censor” their children. However, a presidential daughter discussing, for example, the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into her brother’s contacts and financial dealings is not exactly the kind of going rogue an administration would feel comfortable with, said a political strategist who has worked with White House Democrats.\n\nFederal prosecutors are weighing possible charges for Hunter Biden related to tax violations, as well as for making a false statement related to a gun purchase, CNN has previously reported.\n\n“They’re not going to find anything,” she said at the Q&A last week, talking about Hunter Biden, and the investigation. “They’re just trying to do whatever they can, but that’s,” she said, pausing to shrug, “so when that started to happen, when people started to attack me, and I was like, ‘Whoa.’ It just became a widespread thing.”\n\nAshley Biden said the brouhaha over the Hunter Biden allegations of wrongdoing and influence peddling has become little more than a family inside joke. “I still look at my brother and I’m like, ‘do you know you impeached Donald Trump, basically?’”\n\nFrom a ‘humble’ home to embracing the spotlight\n\nAshley Biden was raised, she says, in a “humble” home.\n\n“Growing up, I lived a very normal, down-to-earth life,” she said last week. She was an athlete, excelling at both field hockey and lacrosse during her Wilmington, Delaware, school years.\n\nShe took an interest in her father’s grassroots-style of politicking, often accompanying him at campaign events, parades and on the door-to-door visits that were once a hallmark of gathering votes.\n\n“I would travel with him everywhere and I would always question the inequity. I also went to a Quaker school and learned about racism from a very young age,” said Biden during an October 20 interview with KQED in San Francisco. “And it was my mission to tackle structural violence and institutional racism. Why aren’t people healing? Why are the most marginalized the most harmed, yet the least healed?”\n\nBiden became a social worker, working hands-on with cases, mostly in underserved areas of Delaware and parts of Philadelphia. She got her master’s degree in social work from the University of Pennsylvania – a Biden-family favorite for higher education. She eventually became executive director for the Delaware Center for Justice, where she worked until 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Biden launched a hooded sweatshirt line dubbed “Livelihood,” and marketed as a socially conscious fashion label. The hoodies retailed for $80-$100, and according to Biden, profits went to various charities in support of social justice and minority entrepreneurship.\n\nAs Joe Biden campaigned for the presidency, Ashley would appear from time to time on the campaign trail, stumping beside him, the only daughter of Jill and Joe Biden. When her parents moved into the White House, Ashley Biden sometimes did, too, said two people familiar with the Bidens’ living situation, most recently last winter and early spring.\n\nShe had been scheduled to travel on two foreign trips with the first lady – in May, to Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine, and Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica – but pulled out of the trips last-minute. The East Wing cited Covid-19-related issues for both of the cancellations.\n\n‘We are not letting them win’\n\nBiden admits she has shied from the spotlight, which she says got uglier and uglier during the last presidential campaign, when opponents made a frequent target of her and her brother.\n\n“I have to be honest with you, I started to really have a lot of resentment,” said Biden last week in Washington. “It’s cruel, like, honestly, it’s dehumanizing. And so, I have a lot of anger around that.”\n\nShe paused and added, “I’m also like, screw this, we are not letting them win.”\n\nThe flare of anger is personal for Ashley Biden. She had her own brush with the exposure of her personal life, motivated by political opponents of her father. In August, two people pleaded guilty to stealing her belongings, including her journal, and selling them to a conservative media outlet.\n\nBiden said this month she is now a consultant for the National Alliance of Trauma Recovery Centers, which teaches and assists with building centers around the country with the specific aim of helping victims of traumatic events. Biden recently said she is also “teaching a trauma class for 25 women who are coming out of incarceration.”\n\nWith midterm elections less than a week away, a second run for the White House by her father remains undetermined; the president’s age, approval ratings and performance being hammered regularly by critics.\n\nEven still, Ashley Biden appears willing to test some of her own boundaries of vulnerability. She speaks with a sense of urgency around socio-economic and health care issues – as the daughter of a lifelong politician, she knows first-hand the partisan stakes when funding, congressional support, health care and power all come into play.\n\n“Dad is dedicated,” she said during her public radio interview from San Francisco. “We’re going to have some real issues if we don’t win the House and Senate. I mean, it’s over, right? It’s over in the sense of what’s to come. Our rights. Mental health care. All of it.”\n\nOn the dais last week in Washington, answering the handful of questions with responses that went on for several minutes, Biden sounded almost like a certain politician.\n\n“I believe we can come to the same results, we can work together, but I think it’s the how we kind of go about it. I’m not saying to not scream from the mountaintops of injustice, but I also think if we really want, I mean, you have to work with the other side,” she said.\n\nBiden said she was sorry to the interviewer, and the audience, for her lengthy answers.\n\n“So, really long-winded. I apologize,” she added. “This is why they don’t let me do interviews.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/mark-meadows-texts-2319/index.html", "title": "Mark Meadows' 2,319 text messages reveal Trump's inner circle ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nCNN has obtained 2,319 text messages that former President Donald Trump’s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent and received between Election Day 2020 and President Joe Biden’s January 20, 2021 inauguration.\n\nThe vast trove of texts offers the most revealing picture to date of how Trump’s inner circle, supporters and Republican lawmakers worked behind the scenes to try to overturn the election results and then reacted to the violence that effort unleashed at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThe logs, which Meadows selectively provided to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, show how the former chief of staff was at the nexus of sprawling conspiracy theories baselessly claiming the election had been stolen. They also demonstrate how he played a key role in the attempts to stop Biden’s certification on January 6.\n\nThe never-before-seen texts include messages from Trump’s family – daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr. – as well as White House and campaign officials, Cabinet members, Republican Party leaders, January 6 rally organizers, Rudy Giuliani, My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, Sean Hannity and other Fox hosts. There are also text exchanges with more than 40 current and former Republican members of Congress, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe texts include everything from plans to fight the election results to surprising and unexpected reactions on January 6 from some of Trump’s staunchest allies. At 2:28 p.m., Greene, the conservative firebrand who had helped to plan the congressional objections that day, texted Meadows with an urgent plea for help as the violence was unfolding at the Capitol.\n\n“Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” Greene wrote. Meadows does not appear to reply.\n\nMore messages flooded in.\n\n“Mark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?” Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former acting White House chief of staff, texted Meadows.\n\n“It’s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol,” Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk wrote.\n\n“The president needs to stop this ASAP,” texted GOP Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina.\n\n“POTUS is engaging,” Meadows sent in response to Loudermilk. “We are doing it,” he texted to Timmons.\n\n“Thanks. This doesn’t help our cause,” Loudermilk replied.\n\nShortly after, Donald Trump Jr. weighed in: “This his(sic) one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.”\n\n“TELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!” texted Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus.\n\nHeated rhetoric and conspiracy theories\n\nThe text messages CNN obtained begin on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Even before the election was called, Meadows was inundated with conspiracy theories about election fraud, strategies to challenge the results and pleas for Trump to keep fighting. The messages – from GOP activists, donors, Republican members of Congress and state party officials – appear to act as an echo chamber affirming Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen. For months leading up to Election Day, Trump had claimed the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged.\n\nPreviously disclosed text messages showed that former Trump administration Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., each texted Meadows on November 4 and 5 with ideas for overturning the election.\n\nOn November 7, hours before the election was called, Perry texted Meadows again: “We have the data driven program that can clearly show where the fraud was committed. This is the silver bullet.”\n\nWhile Perry has previously denied CNN reporting about his text messages to Meadows, CNN has confirmed it’s his cell phone and he signed this text, “Rick Perry,” including his number.\n\nOther texts, however, include hints of doubt expressed by members of Trump’s team and even Meadows himself about the veracity of conspiracy theories being spread by Trump’s “kraken” team – outside attorneys working for Trump that included Giuliani and Sidney Powell.\n\nSome key congressional allies who worked with Trump’s campaign initially in its efforts to overturn the election, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, ultimately soured on the approach as the January 6 congressional certification neared, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe texts also show how Trump allies were quick to deflect responsibility for the January 6 attack. Shortly after pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol, one of his top aides began crafting a counter-narrative.\n\nAt 3:45 p.m., Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller suggested to Meadows and Trump aide Dan Scavino that Trump should tweet: “Call me crazy, but ideas for two tweets from POTUS: 1) Bad apples, likely ANTIFA or other crazed leftists, infiltrated today s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! 2) The fake news media who encouraged this summer s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions. This isn’t who we are! Our people should head home and let the criminals suffer the consequences!”\n\nTrump’s allies in Congress appeared to get the message. At 3:52 p.m., Greene told Meadows: “Mark we don’t think these attackers are our people. We think they are Antifa. Dressed like Trump supporters.”\n\nFive minutes later, Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, texted Meadows: “Cap Police told me last night they’d been warned that today there’d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent.”\n\nIn the 16 months since January 6, hundreds of indictments have shown nearly all of those who breached the Capitol were in fact pro-Trump supporters.\n\nWhile Greene was alarmed on January 6, by the next day she was apologizing that the efforts to block Biden’s certification had failed.\n\n“Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault,” she wrote the morning of January 7. “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wears a \"Trump Won\" face mask as she arrives on the floor of the House to take her oath of office as a newly elected member of the 117th House of Representatives in Washington, U.S., January 3, 2021. Erin Scott/Reuters\n\nGreene is currently facing a legal challenge to disqualify her from running for Congress because of her alleged role in January 6. In court testimony Friday, the Georgia Republican repeatedly deflected or said she didn’t remember what she had said around the events of January 6. The Meadows text logs offer a new glimpse into what she was telling the White House chief of staff in real time.\n\nOn December 31, Greene reached out to Meadows for advice about how to prepare for objections to certifying the election on January 6.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.”\n\nMeadows does not appear to respond.\n\nBy January 17, Greene was suggesting ways to keep Trump in office, telling Meadows there were several Republicans in Congress who still wanted the then-President to declare martial law, which had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month earlier.\n\nGreene texted: “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law. I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!”\n\nAgain, Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nWhat Meadows turned over\n\nMeadows provided the cache of 2,319 messages to the January 6 committee in December 2021. But soon after, he stopped cooperating and refused to appear for a deposition. Ultimately, the House voted to hold the former White House chief of staff in contempt of Congress. The Justice Department has not yet announced whether it will charge Meadows.\n\nMeadows has sued the House committee in an attempt to block the congressional subpoenas. And in a late-night court filing on Friday, the committee responded with new details revealing Meadows was warned ahead of time that January 6 could turn violent, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchison, one of Meadows’ former White House aides.\n\nIn addition, the committee released text messages Meadows exchanged with Republican members of Congress, including texts with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania about a scheme to replace Justice Department leaders who opposed Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\nIn late December, Perry reached out to Meadows, connecting him to then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, who was pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud inside the Justice Department. Trump was considering firing the acting attorney general and installing Clark instead. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he spoke to the January 6 committee in February.\n\nOn December 26, Perry texted Meadows, “Mark, just checking in as time continues to count down. 11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!”\n\n“Mark, you should call Jeff,” he continued. “I just got off the phone with him and he explained to me why the principal deputy won’t work especially with the FBI. They will view it as as (sic) not having the authority to enforce what needs to be done.”\n\n“I got it,” Meadows responded. “I think I understand. Let me work on the deputy position.”\n\nOn December 28, Perry reached out again: “Did you call Jeff Clark?” Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nMeadows withheld more than 1,000 messages from the committee on claims of privilege, the panel said in Friday’s court filing. In his lawsuit, Meadows’ attorney argued the former White House chief of staff “has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims.”\n\nHannity to Meadows: ‘Yes sir’\n\nIn addition to the texts the committee has released, CNN and other news organizations have previously published selections of text messages Meadows received from Lee, Roy, Trump Jr., Perry and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Ginni Thomas.\n\nThe logs obtained by CNN include numerous messages from official White House cell phone numbers. Some have been identified by CNN, others are unknown.\n\nThere are also numerous group texts with Trump’s inner circle. The various group chats include Meadows, Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr. and Kushner, as well as top advisers such as Hope Hicks, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Miller and Scavino, among others.\n\nSome texts only include links to news reports and social media. Others appear to contain content that was cut-and-pasted and forwarded. The logs do not contain images or attachments.\n\nSupporters of U.S. President Donald Trump watch a video featuring Fox host Sean Hannity ahead of Trump's arrival to a campaign rally in Michigan on October 30, 2020. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nMeadows’ messages also include dozens of exchanges with Fox hosts, as well as journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Politico, Bloomberg, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN.\n\nAmong Meadows’ most frequent interactions were those with Fox’s Sean Hannity, a well-known friend of Trump. Throughout the logs, Hannity both gives advice and asks for direction.\n\nOn the afternoon of Election Day, Hannity texted Meadows to ask about turnout in North Carolina.\n\nMeadows responded: “Stress every vote matters. Get out and vote.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Hannity replied. “On it. Any place in particular we need a push.”\n\n“Pennsylvania. NC AZ,” Meadows wrote. “Nevada.”\n\n“Got it. Everywhere,” Hannity said.\n\nFor the most part, Meadows’ texts are short, and frequently he does not appear to reply at all. Some conversations include non sequiturs. It’s unclear whether Meadows did not respond to the messages or if the logs are incomplete, because texts could also have been deleted or withheld for claims of privilege.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to all individuals who sent text messages quoted in this story. Meadows and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment.\n\nThe fight to ‘stop the steal’\n\nThe text messages provide a timeline showing how Trump’s team searched all corners for evidence of election fraud and tried to overturn the election. Beginning on Election Day, Meadows was in the middle of it all, from connecting activists pushing conspiracy theories to strategizing with GOP lawmakers and rally organizers preparing for January 6.\n\nThe texts also show Meadows was dealing with everything from mediating a fight over who would be on the speaker’s list for the January 6 rally to fielding requests to pay Giuliani’s bills.\n\n“Sir, we are airborne on the way to Michigan from Arizona. We’re going to need a hotel for the team and two vehicles to pick us up,” Bernie Kerik, a Giuliani associate, texted Meadows on December 1.\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Kerik confirmed the text was his and said that he never received a credit card for those travel expenses, paid for it himself and was later reimbursed.\n\nOther texts show Meadows coordinating with GOP activists in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\n“Pls get 4 or 5 killers in remaining counts. Need outsiders who will torch the place. Local folks won’t do it. Lawyers and operators. Get us in these states,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp texted Meadows on November 4.\n\n“I may need to get you and mercy (sic) to go to PA,” Meadows responded, referring to Schlapp’s wife, Mercedes, who is a former Trump White House aide.\n\nOn a few occasions, Trump family members weighed in. Ivanka Trump sent a note on November 5 to a group that included Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Miller and Meadows: “You are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight.”\n\nDozens of Republicans also offered support and advice to Meadows – as well as perpetuated conspiracy theories that were gaining traction in right-wing media.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican now running for Senate, suggested in a text on November 7 that Dominion Voting Systems could be connected to George Soros’ company. Dominion has no corporate ties to Soros, a billionaire and frequent target of baseless conspiracy theories, according to a CNN fact check.\n\nOn November 6, Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, appeared to suggest that state legislatures should appoint electors “in the various states where there’s been shenanigans,” a move he acknowledged would be “highly controversial.” In his text, he wrote the legislatures could appoint “a look doors,” which is phonetically similar to electors.\n\nOn December 1, then-Attorney General William Barr infuriated Trump when he publicly stated that the Justice Department did not find widespread evidence of voter fraud. Nevertheless, Meadows received multiple texts pushing back, including from Schlapp later that day: “Happy to walk ag through our evidence. Its (sic) overwhelming.”\n\nThe texts also show Meadows reached out to GOP officials in multiple states to lobby for Trump’s cause. On two occasions, Meadows attempted to contact Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was under attack from Trump for certifying Georgia’s election for Biden.\n\n“mr Secretary. Can you call the White House switchboard,” Meadows wrote on December 5. “Your voicemail is full.”\n\nRaffensperger does not appear to reply to the messages.\n\nTrump’s efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia are under investigation by a district attorney in the Atlanta area.\n\nMeadows also received text messages from GOP activists and local officials making outlandish claims, including allegations that “traitors inside our intel agencies” were committing election fraud, as well as baseless charges that voting equipment companies Dominion and Smartmatic had manipulated votes – the same false claims being pushed by Giuliani and Powell.\n\nBoth companies have filed billion-dollar lawsuits over the false election claims, including against Fox News, right-wing media organizations, Giuliani, Powell and Lindell.\n\nThroughout the two months, Meadows received dozens of messages from Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who offered what she claimed were examples and sources of voter fraud.\n\nOn December 9, she sent a text to Meadows letting him know she’d already reached out to Trump’s executive assistant: “This guy says he’s cracked the whole election fraud and wants to speak to someone. I sent his info to Molly Michael a few days ago, but I’m not sure it went anywhere.”\n\n“I will call him,” Meadows responded.\n\nMyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, speaks to reporters outside federal court in Washington, Thursday, June 24, 2021. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nAnother frequent texter was Lindell, one of the most vocal proponents of baseless election conspiracy theories. Even after courts had dismissed dozens of Trump’s legal challenges, the My Pillow CEO was still pressing the White House.\n\n“Everything Sidney has said is true! We have to get the machines and everything we already have proves the President won by millions of votes!” Lindell texted Meadows on December 20. “This is the biggest cover up of one of the worst crimes in history! I have spent over a million$ to help uncover this fraud and used my platform so people can get the word not to give up!”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks brother. Pray for a miracle.”\n\n\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Lindell confirmed the text was his. He told CNN that he has not spoken to Meadows since before January 20, 2021, and that at the time he was “just trying to get an appointment with the President.”\n\nDoubts about election fraud\n\nWhile Trump and his allies publicly stuck by their claims that the election had been stolen, behind the scenes, Trump’s inner circle – including Meadows – expressed some doubts. Trump’s aides also questioned whether lawyers like Giuliani and Powell were doing more harm than good.\n\nOn November 6, Miller, Trump’s campaign spokesman, texted a group, which included Ivanka Trump, Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Scavino and Meadows, suggesting that the numbers in Philadelphia didn’t back up claims about alleged election fraud there.\n\n“One other key data point: In 2016, POTUS received 15.5% of the vote in Philadelphia County. Today he is currently at 18.3%. So he increased from his performance in 2016. In 2016, Philadelphia County made up 11.3% of the total vote in the state. As it currently stands, Philadelphia County only makes up 10.2% of the statewide vote tally. So POTUS performed better in a smaller share. Sen. (Rick) Santorum was just making this point on CNN - cuts hard against the urban vote stealing narrative,” Miller wrote.\n\nJason Miller talks on the phone in a meeting room for lawyers of former President Donald Trump during his Senate Impeachment trial on Capitol Hill, February 12, 2021 Jabin Botsford/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\n\nA week later, Miller wrote to Meadows again, this time saying that campaign research did not find any evidence of a conspiracy involving Soros, the Democratic donor. Miller also said he was concerned about sharing the findings with Trump.\n\n“Lots there re: functionality problems, not much there on Dem/Soros conspiracy connections,” Miller wrote on November 13. “Will defer to you on whether or not to share full report with POTUS. POTUS is clearly hyped up on them, not just from his tweets, but he also called me and Justin separately last night to complain. JM.”\n\nOn November 20, Meadows was asked by a Florida contact how confident he was about fraud related to Dominion. Meadows texted back: “Dominion, not that confident. Other fraud. Very confident.”\n\nTwo days later, Ginni Thomas messaged Meadows with apparent concerns, asking, “Trying to understand the Sidney Powell distancing…”\n\nMeadows responded: “She doesn’t have anything or at least she won’t share it if she does.”\n\n“Wow!” Ginni Thomas wrote back.\n\nIn one of the few messages Meadows received from Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law shared a fact check on December 4 debunking one of the most prominent election fraud claims from Georgia. The article showed that despite inflammatory claims of poll workers stashing suitcases filled with ballots under a table, that did not, in fact, occur.\n\n‘Hoping the VP sticks with us’\n\nAfter the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s win on December 14, Trump’s allies turned their attention to January 6: the congressional certification of the electors and the rally that Trump said on Twitter “will be wild!”\n\nOn December 21, Brooks, the Alabama congressman, wrote to Meadows and others in a group text asking whether he should engage with the media about the “formulation of our January 6 strategies.”\n\n“Does the White House want me to reply or be mum?” Brooks wrote. A staunch Trump ally running for Senate this year, Brooks gave an incendiary speech on January 6 but recently fell out of favor with Trump after suggesting Republicans should move on from 2020.\n\n\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, Brooks said he had “no regrets” about his speech on January 6 and that he was “shocked” by the violence. “I had no inkling,” Brooks added.\n\nCruz, a Texas Republican who pushed a plan inside the Senate that would have delayed certification of the election, exchanged just a few messages with Meadows – links to his statements posted to social media.\n\nOn January 2, the senator sent Meadows his tweet proposing a 10-day audit of the election results.\n\n“Here’s the statement,” Cruz wrote.\n\n“Perfect,” Meadows responded.\n\nThe texts also make frequent reference to then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with Trump’s plan to try to block the certification on January 6. On December 30, Rep. Brian Babin of Texas expressed concern that congressional leaders might try to short circuit their objections – and that Pence was not on board.\n\n“Dems and some Republicans may well try to shortstop our objection efforts. Hoping the VP sticks with us,” Babin wrote.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Miller shared a news article with Meadows that Pence opposed a lawsuit intended to help overturn the election. Miller warned that it could be used “to drive a massive wedge between POTUS and everybody else in the party.”\n\n“He’s absolutely going to blow his stack on this if he isn’t already aware,” Miller said of Trump. “Oh boy I don’t understand what the VP was thinking here.”\n\nOn January 5, Jordan, the Ohio congressman and close GOP ally of Meadows, weighed in.\n\n“On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all – in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence,” Jordan wrote.\n\nMeadows responded the morning of January 6: “I have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen.”\n\nThe January 6 committee included the text exchange in its Friday court filing as evidence of Meadows’ alleged involvement in the effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe logs also show Meadows was involved with planning the rally on January 6, helping to mediate a fight over the speakers list. Trump adviser Katrina Pierson was alarmed at some of the proposed fringe figures who wanted to speak.\n\nCrowds arrive for the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOn January 2 and 3, Pierson wrote to Meadows looking for help.\n\n“Good afternoon, would you mind giving me a call re: this Jan 6th event. Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please,” she asked on January 2.\n\nThe next day, she reached out again: “Scratch that, Caroline Wren has decided to move forward with the original psycho list. Apparently Dan Scavino approved??”\n\nShe continued: “So, I’m done. I can’t be a part of embarrassing POTUS any further.”\n\nWren was a fundraiser for the Trump campaign and helped organize the January 6 rally. She has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee.\n\nLess than an hour later, Pierson wrote Meadows that she told Wren she was talking to the White House in order to get her to back down.\n\n“I let her know that I was going to reach out to WH and her tone changed,” Pierson wrote. “So, I’ll continue to build a proper event.”\n\n“Thank you,” Meadows responded.\n\n‘As bad as this can get’\n\nIn the aftermath of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, Trump’s inner circle discussed in a group text how to deal with the fallout – and Trump’s suspension from Twitter. At 10:10 p.m. on January 6, Kushner texted the group: “Why don’t we post on his Facebook page since he isn’t locked out there.”\n\nIn the final days of Trump’s term, as he faced impeachment for a second time, Meadows received words of encouragement from staunch allies, as well as caution from advisers.\n\n“I would like to pass to POTUS that we are still with him, I believe in him and I want to encourage him,” Rep. Andrew Clyde, a freshman Georgia Republican, wrote on January 9. “I truly hope he does create a new platform to complete (sic) with Twitter and I hope he calls it ‘Trumpet’ and then we can send out ‘notes’ to each other!”\n\n“I will share it with him. Thanks Andrew,” Meadows responded.\n\nOn January 13, the day the House voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol – with 10 Republicans joining Democrats – Miller shared polling data in a group text with Meadows, Scavino and Kushner that showed “2/3 of the MAGA base wants us to move on.”\n\n“I tried to walk the President through this earlier but he won’t have any of it,” Miller said.\n\nAs Trump prepared to leave power, he appeared to be a pariah in the Republican Party. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had said during the House’s January 13 impeachment debate that the outgoing President “bears responsibility” for the riot. Six days later, on January 19, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell denounced Trump from the floor of the Senate, saying the mob that attacked the Capitol was “provoked by the President and other powerful people.”\n\nNevertheless, Trump’s standing in the Republican Party quickly recovered, especially after McCarthy’s January 28 visit to Mar-a-Lago and the February 2021 acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nBut before Trump left office, the Meadows text logs show some of Trump’s staunchest allies were dejected. On January 19, in one of the final texts Meadows received as chief of staff, Fox’s Sean Hannity shared a video of McConnell’s floor speech.\n\nHannity texted Meadows: “Well this is as bad as this can get.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gangel Jeremy Herb Elizabeth Stuart", "Jamie Gangel", "Jeremy Herb", "Elizabeth Stuart"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}]}

Period,\" he wrote. \"I need to learn from this, listen and engage with child protection organizations to know how I can contribute and help on this terrible subject.\"\n\nPreviously, Balenciaga issued an apology addressing the controversy on its Instagram story last week.\n\n\"We sincerely apologize for any offense our holiday campaign may have caused,” the company wrote. “Our plush bear bags should not have been featured with children in this campaign. … We strongly condemn abuse of children in any form. We stand for children safety and well-being.”\n\nRegarding the display of court documents in its campaign, the fashion brand said it’s pursuing legal action against “the parties responsible for creating the set and including unapproved items.” The Post reported that Balenciaga filed a $25 million lawsuit last Friday against production company North Six, Inc. and set designer Nicholas Des Jardins for use of the legal documents in the campaign.\n\nHowever, on Friday, the company shared another statement on Instagram, signed by President and CEO Cédric Charbit, saying Balenciaga \"has decided not to pursue litigation.\"\n\nInstead, it outlined \"actions\" the organization is taking \"to learn from our mistakes\" which includes creating an internal image board and appointing an external agency to evaluate content. The post also said the brand is setting up a fund for grants to organizations that \"help make a difference in protecting children.\"\n\nCharbit ended: \"At Balenciaga, we stand together for children safety and do not tolerate any kind of violence and hatred message.\"\n\nThe outline of organizational changes comes for days after the fashion house shared in an Instagram statement that it condemns child abuse and had no intention to \"include it in our narrative.\"\n\n\"The two separate ad campaigns in question reflect a series of grievous errors for which Balenciaga takes responsibility,\" it added.\n\nOne of these errors, according to the statement, was featuring children with plush bears bags \"dressed in what some have labeled BDSM-inspired outfits.\" These bears \"should not have been featured with children,\" and the error \"was a wrong choice by Balenciaga, combined with our failure in assessing and validating images.\"\n\n\"The responsibility for this lies with Balenciaga alone,\" the fashion house continued.\n\nThe second error, the statement said, was depicting an office environment containing copies of court papers from a 2008 Supreme Court case that confirmed promoting child pornography is illegal and not a protected form of free speech.\n\nAccording to Balenciaga, third parties provided these documents and confirmed in writing they were \"fake office documents.\" Instead, the documents were \"real legal papers most likely coming from the filming of a television drama.\"\n\n\"We take full accountability for our lack of oversight and control of the documents in the background and we could have done things differently,\" the statement continued.\n\nGabriele Galimberti, one of the photographers for the campaign, also weighed in on the scandal Wednesday, saying that he had no involvement in the photoshoot’s setup.\n\n“As a photographer, I was only and solely requested to lit the given scene and take the shots according to my signature style,” Galimberti wrote on Instagram. “As usual for a commercial shooting, the direction of the campaign and the choice of the objects displayed are not in the hands of the photographer.”\n\nKim Kardashian agrees to pay $1.3Mto SEC for not disclosing paid crypto endorsement\n\nYes, Kim Kardashian is rich:Money doesn't protect her from robbery trauma, experts say\n\nContributing: Charles Trepany", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}]}

It has canceled five flights to and from Honolulu, Southwest said.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration is “closely monitoring the volcanic eruption and will issue air traffic advisories once the size of the ash cloud is determined,” it said in a statement.\n\nRed hues from the eruption of Mauna Loa illuminated Monday's predawn sky. Courtesy David A. Higgins\n\nReports of lava overflowing into the southwest portion of the volcano’s caldera, or crater, have come in to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency tweeted late Monday morning.\n\nThere is no indication of a threat to nearby communities, and no evacuation orders have been issued, the agency tweeted. As a precaution, two shelters have opened, even as “roughly half” of recorded Mauna Loa eruptions remained in the summit area without threatening populated areas, according to another agency tweet.\n\nAshfall can damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems, and damage or kill vegetation, the weather service says, while abrasive volcanic ash can irritate eyes and lungs.\n\n“People with respiratory illnesses should remain indoors to avoid inhaling the ash particles and anyone outside should cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth,” the Honolulu office warned. “Possible harm to crops and animals. Minor equipment and infrastructure damage. Reduced visibility. Widespread clean-up may be necessary.”\n\nThe observatory said earlier that lava flows do not threaten downslope communities.\n\nAt about 4,000 square miles, Hawaii, or the Big Island, is the largest in size of the Hawaiian chain but has a population of just over 200,000 people, according to the US Census Bureau, or fewer than 50 people per square mile. Most of the population is in cities and communities around the coast.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa eruption can be very dynamic and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the observatory said, adding, “If the eruption remains in Moku’āweoweo, lava flows will most likely be confined within the caldera walls.\n\n“However, if the eruptive vents migrate outside its walls, lava flows may move rapidly downslope.”\n\nRed hues from the eruption illuminated Monday’s predawn sky, according to footage captured at the Kailua Bay & Pier by Matthew Liano, a resident of Kailua-Kona, along the Big Island’s west coast.\n\n“The glow is like nothing I’ve seen here living in Kona for most of my life,” Liano told CNN.\n\nThe eruption began in Moku’āweoweo, the summit caldera of Mauna Loa, on Sunday around 11:30 p.m. HST (4:30 a.m. ET Monday), according to the observatory.\n\nMauna Loa began erupting Sunday. USGS\n\nNearby Kilauea volcano erupting since 2021\n\nMauna Loa, which covers half the island of Hawaii, has erupted 33 times since 1843, the volcano’s first “well-documented historical eruption,” according to the US Geological Survey. It last erupted in 1984, making this prolonged quiet period the volcano’s longest in recorded history.\n\nMauna Loa’s summit crater sits about 21 miles west of Kilauea, a smaller volcano that has been erupting since 2021. Their simultaneous eruptions have created a rare dual-eruption event, according to the park.\n\nKilauea’s eruption is currently confined to its crater. When Kilauea erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nMauna Loa has been in a heightened state of unrest, per the agency, which pointed in an update late last month to elevated seismic activity and increased earthquake rates.\n\nEarthquake activity increased from five to 10 earthquakes a day since June 2022 to some 10 to 20 earthquakes a day in July and August, according to the US Geological Survey. Peak numbers of more than 100 earthquakes a day were recorded on September 23 and September 29, CNN has reported.\n\nThe increased activity prompted Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in October to close the Mauna Loa summit to all backcountry hikers until further notice, though the US National Park Service said the main section of the park has remained open.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the Eastern Time equivalents for the ashfall advisory and eruption.", "authors": ["Monica Garrett Dakin Andone", "Monica Garrett", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/us/hawaii-mauna-loa-kilauea-eruption-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Hawaii volcano: Mauna Loa's eruption creates rare dual-eruption ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe rare sight of two neighboring volcanoes erupting simultaneously became even more astounding Tuesday as new lava flows gushed down slopes on Hawaii’s Big Island.\n\nMauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, erupted this week for the first time in 38 years. Its neighbor Kilauea, which is also in Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, has been erupting for more than a year.\n\nOn Tuesday, two new lava flows were seen streaming down Mauna Loa, the US Geological Survey said.\n\nThis annotated view of webcam on Mauna Kea looking toward Mauna Loa shows the flow from Fissure 3 that has moved north to cross the @NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory road overnight.

David Ige to sign an emergency proclamation Tuesday. This allows the state’s director and administrator of emergency management to handle actions such as issuing alerts and warnings as well as facilitating mandatory evacuations where necessary.\n\nAt just 21 miles apart, Mauna Loa and Kilauea have not erupted together since 1984, when Mauna Loa last erupted.\n\nNeither volcano is threatening homes or nearby infrastructure, the national park said. But state health officials warned air quality could be worsened by hazards such as vog, or volcanic smog.\n\nThe rare dual-eruption event is expected to attract an influx of visitors eager to see the molten flows, the national park said in a Facebook post.\n\nFountains of lava as tall as 200 feet burst from Mauna Loa on Monday, the geological survey said. The eruption was concentrated in Mauna Loa’s Northeast Rift Zone, where lava is flowing from at least one split in the volcano, the geological survey said.\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the agency said.\n\nOfficials are keeping a careful eye on the site to monitor any developments.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa rift zone eruption can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the geological survey said in a Monday update.\n\nOnly one of three volcanic fissures that opened on Mauna Loa Monday was still emitting lava Tuesday morning, Hawaii emergency management said. A small, fourth fissure opened overnight and emitted a small amount of lava that cut both power and road access to the Mauna Loa Observatory facility, the agency said.\n\nThough there is no immediate risk to communities, Hawaii’s National Guard is on standby and the state Emergency Management Agency has activated its emergency operations center, Major General Ken Hara, adjutant general for the State of Hawaii Dept. of Defense said during a news conference.\n\nKilauea, a much smaller volcano sitting on Mauna Loa’s southeastern side, has been erupting since September 2021, though its lava is confined to its crater, according to the US Geological Survey. When the incredibly active volcano erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park remains open but cautions visitors hoping to witness the historic eruptions to be aware of the cultural significance the sites have for Native Hawaiians.\n\n“While an eruption is an exciting experience, keep in mind you are observing a sacred event. Kīlauea and Mauna Loa volcano are wahi kapu (sacred landscapes) surrounded with storied places,” the park’s website says.\n\nThe Kilauea volcano lava lake, left, and a magnificent glow from Mauna Loa, upper right, sets the morning sky aglow.

Sunday night’s eruption caused flight cancellations to and from Honolulu and sent lava flowing down the side of the volcano.\n\nIn erupting for the first time since 1984, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in nearly 40 years, joining joined its neighboring volcano, Kilauea, which had been erupting for more than a year. The rare dual-eruption event is expected to attract an influx of visitors eager to see their molten flows, the national park said in a Facebook post.\n\nHere is some of the volcano vocabulary you should know to keep up with the eruptions.\n\nCaldera: A caldera is the large, basin-shaped volcanic depression that forms when a volcano erupts and releases magma stored beneath the surface, causing the overlying rocks to collapse. A caldera is different from a crater, which is a smaller depression formed when a volcano erupts and sends rock exploding outward. Yellowstone National Park is home to a famous caldera, measuring 43 by 28 miles.\n\nLava: Lava is what scientists call magma that breaks through the Earth’s surface – like during a volcano eruption. Lava moves as a fluid or viscous mass, says the US Geological Survey.\n\nLava fountains: A lava fountain is just what it sounds like: a jet of lava sprayed into the air “by the rapid formation and expansion of gas bubbles in the molten rock,” says the USGS. The fountains can reach more than 500 meters (1,640 feet) high.\n\nLava flows: Lava flows describe both the moving masses of lava that spew onto the earth’s surface during an eruption and the solidified deposit they leave behind once they cool down.\n\nMagma: Magma describes the super-hot, molten rock beneath the surface of the Earth, according to the USGS. Stores of magma lie in magma reservoirs or magma chambers underneath volcanoes.\n\nPele’s hair: This term describes long, thin strands of volcanic glass that form from lava fountains and fast lava flows, the USGS says. The strands are named after Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of fire. Swaths of Pele’s hair can remain for years and even decades, according to the service, although the wind will eventually strip them from most surfaces.\n\nTephra: Tephra is a catch-all term for all the fragments of rock that are ejected into the air by an erupting volcano, the geological survey says.\n\nVolcanic ash: Volcanic ash isn’t the same as the ash produced after burning a piece of paper. Volcanic ash, a finer form of tephra, consists of tiny, sharp pieces of rock and glass. It’s hard and abrasive and doesn’t dissolve in water, according to the USGS. Clouds of volcanic ash pose a danger to air traffic because they reduce visibility, can damage flight controls and can even cause jet engines to fail.\n\nVog: Vog, a portmanteau of “volcanic” and “smog,” describes the “hazy air pollution” produced by volcanic emissions, according to the Interagency Vog Dashboard.\n\nThe pollution mostly consists of water vapor, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Vog can pose environmental and health risks, says the USGS.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/us/hawaii-mauna-loa-kilauea-eruption-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Lava is spilling toward a key Hawaiian highway, but the governor ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe world’s largest active volcano is shooting fountains of lava more than 100 feet high and sending a river of molten rock down toward the main highway of Hawaii’s Big Island.\n\nThe leading edge of the lava flow gushing out of Mauna Loa is about 3.6 miles away from Saddle Road, also known as Daniel K.

David Ige said it’s still safe to visit the Big Island.\n\n“We would encourage everyone who has plans to visit the island to continue,” Ige told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n“It is completely safe. The eruption site is high up the mountain, and it’s in a relatively isolated location,” he said.\n\nBut distracted drivers gawking at the lava flows could cause problems, Ige said.\n\n“We are concerned because visitors and residents are stopping along the highway, and sometimes drivers are not paying attention fully,” he said.\n\n“So we are concerned about traffic control on the highway.”\n\nParking along the road is prohibited between mile markers 16 to 31, and any vehicles left there could be towed.\n\nIf the highway is closed, commuters won’t have any pleasant options.\n\nEmmanuel Carrasco Escalante, a landscape worker, said he would then have to decide between the northside or southside coastal roadways to get from Hilo to Kona.\n\n“It’s a hassle to drive all the way around the island,” he told CNN. “If the road closes, that would add almost two hours, more gas, and more miles so hopefully it (lava) doesn’t cross that road.”\n\nCarrasco Escalante said he usually leaves for work at 3:30 a.m. to arrive at 5 a.m. but is worried rerouting even then will take him into traffic jams.\n\nThe state’s emergency management agency tweeted there are no evacuation orders in place and if it becomes necessary to close the highway, there will be time to alert the public in advance.\n\n‘The concern is about dangerous gases’\n\nWhile officials have said there’s no imminent threat to property, a spate of potential health hazards could linger in the air.\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the geological survey said.

So this was the best scenario for everybody because nobody’s in danger… So you just have to be thankful,” Deborah Westbrook, who had come to see the volcano during the day, said on Friday.\n\nBut, the lava flow from the Mauna Loa is gradually moving closer to the Daniel K. Inouye Highway.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, the lava flow had showed little change from a day prior and was about 2.5 miles from the highway, according to an update from the United States Geological Survey.\n\n“During the past 24 hours, the lava flow advanced at an average rate of about 40 feet per hour,” the USGS said. “Though the advance rate has slowed over the past 24 hours, the lava flow remains active. “\n\nOne active fissure is feeding that lava flow, the USGS added.\n\nThe highway remains open in both directions, but the speed limit was reduced to 35 miles per hour in the Mauna Kea Access Road area, according to the HawaiI County Civil Defense Agency.\n\nA traffic hazard safety route is now accessible through Saddle Road, also known as Daniel K. Inouye Highway, according to the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.\n\nThe one-way route “will provide safe viewing of lava flows,” the agency said Thursday, declaring that parking on the highway was putting motorists at risk of traffic citations and vehicles towed.\n\nAmong those gathered early Friday to marvel at the bright orange lava was Ku’ulei Vickery, a native Hawaiian and a teacher at a nearby public school.\n\nShe performed a traditional Hawaiian chant and left rosemary grown in her backyard as an offering.\n\n“As a native, I’m acknowledging the space that I am in.

The fact that the tool has measured the changes of carbon dioxide levels for more than 60 years virtually uninterrupted has made it the authority source on the key greenhouse gas.\n\nMauna Loa has been the ideal location to measure carbon dioxide levels due to its far distance from other major land masses in Hawaii as well as the clear air and landscape of the mountaintop. The observatory is more than 11,140 feet above sea level, far away from significant pollution sources. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also measures carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa using a different instrument.\n\nThroughout its history there have only been a few times where the readings became unavailable: a period in 1964 due to federal budget cuts and a short period in 1984 when the last Mauna Loa eruption cut off power lines. During the latter incident, researchers had to install a generator in the observatory to resume operations.\n\nBut this time around, Keeling said the situation is “much worse” and that the timeline is unclear. “The duration of this is really hard to say, but I have a feeling we’re not going to be back to normal for months,” he said.\n\nResearchers are racing to find a nearby substitute location free of the lava flows to get the data measurements back up and running.\n\n“In the long run, we’ll get back up again; we’ll get back to where we were, but we’ll have a gap of some sort that may have to be filled with surrogate data,” Keeling said. “Right now, there’s no data at all. We’ve seen gaps for several months in the past, we don’t like that, so it’s really all hands on deck to try to figure out how to get something back up as soon as possible.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/world/gallery/photos-this-week-november-24-december-1/index.html", "title": "Photos this week: November 24-December 1, 2022 | CNN", "text": "In this photo, taken with a long exposure, the Mauna Loa volcano erupts on Hawaii's Big Island on Monday, November 28.\n\nProduced by CNN Digital's Photo Team\n\nThe world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa, erupted in Hawaii this week for the first time in 38 years.\n\nThe eruption started late on Sunday, November 27, sending lava down one side of the volcano on Hawaii's Big Island.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nOver the weekend, mainland China experienced something it hasn’t seen in more than 30 years: Thousands of protesters flooding the streets, defying the Communist Party.\n\nThe protests had an immediate impact on global markets, and raised questions about the path forward for China’s increasingly sluggish economy.\n\nWhat’s going on?\n\nThe protests began Friday after 10 people were killed in a fire in China’s Xinjiang province, where Covid lockdown restrictions reportedly hindered first responders from reaching the blaze.\n\nThe fire catalyzed three years’ worth of frustration over the country’s zero-Covid policy, which has seen millions of people locked down for weeks on end at various times.\n\nThe quarantines and testing protocols have taken psychological and economic tolls. Growth has slumped and unemployment is rising. Under lockdown, many residents complained of inhumane conditions, facing shortages of food and medicine. One human rights group reported at least five suicides in Lhasa, Tibet, where some residents have lived under a lockdown for more than 100 days.\n\nPeople are at their breaking point, and their anger is directly targeting President Xi Jining and the Party leadership. During the first night of the demonstrations in Shanghai, a crowd shouted “Step down, Xi Jinping! Step down, Communist Party!”\n\nMeanwhile, the prospect of social upheaval in the world’s second-biggest economy has sent a chill through global markets.\n\nOn Monday, the Dow fell more than 500 points, following declines in European and Asian indexes. Oil prices dropped sharply as investors feared that surging Covid cases and protests in China would sap demand from one of the world’s largest oil consumers. US oil hit its lowest price in nearly a year, falling 2.7% to $74 a barrel.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOfficials in Beijing are in quite a pickle here.\n\nTo fix its economy, China needs to ease lockdowns to allow its people to get back to their lives.\n\nBut doing so — in a country that has almost no natural immunity to the virus and has shunned the idea of importing Western-made boosters — could lead to a deadly outbreak.\n\nXi, who just began an a third term and has doubled down on zero-Covid, doesn’t want to risk a public health disaster that would undermine his credibility. And certainly, cracking down on peaceful protesters and continuing the heavy-handed policy is an option — one that China has a long history of deploying. But all of Xi’s options are less than ideal for a leader who’s long been preoccupied with stability.\n\nRelated: Twitter searches for the protests in China returned a flood of spam, pornography and gibberish that researchers said may be a deliberate attempt by the Chinese government or its allies to drown out images of the demonstrations.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: $5 million\n\nThe label on a cup of Velveeta’s microwaveable mac and cheese says the food will be “ready in 3½ minutes.” One Florida woman is taking issue with that statement, to the tune of $5 million.\n\nYup, someone filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against Kraft Heinz, alleging that its Velveeta Shells & Cheese takes longer than advertised to prepare, court documents show.\n\nHer attorneys argue that the three-and-a-half-minute promise doesn’t account for the other four steps required to prepare the dish: removing the lid and sauce pouch, adding water, microwaving, and stirring, according to court documents.\n\nKraft Heinz dismissed the lawsuit as “frivolous” in a statement.\n\nAhhhhhhh, America.\n\nANOTHER CRYPTO BUST\n\nIntroducing the latest casualty of the financial contagion unleashed by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire…\n\nThe crypto lending firm BlockFi filed for bankruptcy today. Its collapse wasn’t a huge surprise in the crypto world — the firm has basically been on death watch for three weeks — but it’s still a significant player to be taken down in the FTX contagion.\n\nEarlier this month, as FTX unraveled, BlockFi (think of it as a crypto bank — it gave out loans using digital assets as collateral) halted withdrawals, citing “significant exposure” to Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange, as well as its sister hedge fund Alameda. FTX and Alameda, of course, are now bankrupt and practically synonymous with corporate mismanagement at the hands of the calculating oddball known as SBF.\n\nThere’s a kind of tragic interconnectedness to the way the dominoes are falling post-FTX. BlockFi was one of several recipients of SBF’s modern-day JP Morgan theatrics. Over the summer, as the value of digital assets sank, SBF swooped in, engineering financial lifelines for struggling enterprises.\n\nFor BlockFi, that amounted to a $400 million credit line from FTX.\n\nThere was a sense, before this month, that SBF was The Good Crypto Guy. That despite all the internet-bro-y-ness that is (rightly) used to malign the crypto faithful, there was something wholesome about the ragtag nerds who were risking their own necks for the greater good.\n\nObviously, we now know it was all all an act — a bold and admittedly effective strategy to distract investors from the reality that FTX and Alameda were built on a house of cards\n\n(And again, I understand the crypto space in general and FTX in particular can seem like a confusing mess of internetty nonsense, so I’ve written a couple of dead-simple stories that attempt to put it all in plain English. This one is about cryptocurrencies. This one is about FTX. )\n\nEnjoying Nightcap? Sign up and you’ll get all of this, plus some other funny stuff we liked on the internet, in your inbox every night.

The measures were originally widely accepted for minimizing deaths while other countries suffered devastating wavs of infections, but that consensus has begun to fray in recent weeks.\n\nThen on Friday, 10 people died in a fire in an apartment building, and many believe their rescue was delayed because of excessive lockdown measures. That sparked a weekend of protests, as the Chinese public’s ability to tolerate the harsh measures has apparently reached breaking point.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered late Saturday in Shanghai, which experienced a devastating lockdown in the spring in which people struggled to secure groceries and medicines and were forcefully taken into centralized quarantine.\n\nOn a street named for the city in China’s far west where the fire happened, one group of protesters brought candles, flowers and signs honoring those who died in the blaze. Another, according to a protester who insisted on anonymity, was more active, shouting slogans and singing the national anthem.\n\nVideo shows protesters chanting 'Xi Jinping! Step down!'\n\nIn a video of the protest seen by The Associated Press, chants sounded loud and clear: “Xi Jinping! Step down! CCP! Step down!” Xi, arguably China’s most dominant leader since Mao Zedong, was recently named to another term as head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, and some expect him to try to stay in power for life.\n\nThe protester and another, who gave only his last name, Zhao, confirmed the chants. Both insisted on having their identities shielded because they fear arrest or retribution.\n\nThe atmosphere of the protest encouraged people to speak about topics considered taboo, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in which the ruling Communist Party had ordered troops to fire on pro-democracy student demonstrators, the unnamed protester said. Some also called for an official apology for the deaths in the fire in Urumqi in the Xinjiang region. One member of the Uyghur ethnic group that is native to Xinjiang and has been the target of a sweeping security crackdown shared his experiences of discrimination and police violence.\n\n“Everyone thinks that Chinese people are afraid to come out and protest, that they don’t have any courage,” said the protester, who said it was his first time demonstrating. “Actually in my heart, I also thought this way. But then when I went there, I found that the environment was such that everyone was very brave.”\n\nInitially peaceful, the scene turned violent in the early hours of Sunday. Hundreds of police surrounded the protesters and broke up the first more active group before they came for the second as they tried to move people off the main street. The protester said that he saw multiple people being taken away, forced by police into vans, but could not identify them.\n\nThe protester named Zhao said one of his friends was beaten by police and two were pepper sprayed. He said police stomped his feet as he tried to stop them from taking his friend away. He lost his shoes in the process, and left the protest barefoot.\n\nZhao said protesters yelled slogans, including one that has become a frequent rallying cry: “(We) do not want PCR (tests), but want freedom.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, crowds returned to the same spot and again railed against PCR tests. People stood and filmed as police started shoving at people.\n\nDeaths in apartment fire in Urumqi spark weekend of protest\n\nA crowdsourced list on social media showed that there were also demonstrations at 50 universities. Videos posted on social media that said they were filmed in Nanjing in the east, Guangzhou in the south, Beijing in the north and at least five other cities showed protesters tussling with police in white protective suits or dismantling barricades used to seal off neighborhoods. The Associated Press could not independently verify all the protests.\n\nIn Beijing, students at the nation’s top college, Tsinghua University, held a demonstration Sunday afternoon in front of one of the school’s cafeterias. Three young women stood there initially with a simple message of condolence for the victims of the Urumqi apartment fire, according to a witness, who refused to be named out of fear of retribution, and images of the protest the AP has seen.\n\nStudents shouted “freedom of speech” and sang the Internationale, the socialist anthem. The deputy Communist Party secretary of the school arrived at the protest, promising to hold a schoolwide discussion.\n\nMeanwhile, two cities in China’s northwest, where residents have been confined to their homes for up to four months, eased some anti-virus controls Sunday after public protests Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, Urumqi, where the fire occurred, as well as the smaller city of Korla were preparing to reopen markets and other businesses in areas deemed at low risk of virus transmission and to restart bus, train and airline service, state media reported.\n\nWu reported from Taipei, Taiwan.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/china/china-protest-crackdown-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China Covid: Security apparatus swings into action to smother protests", "text": "CNN —\n\nChina’s vast security apparatus has moved swiftly to smother mass protests that swept the country, with police patrolling streets, checking cell phones and even calling some demonstrators to warn them against a repeat.\n\nIn major cities on Monday and Tuesday, police flooded the sites of protests that took place over the weekend, when thousands gathered to vent their anger over the country’s tough zero-Covid policy – some calling for greater democracy and freedom in an extraordinary show of dissent against Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThe heavy police presence has discouraged protesters from gathering since, while authorities in some cities have adopted surveillance tactics used in the far western region of Xinjiang to intimidate those who demonstrated at the weekend.\n\nIn what appears to be the first official response – albeit veiled – to the protests, China’s domestic security chief vowed at a meeting Tuesday to “effectively maintain overall social stability.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN's Beijing reporter breaks down latest police moves to suppress protests 03:10 - Source: CNN\n\nWithout mentioning the demonstrations, Chen Wenqing urged law enforcement officials to “resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order,” the state-run news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nThe tough language may signal a heavy-handed crackdown ahead. While protests over local grievances do occur in China, the current wave of demonstrations is the most widespread since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement of 1989. The political defiance is also unprecedented, with some protesters openly calling for Xi, the country’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades, to step down.\n\nSome of the boldest protests took place in Shanghai, where crowds called for Xi’s removal two nights in a row. The sidewalks of Urumqi Road – the main protest site – have been completely blocked by tall barricades, making it virtually impossible for crowds to congregate.\n\nPolice cars patrol Shanghai's Urumqi Road, which has been completely blocked off by tall barricades after a weekend of protests.

HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTen minutes’ drive away, dozens of police officers patrolled the People’s Square – a large plaza at the heart of the city where some residents had planned to gather with white paper and candles on Monday evening. Police also waited inside a subway station there, closing off all but one exit, according to a protester at the scene.\n\nCNN is not naming any of the protesters in this story to protect them from reprisals.\n\nThe protester said he saw police checking the cell phones of passersby, and asking them if they had installed virtual private networks (VPNs) that can be used to circumvent China’s internet firewall, or apps such as Twitter and Telegram, which though banned in the country have been used by protesters.\n\n“There were also police dogs. The whole atmosphere was chilling,” the protester said.\n\nProtesters later decided to move their planned demonstration to another location, but by the time they arrived, the security presence had already been stepped up there, the protester said.\n\n“There were too many police and we had to cancel,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a widely circulated video appears to show police officers checking passengers’ mobile phones on a Shanghai subway train.\n\nAnother Shanghai protester told CNN they were among “around 80 to 110” people detained by police on Saturday night, adding they were released 24 hours later.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the number of protesters detained and it is unclear how many people, if any, remain in custody.\n\nThe protester said the detainees had their phones confiscated on board a bus that took them to a police station, where officers collected their fingerprints and retina patterns.\n\nAccording to the protester, police told those detained they had been used by “ill-intentioned people who want to start a color revolution,” pointing to nationwide protests breaking out on the same day as evidence of that.\n\nThe protester said police returned their phone and camera upon their release, but officers had deleted the photo album and removed the WeChat social media app.\n\nCalls from police\n\nIn Beijing, police vehicles, many parked with their lights flashing, lined eerily quiet streets on Monday morning throughout parts of the capital, including near Liangmaqiao in the city’s central Chaoyang district, where a large crowd of protesters had gathered Sunday night.\n\nThe demonstration, which saw hundreds marching down the city’s Third Ring Road, ended peacefully in the early hours of Monday under the close watch of lines of police officers.\n\nBut some protesters have since received phone calls from the police inquiring about their participation.\n\nOne demonstrator said she received a phone call from a man who identified himself as a local police officer, asking her whether she was at the protest and what she saw there. She was also told that if she had any discontent with authorities, she should complain to the police, instead of taking part in “illegal activities” such as the protest.\n\n“That night, the police mostly adopted a calm approach when dealing with us. But the Communist Party is very good at meting out punishment afterward,” the demonstrator told CNN.\n\nShe said she did not wear a face mask during the demonstration. “I don’t think Omicron is that scary,” she said. But her friends who wore masks to the protest also received calls from the police – some as late as 1 a.m., she added.\n\nStill, the protester remained defiant. “It is our legitimate right (to protest), because the constitution stipulates that we have freedom of speech and freedom of congregation,” she said.\n\nAnother protester, who has not heard from the police, told CNN that concern she could be the next to be called upon weighs heavily on her mind.\n\n“I can only seek consolation by telling myself that there were so many of us who took part in the protest, they can’t put a thousand people in jail,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, some universities in Beijing have arranged transportation for students to return home early for winter break and take classes online, citing an effort to reduce Covid risks for students taking public transportation.\n\nBut the arrangement also conveniently discourages students from gathering, following demonstrations on a series of campuses over the weekend, including the prestigious Tsinghua University where hundreds of students shouted for “Democracy and rule of law! Freedom of expression!”\n\nGiven the long history of student-led movements in modern China, authorities are particularly concerned about political rallies on university campuses.\n\nBeijing’s universities have been the source of demonstrations which kicked off the May Fourth Movement in 1919, to which the Chinese Communist Party traces its roots, as well as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which were brutally crushed by the Chinese military.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Philip Wang", "Nectar Gan", "Philip Wang"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/china/china-protests-xinjiang-fire-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China Covid: Protests erupt in unprecedented challenge to Xi ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday faced unprecedented dissent after thousands of demonstrators protested in cities across China over the weekend against his zero-Covid strategy – with some daring to openly call for his removal in the streets.\n\n“Step down, Xi Jinping!

Hear why he changed his mind 03:30 - Source: CNN\n\nChinese stock markets and the yuan tumbled in early trade Monday amid concern about the government’s potential response to the protests, which varied from city to city and in some areas became more heavy-handed as the weekend progressed.\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian deflected questions about the protests and claimed that social media posts linking the Xinjiang fire with Covid policies had “ulterior motives.”\n\nAuthorities had been “making adjustments based on realities on the ground,” he said. When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022.

The protest gradually dispersed before dawn, the witness said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Shanghai residents returned to the site to continue protesting despite a heavy police presence and road blocks.\n\nVideos showed hundreds of people at an intersection shouting “Release the people!” in a demand for the police to free detained demonstrators.\n\nCrowds shouting \"Release the people!\" in Shanghai. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nThis time around, police adopted a more hardline approach, moving faster and more aggressively to make arrests and disperse the crowds.\n\nIn one video, a man holding a bundle of chrysanthemum gave a speech while walking on a pedestrian crossing, as a police officer tried to stop him.\n\n“We need to be braver! Am I breaking the law by holding flowers?” he asked the crowd, who shouted “No!” in reply.\n\n“We Chinese need to be braver!” he said to the applause of the crowd. “So many of us were arrested yesterday. Are they without job or without family? We should not be afraid!”\n\nThe man put up a struggle as more than a dozen officers forced him into a police car, as the angry crowd shouted “Release him!” and rushed toward the vehicle.\n\nOther videos show chaotic scenes of police pushing, dragging and beating protesters.\n\nIn the evening, after one protester was violently dragged away, hundreds of people shouted “triads” at the police, in reference to local crime gangs, according to a livestream.\n\nBBC journalist Edward Lawrence was arrested at the scene of the Shanghai protests on Sunday night and later released, according to a statement from the BBC. A BBC spokesperson expressed concern about Lawrence’s treatment, claiming he was “beaten and kicked by the police.”\n\nOn Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao acknowledged Lawrence’s arrest, claiming he had not identified himself as a journalist before being detained.\n\nPolice officers block Shanghai's Urumqi Road on Sunday.

A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom! We want freedom!” the crowd chanted under an overpass.\n\nA Beijing protester holds a candal in demonstrations on Sunday night.

They don’t have to voice their opinions, but I hope they can stand with us,” he said.\n\nIn the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu, large crowds demonstrated along the bustling river banks in a popular food and shopping district, according to a protester interviewed by CNN and videos circulating online.\n\nThe gathering started with a minute of silence to mourn the Xinjiang fire victims, later turning political as the crowd grew in size, numbering into the hundreds.\n\n“Opposition to dictatorship!” the crowd chanted. “We don’t want lifelong rulers. We don’t want emperors!” they shouted in a thinly veiled reference to Xi, who last month began a norm-shattering third term in office.\n\nProtesters hold up blank papers and chant slogans as they march in protest in Beijing on Sunday night. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nIn the southern city of Guangzhou, hundreds gathered on a public square in Haizhu district – the epicenter of the city’s ongoing Covid outbreak that has been locked down for weeks.\n\n“We don’t want lockdowns, we want freedom! Freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of arts, freedom of movement, personal freedoms. Give me back my freedom!” The crowd shouted.\n\nUniversity campuses\n\nAcross China, protests have also broken out on university campuses – which are particularly politically sensitive to the Communist Party, given the history of the student-led Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday morning, about 100 students gathered around a protest slogan painted on a wall at the prestigious Peking University in Beijing. A student told CNN that when he arrived at the scene at around 1 a.m., security guards were using jackets to cover the protest sign.\n\nA security guard tries to cover a protest slogan against zero-Covid on the campus of Peking University in Beijing.

But furious posts on Chinese social media, which continued despite censors’ best efforts, suggested it wasn’t enough.\n\nThen came Friday, and the first known remarks from Xi on the protests – an unexpected acknowledgment of people’s frustration, according to a European Union official who declined to be named.\n\n“Xi also said Omicron is less deadly than Delta, which makes the Chinese government feel more open to further relaxing Covid restrictions,” the EU official added, raising hopes of greater freedoms after an extraordinary week.\n\nThe deadly fire\n\nOn November 24, Ali Abbas’ granddaughter was charging her tablet device when an electrical fault caused smoke to fill their Urumqi home, in China’s far western Xinjiang region, he told CNN on the phone from Turkey.\n\nSmoke quickly turned to flames, which raced through the wood-furnished apartment. Abbas’ granddaughter and daughter were able to evacuate – but residents on higher floors found themselves stranded after the elevator stopped working.\n\nSome households with previous Covid cases were also locked inside their apartments, leaving them with no way to escape. Urumqi has been under strict lockdown since August, with most residents banned from leaving their homes.\n\nThe fire broke out in Urumqi, Xinjiang, on November 24, according to Chinese authorities. Credit: Douyin\n\nVideos of the incident, taken from other buildings and on the street, suggest firefighters may have been delayed in reaching victims due to street-level lockdown restrictions. Footage shows one fire truck struggling to spray water at the building from a distance.\n\nState-run media reported the fire killed 10 people and injured nine, but reports from local residents suggest the real toll is far higher. A day after the blaze, Urumqi local government officials denied the city’s Covid policies were to blame for the deaths, adding that an investigation was underway.\n\nWhat happened to my neighbors is really a big disaster. I would like to express my sincere sorrow to all Uyghur people, to all those loved ones who lost their family members. Ali Abbas, apartment owner\n\nPublic anger quickly swelled. Videos online showed people marching to a government building in Urumqi on the night of November 25, demanding an end to the lockdown, chanting with fists in the air. Residents in other parts of the city broke through lockdown barriers and confronted Covid workers dressed in PPE; at one point, the crowd sang the national anthem, roaring the chorus: “Arise, arise, arise!”\n\nThe scenes were extraordinary in a city subject to some of China’s most stringent surveillance and security. The government has long been accused of committing human rights abuses against ethnic Uyghurs and other minorities in the region, including placing up to 2 million people in internment camps. Beijing has repeatedly denied these accusations, claiming the camps are vocational training centers.\n\nThe next morning, the Urumqi government said it would gradually ease the lockdown in certain areas. But by then, it was too late to quell the protests erupting across the nation.\n\nMounting frustrations\n\nThe protests tapped into a well of anger that had been brewing over China’s zero-Covid policy – and the damage it has often caused – as the rest of the world ended lockdown restrictions and eased other mandates, including masking.\n\nThe cost has been immense. Unemployment has skyrocketed. The economy is flailing. Those trapped in unexpected lockdowns have found themselves without adequate food, basic supplies, or even medical care in non-Covid emergencies.\n\nAnd, like those in the Urumqi fire, many deaths have been blamed on the zero-Covid policy in the last six months – far more than the six official Covid deaths reported during the same period. Demands for accountability are growing, especially after a September bus crash that killed 27 people while transporting residents to a Covid quarantine facility, and the November death of a toddler during a suspected gas leak in a locked-down residential compound.\n\nFrom left, a protest banner is seen on Sitong Bridge in Beijing on October 13, and Foxconn employees in Zhengzhou take buses home on October 30. Twitter/Getty Images\n\nThe policy had been broadly popular at the start of the pandemic, but many residents have now had enough. In a rare demonstration in October, a sole protester hung banners on a Beijing bridge that decried Covid restrictions and demanded Xi’s removal.\n\nThough all references to the banners were wiped from the Chinese internet, versions of those slogans began appearing in other parts of the country and in universities around the world – scrawled on bathroom walls and pinned on bulletin boards. More acts of disobedience came in November; workers fled China’s largest iPhone assembly factory in Zhengzhou when it was placed under lockdown, while residents of Guangzhou, also a manufacturing hub, tore down lockdown barriers and surged onto the streets in a nighttime revolt.\n\nFrom June to November 22, American think tank Freedom House recorded at least 79 protests against Covid restrictions, spanning from social media campaigns to gatherings on the street. But most of these voiced grievances against local authorities – a far cry from some of the nationwide protests that, for the first time in a generation, took aim at the country’s powerful leader and central government.\n\nAn unprecedented wave of protest\n\nProtesters gather in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai on November 26. Credit: Twitter/@whyyoutouzhele\n\nThe protests in Urumqi quickly sparked more across the country – from the original epicenter of the pandemic in Wuhan, to the capital Beijing, and Shanghai, China’s glitzy financial hub, which still carries the trauma of its own two-month lockdown earlier this year.\n\nHundreds of Shanghai residents gathered on November 26 for a candlelight vigil for the victims of the fire. Grief turned to anger as the crowd chanted slogans calling for freedom and political reform, while holding blank sheets of paper in a symbolic protest against censorship. In videos, people can be heard shouting for Xi and the Communist Party to “step down,” and singing a famous socialist anthem.\n\nAround 300 kilometers (186 miles) away, dozens of students in Nanjing gathered to mourn the victims, with photos showing a crowd of young people lit by cell phone flashlights. Images of the protests raced across social media faster than censors could erase them – igniting demonstrations in other university campuses, including the prestigious Peking University in Beijing. One wall at Peking University bore a message in red paint, echoing the slogans used by the protester who had hung the Beijing bridge banners in October: “Say no to lockdown, yes to freedom.”\n\nProtesters and students demonstrate outside Nanjing University, November 26.

In Shanghai, one protester told CNN around 80 to 110 people had been detained by police on the night of November 26, adding they were released 24 hours later after officers collected their fingerprints and retina patterns.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the number of protesters detained and it is unclear how many people, if any, remain in custody.\n\nBeijing emerged as a protest hotspot on November 27, as hundreds of students gathered at the elite Tsinghua University, shouting: “Democracy and rule of law! Freedom of expression!” Elsewhere in the city, a large crowd gathered for a vigil and a march through the commercial center, chanting slogans for greater civil liberties.\n\nAmid the mourning and frustration, a strong sense of solidarity emerged as people shared the rare chance to stand side by side and voice grievances long silenced.\n\nIt turns out there are so many people who are wide awake Protester in Chengdu\n\nOnline, China’s vast army of censors worked overtime to erase content about the demonstrations – prompting many to get creative. Some posts on social media consisted only of one or two characters repeated for several paragraphs, in the long tradition of using codes and wordless icons to convey dissent on China’s internet.\n\nSimilar tactics were used on the ground, with videos on social media showing crowds shouting, “We want lockdowns, we want tests” after reportedly being told not to chant the opposite.\n\nProtesters in Shanghai hold up pieces of white paper to symbolize censorship, November 27.

In Shanghai, huge barricades were erected to prevent crowds from congregating on sidewalks, while police officers checked passengers’ cell phones on the street and on subway trains, according to eyewitnesses and videos on social media.\n\nIn a veiled warning, the Communist Party’s domestic security committee vowed to “strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilize social order,” according to state media.\n\nOthers in Beijing described receiving phone calls from authorities asking about their participation. One protester told CNN they received a call on Wednesday from a police officer, who revealed that their cell phone signal had been detected near a protest site three days before.\n\nAccording to a recording of the phone conversation heard by CNN, the protester denied being near the site that night – to which the officer asked, “Then why did your cell phone number show up there?”\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time as the crackdown, health officials tried to appease the public, acknowledging in a news conference on Tuesday that some Covid control measures had been implemented “excessively.” Authorities were adjusting measures to “limit the impact on people as much as possible,” they said, reiterating similar recent statements.\n\nThe promises failed to soothe some listeners who seethed in comments on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, where the conference was livestreamed. “You’ve lost all credibility,” one said. Another wrote: “We’ve cooperated with you for three years. Now, it’s time to give our freedom back.”\n\nThe following day, a top official gave the clearest indication yet that the country was considering a new direction.\n\n“With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China’s pandemic containment faces (a) new stage and mission,” said Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who oversees the country’s Covid response, according to state media.\n\nSeveral cities moved quickly to loosen restrictions. On Friday, Beijing’s municipal government reversed rules set just 10 days ago that required residents to show a negative Covid-19 test taken in the previous 48 hours to board public transport in the capital city.\n\nTianjin and Chengdu also scrapped requirements for commuters to present a negative test result, effective immediately, according to notices from both cities’ metro operators on Friday.\n\nIn Chongqing and Guangzhou, close contacts of positive cases can quarantine at home instead of at a government facility. Several lockdowns were also lifted, including in Zhengzhou and in Guangzhou.\n\nWhile these measures are expected to bring some relief, authorities have repeatedly voiced concerns that vaccination rates aren’t high enough to fully open up without risking spikes in Covid deaths.\n\nChina recorded 34,772 new Covid cases on Thursday, then 32,827 on Friday, continuing a downward trend in daily infections from record highs on November 27.\n\nAs of Friday, thousands of buildings and residential communities across China remain under lockdown restrictions due to their classification as “high risk.”\n\n\n\nIt’s not opening up, don’t misinterpret this Comment on Weibo\n\nOne user on Weibo urged authorities to further relax rules “so people can live a normal life,” warning that strict Covid measures could push some too far.\n\n“If they don’t open up soon, people will really go crazy,” one comment read.\n\nAnother wrote: “The pressure is too great.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Carlotta Dotto Henrik Pettersson", "Jessie Yeung", "Carlotta Dotto", "Henrik Pettersson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/china/china-party-congress-protest-banners-xi-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Beijing: Rare protest against China's Xi Jinping days before ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA rare protest against Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his policies was swiftly ended in Beijing Thursday, just days before he is set to secure a third term in power at a key meeting of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nPhotos circulating on Twitter Thursday afternoon show two banners hung on an overpass of a major thoroughfare in the northwest of the Chinese capital, protesting against Xi’s unrelenting zero-Covid policy and authoritarian rule.\n\n“Say no to Covid test, yes to food.

Security personnel were also spotted patrolling every overpass CNN drove by on the Third Ring Road.\n\nChinese authorities have yet to comment on the incident. CNN has reached out to Beijing police for comment.\n\nThe protest sent China’s stringent online censorship into overdrive.\n\nWeibo, a Twitter-like platform, immediately censored search results for “Sitong Bridge,” the site of the protest. Before long, key words including “Beijing,” “Haidian,” “warrior,” “brave man,” and even “courage” were restricted from search.\n\nNumerous accounts on Weibo and WeChat, the super-app essential for daily life in China, have been banned after commenting on – or alluding to – the protest.\n\nStill, many spoke out to express their support and awe. Some shared the Chinese pop hit “Lonely Warrior” in a veiled reference to the protester, who some called a “hero,” while others swore never to forget, posting under the hashtag: “I saw it.”\n\n“Thank you for letting me still see hope for this land,” one comment said.\n\n“The person has disappeared, the name of the site has disappeared, so many words are disappearing. But there are so many Chinese characters, so many pair of eyes. Can you censor us all?” said another.\n\nPublic protest against the top leadership is extremely rare in China, especially in the run-up to important political meetings, when authorities turn Beijing into a fortress to maintain security and stability.

She’d planned to arrive early enough that the campus would be deserted, but her fellow students were already beginning to filter in to start their day.\n\nIn the hallway of an academic building, Jolie, who’d worn a face mask to obscure her identity, waited for the right moment to reach into her bag for the source of her nervousness – several pieces of A4-size paper she had printed out in the small hours of the night.\n\nFinally, when she made sure none of the students – especially those who, like Jolie, come from China – were watching, she quickly pasted one of them on a notice board.\n\n“Life not zero-Covid policy, freedom not martial-lawish lockdown, dignity not lies, reform not cultural revolution, votes not dictatorship, citizens not slaves,” it read, in English.\n\nThe day before, these words, in Chinese, had been handwritten in red paint on a banner hanging over a busy overpass thousands of miles away in Beijing, in a rare, bold protest against China’s top leader Xi Jinping.\n\nAnother banner on the Sitong Bridge denounced Xi as a “dictator” and “national traitor” and called for his removal – just days before a key Communist Party meeting at which he is set to secure a precedent-breaking third term.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows rare protest in Beijing as Chinese leader is set to extend his reign 02:09 - Source: CNN\n\nBoth banners were swiftly removed by police and all mentions of the protest wiped from the Chinese internet. But the short-lived display of political defiance – which is almost unimaginable in Xi’s authoritarian surveillance state – has resonated far beyond the Chinese capital, sparking acts of solidarity from Chinese nationals inside China and across the globe.\n\nOver the past week, as party elites gathered in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People to extoll Xi and his policies at the 20th Party Congress, anti-Xi slogans echoing the Sitong Bridge banners have popped up in a growing number of Chinese cities and hundreds of universities worldwide.\n\nIn China, the slogans were scrawled on walls and doors in public bathrooms – one of the last places spared the watchful eyes of the country’s ubiquitous surveillance cameras.\n\nOverseas, many anti-Xi posters were put up by Chinese students like Jolie, who have long learned to keep their critical political views to themselves due to a culture of fear. Under Xi, the party has ramped up surveillance and control of the Chinese diaspora, intimidating and harassing those who dare to speak out and threatening their families back home.\n\nAnti-Xi posters are seen on a university campus in the Netherlands. Obtained by CNN\n\nCNN spoke with two Chinese citizens who scribbled protest slogans in bathroom stalls and half a dozen overseas Chinese students who put up anti-Xi posters on their campuses. As with Jolie, CNN agreed to protect their identities with pseudonyms and anonymity due to the sensitivity of their actions.\n\nMany said they were shocked and moved by the Sitong Bridge demonstration and felt compelled to show support for the lone protester, who has not been heard of since and is likely to face lifelong repercussions. He has come to be known as the “Bridge Man,” in a nod to the unidentified “Tank Man” who faced down a column of tanks on Beijing’s Avenue of Eternal Peace the day after the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989.\n\nFew of them believe their political actions will lead to real changes on the ground. But with Xi emerging triumphant from the Party Congress with the potential for lifelong rule, the proliferation of anti-Xi slogans are a timely reminder that despite his relentless crushing of dissent, the powerful leader may always face undercurrents of resistance.\n\n‘A tiny spark’\n\nAs China’s online censors went into overdrive last week to scrub out all discussions about the Sitong Bridge protest, some social media users shared an old Chinese saying: “A tiny spark can set the prairie ablaze.”\n\nIt would appear that the fire started by the “Bridge Man” has done just that, setting off an unprecedented show of dissent against Xi’s leadership and authoritarian rule among mainland Chinese nationals.\n\nThe Chinese government’s policies and actions have sparked outcries online and protests in the streets before. But in most cases, the anger has focused on local authorities and few have attacked Xi himself so directly or blatantly.\n\nCritics of Xi have paid a heavy price. Two years ago, Ren Zhiqiang, a Chinese billionaire who criticized Xi’s handling of China’s initial Covid-19 outbreak and called the top leader a power-hungry “clown,” was jailed for 18 years on corruption charges.\n\nBut the risks of speaking out did not deter Raven Wu, a university senior in eastern China. Inspired by the “Bridge Man,” Wu left a message in English in a bathroom stall to share his call for freedom, dignity, reform, and democracy. Below the message, he drew a picture of Winnie the Pooh wearing a crown, with a “no” sign drawn over it. (Xi has been compared to the chubby cartoon bear by Chinese social media users.)\n\nA protest slogan is scribbled on the wall in a public bathroom in China. Obtained by CNN\n\n“I felt a long-lost sense of liberation when I was scribbling,” Wu said. “In this country of extreme cultural and political censorship, no political self-expression is allowed. I felt satisfied that for the first time in my life as a Chinese citizen, I did the right thing for the people.”\n\nThere was also the fear of being found out by the school – and the consequences, but he managed to push it aside. Wu, whose own political awakening came in high school when he heard about the Tiananmen Square massacre by chance, hoped his scribbles could cause a ripple of change – however small – among those who saw them.\n\nHe is deeply worried about China’s future. Over the past two years, “despairing news” has repeatedly shocked him, he said.\n\n“Just like Xi’s nickname ‘the Accelerator-in-Chief,’ he is leading the country into the abyss … The most desperate thing is that through the [Party Congress], Xi Jinping will likely establish his status as the emperor and double down on his policies.”\n\nChen Qiang, a fresh graduate in southwestern China, shared that bleak outlook – the economy is faltering, and censorship is becoming ever more stringent, he said.\n\nChen had tried to share the Sitong Bridge protest on WeChat, China’s super app, but it kept getting censored. So he thought to himself: why don’t I write the slogans in nearby places to let more people know about him?\n\nHe found a public restroom and wrote the original Chinese version of the slogan on a toilet stall door. As he scrawled on, he was gripped by a paralyzing fear of being caught by the strict surveillance. But he forced himself to continue. “(The Beijing protester) had sacrificed his life or the freedom of the rest of his life to do what he did. I think we should also be obliged to do something that we can do,” he said.\n\nChen described himself as a patriot. “However I don’t love the (Communist) Party. I have feelings for China, but not the government.”\n\nOf course I love my country. However, I don’t love the (Communist) Party. Chen Qiang, a fresh graduate\n\nSo far, the spread of the slogans appears limited.\n\nA number of pro-democracy Instagram accounts run by anonymous Chinese nationals have been keeping track of the anti-Xi graffiti and posters. Citizensdailycn, an account with 32,000 followers, said it received around three dozen reports from mainland China, about half of which involved bathrooms. Northern_Square, with 42,000 followers, said it received eight reports of slogans in bathrooms, which users said were from cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Wuhan.\n\nThe movement has been dubbed by some as the “Toilet Revolution” – in a jibe against Xi’s campaign to improve the sanitary conditions at public restrooms in China, and a nod to the location of much of the anti-Xi messaging.\n\nWu, the student in Eastern China, applauded the term for its “ironic effect.” But he said it also offers an inspiration. “Even in a cramped space like the toilet, as long as you have a revolutionary heart, you can make your own contribution,” he said.\n\nFor Chen, the term is a stark reminder of the highly limited space of free expression in China.\n\n“Due to censorship and surveillance, people can only express political opinions by writing slogans in places like toilets. It is sad that we have been oppressed to this extent,” Chen said.\n\n‘A glimmer of light’\n\nFor many overseas Chinese students, including Jolie, it is their first time to have taken political action, driven by a mixture of awe and guilt toward the “Bridge Man” and a sense of duty to show solidarity.\n\nAmong the posters on the notice boards of Goldsmiths, the University of London, is one with a photo of the Sitong Bridge protest, which showed a plume of dark smoke billowing up from the bridge.\n\nAbove it, a Chinese sentence printed in red reads: “The courage of one person should not be without echo.”\n\nA poster at Goldsmiths, the University of London, reads in Chinese: \"The courage of one person should not be without echo.\" Obtained by CNN\n\nPutting up protest posters “is the smallest thing, but the biggest I can do now – not because of my ability but because of my lack of courage,” Jolie said, pointing to her relative safety acting outside China’s borders.\n\nOthers expressed a similar sense of guilt. “I feel ashamed. If I were in Beijing now, I would never have the courage to do such a thing,” said Yvonne Li, who graduated from Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands last year.\n\nLi and a friend put up a hundred posters on campus and in the city center, including around China Town.\n\n“I really wanted to cry when I first saw the protest on Instagram. I felt politically depressed reading Chinese news everyday. I couldn’t see any hope. But when I saw this brave man, I realized there is still a glimmer of light,” she said.\n\nWhen I saw this brave man, I realized there is still a glimmer of light. Yvonne Li, recent graduate in Rotterdam\n\nThe two Instagram accounts, Citizensdailycn and Northern_square, said they each received more than 1,000 submissions of anti-Xi posters from the Chinese diaspora. According to Citizensdailycn’s tally, the posters have been sighted at 320 universities across the world.\n\nTeng Biao, a human rights lawyer and visiting professor at the University of Chicago, said he is struck by how fast the overseas opposition to Xi has gathered pace and how far it has spread.\n\nWhen Xi scrapped presidential term limits in 2018, posters featuring the slogan “Not My President” and Xi’s face had surfaced in some universities outside China – but the scale paled in comparison, Teng noted.\n\n“In the past, there were only sporadic protests by overseas Chinese dissidents. Voices from university campuses were predominantly supporting the Chinese government and leadership,” he said.\n\nThe risks\n\nIn recent years, as Xi stoked nationalism at home and pursued an assertive foreign policy abroad, an increasing number of overseas Chinese students have stepped forward to defend Beijing from any criticism or perceived slights – sometimes with the blessing of Chinese embassies.\n\nThere were protests when a university invited the Dalai Lama to be a guest speaker; rebukes for professors perceived to have “anti-China” content in their lectures; and clashes when other campus groups expressed support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests.\n\nBut as the widespread anti-Xi posters have shown, the rising nationalistic sentiment is by no means representative of all Chinese students overseas. Most often, those who do not agree with the party and its policies simply choose to stay silent. For them, the stakes of openly criticizing Beijing are just too high. In past years, those who spoke out have faced harassment and intimidation, retaliation against family back home, and lengthy prison terms upon returning to China.\n\nPosters calling for Chinese leader Xi Jinping's removal on a university campus in London. Obtained by CNN\n\n“Even liberal democracies are influenced by China’s long arm of repression. The Chinese government has a large amount of spies and informants, monitoring overseas Chinese through various United Front-linked organizations,” Teng said, referring to a party body responsible for influence and infiltration operations abroad.\n\nTeng said Beijing has extended its grip on Chinese student bodies abroad to police the speech and actions of its nationals overseas – and to make sure the party line is observed even on foreign campuses.\n\n“The fact that so many students are willing to take the risk shows how widespread the anger is over Xi’s decade of moving backward.”\n\nMost students CNN spoke with said they were worried about being spotted with the posters by Beijing’s supporters, who they fear could expose them on Chinese social media or report them to the embassies.\n\n“We were scared and kept looking around. I found it absurd at the time and reflected briefly upon it – what we were doing is completely legal here (in the Netherlands), but we were still afraid of being seen by other Chinese students,” said Li, the recent graduate in Rotterdam.\n\n‘We’re not alone’\n\nThe fear of being betrayed by peers has weighed heavily on Jolie, the student in London, in particular while growing up in China with views that differed from the party line. “I was feeling really lonely,” she said. “The horrible (thing) is that your friends and classmates may report you.”\n\nBut as she showed solidarity for the “Bridge Man,” she also found solidarity in others who did the same. In the day following the protest in Beijing, Jolie saw on Instagram an outpouring of photos showing protest posters from all over the world.\n\n“I was so moved and also a little bit shocked that (I) have many friends, although I don’t know them, and I felt a very strong emotion,” she said. “I just thought – my friends, how can I contact you, how can I find you, how can we recognize each other?”\n\nAnti-Xi posters at a university in New York. Obtained by CNN\n\nSometimes, all it takes is a knowing smile from a fellow Chinese student – or a new protest poster that crops up on the same notice board – to make the students feel reassured.\n\n“It’s important to tell each other that we’re not alone,” said a Chinese student at McGill University in Quebec.\n\n“(After) I first hung the posters, I went back to see if they were still there and I would see another small poster hung by someone else and I just feel really safe and comforted.”\n\n“I feel like it is my responsibility to do this,” they said. If they didn’t do anything, “it’s just going to be over, and I just don’t want it to be over so quickly without any consequences.”\n\nNot everyone is brainwashed. (We’re) still a nation with ideals and hopes. Matt, a Chinese student in New York\n\nIn China, the party will also be watching closely for any consequences. Having tightened its grip on all aspects of life, launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent, wiped out much of civil society and built a high-tech surveillance state, the party’s hold on power appears firmer than ever.\n\nBut the extensive censorship around the Sitong Bridge protest also betrays its paranoia.\n\n“Maybe (the bridge protester) is the only one with such courage and willingness to sacrifice, but there may be millions of other Chinese people who share his views,” said Matt, a Chinese student at Columbia University in New York.\n\n“He let me realize that there are still such people in China, and I want others to know that, too. Not everyone is brainwashed.

Her comments came a day after a separate body of top health officials pledged to rectify some approaches to Covid control and said local governments should “respond to and resolve the reasonable demands of the masses” in a timely manner.\n\nOn Thursday, Sun reiterated the new tone, telling a health symposium in Beijing that China’s health care and disease control systems now had “effective diagnosis and treatment techniques” against the epidemic. Overall, China had “created conditions for the country to further optimize its prevention and control measures,” she said, according to state media.\n\nThe high-level statements – alongside minor adjustments of rules and some easing of lockdown measures in major cities in recent days – suggest China is bending under pressure on the policy, which has become increasingly disruptive as it struggles to counter highly transmissible variants and record case numbers.\n\nBut the shifting tone has not come with any road map to an end goal or mention of transitioning away from zero-Covid, and it remains uncertain how it will impact realities on the ground or ease mounting public frustration.\n\nAs of Friday, thousands of buildings and residential communities across China remain under lockdown restrictions due to their classification as “high risk.”\n\nLocal officials may be reticent to let cases rise for fear of retribution from a central government that has long prided itself on its zero-Covid stance. Meanwhile, experts say, the country continues to lag in key areas of preparedness for a widespread outbreak.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Protesters clash with police in China during new wave of demonstrations 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nTone shift\n\nChinese health officials and experts have long argued that the costs of the zero-Covid policy are scientifically justified, citing uncertainties in how the virus will evolve, unknowns about its long-term effects, and gaps in medical preparedness, including a lagging elderly vaccination rate and inadequate intensive care infrastructure – especially in rural areas.\n\nThese weaknesses, they have warned, could see the health care system overwhelmed if the virus spreads freely in the country of 1.4 billion – a situation that could exacerbate the deaths expected with an opening up.\n\nThis remains a key concern for the government, according to health security expert Nicholas Thomas at the City University of Hong Kong, who said: “There is still a substantial part of the population that is trusting in the government’s actions in dealing with the virus. An unmanaged engagement with the virus could not only erode that trust but it could also expose vulnerable populations (to risk).”\n\nOfficials’ recent comments around the policy are “not a sign that China is ready to transition to living with Covid, but a sign that the virus has slipped out of control and that the government is unable to return to a zero-Covid environment,” he said.\n\nCase numbers in the past week have hovered around record highs, with more than 34,000 new infections reported Thursday – posing a steep challenge to efforts to return them to a low level.\n\nThere have, however, been recent signs of efforts to shift public perception about the virus, following years of focusing on its risks.\n\nA number of media outlets picked up a piece by state-run Global Times citing “recent research” from Chinese scientists showing the comparative “decreased pathogenicity” of the Omicron variant. Others shared an interview with a medical expert who raised doubts about long Covid — a sharp contrast to previous state media coverage playing up the long-term risks of contracting the virus.\n\nThe government’s own narrative about the success of zero-Covid and its backing by leader Xi Jinping partly explain why China has long maintained the policy, according to Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.\n\nAfter bringing its initial outbreak in Wuhan under control in 2020, China’s border restrictions and swift method of detecting and suppressing the virus allowed the country to live relatively virus-free, while hospitals in many parts of the world were overrun with sick and dying patients. By China’s official count, it has seen only 5,233 Covid-19 deaths since early 2020, with fewer than 600 reported in 2022.\n\nXi has touted China’s measures and its relatively low number of Covid deaths as a triumph of Chinese governance. The country stuck to that system even as others transitioned to living with the virus following mass vaccinations and the spread of the milder, but highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nEven as Omicron made China’s controls less effective, Beijing continued to prioritize resources for lockdowns, mass testing and forced quarantines over preparing for wide spread of the virus, observers say.\n\n“The number one (reason) is propaganda – they want to claim that China is doing a much better job than the United States,” said Wu, adding that expanding state control over the population could be another motivation for maintaining the zero-Covid policy – as Xi has stressed state security as a key policy goal.\n\nBut while pursuing this strategy, China “lost so many golden opportunities,” to prepare to live with the virus, and to prepare the public for a larger scale of deaths from Covid-19, he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'River of blood': Foxconn employee describes violent protests in China 03:26 - Source: CNN\n\nPrepared?\n\nOne concern among health officials about relaxing controls is the low level of vaccination in the elderly population most vulnerable to Covid-19 – a weakness that Beijing on Tuesday launched a new plan to address.\n\nAs of November 11, 40% of China’s over-80 population had received a booster shot, according to state media, while around two-thirds had received two doses – a result of both vaccine hesitancy and an initial roll-out that did not prioritize the elderly.\n\nA World Health Organization advisory group last year recommended that elderly people taking China’s inactivated-virus vaccines receive three doses in their initial course to ensure sufficient protection. Vaccine protection is known to wane over time and decrease against Omicron.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s immunity rests almost entirely on vaccination as so few people have been exposed to the virus. Around 90% of the population is fully vaccinated. While China’s vaccines have been shown to protect against severe disease and death, studies show they offer lower antibody protection than the mRNA vaccines used widely elsewhere in the world. Beijing has yet to approve any mRNA vaccine.\n\nResidents line up for Covid-19 testing at a residential complex in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1, 2022. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA stark warning of the risks for mainland China played out in Hong Kong, where low vaccination rates among that most at-risk group played a role in pushing the Chinese territory’s Covid-19 death rates to some of the highest in the world last spring.\n\nWhile vaccination will not eliminate an increase in deaths when restrictions ease, shots and boosters, and other preparations to reduce risks, are critical for countries transitioning away from policies aimed at “zero-Covid,” according to infectious disease physician Peter Collignon of the Australian National University Medical School.\n\n“The preparation isn’t just vaccines, it’s surge capacity, it’s making sure you have enough hospital staff, you have enough beds and particularly making sure the elderly (are protected),” he said.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nChina has signaled it may make more concerted efforts to bolster its defenses against the virus. Officials on Tuesday released an action plan to boost elderly vaccination rates. This echoed a target mentioned in a 20-point plan to optimize zero-Covid measures, released last month, which also called for hospitals to increase intensive treatment facilities and to stockpile anti-viral drugs and medical equipment.\n\nThe same notice also relaxed certain measures around testing and quarantine, and cautioned against excesses in policy enforcement at the local level – all messages that have been echoed by top health officials in recent days.\n\nAfter that guidance – and in the wake of the recent protests – state media has highlighted a number of cities making minor changes to their policies, largely around testing and quarantine rules.\n\nBut some social media users remained skeptical, saying the changes to testing requirements were too minor to ease the impact of zero-Covid on daily life.\n\nThe northeastern city of Jinzhou on Friday announced it would gradually restore some normal operations in its main urban area – just one day after saying it would not follow other cities by relaxing measures ahead of schedule.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials in the southern hub of Guangzhou relaxed lockdowns in four districts and eased a quarantine requirement. And in Xinjiang’s Urumqi on Saturday, local officials said they would gradually ease lockdown measures in neighborhoods categorized as “low risk,” and moved to reopen essential businesses and public transport in a notice the following day.\n\nThe protests across the nation were sparked by a deadly fire on November 24 in Urumqi, where at least 10 people died, and videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims. They joined a list of deaths that have been widely linked in public conversation to Covid-19 controls.\n\nExperts say the real test of the country’s direction remains to be seen in the coming months.\n\nIf the vaccination push and other proposed measures bolstering medical readiness were “seriously implemented,” then China would have “a way forward for future opening,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “But so far they have not been prioritized in the implementation process.”\n\nAnother problem is the disconnect between Beijing’s policies and how they are implemented by local government officials, who are under pressure to control case numbers for fear of being removed from their posts – a regular punishment in the past for those who have allowed outbreaks to spread.\n\n“If you open up and you mess up, then there will be trouble,” Huang said. “You have to change the incentive structure of the local governments before any meaningful changes can be introduced.”\n\nThis article has been updated with new information.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/us/five-things-november-30-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Nov. 30: Rail strike, Jan. 6, Marriage bill, China ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

The bill would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage, although it stops short of setting a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage.

ALY SONG/REUTERS\n\nI set out to help but never had I thought online grocery shopping would be such an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nArmed with a membership for a retail warehouse club – presumably allowing me to face less stiff competition than those using a general online grocer – I quickly realized it was impossible to grab one of the coveted delivery slots, which are assigned at 9 p.m. daily, even with food still available on the virtual shelves.\n\nThe retailer’s app simply crashed each night – and would only come back online a few hours later with a glaring “no more delivery slots for the day” message.\n\nAs frustration and anxiety built up, my hope dwindled along with my father’s supply. On Day 2 of my futile attempts, a friend tipped me off about a “boutique” online retailer that was still offering a grocery package with next-day delivery slots. Elated to find out she was right, I immediately ordered for my father.\n\nWhen I broke the good news in the online family group chat, however, uncles and aunts – all facing their own food shortage to various degrees – jumped in to express their shock that I willingly paid 398 yuan ($62) for five kilograms of vegetables and 60 eggs.\n\n“Highway robbery!” cried one uncle, while an aunt stressed the price was more than four times what she would normally pay for the same amount of food in the market.\n\n“But these are boutique eggs,” my dad deadpanned.\n\nI was relieved that my father’s fridge was replenished in time but, hearing relative’s comments, felt a sense of “survivor’s guilt”: What about the countless residents who can’t afford price-gouged groceries?\n\nWorkers in hazmat suits transfer daily food supplies and necessities for local residents during the Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAn indefinite lockdown\n\nLiteral survival wasn’t a concern for most of Shanghai’s 25 million residents before April.\n\nFor the past two years, the city had bolstered its status as the most important international gateway to China – for both people and goods. It had prided itself on its more targeted and lenient approach to Covid containment, despite Beijing’s strict zero-Covid policy.\n\nWith Shanghai shunning citywide mass testing and adopting less restrictive quarantine rules, it once looked like a potential role model for the whole country as the rest of the world had largely chosen to live with Covid with an emphasis on vaccination.\n\nThen came Omicron, with the highly contagious Covid variant sweeping through the city and infecting more than 390,000 residents since March, according to government statistics.\n\nAfter repeatedly denying the city would be locked down – with police even announcing a probe into alleged online rumormongers – Shanghai authorities abruptly changed course in late March and sealed off the entire metropolis at the beginning of April.\n\nThe government initially billed it as a four-day “temporary pause” – claiming they would promptly test the entire population, isolate positive cases and then re-open the city. As a result, many residents never bothered to stock up.\n\nDespite widespread panic buying before the lockdown, my father was among the unfazed. A retired electric engineer who enjoys travel, photography and coffee, he had recently strained his back muscles – and wasn’t going anywhere in any case.\n\nStill, his home confinement turned out to be much longer – and more precarious – than he ever envisioned.\n\nWith tens of thousands of new infections reported daily, the government has continued to extend the lockdown – ordering any residential community with a single new positive case to be sealed for an additional 14 days.\n\nMy father’s apartment complex is currently slated to be locked down until May 2. But even that date remains uncertain, as the authorities continue to retest residents, meaning the lockdown clock could reset at any time.\n\nFor once, millions of people in Shanghai – young and old, rich and poor, liberal and conservative – seem united by their rising anger.\n\nDespite the censors’ ferocious effort to erase all traces of bad news, social media users keep recounting and re-posting heartbreaking stories, increasingly disgusted by highly choreographed state media images showing an orderly and effective lockdown.\n\nAmong my friends and family, almost everyone has a personal story to share about the lockdown chaos and misery: from sneaking out in darkness to barter some food with a neighbor, to learning harrowing experiences of a friend dumped into to a hastily built isolation ward with leaking roofs and overflowing toilets, and hearing the wailing of an old woman next door whose children were unable to see their newly deceased father one last time.\n\nResidents take part in Covid-19 testing during a lockdown in Shanghai on Monday, April 18. Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nPropaganda adds insult to injury\n\nPeople are also seeing Chinese propaganda czars double down, painting Omicron as a potentially lethal threat while stressing that only zero-Covid can save China from the deaths and havoc caused by the virus in the West.\n\nOfficials have made it clear the policy has the personal stamp of approval from the country’s strongman leader, Xi Jinping, who has yet to visit Shanghai – a city he once led – amid the deepening crisis. Xi is expected to assume an almost unprecedented third term later this year, paving the way for him to rule for life.\n\nOutside Shanghai, that message still seems to resonate with many, though debates have started to emerge and intensify. Inside the eerily quiet metropolis, the lockdown and its ensuing calamity have become a watershed moment for locals and expatriates.\n\nWith state media headlines screaming “it’s not the flu!” against government statistics showing only about two dozen severe cases among the infected in Shanghai so far, nearly everyone seems to agree on the apparent absurdity of “the solution being worse than the problem” – particularly as stories surface on social media about deaths relating to those unable to receive medical care for non-Covid causes due to the lockdown.\n\nSome residents have questioned online why the authorities appear more keen to attack critics of zero-Covid than to convince residents aged over 60 in the fast-graying city – the most vulnerable group with a disappointing vaccination rate of 62% – to get the shot.\n\nOthers reflect on the current tragedy and contemplate their next steps.\n\n“How did Shanghai fall like this?” has been the line I have heard most often lately. It’s mostly a rhetorical question – the real question seems to be “Shall I stay, or shall I go?”\n\nAn ambulance runs through an empty street in Shanghai on April 8. Wang Gang/FeatureChina/AP\n\nFor expats, many have been voting with their feet – undaunted by the bureaucratic and logistical hoops they must jump through to just exit their residences.\n\nFor locals, it involves more soul-searching but, echoing sentiment online, a growing number of Shanghainese – native or adopted – have told me they have decided to put their foot down to emigrate.\n\nEntrepreneurs and bankers alike say the brutal lockdown has demonstrated money means nothing in a world where anyone can instantly become collateral damage in plans instigated by a distant and unaccountable leadership.\n\nFor most people in Shanghai, especially of the older generations like my father, they will always call the city home. They remain focused on surviving the ongoing nightmare, trying their luck with bulk-purchasing online.\n\nMy father said someone in his community recently initiated a coffee group-buy attempt – but quickly failed due to lack of interest.\n\n“No one seems to be in the mood for coffee right now,” he said.", "authors": ["Steven Jiang"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}]}

Surprise: The answer isn't France\n\nAlthough it seems like the quintessential French product, the baguette was said to have been invented by Vienna-born baker August Zang in 1839. Zang put in place France’s steam oven, making it possible to produce bread with a brittle crust yet fluffy interior.\n\nThe product’s zenith did not come until the 1920s, with the advent of a French law preventing bakers from working before 4 a.m. The baguette’s long, thin shape meant it could be made more quickly than its stodgy cousins, so it was the only bread that bakers could make in time for breakfast.\n\nSpotify Wrapped 2022 is here:How to view your favorite songs, artists and podcasts of the year\n\n'Beautiful smile':11-year-old girl undergoes first-of-its-kind surgery\n\n'Bad baguettes' are rampant\n\nDespite the decline in traditional bakery numbers today, France’s 67 million people still remain voracious baguette consumers – purchased at a variety of sales points, including in supermarkets. The problem is, observers say, that they can often be poor in quality.\n\n“It’s very easy to get bad baguette in France. It’s the traditional baguette from the traditional bakery that’s in danger. It’s about quality not quantity,” said one Paris resident, Marine Fourchier, 52.\n\nIn January, French supermarket chain Leclerc was criticized by traditional bakers and farmers for its much publicized 29-cent baguette, accused of sacrificing the quality of the famed 26-inch loaf. A baguette normally costs just over $1, seen by some as an index on the health of the French economy.\n\nDo French people eat baguettes often?\n\nThe baguette is indeed serious business. France’s “Bread Observatory” – a venerable institution that closely follows the fortunes of the flute – notes that the French munch through 320 baguettes of one form or another every second. That’s an average of half a baguette per person per day, and 10 billion every year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/12/03/japan-young-spurn-rice/3836175/", "title": "Japan lauds food heritage as young spurn rice", "text": "AP\n\nJapan seeks designation of its traditional cuisine as a UNESCO cultural heritage\n\nYounger generation is eating more fast food%2C less traditional cuisine\n\nAnnual Japanese rice consumption has fallen 17%25 over 15 years\n\nTOKYO (AP) — Washoku, the traditional cuisine of Japan, is being considered for designation as part of the world's priceless cultural heritage by the U.N. this week. But even as sushi and sake booms worldwide, purists say its finer points are candidates for the endangered list at home. The younger generation is increasingly eating Krispy Kreme donuts and McDonald's, not rice.\n\nAmong cuisines, only French cooking has been distinguished as a national culinary tradition. Other picks by UNESCO for its World Heritage list, such as food from Mexico and Turkey, are more specific dishes. Washoku embraces seasonal ingredients, a unique taste, time consuming preparation and a style of eating steeped in centuries of tradition. At its heart is savory \"umami,\" recognized as a fundamental taste along with sweet, sour, salty and bitter.\n\n\"That's a delicate subtle taste. But younger people can't even taste it anymore because they're too used to spicy oily food,\" said Isao Kumakura, president of Shizuoka University of Art and Culture, who is leading the drive to get washoku recognized. \"It's Westernization. Japanese should be more proud of Japanese culture.\"\n\nKumakura believes UNESCO recognition will send a global message and boost efforts to save washoku, a fight that faces serious challenges.\n\nAnnual rice consumption in Japan has fallen 17% over the last 15 years to 779 tons from 944 tons, according to government data.\n\nFast-food chains have become ubiquitous in Japan, including Krispy Kreme, Domino's Pizza and the perennial favorite McDonald's. Their reasonable prices and fast service are attracting the stomachs of the workaholic \"salaryman\" and OL, short for \"office lady.\"\n\nAs washoku dims in popularity, fears are growing the community ties it historically stood for may also be withering, such as cooking together for New Year's and other festivals.\n\nThose are traditions closely linked to family relations as defined by home-cooking — almost always the taste of mom's cooking, or \"ofukuro no aji,\" as the Japanese say.\n\nYasuko Hiramatsu, mother, housewife and part-time translator, learned how to cook from her mother and grandmother, although she also relies on several cookbooks and watches TV shows to beef up her repertoire.\n\nOne of her favorite dishes is ground beef and potatoes cooked in soy sauce, sake and sugar, that she says has a reputation as the way to grab a man's stomach, and thereby his heart.\n\nBoth her husband and son love her \"nikujaga.\" But it's a close call whether that recipe fits the strictest definitions of washoku, which is generally more about fish than meat.\n\nHiramatsu is old-style in making tsukemono from scratch, using \"nuka,\" or fermented rice bran, from her grandmother's recipe to replicate the taste that runs in her family. She sometimes doesn't have time and resorts to packaged stuff from the supermarket. But that's not the ideal.\n\n\"Of course, sometimes I eat out and get French fries, but this is what has been eaten for the longest time,\" she said of her home cooking. \"It must be something in our blood.\"\n\nWashoku is always about rice, miso or soy-bean-paste soup, \"tsukemono\" pickles, and usually three dishes — perhaps a slice of grilled salmon, broth-stewed \"nimono\" vegetables and boiled greens. Umami is based on flavor from dried bonito flakes and seaweed, Japan's equivalent of soup stock.\n\nWashoku is also about design. Fancy ceramic and lacquer-ware come in varying sizes, textures and shapes. Food is placed in a decorative fashion, sometimes with inedible items for effect like an autumn leaf.\n\nPieces of food may be cut into flowery shapes or carefully wrapped around other food, tied like a package with an edible ribbon. Recipes celebrate the seasons by focusing on fresh ingredients.\n\nKenji Uda, 47, the chief chef at Tokyo restaurant Irimoya Bettei, where he makes blowfish sashimi and crab cooked in rice, says he was 17 when he decided to devote his life to washoku.\n\n\"Japanese food is so beautiful to look at,\" he said. \"But it takes a lot of time. People are working and busy, and no longer have that kind of time.\"\n\nThe exodus from washoku is apparent at Taiwa Gakuen, a Kyoto-based school for chefs, where the biggest number of students wants to learn Italian cuisine, followed by French, and interest in washoku is growing only among overseas students.\n\nSeiji Tanaka, who heads the school, hopes the UNESCO decision expected at meeting in Azerbaijan this week will help draw Japanese people back to tradition.\n\n\"It's endangered,\" he said.\n\nTanaka believes the survival of washoku is critical because it's linked with what he sees as the spirit of Japan, especially the family.\n\n\"The 'wa' in washoku means harmony,\" he said.\n\nIn proper Japanese dining, the phrase \"itadakimasu,\" or \"I am going to receive this,\" is uttered, preferably in unison, at the beginning of a meal; \"gochisousama,\" or \"thank you for the meal,\" ends it.\n\nDifferent from saying grace, the custom expresses gratitude not only to the chef but for the blessing of having food on the table — the grace of nature.\n\nBut even washoku experts say you shouldn't feel guilty about not eating it three times a day.\n\nKumakura swears eating with chopsticks — daintily picking each bite-size serving, never piercing — is a symbol of Japanese-ness. But he acknowledges he often has toast and eggs for breakfast.\n\n\"Just please try to have washoku at least once a day,\" he said with a laugh.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/food-and-wine/2018/03/01/unesco-creative-cities-gastronomy/373421002/", "title": "UNESCO Creative Cities of Gastronomy", "text": "Keith Flanagan\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nIn November, the mouthful that is UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) selected San Antonio, Texas, as a Creative City of Gastronomy. It’s one of only two cities in the USA with such gastronomic status: Tucson, Ariz., made the list in 2015.\n\nIf you’re asking yourself “what’s so tasty about the desert,” you’re asking the wrong question.\n\n\n\nThrough UNESCO’s lens, gastronomy is less about a city’s number of starred restaurants and more about a city’s culinary heritage — how it means to share it, sustainably, with future generations. The Creative Cities Network, which now totals 26 cities of gastronomy around the world, started in 2004 in order to promote cooperation and shared experience amongst culture-rich cities worldwide throughout a handful of creative fields (from design to film, and beyond).\n\n\n\nSure, Tucson may be a desert, but gastronomy runs deep: more than a decade ago, architectural digs revealed evidence of irrigated crops dating back 4,000 years, meaning that Tucson claims the country’s longest agricultural history (and at the very least, some seriously old corn).

Originally scheduled to be released in May before UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee meeting in Russia, the report was postponed due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nThe recommendations include slashing greenhouse gas emissions, reassessing proposed projects and credit schemes, and scaling up financial resources to ultimately protect the reefs.\n\nAustralia’s environment minister Tanya Plibersek argued in a press conference Tuesday that the UNESCO report unfairly puts the spotlight on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n“Yes, climate change is a risk to ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef but that means it’s a risk to every reef globally,” Plibersek said. “There is no need to single the Great Barrier Reef out in this way.”\n\nJumbo Aerial Photography/Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority/AP\n\nSpanning nearly 133,000 square miles and home to more than 1,500 species of fish and over 400 species of hard corals, the Great Barrier Reef is an extremely critical marine ecosystem on the Earth.\n\nIt also contributes $4.8 billion annually to Australia’s economy and supports 64,000 jobs in tourism, fishing and research, according to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.\n\nBut as the planet continues to warm, because of the growing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the reef’s long-term survival has come into question. Warming oceans and acidification caused by the climate crisis have led to widespread coral bleaching. Last year, scientists found the global extent of living coral has declined by half since 1950 due to climate change, overfishing and pollution.\n\nThe outlook is similarly grim, with scientists predicting that about 70% to 90% of all living coral around the world will disappear in the next 20 years. The Great Barrier Reef, in particular, has suffered many devastating mass bleaching events since 2015, caused by extremely warm ocean temperatures brought by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.\n\nDuring the UNESCO monitoring missions, reef managers found that the Great Barrier Reef is suffering its sixth mass bleaching event due to heat stress caused by climate change. Aerial surveys of around 750 reefs show widespread bleaching across the reef, with the most severe bleaching observed in northern and central areas.\n\nBleaching happens when stressed coral is deprived of its food source. With worsening conditions, the corals can starve and die, turning white as its carbonate skeleton is exposed.\n\n“Even the most robust corals require nearly a decade to recover,” Jodie Rummer, associate professor of Marine Biology at James Cook University in Townsville, previously told CNN. “So we’re really losing that window of recovery. We’re getting back-to-back bleaching events, back-to-back heat waves. And, and the corals just aren’t adapting to these new conditions.”\n\nWeeks before the mission, global scientists with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released an alarming report concluding that with every extreme warming event, the planet’s vital ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef are being pushed more toward tipping points beyond which irreversible changes can happen.\n\nAs researchers on the mission assessed the dire state of one of the world’s seven natural wonders, they witnessed how the climate crisis has drastically changed the coral reef system.\n\nFollowing publication of the report, Professor Lesley Hughes from the Climate Council, said limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius along with “deep and rapid emissions cuts this decade” are necessary to give the reef “a fighting chance.”\n\nA decision on whether the reef should be officially labeled as “in danger” will be made by the World Heritage Committee next year, once UNESCO compiles a more thorough report that will include responses from the Australian federal and state governments.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez Tara Subramaniam", "Rachel Ramirez", "Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/12/03/jonathan-tortoise-190th-birthday-oldest-land-animal/10826362002/", "title": "World's oldest land animal, Jonathan the tortoise, has 190th birthday", "text": "Life truly has been a marathon for Jonathan, a giant tortoise that holds the title of the oldest living land animal.

But perhaps one of the most visible indicators of its impact is its effect on Earth’s iconic glaciers, a major source of freshwater supply. Glaciers have been melting at a breakneck pace in recent decades, leading to around 20% of global sea level rise since 2000.\n\nNow researchers at the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization have found that glaciers in one-third of the planet’s most beautiful parks and protected areas are set to disappear by 2050 – whether or not global warming is slowed.\n\nAmong the glaciers on the brink of vanishing at World Heritage sites are those in two of the most visited and most beloved parks in the United States – Yellowstone National Park, which saw unprecedented flooding earlier this year, and Yosemite National Park.\n\nThe list also includes some of the largest and most iconic glaciers in Central Asia and Europe as well as the last remaining glaciers in Africa, namely Mount Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro.\n\nGlaciers at World Heritage sites shed around 58 billion tons of ice each year, UNESCO reports, which is equivalent to the total volume of water used annually in France and Spain combined. And these glaciers have already contributed nearly 5% of global sea level rise in the last 20 years.\n\nThe study provides the first global assessment of both the current and future scenario of glaciers in World Heritage sites, according to Tales Carvalho Resende, project officer at UNESCO’s natural heritage unit and author of the report.\n\n“This report brings a very powerful message in the sense that World Heritage Sites are iconic places – places that are extremely important for humanity, but especially for local communities and Indigenous peoples,” Resende told CNN. “Ice loss and glacial retreat is accelerating, so this sends an alarming message.”\n\nHalf Dome at Yosemite Valley in 2021.

Randy Pench/Sacramento Bee/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nOnly by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels can we save glaciers at the other two-thirds of these parks, scientists report – a climate target that recent reports say the world is far from achieving. The global average temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution.\n\nGlaciers cover around 10% of land, providing fresh water supply for households, agriculture and industry downstream. Under normal conditions, they take as long as a millennium to fully form; each year, they gain mass through snow or rain, and lose mass by melting in the summer.\n\nMelting glaciers may seem like a faraway problem, but Resende said it’s a serious global issue that can hit downstream communities hard. He highlighted Pakistan’s deadly floods this year, which left nearly one-third of the country underwater. Reports say the multiweek floods were likely triggered by a combination of heavier than usual monsoon rains and several glacial lake outbursts due to melting that followed the recent extreme heat that enveloped the region.\n\n“As water melts, this water will accumulate in what we call glacial lakes; and as water comes, these glacial lakes might burst,” he said. “And this outburst can create catastrophic floods, which is something we can see very recently in Pakistan.”\n\nGlaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania are on track to disappear within the next few decades, UNESCO reports.

Researchers like Slater have already found those ice sheets to be the major contributors to global sea-level rise this century.\n\n“While it’s sad to hear some of these glaciers could be lost, we should take hope in the fact that reducing emissions can save the majority of them and avoid disruption to the water supply of millions of people worldwide who live downstream,” Slater, who is not involved with the UN report, told CNN.\n\nWith the rate at which the climate crisis is accelerating, more water will be released from glaciers. In drought-stricken areas like the Western US, an increase in meltwater may be a good thing, but Resende said it is only temporary.\n\nOnce a glacier’s peak water – the maximum meltwater it contributes to the system – has been reached, annual runoff decreases as the glacier shrinks to the point where it’s no longer able to produce water supply.\n\nAccording to the report, many small glaciers in the Andes, Central Europe and Western Canada either have already reached peak water or are expected to in the coming years. Meanwhile, in the Himalayas, annual glacier runoff is forecast to jump around 2050, before it plunges steadily afterward.\n\nPunta Rocca summit is seen after parts of the Marmolada glacier collapsed in the Italian Alps amid record temperatures in July. Borut Zivulovic/Reuters\n\nIf countries fail to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees, or even 2 degrees, glaciers will only continue to recede, the report shows. In that future, places would see significant glacier runoff during the wet periods, with little to no flow to quench drier and hotter conditions.\n\n“This is a hot topic currently in the research community – to see what will be the landscape after glacier melting,” Resende said. “Unfortunately, glaciers will keep melting because there’s always a delay. Even if we stop or drastically cut our emissions today, they will keep retreating because there’s this inertia – and it is extremely important that we manage to set up adaptation measures.”\n\nThe report comes as world leaders gather in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, next week for the UN-brokered international climate negotiations, where the focus will be on getting countries to commit to stronger fossil fuel cuts that would limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. They will also discuss plans to adapt to worsening extreme weather events including heat waves, floods and storms.\n\n“We need to really unite ourselves, to make as much as possible this 1.5 objective feasible,” Resende said. “The impacts might be irreversible, so this is really a pledge to take urgent action.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2016/10/07/world-food-prize-grows-tall-30-years/91537122/", "title": "World Food Prize grows tall in 30 years", "text": "Kenneth Quinn\n\nThis coming week, the World Food Prize will celebrate the 30th anniversary of its creation in 1986. Des Moines will be overrun with close to 1,500 participants from more than 50 countries here to take part in our Borlaug Dialogue symposium and Global Youth Institute for high school students and teachers.\n\nIn addition, 700 Iowans will take part in our Iowa Hunger Summit on Oct. 10. Several thousand others will attend more than 20 \"Laureate Lectures\" around the state and watch our Laureate Award Ceremony (often called the \"Oscars of Agriculture\") live on IPTV as we present our $250,000 award to the four pioneers of bio-fortification — infusing crops with essential vitamins and minerals and decreasing malnutrition in Africa.\n\nIt all will be an incredible week-long celebration of the legacy of our founder, Norman Borlaug. But it represents a dramatic change from when I first returned from Cambodia in 1999 to accept the invitation of the new chairman, John Ruan III, to become president of the World Food Prize.\n\nJohn told me that my mission was simple: just fulfill Norm Borlaug’s dream and make the World Food Prize into the “Nobel Prize for food and agriculture,” and his father's vision that Des Moines could be seen as the food and agricultural capital of America.\n\nWith just a one-person staff operating from a small two-room office, and only about 50 people from outside Iowa attending the one-day World Food Prize event each October, it seemed like Mission Impossible. But with the support of the state, the generosity of our many donors, and the dedication and hard work of our foundation staff, the World Food Prize has grown remarkably over the past two decades.\n\nThe World Food Prize is now a week-long set of events in October and year-around programs that provide significant benefit to the students, businesses and citizens of our state. Included are our:\n\nLaureate Award Ceremony at the magnificent Iowa State Capitol that gives the World Food Prize the aura of a regal Nobel event. When I arrived in 2000, there were no female laureates, nor any Africans. Now in 2016, with six women and five African laureates, the World Food Prize is truly seen as the foremost international award in agriculture and food security.\n\nBorlaug Dialogue International Symposium, which brings the world to Iowa, with speakers such as U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, Kofi Annan and Bill Gates, who launched his multi-billion dollar initiative to lift up Africa from our symposium stage.\n\nGates chose our venue for this historic announcement because his staff had told him that they had “met a more diverse array of people at the World Food Prize in Des Moines than at any other conference they had attended anywhere in the world.”\n\nSir Gordon Conway has referred to our symposium as “the premier conference in the world on global agriculture.” One journalist noted that the World Food Prize \"brings more CEOs to Iowa than any other organization,\" thus playing a significant role in promoting Iowa’s economic development.\n\nIowa Youth Institute, Global Youth Institute, and Borlaug-Ruan International Internships, for high school students and Wallace-Carver Fellowships and George Washington Carver college internships, all of which promote STEM education for Iowa students. The results are amazing.\n\nConsider that 92 percent of all students in our youth programs major in agriculture or STEM-related subjects in college; 77 percent ultimately have careers in these areas; two-thirds of all participants are young women; and 63 percent of all Iowa high schools have participated in our Iowa Youth Institute.\n\nWorld Food Prize Hall of Laureates, open to the public, is celebrating its fifth anniversary. More than 15,000 visitors a year see the spectacular art telling the story of our state’s amazing agricultural heritage, and learn about our LEED Platinum certification, the highest possible level of resource conservation and energy efficiency.\n\nIowa Hunger Summit, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, began in 2006 with a column in the Register by outgoing Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack and former Republican Govs. Robert Ray and Terry Branstad as co- founders of the event. It remains the place where Iowans come together across party lines to confront hunger.\n\nOthers will have to judge whether we have fulfilled the dreams of Norman Borlaug and John Ruan Sr. One of my most vivid memories of Borlaug is of sitting with him in September of 2009, just a few days before he died. Weak from the ravages of cancer, his voice was only a whisper, so I had to lean in to hear him. Squeezing my hand he said, \" Ken, I am so grateful...\" but then his voice trailed off and he slipped away.\n\nEditorial spurred change\n\nIt is remarkable that the World Food Prize is located in Iowa and still in existence only because of an editorial that ran in the Des Moines Register on Dec. 24, 1989. That piece urged Iowa to rescue the World Food Prize, because its original sponsor in New York had withdrawn its financial support and the award was about to go out of existence.\n\nIf you are wondering who reads editorials on Christmas Eve, the answer is John Ruan Sr., who stepped in and, with bipartisan support from Gov. Terry Branstad and the state Legislature, endowed the World Food Prize and gave it a new home in central Iowa.\n\nThrough all of these above programs, the World Food Prize has been attempting to re-pay Iowa for rescuing it when it appeared it was about to go out of existence.\n\n\n\n\n\nKENNETH QUINN is the president of the World Food Prize.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/middleeast/mideast-summary-03-09-2022-intl/index.html", "title": "Israel put in a tricky spot by Russia's invasion of Ukraine | CNN", "text": "Jerusalem CNN —\n\nIn Israel, when someone is trying to tread carefully, it is said that they are “walking between the raindrops” – trying not to get wet.\n\nFor several weeks now, Israel has been walking between the raindrops as Russia wages war on Ukraine.\n\nOn the one hand is Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who regularly condemns Russia’s invasion. Shortly after meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday, Lapid said: “There is no justification for violating Ukrainian sovereignty and killing innocent civilians.”\n\nOn the other hand is Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Although he has called for a ceasefire, is sending humanitarian aid and has personally welcomed Ukrainian refugees landing in Israel, he has barely mentioned Russia or its President Vladimir Putin in public speeches.\n\nThe reason is complicated and down to a combination of economic, cultural, political and, most importantly, security considerations.\n\nIsrael prepares for a wave of immigration that could potentially be the largest it has experienced since the fall of the Soviet Union. @hadas_gold has the story: pic.twitter.com/3k2nvTJ09l — Connect the World (@CNNConnect) March 7, 2022\n\nAnd while the pressure has been building on Israel internationally and domestically to do more to help Ukraine and push back against Russia, Israel is arguing it should use its unique position as one of the few Western-allied countries that has an open channel of communication with both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nBennett is in regular contact with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin, attempting to broker negotiations. An observant Jew, he broke Shabbat on Saturday to fly to Moscow for an unannounced meeting with Putin. On Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath, work and the use of electrical objects is forbidden from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday for those who observe it. But there’s a caveat in Jewish law that a rule can be broken if it saves a life.\n\nHow is Israel’s relationship with Russia?\n\nIsrael and Russia have had a relationship of convenience after re-establishing ties following the end of the Cold War.\n\nIsrael has a large Russian-speaking population. From the fall of the Soviet Union until the mid 2000s, more than one million immigrants arrived from the former Soviet Union under Israel’s “Law of Return,” which allows any Jew, or anyone with at least a Jewish grandparent, to obtain citizenship along with their families.\n\nBut beyond cultural connections, what Israel cares most about with Russia is its influence on Iran and its presence in Syria.\n\nRussia is a party to negotiations to revive the 2015 Iranian nuclear agreement, which Israel opposes. Although his trip to Moscow on Saturday was focused on the Ukraine invasion, Bennett brought up Israel’s position on the deal as nuclear talks continued in Vienna, according to an Israeli official who spoke with CNN.\n\nBut in the more immediate view, Israel considers that its northern border with Syria, “for all intents and purposes is a border with Russia,” in the words of Lapid. “Because the Russians are there and there is security coordination with the Russians.”\n\nIsrael regularly carries out airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria, which it regards as critical to prevent the transfer of precision-guided missile technology to Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIsrael coordinates with the Russians ahead of strikes in Syria and there are concerns that if the relationship with Moscow goes sour, so does Israel’s freedom of action in Syria – something Israel sees as vital for its security.\n\nHow is Israel’s relationship with Ukraine?\n\nIsrael’s relationship with Ukraine is personal. As a European democracy with one of the few Jewish heads of state in the world, Israel sees itself as a natural ally.\n\nUkraine has a large Jewish population and Israel also hosts a large Ukrainian-born population. Economically, Ukraine provides at least 40% of Israel’s grain imports and is an important hub of outsourced engineering work for Israel’s high-tech industry.\n\nAlthough some officials have condemned the invasion and Israel is providing humanitarian assistance, like a field hospital, and sending airplanes full of aid, it has stopped short of committing to providing military equipment.\n\nYevgen Korniychuk, Ukraine's ambassador to Israel, puts on a protective helmet at a press conference on March 7. Sara Lemel/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nUkrainian ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk has decried Israel’s reluctance to provide even defensive equipment. At a press conference in Tel Aviv on Monday, he donned a protective helmet and asked the assembled journalists: “Please tell me, how [can one] kill with this thing? This is simply not possible. So, I don’t know what these people are afraid of.”\n\nWhere do things stand on Israel’s mediation attempts?\n\nEven before hostilities began, Ukraine’s Zelensky had been asking Israel to host talks in Jerusalem. Bennett brought up the possibility when he met Putin in the western Russian city of Sochi in October, but the Russian president dismissed the discussion, according to an Israeli official.\n\nAfter the invasion began, Zelensky again requested Israel mediate. The Israelis say they’re in regular contact with both the Ukrainians and Russians – Bennett spoke with Zelensky again on Tuesday afternoon. But speaking on Sunday after his surprise trip to Moscow, Bennett did not sound optimistic.\n\n“We will continue to assist as needed,” he said. “Even if the chance is not great — as soon as there is even a small opening, and we have access to all sides and the capability — I see this as our moral obligation to make every effort.”\n\nOther top Middle East news\n\nIran puts second military satellite into orbit\n\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) successfully put a second military satellite, the Noor 2, into orbit, the semi-official news agency Tasnim said on Tuesday.\n\nBackground: The announcement came as talks held in Vienna to revive an agreement restraining Iran’s nuclear program have reached a critical stage.\n\nWhy it matters: Putting a second satellite in space would be a major advance for Iran’s military, raising concerns for its rivals about the country’s nuclear and missile programs.\n\nUAE envoy says trade deal with Israel will be signed this month\n\nThe United Arab Emirates and Israel will sign a broad trade and investment pact by the end of the month, the Gulf state’s ambassador to Israel tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nBackground: The UAE and Israel formally established ties in 2020 and the UAE has identified Israel as a future investment partner. Last year, it started a $10 billion fund aimed at strategic sectors in Israel.\n\nWhy it matters: The deal is the latest in a series of agreements between the two countries following the establishment of diplomatic relations and demonstrates Israel’s emergence as an important ally and partner of several Gulf Arab states.\n\nSaudi Arabia to manufacture US patriot missile parts locally\n\nSaudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding with defense giant Raytheon Technologies to locally manufacture key parts of the US Patriot missile defense systems, Saudi’s state news agency said.\n\nBackground: Saudi Arabia depends on surface-to-air systems to intercept drones and missiles fired by Iran-allied Houthi rebels from neighboring Yemen. It has also promoted itself as a strategic location to attract military manufacturing.\n\nWhy it matters: The Saudi military relies heavily on US weaponry, but it is hoping to localize 50% of its military spending by 2030 as its relationship with Washington continues on its unsteady path\n\nAround the region\n\nSt. Catherine's Monastery, located in the Sinai in Egypt at the foot of Mount Moses. Dmitrii Melnikov/Alamy\n\nAt the foot of Egypt’s historic Mount Sinai, a construction boom near the ancient city of St. Catherine is angering residents and visitors, who for years have been drawn to the site’s quiet, nomadic lifestyle.\n\nNow, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is completing his “Great Transfiguration Project” – a construction plan launched in 2021 that is aimed at developing the South Sinai governorate to boost its tourism profile.\n\nThe project is comprised of 14 plans that state-owned media says have been a longstanding demand by investors and residents.\n\nImages on social media have for the past year shown bulldozers and cranes digging through the city’s rocky mountains – natural sites that for centuries have been left untouched. Activists have expressed worry over the work, saying it risks endangering local communities.\n\nAccording to the Bible and the Quran, Mount Sinai is the site where Moses received his Ten Commandments from God, making the area of religious importance to Christianity, Islam and Judaism.\n\nDating as far back as the 6th century, the Monastery of St Catherine and its surroundings are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nResidents say they are seeing multi-story buildings coming up, an alien scene in a city where scattered single-level homes define the Bedouin character.\n\n“I feel upset, of course,” Yasmine Elkashef, a 51-year-old artist who moved to St. Catherine to escape the bustling capital Cairo, told CNN. “We come to St. Catherine for the authenticity.”\n\n“We come here for tranquility because there is no pollution and very few residents,” she added.\n\n“Egypt is destroying the town of Saint Catherine’s in Sinai,” Mohannad Sabry, a journalist and Sinai researcher, said on Twitter, “And it calls it development.”\n\nSabry called on UNSESCO to intervene, saying that while the work will “take decades to reverse,” it is not too late.\n\nEgyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said in September that the government has “taken into consideration the holiness of the site,” and has been in touch with environmental and antiquity experts throughout the renovation period.\n\nThe North African country’s tourism sector took a painful blow during the Covid-19 pandemic but it has seen some improvement after global restrictions were eased.

Bill took charge as president in 1983; his wife, Kathleen, joined the team as general manager in 1993.\n\nUnder Oliver’s direction, the oldest and largest winery in Indiana produces more than 360,000 cases annually in a diverse portfolio of products. This year, Oliver was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Eastern Winery Exposition in Lancaster, Pa. He recently transitioned into the role of CEO to make way for the winery’s new president, Julie Adams. In turn, he plans to focus on team building, capital projects and the creation of a new facility that will triple the winery’s production capacity.\n\n“New products are another priority for me, as our growth depends on having great new wines that resonate with consumers,” he said. “My background is mostly from the winemaking side of our business, so I’m frequently showing up in the winemaking offices tasting and collaborating with the winemaking team.”\n\nAlthough Oliver’s Soft Red and Soft White remain favorites among Hoosier wine drinkers, he said it’s a mistake to generalize about the characteristics of Indiana wines.\n\n“We make classic vinifera wines from our own grapes that would stand up against any California wine, but the world is awash in great vinifera wines such as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon,” he said. “We’ve found a growth opportunity in unique wines with solid appeal. Some of those are dry; some are sweet.”\n\nOliver also is quick to point out just how much Indiana’s booming wine industry has evolved over the past few decades.\n\n“The wine has gotten a lot better, for sure,” he said. “There’s a higher level of business savviness as well. Social media has been a great thing for smaller wineries, giving them a platform to build a brand and build relationships.”\n\nAs to the wine industry’s future in Indiana, Oliver predicts we’ll see continued quality improvements and increased sales.\n\n“I believe consumers want to buy from businesses that not only offer a great product, but that also offer a personal relationship,” he said. “Indiana wineries are real businesses operated by people you can meet in person simply by visiting their tasting rooms. We sit on the genuine side of the spectrum, and that speaks to consumers who want authenticity.”\n\nQuestion: What does the word “leader” mean to you?\n\nAnswer:Leadership is about creating a vision and getting others on board to collectively work toward achieving that vision. Good leaders inspire and bring the best out of others.\n\nQ: What are your biggest successes you’ve had on the job?\n\nA:Building one of the largest wineries in the eastern U.S. — and doing so with my wife as my primary business partner — has been my biggest achievement. I’m very proud of the team we’ve built across winery functions — winemaking, sales, marketing and hospitality. We have the best crew of hardworking and dedicated people that we’ve ever had. Our employees are simply good people and make coming to work loads of fun.\n\nTen years ago, we transitioned Oliver Winery to 100 percent employee ownership through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Employees are incentivized by sharing in the company’s successes, and this is a model that has contributed to our success.\n\nQ: If you weren’t involved in wine, what would you be doing?\n\nA:That’s actually a question I ponder on occasion. My other love is aviation. I can see myself as a commercial pilot, but probably not for airlines. I’m more of an Alaskan Bush pilot kind of guy. Or perhaps running a school teaching aerobatics, and showing up in the air-show circuit.\n\nQ: Do you have a business philosophy you try to follow?\n\nA:My business philosophy is fundamentally the four operating principles of Oliver Winery — respect people, expect quality, think differently and get stuff done.\n\nQ: What is the best piece of career advice you’ve ever received?\n\nA: Unquestionably, it would be to never give up. You need tough skin, patience and perseverance to succeed in any business.\n\nMore about Bill Oliver\n\nJob title: CEO of Oliver Winery.\n\nEducation: MBA from Indiana University, 1993.\n\nPrior employment: Commercial balloon pilot and instructor.\n\nFamily: Wife, Kathleen; three sons.\n\nFavorite pastimes: Wilderness travel, skiing, bicycling, aviation and cooking.\n\nFavorite musical artists: Jimmy Buffett, Bonnie Raitt, Aaron Neville, Pentatonix.\n\nFavorite quote: “We’re free to live average lives on average decisions.

Not only did the Wildcats get yards in chunks, but they avoided plays of negative or no gain.\n\nOhio State and Northwestern having trouble getting passing games going\n\nIt wasn't until there were about nine minutes remaining in the first quarter that either team could complete a pass. Brendan Sullivan missed on his only attempt on Northwestern's opening drive. (He has, however, connected on two passes since.) Ohio State's C.J.

Stroud and offensive tackle Paris Johnson Jr.\n\nOhio State wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is also projected as a first-round puck, but will miss Saturday’s game with a hamstring injury.\n\nPat Fitzgerald: Northwestern has ‘hands full’ with Ohio State\n\nWhen previewing Northwestern’s matchup with Ohio State Monday, coach Pat Fitzgerald wasn’t afraid to mince words when talking about the Buckeyes.\n\n“When you pop on the tape and take a deeper dive, it’s a complete team,” Fitzgerald said. “Coach (Ryan) Day and his staff have done a phenomenal job in recruiting. They’ve got depth everywhere and explosiveness in all three phases. Coming off a really hard-fought game at Penn State, that was impressive to watch.\n\n“We’ll have our hands full.”\n\nRedshirt senior defensive back A.J. Hampton Jr. showed confidence when asked about facing Ohio State’s passing game led by quarterback C.J. Stroud.\n\n“Everybody’s praising these guys, everybody wants these guys to do good,” Hampton said. “But they haven’t faced us yet. They haven’t faced me, they haven’t faced Cam Mitchell, they haven’t faced any of our secondary.”\n\nOhio State vs. Northwestern set for extreme weather conditions Saturday\n\nWeather conditions are not set to be ideal for Ohio State vs. Northwestern Saturday afternoon.\n\nEvanston, Illinois is currently under a high-wind warning with gusts up to 65 mph, and a storm warning that will last until 8 p.m. with a 52% chance of rain starting at noon.\n\nCoach Ryan Day said he’s preparing for extreme conditions Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"This is probably a little more extreme, so we will have to be smart,\" Day said on ESPN's \"College GameDay\" Saturday morning. \"But also, we're going to play our game.\n\n\"We have to be cognizant of how the wind's blowing. It looks like it's blowing north here. We'll have the wind one of the quarters and then going against it the other quarter. We'll adjust, but we're also going to run our offense.\n\nOhio State has dominated its recent history against Northwestern\n\nOhio State hasn’t had much trouble with Northwestern recently.\n\nSince 1972, the Buckeyes have only lost once against the Wildcats: a 33-27 loss in Evanston, Illinois in 2004. After the loss, Ohio State has won each of its last nine games against Northwestern by a combined score of 388-121, allowing more than 24 points only once.\n\nDuring Ohio State’s nine-game win streak against Northwestern, the Buckeyes have beaten the Wildcats by an average of 29.7 points per game.\n\nOhio State also leads the overall season series 64-14-1, which started with a 58-0 Buckeye victory in 1913.\n\nOhio State comes in as massive favorite against Northwestern\n\nOhio State will come into Ryan Field Saturday as a massive favorite against Northwestern.\n\nThe Buckeyes are 37.5-point favorites against the Wildcats according to Tipico Sportsbook, with an over/under line of 55.5 points.\n\nOhio State is a 38-point favorite on Draft Kings Sportsbook, while coming in as 38.5-point favorites against Northwestern on FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nWhile Ohio State has won each of its eight games in 2022, the Buckeyes are 4-3-1 against the spread this season, while Northwestern, with only one win, has covered three of its eight matchups this season.\n\nOhio State to be without TreVeyon Henderson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba vs. Northwestern\n\nOhio State will be without two of its main offensive weapons Saturday afternoon against Northwestern.\n\nAfter recording 78 rushing yards and two touchdowns against Penn State Oct. 29, running back TreVeyon Henderson was listed as unavailable for the Buckeyes against the Wildcats.\n\nOhio State will have Miyan Williams back Saturday afternoon, who recorded only two rushes for nine yards and a touchdown against the Nittany Lions before leaving the game at the end of the first quarter.\n\nWide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba will miss his second-straight game after playing 23 snaps against Iowa Oct. 22. Due to a lingering hamstring injury, he's been limited to five receptions for 43 yards.\n\nAccording to an interview with The Dispatch, Maada Smith-Njigba, Jaxon's father, said the best-case scenario for the wide receiver's return is against Michigan Nov. 26.\n\nOhio State will also be without wide receiver Kamryn Babb, cornerback Cameron Brown, running back T.C.

Michigan gives up just 11.7 points and 241.3 yards per game, which rank 2nd and 1st in the Football Bowl Subdivision, respectively. But it hasn't faced an offense as potent as the Buckeyes, which rank Top 10 in both total offense (492.7 yards per game, 9th in FBS) and points (46.5, tied with Tennessee for first). They're led by quarterback C.J. Stroud, a Heisman Trophy contender with 2,995 passing yards, 35 touchdowns and 4 interceptions this season.\n\nMichigan has a Heisman contender of its own in running back Blake Corum, who is third in the FBS with 1,457 rushing yards and second with 18 touchdowns. And it will be on Ohio State's new-look defense, led by first-year coordinator Jim Knowles, to bottle him up after OSU got gashed for 297 yards and five touchdowns on the ground in last year's game. That said, Corum suffered a knee injury last Saturday in Michigan's 19-17 nailbiting win over Illinois and, while he sounds confident about playing Saturday vs. OSU, coach Jim Harbaugh did not give an update Monday on his condition.\n\nMORE:Michigan football must shut down prolific Ohio State passing attack in heavyweight matchup\n\nMichigan-Ohio State predictions\n\nFree Press sports writer Tony Garcia offers his scouting report and prediction for Michigan-Ohio State on Saturday and, like many, he thinks the Buckeyes will have the edge.\n\nA few other predictions from around the web, and they're almost unanimous:\n\nColumbus Dispatch: 5 of 5 experts pick Ohio State.\n\nSports Illustrated: Ohio State 31, Michigan 27.\n\nDallas Morning News: 8 of 9 experts pick Ohio State.\n\nMinneapolis Star-Tribune: Ohio State 31, Michigan 20.\n\nAlso: ESPN's Football Power Index gives Ohio State a 71.8% chance of winning Saturday's game.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/football/2022/11/18/michigan-football-schedule-2022-big-ten-wolverines-vs-ohio-state-buckeyes-football/69658242007/", "title": "Michigan football hosts Illinois before finale vs. Ohio State", "text": "Michigan football has a lot on the line in the final two weeks of the 2022 season.\n\nThe Wolverines are one of four undefeated teams left in FBS along with Georgia, TCU and Ohio State, which Michigan will face in Columbus Nov. 26.\n\nOhio State football news:Sign up for the Ohio State Sports Insider text group with Dispatch reporters\n\nHow to watch OSU play Maryland:What channel is the Ohio State football game on vs. Maryland?

Here are five things to remember about the 2011 game.\n\nIt was Brady Hoke and Luke Fickell's first Ohio State-Michigan game\n\nFickell, and former OSU player, was the interim head coach of the Buckeyes and he went 6-7 in 2011. He had been Jim Tressel's defensive coordinator from 2005-2010 and after serving as head coach he returned to that job before becoming the University of Cincinnati head coach in 2017.\n\nHoke was hired to replace Rich Rodriguez, who lasted just three seasons, and came from San Diego State (where Hoke is once again coaching in 2021).\n\nMichigan's Denard Robinson had himself a football game\n\nRobinson maybe most remembered for being the last NCAA College Football video game cover athlete, but he was spectacular against the Buckeyes in 2011.\n\nRobinson rushed for 170 yards and two touchdowns on 26 carries and added three more touchdowns through the air. He was 14-of-17 passing for 167 yards.\n\nA junior in 2011, Robinson would go on to be one of the productive players in Michigan history and was voted by fans to be on the cover of the popular video game. While EA Sports announced they are bringing the game back, Robinson remains the last player to be on the cover.\n\nBraxton Miller wasn't bad either for Ohio State\n\nMiller, then a freshman, threw an interception in the game but overall was solid. He finished with 235 yards passing with two touchdowns and 100 yards rushing on 16 carries.\n\nAs a sophomore under new coach Urban Meyer in 2012, Miller led OSU to an undefeated season.\n\nHe was expected to be the starting quarterback of the 2014 team until an injury in the preseason cost him his season. After redshirting, he returned in 2015 as a wide receiver as J.T. Barrett continued as the starter.\n\nOnly 3 future NFL first round picks played in the game\n\nRyan Shazier, Bradley Roby and Taylor Lewan were on Ohio State and Michigan rosters in 2011.\n\nLewan, the Michigan starting left tackle, was taken 11th in 2014 by the Tennessee Titans.\n\nOhio State linebacker Shazier was the 15th pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers, while Roby, an OSU defensive back, was the 31st pick by the Denver Broncos.\n\nNo one from Ohio State or Michigan were taken in the first round of the 2012 or 2013 drafts.\n\nOhio State led Michigan at halftime 24-23\n\nThe Buckeyes trailed 16-7 after the first quarter but took a 24-23 lead into the half.\n\nRobinson connected with Martavious Odoms for 20-yards in the third quarter to give Michigan the lead and the two teams both scored 10 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nDan Herron's 4-yard touchdown cut Michigan's fourth quarter lead to 37-34, but the wolverines scored a Brendan Gibbons 43-yard field goal with 1:59 to make the game 40-34.\n\nGet more Ohio State football news by listening to our podcasts", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/football/2022/11/12/ohio-state-football-score-vs-indiana-live-osu-buckeyes-newsupdates/69624110007/", "title": "Ohio State football score vs. Indiana: OSU updates", "text": "The Ohio State football team begins the final three-week stretch of the regular season with a game against Indiana at Ohio Stadium at noon today in Columbus.\n\nThe No. 2-ranked Buckeyes (9-0 overall, 6-0 in Big Ten) are inching closer to a Big Ten Championship game appearance with only the Hoosiers, Maryland and No. 3 Michigan in the way.

He was a four-star recruit out of Christian Brothers High School in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nEntering today's game, he was OSU's third-leading rusher with 54 carries for 255 yards and a touchdown. His longest run this season came in Week 2 against Toledo. It was a 45-yarder.\n\nWho will be Ohio State's running back with Miyan Williams out?\n\nMiyan Williams had to be carted off after he was unable to put any weight on his right leg. TreVeyon Henderson is not playing today and is wearing a walking boot. Chip Trayanum, who moved from linebacker to running back to give OSU depth at the position was hurt in practice Thursday, according to WBNS radio. He's unable to play today. TC Caffey has suffered a season-ending injury. So who does that leave for OSU?\n\nFreshman Dallan Hayden recorded 5 carries for 26 yards and a touchdown in the first half against Indiana. Receiver Xavier Johnson has played multiple positions over the course of his career, including running back. Although officially listed as a tight end, Mitch Rossi has played a fullback-type role for OSU.\n\nIn any case, it's clear OSU is running out of options there.\n\nOhio State halftime stats, score\n\nSTAT Indiana Ohio State Points 7 28 Total Yds 147 377 Pass Yds 100 187 Rush Yds 47 190 Penalties 0-0 0-0 1st Downs 6 14 3rd Downs 2-9 5-9 4th Downs 0-0 0-1 Total Plays 33 41 Avg Yds/Play 4.5 9.2 Avg Yds/Completion 12.5 20.8 Avg Yds/Rush 2.6 7.9 Sack-Adj Rush Yd(Avg) 60 (3.8) 190 (7.9) Red Zone 1-1 2-3 Time of Poss 13:09 16:51 Turnovers (Def Pts Off) 0 (0) 0 (0) Fumbles-Lost 1-0 0-0 Sacks (Def Yds) 0 (0) 2 (13) TFL (Def Yds) 4 (6) 5 (18)\n\nOhio State's Miyan Williams hurts right foot or ankle\n\nOSU's Miyan Williams had 147 yards on 15 carries and one touchdown before appearing to hurt his foot or ankle. The Buckeyes' athletic trainers had to help Williams, who could not put any weight on his right leg, off the field. He was eventually carted into the locker room.\n\nOSU's Miyan Williams charges for another long run | Score: Ohio State 28, Indiana 7\n\nMiyan Williams has two runs of 30-plus yards already with almost 11 minutes until halftime. His latest breakaway went 48 yards for a score. Luke Wypler, Matt Jones did a nice job opening a hole for Williams, who has already rushed for 128.\n\nDexter Williams II sparks Hoosiers | Score: Ohio State 21, Indiana 7\n\nIn an effort to get their offense going, Indiana made a switch at quarterback, and Dexter Williams II has gone 2 for 3 for 56 yards.\n\nThat includes a 7-yard touchdown throw to A.J. Barner, who used his 6-6 frame to catch a pass over OSU's Cameron Brown.\n\nMaking an impression:Marvin Harrison Jr. 'the best non-quarterback I've covered in my career' says Joel Klatt\n\nMarvin Harrison latest OSU player to find the end zone | Score: Ohio State 21, Indiana 0\n\nIndiana is averaging 41 yards a punt, and OSU has benefitted with decent field position. On their most recent drive, the Buckeyes only needed one 58-yard pass from C.J. Stroud to Marvin Harrison in order to score.\n\nThe snow is falling a bit thick right now, and the lights are on at Ohio Stadium.\n\nOhio State uses multiple rushers to get run game going | Score: Ohio State 14, Indiana 0\n\nOhio State has had four different players carry the ball already today. Miyan Williams is, unsurprisingly, leading the way with seven attempts for 72 yards.\n\nBut whoever has been getting the ball has been seeing some open lanes thanks to the offensive line. On this latest score, Donovan Jackson did a nice job sealing the edge, and Dallan Hayden was able to go 14 yards into the end zone untouched.\n\nOSU's C.J. Stroud finds Emeka Egbuka to open the scoring | Score: Ohio State 7, Indiana 0\n\nOn Ohio State's second drive, the Buckeyes marched down the field in six plays – one of which was a 32-yard Miyan Williams run helped along by a nice block from Josh Fryar. Marvin Harrison also had an 18-yard run on a reverse.\n\nOSU eventually made it into the end zone when C.J. Stroud connected on 6-yard touchdown pass to Emeka Egbuka.\n\nJosh Fryar starts for Ohio State\n\nAlthough Dawand Jones was able to warm up with OSU's first-team offensive line, he was hurting to the point that when the game kicked off, Josh Fryer was in to get his first collegiate start.\n\nThe Buckeyes went three-and-out on their initial drive.\n\nWho are the officials for the Ohio State, Indiana game?\n\nReferee: Larry Smith Umpire: Tim Gover Linesman: Michael Maisner Line Judge: Marcus Allen Back Judge: Kevin Schwarzel Field Judge: Matt Kukar Side Judge: John Hayes Center Judge: Mike Stumberg\n\nWhen do the other College Football Playoff teams play Saturday?\n\nEach of the three other teams in the top four of the College Football Playoff’s most recent rankings will be in action Saturday along with No. 2 Ohio State.\n\nNo. 1 Georgia is off to Starkville, Mississippi for a prime-time meeting with Mississippi State on ESPN, while No. 3 Michigan is set to host Nebraska at 3:30 p.m. on ABC. No. 4 TCU will travel to Austin to take on No. 18 Texas at 7:30 p.m. on ABC for the Horned Frogs’ fourth ranked matchup.\n\nOhio State RB TreVeyon Henderson seen in walking boot on left foot\n\nTreVeyon Henderson has not played since Ohio State's win against Penn State, and he was listed as unavailable for the Buckeyes ahead of their matchup with Indiana.\n\nThe sophomore running back was seen ahead of Ohio State vs. Indiana with a walking boot on his left foot.\n\nIn seven games, Henderson is averaging 5.8 yards per carry, recording 552 rushing yards and six touchdowns on 96 carries.\n\nOhio State football comes in with a dominant history vs. Indiana\n\nIndiana will come to Columbus Saturday looking for its first win against Ohio State in 34 years.\n\nThe Hoosiers’ last win against the Buckeyes came in 1988, the second of two-straight Indiana victories that stopped a 23-game win streak that started in 1960.\n\nStarting with a 35-31 win in 1989, Ohio State has won 28 of its last 29 meetings with Indiana, stopped only by a 27-27 tie in 1990.\n\nChip Trayanum not in uniform ahead of Ohio State vs. Indiana\n\nChip Trayanum was listed as one of three Ohio State players listed as game-time decisions ahead of the Buckeyes' matchup with Indiana, along with offensive linemen Dawand Jones and Toby Wilson.\n\nDuring warmups, Trayanum was not in uniform, leaving Miyan Williams and Dallan Hayden as the only scholarship running backs available for the Buckeyes against the Hoosiers.\n\nDesmond Howard: 'If (Ohio State plays) a team with a pulse, they struggle.'\n\nOhio State vs. Indiana has the attention of ESPN's \"College GameDay.\" But former Michigan Wolverines wide receiver and Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard needs to see more from the Buckeyes.\n\n\"They are blowing out inferior opponents,\" Howard said. \"If they play a team with a pulse, they struggle.\"\n\nESPN analyst and former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit said he feels Ohio State should beat Indiana handily. However, he said a big win is more about momentum heading into the final game of the Buckeyes' regular season.\n\n\"To me, it's more about building to the Michigan game,\" Herbstreit said. \"It's about trying to get their train back on the track because the last three weeks haven't been there.\"\n\nOhio State right tackle Dawand Jones goes through first round of warmups\n\nDawand Jones may be a game-time decision, but he is out on the field warming up prior to Ohio State vs. Indiana.\n\nThe Buckeyes' starting right tackle took the field with the rest of the offensive line to go through the first round of pre-game warmups.\n\nJones is a game-time decision along with offensive lineman Toby Wilson and running back Chip Trayanum.\n\nWhich NFL teams are at Ohio Stadium for Ohio State vs. Indiana?\n\nMultiple NFL teams will be in Ohio Stadium's press box Saturday for Ohio State vs. Indiana.\n\nRepresentatives from the Los Angeles Rams, Tennessee Titans, Baltimore Ravens and Atlanta Falcons will attend the Buckeyes' matchup against the Hoosiers.\n\nTwo representatives from the Citrus Bowl are also in attendance.\n\nOhio State to face cold weather vs. Indiana\n\nAfter playing in rain and wind gusts up to 49 mph at Ryan Field during its 21-7 win against Northwestern, Ohio State is set to face cold temperatures at Ohio Stadium when Indiana comes to town.\n\nAccording to Weather.com, it will be 38 degrees with a 93% chance of snow at noon for Ohio State’s kickoff vs. Indiana. However, Columbus will only see 7 mph winds at the game’s start.\n\nWhat Ohio State’s spread against Indiana?\n\nOhio State comes in as a significant favorite against Indiana Saturday afternoon.\n\nAfter beating Northwestern by 14 last week, the Buckeyes are 40.5-point favorites against the Hoosiers Saturday afternoon with the over/under set at 61.5.\n\nWhile Ohio State remains undefeated through nine games, the Buckeyes have only covered the spread in four games this season, coming into the matchup with the Hoosiers with a 4-4-1 record against the spread.\n\nIndiana’s record against the spread is the same as its overall record, sitting at 3-6.\n\nTreVeyon Henderson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba out, Dawand Jones game-time decision for Ohio State vs. Indiana\n\nRunning back TreVeyon Henderson and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba were two of 11 players listed as unavailable on Ohio State's availability report released Saturday prior to its matchup with Indiana.\n\nRight tackle Dawand Jones is also listed as a game-time decision, along with offensive lineman Toby Wilson and running back Chip Trayanum.\n\nCornerback Cameron Brown is not listed on Ohio State's injury report for the first time since the Michigan State game, along with cornerback Jordan Hancock and wide receiver Kamryn Babb.\n\nHenderson has not played since logging 79 rushing yards and two touchdowns in Ohio State's 44-31 win at Penn State Oct. 29.\n\nSmith-Njigba has missed the majority of 2022 with an injured hamstring, recording five catches for 43 yards in three games.\n\nOhio State will also be without running back T.C.

Stroud said. “We’ve been licking our wounds for 365 days. We’re hearing all the laughing, everything people have been saying.”\n\nNot only did the 42-27 loss at Michigan cost the Buckeyes a shot at a Big Ten championship and berth in the College Football Playoff, but it was also devastating for a program unaccustomed to the feeling of defeat in the rivalry. A decade had passed since their last loss to the Wolverines.\n\n“Everybody took it a lot personal from the coaches to the players to the EQ guys,” defensive end Zach Harrison said.\n\nNow their shot at revenge comes this weekend.\n\nWeek 13: Ohio State (11-0) vs. Michigan (11-0)\n\nSaturday, noon, FOX, 97.1 FM/1460 AM\n\nPoll position\n\nWith Ohio State at No. 2 and Michigan at No. 3 in this week’s Associated Press poll, it sets up a top-five matchup between the teams for only the 12th time in history of The Game and the first time since 2016.\n\nOhio State vs. Michigan point spread\n\nThe Buckeyes opened as eight-point favorites. It’s the fourth straight season that they have been favored over Michigan, including in 2020 before the game was canceled due to a COVID-19 outbreak within the Wolverines’ program. The last time Ohio State was an underdog against Michigan was in 2018.\n\nMichigan’s last game\n\nLike the rest of the playoff contenders last weekend, Michigan got an upset scare, holding off Illinois in a 19-17 win. A 35-yard field goal by Jake Moody with nine seconds left put the Wolverines in front of the Illini. But the real scare came late in the first half when star running back Blake Corum went down with a knee injury, leaving his status up in the air for Saturday’s game.\n\nMichigan’s strength\n\nMuch like last season, the Wolverines are built to win at the line of scrimmage. They rank fourth in the Football Bowl Subdivision in rush offense, gaining an average of 243.8 yards per game on the ground, and second in rush defense, giving up only 79.6 yards per game. Illinois running back Chase Brown, the nation’s third-leading rusher, is the only back who has rushed for more than 100 yards against them this fall.\n\nMichigan’s weakness\n\nJ.J. McCarthy’s five-star pedigree, offering a certain level of talent, made it enticing for Jim Harbaugh to settle on him as the starting quarterback over Cade McNamara. But McCarthy also has limitations. He’s only completed 50% of his passes the last three weeks and is unlikely to take the shots down the field that stress a secondary. Over half the Big Ten starting quarterbacks have completed more passes of 20-plus yards than McCarthy.\n\nMichigan’s player to watch\n\nThe face of Michigan’s pass rush is end Mike Morris, who has replaced Aiden Hutchinson as the star along the defensive line. His 7.5 sacks rank second in the Big Ten. But he was banged up against Nebraska and missed last weekend’s game against Illinois. It was clear the Wolverines missed him as they went without a sack for only the second game this season. They’ll need him against the Buckeyes.\n\nMichigan’s X-factor\n\nThe run-heavy approach by Michigan means it can chew clock, ranking third in the FBS in time of possession. For an average of 35 minutes per game, the Wolverines have their offense on the field. That ball control could do a lot to keep the Buckeyes’ offense off the field. Ohio State’s improved third-down defense will be tested.\n\nOhio State-Michigan series history\n\nThe Buckeyes’ loss last season ended an eight-game winning streak in the rivalry, part of a stretch of dominance that had seen them go 17-2 against Michigan since 2001. Ohio State has not lost consecutive games to the Wolverines since the end of the John Cooper era in 1999 and 2000.\n\nJoey Kaufman covers Ohio State football for The Columbus Dispatch.

Ohio State was a 29-point favorite against Iowa. The spread is about half that this week and is the slimmest point spread the Buckeyes have had all year at just 15.5 points, according to Tipico.\n\nSo the smart people in Las Vegas have their picks, but what about the experts at the Columbus Dispatch and the York Daily Record? Here's how they see the game:\n\nBill Rabinowitz\n\nOhio State beat writer\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch\n\nOhio State 38, Penn State 24\n\nThe Buckeyes are likely to be tested for the first time since the season opener. Penn State's secondary is quite good and might be able to slow Ohio State's passing game if the Nittany Lions can get some pressure on C.J. Stroud. The Buckeyes will look to get their ground game going against a Penn State defense that was exposed by Michigan a couple of weeks ago. Penn State's offense has playmakers, but they're young. Can QB Sean Clifford make enough plays to help pull off an upset? Seems doubtful.\n\nOhio State football predictions:Predictions: Our experts guess what Ohio State football will accomplish in 2022\n\nTreVeyon Henderson:'He was a pro's pro at 16 years old.' How TreVeyon Henderson pushes himself to be better\n\nJoey Kaufman\n\nOhio State beat writer\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch\n\nOhio State 38, Penn State 21\n\nThe tenor of this East Division series has been consistent for half a decade. Penn State, with one of the more talented rosters in the Big Ten, is constructed to keep within striking distance, especially in a favorable home environment in Happy Valley. None of Ohio State’s past five wins over the Nittany Lions has been by more than 13 points. A blowout of another conference opponent is therefore less likely for the Buckeyes this weekend, but it’s difficult to imagine Penn State scoring enough to pull off the upset.\n\nOhio State ranking:Big Ten Power Rankings: Ohio State moves past Michigan into top spot after defeating Iowa\n\nOhio State football:An Eddie George photo worth 61 yards: The story of the image that Notre Dame won't forget\n\nRob Oller\n\nSports columnist\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch\n\nOhio State 43, Penn State 21\n\nHappy Valley more resembles a sad trench after the Buckeyes break out their offensive arsenal against the Nittany Lions, who show more fight than previous OSU opponents but simply don't have the depth of talent to hang tough long enough to pull the upset. Beaver Stadium is a bear of a venue during Whiteouts, but this is a noon kickoff, the first between these two in State College since 2001, so the crowd won't be as much of a factor. A solid test for Ohio State heading into November.\n\nOhio State Buckeyes:Ex-OSU football player Nate Ebner pens book, says, 'I'm just a hard person to break'\n\nC.J. Stroud:Amid loss and family heartbreak, Ohio State QB C.J. Stroud matures into model leader\n\nColin Gay\n\nReal-time reporter\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch\n\nOhio State 38, Penn State 21\n\nPenn State seemed to keep up with Michigan until it lost its momentum, allowing 25 points, while mustering only a field goal in the second half. Allowing four touchdowns and 563 yards of offense to the No. 19 offense in the country, Penn State now has to contend with Ohio State's No. 4 offense in the country, which leads college football with 7.77 yards per play. While Penn State's strength on defense is its secondary, Ohio State has the pieces to move the ball in the ground game with Miyan Williams and TreVeyon Henderson. And even if Penn State's offense puts up points against a Buckeye defense that allows 4.21 yards per play, expect the Nittany Lions to run out of gas again, even in a hostile road environment.\n\nOhio State recruiting:How OL Ian Moore developed into Ohio State football's second 2024 commit\n\nMeet the Buckeyes:Ohio State's Enokk Vimahi seeks to inspire more Hawaiians to play football\n\nFrank Bodani\n\nPenn State beat writer\n\nYork Daily Record\n\nOhio State 31, Penn State 20\n\nPenn State's defense, including a stellar secondary, can't be expected to win this game. It will help it hang in, but the bigger responsibility will be on Sean Clifford and the offense. Rejuvenated and diversified, this group does just enough to stay within striking distance through three quarters. But that's it. Nothing more against the most balanced, if not most talented team in the nation.\n\nPenn State vs. Ohio State:Big Ten moments to make a Nittany Lion fan smile\n\nPenn State football:The best Penn State personality?

The rivalry never goes away, even last year when a COVID-19 outbreak among the Wolverines caused the teams not to play for the first time since 1917.\n\nBut now The Game is back, and much more is at stake beyond the bragging rights that always suffice. After its early loss to Oregon, Ohio State has won nine straight, culminating in a 56-7 annihilation of No. 7 Michigan State last week.\n\nIn the summer at Big Ten media days, Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said his team would beat Ohio State and win the Big Ten “or die trying.” Back then, not much was expected of the Wolverines. But they are also 10-1, the only loss against the Spartans after blowing a 16-point second-half lead.\n\nThe winner Saturday in Ann Arbor will advance to the Big Ten championship game. Ohio State has won the last four conference titles. Michigan has never been to Indianapolis.\n\nFollow every game: Live NCAA College Football Scores\n\nThe Big Ten is only a stepping stone to the College Football Playoff.

In a hall at the Woody Hayes Athletic Center, video of the epic ’16 game, famous for the controversial first-down call on J.T. Barrett’s second-overtime keeper, replayed continuously.\n\n“I just remember thinking to myself, ‘I just want to be a part of this,’ because it meant so much to so many people,” Day said.\n\nDay grew up in New Hampshire, but he fully embraces the rivalry as much as his predecessor and native Ohioan, Urban Meyer.\n\n“We work it year-round,” Day said. “Every day we work it. We work it in the offseason. We work it on Fridays in the weight room. We have our sessions in the preseason and spring. We have meetings about it.\n\n“We just constantly talk about it. And we talk about it in recruiting. The No. 1 goal here at Ohio State is to beat the Team Up North, period.”\n\nThe Buckeyes have dominated the rivalry this century, not losing since 2011. But few current players have participated in a victory over the Wolverines.\n\nSeventy-five players on OSU’s roster are freshmen or sophomores. They’ve never even suited up for a Michigan game. Offensive lineman Thayer Munford and wide receiver Chris Olave are the only current Buckeyes who started in OSU’s 56-27 victory in 2019.\n\nJunior defensive end Zach Harrison said the newcomers to the rivalry understand its importance.\n\n“They know,” he said. “The second you walk into the building, you know how big this game is. We train for it every single day of the offseason. Every single day of the year, we've got this game in the back of my mind. Now that it's finally here, the guys who haven't played in the game, they're excited. They get a chance to play the Team Up North.”\n\nDay acknowledged that the pressure of the rivalry can be overwhelming if not handled properly. But that’s what makes this rivalry, and this game in particular, so special.\n\n“There is a lot of pressure, and that's the way you want it,” Day said. “You want this game with everything riding on it. At their place, it's going to be a wild environment. That’s why you come to Ohio State.”\n\nBill Rabinowitz covers Ohio State football for The Columbus Dispatch.

Stroud saw on interception into quadruple coverage against Rutgers\n\nOhio State Buckeyes:Sons of former Ohio State football star Stanley Jackson following in his footsteps\n\nOhio State, meanwhile, has crushed its first two conference opponents this season, beating Wisconsin 52-21 and Rutgers 49-10. The Buckeyes have scored at least 45 points in every game since their 21-10 win over Notre Dame in Week 1.\n\nHow can Ohio State keep the momentum going? Here are three keys for No. 3 Ohio State against Michigan State on Saturday:\n\nHandle road environment\n\nThe Buckeyes have nearly reached the midpoint of their regular-season schedule without having to venture beyond the Horseshoe. It’s made for a favorable stretch for a team managing injuries among key starters. But the lengthy homestand to begin this fall has also left them without any road tests or chances to test their mettle in hostile environments. Spartan Stadium will likely feature large swaths of visiting Ohio State fans, but leaving their friendly confines still presents a challenge.\n\nMSU Football:Michigan State football star Jayden Reed slowed by bruises, cuts, dating back to preseason\n\nAir it out\n\nIn 17 starts behind center for the Buckeyes, C.J. Stroud has twice thrown for six touchdowns in a game. The first came in November when he picked apart the back end of the Spartans’ defense, throwing for 432 yards and a half-dozen scores. Things aren’t much improved from last year, when Michigan State ranked last in the Football Bowl Subdivision in pass defense. Through five weeks, it ranks 115th out of 131 teams, and on its recent three-game losing skid, it’s given up 326 yards per game. The conditions favor Stroud and the Buckeyes’ receiving corps, even without Jaxon Smith-Njigba, taking advantage.\n\nLimit big plays\n\nOhio State’s defense has been susceptible to big plays, though it’s shown recent improvement. In each of the first three games, the Buckeyes surrendered passes of at least 50 yards. The recent trend will need to continue as Michigan State will push it downfield. Payton Thorne has attempted 26 deep passes this season, as defined as 20 yards or more by Pro Football Focus. Among Big Ten quarterbacks, only Indiana’s Connor Bazelak has thrown more of them this season.\n\nDenzel Burke:Despite struggles, Ohio State football Buckeyes praise cornerback Denzel Burke's grit\n\nKey matchup\n\nOhio State cornerback Denzel Burke vs. Michigan State wide receiver Jayden Reed\n\nIn last season’s meeting, Burke contained Reed, the Spartans’ reigning All-American receiver. Reed caught two passes for 28 yards with only one reception coming while he was covered by the Buckeyes’ top corner. It was then routine for Burke, who as a freshman also held other Big Ten receivers, including Purdue’s David Bell and Penn State’s Jahan Dotson, in check.

Tuimoloau continues his remarkable day | Score: Ohio State 44, Penn State 24\n\nJ.T. Tuimoloau was already having a career day, and he just added to it. People will probably talk about this one for a while. He jumped up, snagged a Sean Clifford pass out of the air and ran it back for a touchdown.\n\nTreVeyon Henderson rushes for another TD | Score: Ohio State 37, Penn State 24\n\nMitch Rossi set a vicious block to allow TreVeyon Henderson to waltz into the end zone for a seven-yard score and his second touchdown of the day. The TD was set up by 42-yard catch by Emeka Egbuka.\n\nKaytron Allen helps set up Nittany Lions FG | Score: Ohio State 30, Penn State 24\n\nRushing for 27 yards to start Penn State's most recent drive Kaytron Allen gave his team a boost, but OSU's defense finally buckled down to hold the Nittany Lions to a 44-yard field goal.\n\nOSU's C.J. Stroud connects with Cade Stover | Score: Ohio State 30, Penn State 21\n\nOn the play after J.T. Tuimoloau's fumble recovery, Buckeyes quarterback C.J. Stroud found Cade Stover, who plowed his way into the end zone for a 24-yard touchdown catch.\n\nJ.T. Tuimoloau helps force another Penn State turnover\n\nAlready having batted a ball that Zach Harrison intercepted and picked off a Sean Clifford pass, Ohio State's J.T. Tuimoloau again spearheaded an OSU takeaway. He forced a Clifford fumble and then grabbed the ball to give the Buckeyes a short field to work with.\n\nTuimoloau has six tackles, three tackles for loss, two sacks, a pick, a pass breakup and a forced fumble.\n\nTreVeyon Henderson rushes 41 yards for score | Score: Ohio State 23, Penn State 21\n\nAfter being bottled up most of the afternoon, on his 12th carry of the day, Ohio State running back TreVeyon Henderson found space and ran for 41 yards and a touchdown. Again, Marvin Harrison helped set up the score. His 21-yard catch started the drive.\n\nOhio State penalties lead to Penn State touchdown | Score: Penn State 21, Ohio State 16\n\nOSU's Jakailin Johnson took a pass interference call, and even more costly, Ohio State lined up over the center on an unsuccessful Penn State field goal attempt that gave the Nittany Lions another shot on fourth down. Tyler Warren then made a four-yard catch to give Penn State a first down to keep the drive alive. Eventually, Kaytron Allen would punch in into the end zone with a short run.\n\nOne of the big plays for Penn State to set up the score was a 26-yard Parker Washington catch. On the day Washington has 10 catches for 170 yards and a TD.\n\nThe Nittany Lions are outgaining Ohio State's offense 360-263.\n\nOSU's Noah Ruggles makes 40-yard field goal | Score: Ohio State 16, Penn State 14\n\nOhio State's Marvin Harrison Jr. has seven catches for 136 yards, including a 16-yard catch at the start of OSU's most recent drive that helped drive the Buckeyes into position for Noah Ruggles to make a 40-yard field goal. However, OSU couldn't make their way to the end zone, partly because Ohio State is now 2 for 10 on third down.\n\nOhio State still struggling to get the running game going, especially with Miyan Williams out\n\nOSU is averaging just 1.8 yards per carry today, a big reason that the Buckeyes are 2 for 9 on third down.\n\nOhio State running back Miyan Williams done for the day\n\nOSU running back Miyan Williams is no longer wearing pads on the Buckeyes' sideline. FOX television says his day is done due to a knee injury, and Williams has ice on his knee. However, he also appears to have a cast on his hand.\n\nOhio State, Penn State halftime stats\n\nSTAT Ohio State Penn State Total Yds 209 225 Pass Yds 179 180 Rush Yds 30 45 Penalties 3-15 2-30 1st Downs 10 10 3rd Downs 1-7 3-7 4th Downs 1-1 0-0 Total Plays 34 32 Avg Yds/Play 6.1 7 Avg Yds/Completion 11.9 15 Avg Yds/Rush 2.1 3.8 Sack-Adj Rush Yd(Avg) 43 (3.6) 45 (3.8) Red Zone 3-4 0-0 Time of Poss 18:16 11:44 Turnovers (Def Pts Off) 0 (0) 2 (7) Fumbles-Lost 1-0 0-0 Sacks (Def Yds) 0 (0) 2 (13) TFL (Def Yds) 0 (0) 5 (23)\n\nOhio State can't convert at half\n\nOSU had the ball with six seconds left until halftime and planned to take a shot at the end zone before, if still necessary, attempting a field goal. But a C.J. Stroud fumble ran out the clock.\n\nOSU's Noah Ruggles connects from 37 | Score: Penn State 14, Ohio State 13\n\nAlthough Ohio State's C.J. Stroud had passes of 23 and 9 yards on OSU's most recent drive, the Buckeyes also lost 20 yards on penalties and a pass play to TreVeyon Henderson went for minus-5 yards. So OSU had to settle for a Noah Ruggles 37-yard field goal.\n\nMiyan Williams' return is questionable\n\nPer 97.1 The Fan, Miyan Williams has suffered a hand injury, which required X-rays. His return today is very much a question according to the radio broadcast.\n\nNittany Lions' Sean Clifford bouncing back from two early picks | Score: Penn State 14, Ohio State 10\n\nHe threw two early interceptions, but Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford has completed 6 of his last 7 pass attempts, and with 180 yards and two touchdowns (to Parker Washington and most recently KeAndre Lambert-Smith), has guided the Nittany Lions to the lead.\n\nMissed tackle results in Penn State touchdown | Score: Ohio State 10, Penn State 7\n\nAfter catching a Sean Clifford pass, Penn State's Parker Washington spun out of the grasp of Ohio State linebacker Tanner McCalister and eluded defensive back Jakailin Johnson to score a 58-yard touchdown. Washington has four catches for 87 yards today.\n\nOhio State's Miyan Williams hurt?\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, Ohio State running back Miyan Williams landed hard on the first-down marker and had to be tended to by OSU's athletic trainers before walking off under his own power.\n\nUPDATE: Williams has headed to the locker room.\n\nMiyan Williams bullies forward for a touchdown | Score: Ohio State 10, Penn State 0\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. caught passes of 18 and 19 yards before OSU handed the ball to Miyan Williams, who powered forward and scored. Officials didn't initially rule the play a touchdown, but the replay booth buzzed down and awarded the Buckeyes points upon review. The 4-yard score is Williams' 10th of the year.\n\nJ.T. Tuimoloau gives Ohio State the ball again\n\nWhile J.T. Tuimoloau forced a Penn State turnover on the previous drive by getting penetration, this time, he hung back, jumped a route and outmuscled a somewhat lackadaisical effort by Kaytron Allen to steal the ball. Nittany Lions quarterback Sean Clifford now has three completions and two interceptions.\n\nOhio State can't convert with short field\n\nAlthough Ohio State started their most recent drive at the Penn State 39, the Buckeyes came away without points. TreVeyon Henderson had a carry that gained no ground. C.J. Stroud had two completions for just four combined yards. And Noah Ruggles missed a 53-yard field goal attempt that was both short and right.\n\nZach Harrison steps up again\n\nOhio State has recorded an interception in six straight games. This pick ends up in the arms of Zach Harrison, who continues a stretch of strong play for the Buckeyes, but he was the beneficiary of J.T. Tuimoloau getting pressure on Sean Clifford and batting the ball up into the air.\n\nOSU takes an early lead | Score: Ohio State 3, Penn State 0\n\nBuckeyes quarterback C.J. Stroud went 4-for-5 passing on his opening drive, garnering 55 yards, But Ohio State ended up having to settle for a Noah Ruggles' 38-yard field goal, partly because TreVeyon Henderson's 3 carries only traveled 5 yards.\n\nWho are the officials for today's Ohio State, Penn State game?\n\nReferee: Jeffrey Servinski Umpire: Tim Owens Linesman: Ryan MacDonald Line Judge: Brett Bergman Back Judge: Jake Kemp Field Judge: Phil Hicks Side Judge: Todd Ransom Center Judge: Jason Nickleby\n\n'College GameDay' makes Ohio State vs. Penn State picks\n\nEach ESPN's \"College GameDay\" analyst, including guest picker Stephen A. Smith, picked Ohio State to beat Penn State. But after former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit's answer, saying it would be a close game, Smith marveled at what his colleague had to say about Penn State.\n\n\"When he knows in his heart someone is going to get blown out, he still has something nice to say,\" Smith said of Herbstreit. \"I want to be him when I grow up.\"\n\nEarlier in the show, when discussing Ohio State vs. Penn State, Herbstreit was succinct about how he thought Saturday afternoon's game would go.\n\n\"First half energy, crowd, close,\" Herbstreit said. \"Second half, too much talent.\"\n\nChris Fallica picked Ohio State, wasn't comfortable with the 15.5-point spread, while ESPN analyst and former Georgia linebacker David Pollack picked Ohio State.\n\n\"I got the Buckeyes,\" Pollack said. \"Large.\"\n\nUrban Meyer also picked the Buckeyes to win big against Penn State, beating the Nittany Lions 45-20, while Matt Leinart, Reggie Bush and Brady Quinn each have a Ohio State win. Quinn picked the Buckeyes 38-31, which would be Ohio State's first game decided by less than 10 points.\n\nJames Franklin: ‘The triggerman’ is what makes Ohio State go\n\nFor Ohio State, it all starts with quarterback C.J. Stroud, according to Penn State coach James Franklin.\n\n“At the end of the day, their triggerman is what makes them go,” Franklin said. “He’s the one that distributes the ball (to) all those different playmakers and does a great job doing it.\n\n“He’s leading the Heisman race for a reason.”\n\nStroud leads an Ohio State offense that is averaging 49.6 points and 517.4 yards per game: second- and fourth-best in college football, respectively.\n\nPenn State has the No. 20 scoring defense in the country, allowing 18.86 points per game, while allowing 373 yards per game — 63rd-best in college football — and 5.14 yards per play.\n\nBeaver Stadium to hold ‘stripe out’ for Penn State vs. Ohio State\n\nInstead of a “White Out,” Beaver Stadium will hold a “Stripe Out” when Ohio State comes to town Saturday afternoon.\n\nPenn State already held its annual “White Out” in 2022, beating Minnesota 45-17 Oct. 22, the game the Buckeyes have historically faced when they come to town. Instead, Ohio State will face a crowd coordinated in either all blue or all white depending on the section they sit in.\n\nOhio State will kick off against Penn State at noon Saturday on FOX for the Buckeyes’ first afternoon meeting against the Nittany Lions since 2009.\n\nOhio State RB Miyan Williams celebrates birthday at Penn State\n\nWhen Ohio State takes on Penn State Saturday afternoon, Miyan Williams has even more to celebrate: his birthday.\n\n\"Blessed to see another year,\" Williams tweeted Saturday morning.\n\nWilliams has a team-leading 516 rushing yards and nine touchdowns through six games, averaging 6.9 yards each time he touches the ball.\n\nOhio State remains heavy favorite on the road against Penn State\n\nEven with Ohio State going on the road for only the second time in 2022, the Buckeyes remain a distinct favorite against Penn State.\n\nOhio State heads into kickoff as a 15.5-point favorite against Penn State, coming in with a 4-2-1 record against the spread through the first seven games of the season.\n\nFanDuel and Draft Kings sportsbooks each have the Nittany Lions as 14.5-point underdogs against the Buckeyes.\n\nOhio State’s spread vs. Penn State is the closest for the Buckeyes’ this season.\n\nMarvin Harrison Sr. says Marvin Harrison Jr's Ohio State season is 'surreal'\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. is doing things for Ohio State in 2022 that his NFL Hall of Fame wide receiver father calls \"surreal.\"\n\n\"As you watch week in and week out, and his determination to play and get better, it's like he's doing everything he needs to do as long as he stays focused and keeps his head level,\" Harrison said on FOX's \"Big Noon Kickoff.\" \"Week in and week out, just forget about last week and focus on this week.\"\n\nThrough seven games, Marvin Harrison Jr. leads Ohio State with 10 touchdowns recording 598 receiving yards on 38 catches.\n\nIn his 13-year career with the Indianapolis Colts, Marvin Harrison Sr. recorded 128 touchdowns and 14,580 receiving yards on 1,102 receptions.\n\nOhio State has dominated its recent history with Penn State\n\nOhio State’s recent history with Penn State has been a bit one-sided as of late.\n\nThe Buckeyes have won nine of their last 10 meetings with the Nittany Lions, including four of their last five games at Beaver Stadium.\n\nThe Buckeyes have averaged 36.9 points in each of their wins against the Nittany Lions during this run, never scoring less than 27 points. Penn State has averaged 22.3 points in its nine losses, scoring more than 30 points only once in 2017.\n\nAfter Ohio State’s 2016 loss on the road against Penn State, the Buckeyes have won five straight against the Nittany Lions, outscoring their opponent 165-130 in those five games. Three of the last five games have been decided by less than 10 points between Ohio State and Penn State.\n\nUrban Meyer puts Buckeyes on upset alert against Penn State\n\nUrban Meyer does not have fond memories of his trip to Beaver Stadium in 2016.\n\nThe former Ohio State head football coach said on FOX's \"Big Noon Kickoff\" he remembers Penn State students outside of his players' windows at their hotel \"drinking cervezas\" and being loud ahead of the Buckeyes' matchup the next day.\n\nUrban Meyer:'The student body are absolute nut jobs.' Urban Meyer puts OSU on upset alert vs. PSU\n\n\"This stadium, I've experienced this stadium,\" Meyer said. \"This is a tough place to play. The student body are absolute nut jobs. I've seen it, it's loud. This is the first real road game Ohio State has had in quite awhile. Last time they were on the road, they were in Ann Arbor, it didn't end real well. I'm not saying Penn State will win. I'm saying it will be a street fight with a great student body.\"\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba out for Ohio State vs. Penn State\n\nOhio State wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is back on the injury list ahead of the Buckeyes' trip to Beaver Stadium.\n\nAfter returning for 22 of the team's 64 snaps against Iowa, recording one catch on seven yards, Smith-Njigba left the game with a slight limp in the second quarter after trying for a catch downfield from quarterback C.J.

Hakeem Jeffries launched his bid for House Democratic leadership on Friday, a historic move in which he would succeed speaker Nancy Pelosi after two decades of leading congressional Democrats. If chosen, Jeffries, a progressive, would become the first Black lawmaker to lead a party in Congress.\n\nHe has widespread support among Democrats, including from Pelosi as well as House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, both of whom said they will also step down from their leadership roles.\n\nA rising star in the Democratic Party, Jeffries was born in Brooklyn, New York, and studied political science at the State University of New York at Binghamton and received a master’s degree in public policy from Georgetown University. He also attended law school at New York University School of Law where he was on the law review.\n\nAfter law school, Jeffries clerked for late federal district judge Harold Baer Jr. of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, was a lawyer for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and was litigation counsel for CBS and Viacom Inc.\n\nHe started his career in politics after being elected to the New York State Assembly in 2006. In 2012, he was elected to New York’s 8th congressional district, which includes parts of Brooklyn and Queens. During his time in Congress, Jeffries has pushed for policing reform, including a national ban on chokeholds following the death of Eric Garner, a Black man who died in 2014 after being held in the restraining move. He was also instrumental in the passage of the First Step Act and co-sponsored the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that passed the House but failed in the Senate.\n\nJeffries also co-sponsored the Music Modernization Act, a bill that overhauled laws related to how songwriters are paid when their songs are licensed or played. It was signed into law in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, he became chairman of the Democratic caucus, making him the youngest member serving in leadership. Jeffries was part of a select group of lawmakers who were impeachment managers during the Senate trial of then-President Donald Trump, in which he referenced lyrics by late rapper The Notorious B.I.G. when outlining the House’s case against Trump. He has also been a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Budget Committee and Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nIn a letter announcing his leadership bid, Jeffries said he hopes to “lead an effort that centers our communication strategy around the messaging principle that values unite, issues divide.” He also praised the past leadership but said “more must be done to combat inflation, defend our democracy, secure reproductive freedom, welcome new Americans, promote equal protection under the law and improve public safety throughout this country.”", "authors": ["Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/hakeem-jeffries-next-democratic-leader/index.html", "title": "Hakeem Jeffries launches bid to be Nancy Pelosi's successor | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to succeed Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a potentially historic move to elect the first Black person to lead a party in Congress.\n\nJeffries launched his bid for House Democratic leader on Friday, promising his colleagues in a letter that he would empower and protect them — and expand their ranks.\n\n“Our top non-governmental priority, for the sake of the American people, must be retaking the majority in November 2024,” Jeffries wrote.\n\nIn a sign of Jeffries’ emerging power, Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn quickly backed him after announcing they would step down from their leadership posts.\n\nPelosi blessed the new trio of leaders expected to succeed them — Jeffries, Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Peter Aguilar — in a statement on Friday. The House Democrats’ leadership election is on November 30.\n\n“A new day is dawning — and I am confident that these new leaders will capably lead our Caucus and the Congress,” Pelosi said.\n\n“Speaker Pelosi has left an indelible mark on Congress and the country, and I look forward to her continued service and doing whatever I can to assist our new generation of Democratic leaders,” said Clyburn in a statement. And Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.”\n\nAt 52, Jeffries would represent a generational change from the current triumvirate of House Democratic leaders, who are three decades older than him. He became the chairman of the Democratic caucus in 2019, making him the youngest member serving in leadership.\n\nIn his letter Friday, Jeffries praised the past leadership but said “more must be done to combat inflation, defend our democracy, secure reproductive freedom, welcome new Americans, promote equal protection under the law and improve public safety throughout this country.”\n\nHe promised his rank-and-file colleagues that he would give them more power in the legislative process, writing “we must chart a return to regular order.” He also said that in “dangerous times,” Congress must focus on passing bills to “combat crime” for Americans and “significantly enhance the security of all Members and their families.”\n\nJeffries seems to enjoy widespread support among the House Democratic caucus.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, the Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman, told CNN that she expected the caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” Beatty said. “I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nAnd Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, a former Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, also threw his weight behind Jeffries. “Hakeem Jeffries came in my class and I’m a huge fan of Hakeem,” Pocan told CNN. “I think he’s extremely intelligent, he’s a good person to bring consensus among the caucus. I think he’ll be an outstanding Leader.”\n\nFor months, Democratic lawmakers have whispered that Pelosi’s potential exit from Congress could pave the way for Jeffries. The Brooklyn-bred attorney graduated from State University of New York at Binghamton, Georgetown and New York University Law School, before his election to the New York State Assembly in 2006. He has since served New York’s 8th District since winning his first election to Congress a decade ago. In the Trump era, Jeffries played a crucial role passing the bipartisan criminal justice overhaul bill known as the First Step Act and in arguing for the former president’s impeachment as a House manager in the first trial. He has continued to shape the party’s messaging during the Biden administration.\n\nSome House Democrats have waited a long time to turn the page on the Pelosi era. She earned the speaker’s gavel after the 2006 elections, lost it after the 2010 elections, and won it again after the 2018 elections.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN.\n\nBut whoever follows Pelosi will serve in the shadow of her legacy as one of the most powerful and polarizing figures in American politics. The Speaker was instrumental in passing the Affordable Care Act, the 2008 economic stimulus bill, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package and, most recently, a sweeping $750 billion health care and tax bill that included the largest investment in American history to address climate change.\n\nPelosi, who will continue to serve in Congress representing San Francisco, will leave her successor with a greater than expected House minority following the 2022 midterm elections. Some Democrats said they wished she would remain leader.\n\nAsked about Pelosi’s decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said, ‘Please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Daniella Diaz Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Daniella Diaz", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/18/hakeem-jeffries-bio-age-family-info/10726612002/", "title": "Meet Rep.

He is rumored to be the preferred successor to Nancy Pelosi as leader of the Democratic Caucus in the House of Representatives.\n\nJeffries, who was elected in 2013, has already been endorsed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, both of whom have also announced plans to resign.\n\nIn their relinquishing of power, Hoyer, Clyburn, and Pelosi have cleared a path for a new guard to head up the party for the second half of the Biden presidency.\n\nJeffries was recently re-elected as chairman of the Democratic Caucus, the party's No. 5 leadership position, and has been described by colleagues as competent, experienced, and respected.\n\nA brief Hakeem Jeffries bio\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries is a Brooklyn native. Raised in Crown Heights by his parents, one a social worker, and one a caseworker, Jeffries now lives in Prospect Heights with his wife Kennisandra Arciniegas Jeffries, herself a social worker, and their two sons.\n\nJeffries attended Binghamton University for undergrad, before pursuing a masters in public policy Georgetown University and then a law degree from New York University.\n\nHe worked for years as a corporate lawyer serving clients like Viacom Inc. and CBS, and then entering politics at the local level. He was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2006, then ran for national office in 2012, unseating a 30-year incumbent to win his seat representing the 8th District.\n\nWhat will a Republican House look like? A lot of investigations and maybe impeachment.\n\nWhere is Hakeem Jeffries from?\n\nRep. Jeffries is a lifelong Brooklynite. While he spent his childhood in the Crown Heights neighborhood, he now lives in Prospect Heights with his family.\n\nNow that he has secured the top spot in the House, both Democratic leaders will hail from Brooklyn. Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, also a lifelong resident of Kings County, has represented New York in the Senate since 1998.\n\nWhat are Hakeem Jeffries' views?\n\nHakeem Jeffries has been a vocal supporter of everyday costs for Americans. He was integral in helping the Democratic party to craft a campaign message around 'dollar and cents' issues ahead of the 2022 midterms.\n\nHis campaign websites lists lowering childcare and health care costs, as well as the cost of education and prescription drugs as top priorities.\n\nJeffries is also a champion of criminal justice reform, having worked on legislation aimed at correcting sentencing disparities for crack versus powder cocaine and introducing the Eric Garner Excessive Use of Force Prevention in 2015, then later again in 2021 as part of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\n\nJeffries is also a proponent of gun control measures and of women's reproductive rights, condemning along with many other congressional Democrats the overturning of Roe v. Wade earlier this year.\n\nIs Hakeem Jeffries progressive?\n\nJeffries has referred to himself as a “pragmatic progressive.\" While his core viewpoints are in line with a lot of progressive thinking, he has said he doesn't believe in sacrificing everything for a legislative wish list when it might be out of reach.\n\nHe is a member of the House Progressive Caucus, a collective of legislators which works to push forward a more progressive agenda in the legislature, and has worked throughout his career in support of various progressive causes like criminal justice reform and affordable housing.\n\nHow old is Hakeem Jeffries?\n\nHakeem Jeffries is 52 years old. Pelosi, by contrast, is 82.\n\nWere Jeffries to take on the role as party leader, he would certainly represent the shift towards a younger generation of Democratic Party leaders that Pelosi mentioned in her farewell speech.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi:Her political career in pictures\n\nWho are Hakeem Jeffries' parents?\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries was born to mother Laneda Jeffries and father Marland Jeffries.\n\nIn an interview with journalist Farah Halime, Jeffries noted that his \"public service spirit” came from his parents, both public servants themselves. His mother was a social worker while his father worked as a state substance-abuse counselor.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/politics/hakeem-jeffries-biden-reelection/index.html", "title": "Hakeem Jeffries plots return to majority for House Democrats in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSome things have changed in the two weeks since Hakeem Jeffries learned – from listening to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s speech, sitting motionless with an intentional blank expression on his face for those who were watching – that she really was going to step aside. His phone is ringing more. He’s being stopped more in the hallways of the Capitol.\n\nOn a small table in his hideaway office in the Capitol, there’s a platter of scones and a bowl of fresh raspberries as refreshments for the many guests filing in, from “squad” member Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib on Thursday evening to the law enforcement officer representatives who came in on Friday morning.\n\nSome things are the same. Jeffries is still carefully working out in advance what he wants to say at every public appearance, delivering those rehearsed comments deliberately enough that reporters’ automated transcription programs inserts extra periods they assume must be there to fill the spaces. He’s still the cautious operator who nixed calls from colleagues in a private post-midterms meeting to jump out ahead and challenge Pelosi.\n\nThe new leader of the Democrats in the House insists that he hasn’t had time to take it in, or even to reflect on making history as the first Black leader in Congress. What matters, he said, is getting his party back to the majority in 2024 – and likely then getting himself to be speaker.\n\nIn an interview with CNN – his first with a major outlet since officially being elected to the post on Wednesday – the Brooklyn-born Democrat laid out his plan to get there, starting with hoping the president runs for reelection, in part, Jeffries said, because that would be better than an open field for Democrats trying to win against Republicans in swing districts that Joe Biden carried in 2020. He wants to pre-empt, or at least absorb, the complaints from the party’s left flank, which has expanded its footprint among House Democrats and has been suspicious of him, despite the unanimous vote he received.\n\nAnd ripping into both House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Jeffries said he’s also counting on Republicans being unable to distance themselves from extremism to make the case for them.\n\n“It’s incredible to me that even at this point in time, as they’re on their way temporarily into the majority, they have not articulated a vision for addressing the economic concerns of the American people,” Jeffries said of Republicans. “It’s because there’s a real risk that the incoming Republican majority is being hijacked by the extremists who have grown in ranks.”\n\nThe outgoing House Democratic leadership team are all in their 80s. The three members of Jeffries’ closely aligned, constantly coordinating leadership team of incoming Minority Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and incoming Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California are so new that none were in Congress when Barack Obama was first elected. There’s a sincere buzz among many Democratic members and their aides about what the new order means. It’s coupled, though, with the silver lining of being in the minority: Jeffries will have time to learn a job that over the years some have come to believe only Pelosi could handle.\n\nThe concerns aren’t just about Jeffries’ ability to count votes. Members and Democratic operatives point to his lack of an extensive fundraising network, or of a political team with much experience outside of Brooklyn.\n\nWhat he does have is two years’ worth of taking swings at Republicans at weekly news conferences, often at McCarthy – whom he tends to call just “Kevin” and insists he’s been “pretty gentle” on despite all the whacks he’s taken.\n\nAsked whether he believes there is common ground to be found with McCarthy, who’s trying to hold off an internal revolt to be elected the new speaker, Jeffries demurred.\n\nAsked to describe what he thinks of McCarthy, Jeffries said only, “We serve in Congress together,” and stopped talking. Asked if he respects McCarthy, Jeffries said, “I respect the fact that he is the current House Republican leader, and depending on what happens on January 3, may be the next Republican speaker.”\n\nOn Thursday, McConnell used part of a speech on the Senate floor to rip into Jeffries for being “a past election denier” because he called the 2016 election “quote, ‘illegitimate,’ and suggested that we had a quote ‘fake president,’” which a McConnell aide said was just his way of laying down a marker.\n\nJeffries called McConnell’s speech “unfortunate” but part of what he said is a familiar pattern of Republican attacks.\n\n“If McConnell wants to lean into the fact that I’ve been critical of [Donald] Trump’s presidency – the overwhelming majority of the world is critical of Trump’s presidency,” Jeffries said. “That didn’t seem to make a lot of sense to me. But he’ll do what he does, and I want to stay focused on fighting for the people.”\n\nJeffries offered one suggestion for common ground: restoring the enhanced child tax credit, which provided families with several hundred dollars per month for six months before expiring at the end of 2021. Some Democrats, most notably West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, opposed keeping it at the original levels.\n\nBut Jeffries said he’s ready to highlight the difference between that money, which had a transformative effect on child poverty and which boosted the middle class, and what he refers to as the “GOP tax scam” of the 2017 Republican tax cuts signed by Trump.\n\nThe enhanced child tax credit passed initially as part of the Covid-era American Rescue Plan in the spring of 2021, without a single Republican vote in the House or Senate. The luxury of being in the minority, though, is being able to criticize and contrast without having to work out actual deals that his own members have to agree to.\n\n“The job of the minority leader is to become the speaker,” said Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss, who quickly joined Jeffries’ advisory team as a freshman member. “There’s widespread agreement in the caucus that we’ve got a formula here for 2024: We’ve got to hang together, we’ve got to allow the GOP to audition for two years to the American people.”\n\nA massive public shift for a committed introvert\n\nJeffries was in diapers when Biden was first elected to the Senate and in grade school when Chuck Schumer was first elected to the House, and he began his first term in the New York State Assembly the same year Pelosi first won as speaker.\n\nBut as pointed out by many in a caucus where even millennials are starting to rack up seniority, it’s less a question of age than of life experience and sensibility. Jeffries was a teenager in Brooklyn during the crack epidemic. By the time he first arrived in Washington, Twitter had already ended a few politicians’ careers. His two public employee parents named him Hakeem and his brother Hasan, but he came of age and into politics thinking more about tackling systemic racism than marching in the civil rights movement.\n\nThe younger brother grew up to be a noted professor of Black history. Jeffries is now the highest-ranking Black politician ever in America, other than Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris, in a building with a foundation laid by slaves. The head of the most diverse leadership team in the history of Congress, Jeffries stepped in when an African dance troupe invited him to join them at a Juneteenth celebration back home last summer. He is a regular at services at the Cornerstone Baptist Church back home.\n\nYet in a conversation the night before his unanimous election last week, the intensely private congressman repeatedly insisted to several skeptical reporters that he really hadn’t spent much time thinking about making history. He’d been too busy nailing down votes, dealing with lame-duck session priorities and preparing to move into the minority.\n\nAsked whether in the new role he would prioritize some of the criminal justice reform efforts that have been a cause since he was a state legislator, Jeffries spoke about a focus on rebuilding economic access to the American dream, whether that meant addressing the drop in unionization or the rise in automation.\n\nPeople can misread Jeffries’s heart because of his style, said Rev. Al Sharpton, who has known the congressman for two decades and called his election as House minority leader “an embodiment of the dream of Black political power we’ve had second only to the president of the United States.”\n\n“He is an activist, but he has always said, ‘I’m the guy to go inside the room – I’m not the guy to go to jail and be handcuffed,’” Sharpton said. “But we can trust him in the room. His ambition never outran his agenda.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who, in 2020, won a primary from the left against a longtime incumbent New Yorker whom Jeffries had endorsed, said he’s excited to have the new perspective at the helm. He downplayed progressive complaints from the past.\n\n“For the most part, he believes what I believe,” Bowman said. “So now it’s a question of how to make that work.”\n\nSome hope his elevation means a higher priority on urban issues, but Jeffries has been pushing to think in terms of what it takes to win enough seats to govern.\n\n“We have to show up in unexpected places, show up early, engage in authentic conversations and then deliver results,” he said, pledging to do some of that showing-up personally through “on the ground conversations with Americans throughout the country – in the heartland, in Appalachia and in rural America.”\n\nFinding a place for Pelosi\n\nPelosi is such a presence that even those who were helping Jeffries prepare for her departure struggle to imagine life without her involved.\n\n“What do you do if you have a guru? You go sit down at her knee and say, ‘Here’s what’s going on, what do you think?’” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, who’s been working with Jeffries for years.\n\nIn response, a Pelosi spokesperson pointed CNN to her line from before Thanksgiving, when she said she has “no intention of being the mother-in-law in the kitchen, saying, ‘My son doesn’t like the stuffing that way. This is the way we make it.’”\n\nPelosi was serious, the spokesperson said: The caucus voted to officially designate her “speaker emerita,” but she really is planning to step back. Many of her colleagues, along with most political players back in San Francisco, believe she wants to help position her daughter, Christine, to succeed her in Congress. They speculate that may mean she’ll spend a lot of time in the district instead, building back bridges.\n\nJeffries said he is not planning on keeping the kind of international schedule Pelosi did, especially in recent years, when she would pop over to Europe or Asia on weekends. He acknowledges that he doesn’t have anything like Pelosi’s depth of friendship with Biden, which has made her someone the president has often relied on.\n\nJeffries has talked about having a more open leadership style. Democrats in the House rave about how every time they’re in their chamber to vote, they get checked in on by either Jeffries, Clark or Aguilar. But many still struggle to name what they think his own policy priorities are, what motivates him or how he makes decisions.\n\nAsked directly why he wanted to be leader, Jeffries said only, “I just look forward to the opportunity to do the most good for the greatest number of people possible for as long as I have the opportunity to do so and can operate at the highest level.”\n\nIn the meantime, Jeffries is still wrapping his head around his new life, which will soon involve being trailed around by an official security detail from the US Capitol Police.\n\n“I’m just taking the approach of what has to be done today, what has to be done tomorrow, what has to be done this week, what has to be done this month? And then what has to be done to be successful over the next few years?” he said, explaining that he finds that to be “the only way to approach this without suffering from high anxiety.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/30/hakeem-jeffries-house-democratic-leader/10803965002/", "title": "Hakeem Jeffries elected House Democratic leader, succeeding Pelosi", "text": "House Democrats elected New York Rep.

Hakeem Jeffries’ election to be the first Black minority leader in American history reflects the potential, possibility and power of multiracial democracy. The 52-year-old congressman representing New York’s 8th Congressional District in Brooklyn and Queens, reflects both a generational and cultural shift from retiring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose legendary tenure made her a trailblazing feminist icon and an impeccably dressed breaker of glass ceilings, unafraid of tussling in public with former President Donald Trump.\n\nPeniel E. Joseph Kelvin Ma/Tufts University/Kelvin Ma/Tufts University\n\nWhen Jeffries elucidated the case for impeaching Trump on the Senate floor in 2020, he ended by dropping a gem of a quote from the late, beloved Brooklyn-based rapper, the Notorious B.I.G. — “And if you don’t know, now you know.”\n\nThat a Generation X, hip-hop-quoting congressman has become the first Black person to lead a major party, with the potential of ascending to the speaker spot depending on the 2024 elections, is all the more remarkable considering tensions within the Democratic coalition and racial divisions with which America continues to wrestle.\n\nThe May 25, 2020, murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis surfaced long simmering issues related to Black citizenship and dignity thought to have been answered during the civil rights movement’s heroic period between the Supreme Court’s school desegregation decision on May 17, 1954, and the April 4, 1968, assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIt makes sense for the face of the Democratic minority in Congress to be Black since those voters support the party more consistently than any other demographic. Yet while Blacks voted for Democrats in the midterms at well over 80%, this support shrank 4 percentage points from the 2018 midterms, according to network exit polling.\n\nSo, while Democrats did better than expected in the midterms, thanks in large part, to a surprising robust youth turnout, support from voters of color lagged behind 2018 and 2020.\n\nAs the Democratic congressional leader, Jeffries will be a cool-headed pragmatist and supporter of liberal and progressive policies who seeks to be an effective legislator. He may be able to convince the party to display a level of attentiveness and investment in Black voters often absent in favor of outreach to white suburban constituencies. Despite these efforts, nearly 60% of White voters supported Republicans, further evidence of a stark racial divide between constituents within the two major parties.\n\nThe significance of a Black man leading House Democrats in 2023 is both symbolic and substantive. Symbolically, it represents a kind of racial progress unimaginable when the Congressional Black Caucus was founded in 1971 at the beginning of the 92nd Congress to provide community for the then-record number of 13 Black members of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe first Black congressional officials were Republicans elected during the Reconstruction era in the decade after the Civil War. Their presence offering a hopeful example of the promise of multiracial democracy. This generation of Black officials helped to institutionalize what would become contemporary Democratic Party bread and butter issues, including public education, access to health care and public investments in infrastructure that helped to rebuild a physically wrecked and morally broken America in record time.\n\nIt is one of this country’s greatest ironies that arguably its greatest generation of statesman (for women still were denied the ballot and the right to hold public office) were ultimately denied equal access to the democracy they bled for in wartime and helped resuscitate during the tumultuous peace that followed.\n\nJeffries stands on the shoulders of these 19th century leaders, as well as 20th century congressional icons such as Texas’ Barbara Jordan, who cosponsored the 1975 Voting Rights Act extension, and Shirley Chisholm, the Brooklyn representative whose 1972 presidential campaign upended many of the rules of politics.\n\nLike Jordan, Jeffries is at times viewed with suspicion by some figures on the Democratic left. They see him as too mainstream for the radical change they feel is necessary to right a ship of state still reeling from voter suppression, racial injustice, economic inequality and legislative efforts that have tried to censor truth teaching in public schools.\n\nLast year, Jeffries observed, “The extreme left is obsessed with talking trash about mainstream Democrats on Twitter, when the majority of the electorate constitute mainstream Democrats at the polls.”\n\nOn this score Jeffries has helped organize a political action committee, Team Blue, to defend Democratic incumbents against being primaried from the left, a phenomenon that helped to create the progressive “Squad” led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the eloquent and outspoken proponent of a Green New Deal whose criticism against conservative Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and moderates such as President Joe Biden, gave Pelosi fits as majority leader.\n\nJeffries’ leadership will, of course, be judged not by its symbolic merits, although considerably historic, but on substance.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe 21st century Democratic Party traverses a perilous tightrope in a political climate riven by racial, ideological and partisan divisions. These divisions not only threaten its precarious coalition but also reflect the fragility of American democracy in the aftermath of President Barack Obama’s election, the rise of Black Lives Matter, the ascent of Trump, and the political and racial reckoning of 2020 and its fallout.\n\nAmerica needs political leadership that can inspire disparate constituencies and star-crossed communities to coalesce around ideas, issues and goals that transcend party loyalty. Such leadership can help us reach into the rarified stratosphere of the kind of civic nationalism that has, in the past, led the nation to innovate the New Deal, defeat fascism during World War II, envision a Great Society and elect the first Black president.\n\nHakeem Jeffries cannot, of course, be expected to embody this leadership on his own. But it is a testament to the national character, and the grace at times embedded within it, that the voice of the first Black leader of the Democratic minority in Congress will be seated at the head of the table as we deliberate on the future of our ongoing democratic experiment.", "authors": ["Peniel E.

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/28/underwater-art-tomato-fight-lawn-mower-racing-news-around-states/39520639/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state House of Representatives has passed legislation allowing residents to purchase wine and have it shipped directly to their house. The bill by Republican Rep. Terri Collins would allow licensed wine manufacturers to obtain a permit to deliver limited quantities of wine directly to Alabamians. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board doesn’t allow such shipments now. The bill passed 77-11 and now heads to the Senate. Democratic Rep. Thomas Jackson jokingly shouted during Thursday’s debate, “What’s wrong with the wine we got now?” – a reference to former Rep. Alvin Holmes, who famously asked in a 2008 debate about allowing stronger beer: “What’s wrong with the beer we got? I mean the beer we got drank pretty good, don’t it?”\n\nAlaska\n\nAkiak: The community has quickly lost entire buildings due to erosion along the banks of its river, officials say. Residents of this southwest Alaska town awoke last week to find that smokehouses built along the Kuskokwim River had fallen into the water along with stretches of the riverbank, KYUK-AM reports. The community 42 miles northeast of Bethel lost between 75 and 100 feet of the riverbank, according to Akiak City Administrator David Gilila. “That’s just in one day; that’s just in a matter of hours,” Gilila says. Akiak has experienced erosion problems before but now faces damage to about a mile of riverbank. “There’s no comparison to it,” Gilila says. “Before, it was just certain spots. Today, it’s the whole bank from the upper end of Akiak to the lower end of it.” Houses now face possible destruction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Republican-led Legislature has proved receptive in recent years to certain proposals offered up by teenagers, passing laws to designate lemonade as the state drink and copper as the state metal. But some students who went to the Capitol this year say they got a different type of reception – if they got one at all – when they tried to pitch proposals on meatier public-policy topics. The Arizona Capitol Times reports that those topics include gun control, school safety and climate change. While GOP legislators said refusing to sponsor progressive bills doesn’t amount to disrespect, some teenage policy advocates said some lawmakers were condescending at times but gushed about the civic involvement of young people who pushed innocuous bills sponsored by Republicans.\n\nArkansas\n\nHope: The publisher of the largest newspaper in the state has said by the end of the year, the publication will no longer print or deliver daily editions and will instead distribute iPads for subscribers to access a daily digital replica. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette will still print a Sunday edition but will urge subscribers to convert to the daily digital replica, accessible via the newspaper’s app. The newspaper’s publisher, Walter Hussman, has said that if 70% of subscribers convert to the digital version, the paper will be profitable for the first time since 2017. Some subscribers who converted say they prefer the digital paper, which can be enlarged and which is easily transportable. But it remains to be seen if the program will also appeal to younger generations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAnaheim: Massive crowds are expected at Disneyland when its Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge land opens this week, but park officials have a plan to manage them – and it involves Stormtroopers. Park employees dressed as the white-armored foot soldiers may be used to encourage guests to “move along” to other parts of the theme park if they’ve overstayed a four-hour limit inside Galaxy’s Edge. The time limit will be in place from the area’s opening Friday until June 23. Reservations and a special wristband are required to visit the area at the Anaheim theme park for the first three weeks. Galaxy’s Edge is the largest single-theme land created inside a Disney park. The 14-acre land’s marquee attraction is a ride inside a replica of the Millennium Falcon.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: The state has a new law on the books that legislators say expands protections for mobile home residents and leads to better enforcement of those regulations. The Daily Camera reports Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed the bill into law Thursday that sets up a resolution process for disputes between mobile home residents and park owners. The law allows the state Division of Housing to accept complaints and begin the mediation process. The law also gives residents 30 days to leave properties when evicted, instead of the previous 48 hours. Democratic state Rep. Edie Hooton says the state will likely see a spike in complaints during the law’s first year, but lawmakers expect the volume to subside as “park owners start to see that the rules are being enforced.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: Police are still searching for a fugitive who failed to honor an agreement and surrender once enough people responded to his wanted poster on social media. Jose Simms is being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on charges that range from breach of peace to risk of injury to a child. He is believed to be in New York state. Torrington police Lt. Brett Johnson posted on the department’s Facebook page last week that Simms had contacted him through the site and agreed to turn himself in if the post containing his poster received 15,000 likes. The page has far surpassed that number, but still no sign of Simms. Maki Haberfeld, an expert in police ethics and procedure at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says Simms is using social media to manipulate the news media and police, who she said have no business negotiating a deal with a suspect, never mind one that involves likes on Facebook.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A church has been badly damaged by a fire, though no injuries have been reported. The blaze engulfed Saint Mary’s Holy Church near Georgetown on Sunday. State investigators are trying to determine the cause of the destructive blaze. Delaware’s office of the state fire marshal says the “heavy damage” at the church was estimated at $50,000. The Georgetown Fire Company responded to the early Sunday blaze. It was first reported shortly after midnight.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory welcomed parishioners to his first Sunday Mass at the Cathedral of Saint Matthew the Apostle over the weekend, WUSA-TV reports. D.C.’s newest archbishop officially took possession of the cathedral during the Mass, welcomed by Monsignor Ronald James in a celebration of the beginning of the new ministry. Gregory expressed his joy, saying, “We are beginning something new – a new friendship and relationship that we pray will be fruitful and filled with joy.” He then asked the parishioners for their faith and prayers. Following the Mass, Gregory introduced himself, shaking hands and talking with the Catholic parishioners he will serve in his new position. He was formally installed last Tuesday as the first African American leader of the district’s Catholic community.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Divers off the state’s far southern coast can now visit an underwater art museum. Divers finished placing a series of artworks on a sunken ship Saturday about 7 miles south of Key West in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The project consists of 24 large photo illustrations created by Austrian artist Andreas Franke. They were placed on the Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a former U.S. Air Force missile tracking ship that was intentionally sunk 10 years ago to create an artificial reef. Franke calls it the “Plastic Ocean Project” and says he wants it to draw attention to the need to eliminate plastics in the world’s oceans. On Monday, divers unfurled a giant American flag on the 523-foot long ship to commemorate Memorial Day and the 10th anniversary of the ship’s sinking.\n\nGeorgia\n\nValdosta: A civil rights activist is clashing with the mayor over a proposal to rename a street for former President Barack Obama. The Valdosta Daily Times reports police escorted the Rev. Floyd Rose, 80, from a city council meeting Thursday after Mayor John Gayle said he kept talking beyond his public comment time. Rose wants Forrest Street renamed to honor the nation’s first black president. He says it was named in 1883 for Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Ku Klux Klan leader. Gayle said petitioners need to follow a new ordinance, but Rose said it was designed to thwart the name change. It says only one signature can come from each parcel along a road, so multiple signatures from a single apartment complex don’t count.\n\nHawaii\n\nKeauhou: Federal officials are in the final review stages for rules that would ban swimming with Hawaiian spinner dolphins. West Hawaii Today reported last week that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials are nearing completion of regulations proposed almost three years ago that would create a 50-yard barrier around the mammals. Officials say the rules would outlaw coming within the protected area around Hawaiian spinner dolphins – or “naia” in the Hawaiian language – by any means including swimming or using a boat to intercept the animal’s path. The prohibition would cover all persons, vessels and objects and extend 2 nautical miles from island coastlines, including waters bounded by Maui, Lanai and Kahoolawe. The regulations would include exceptions such as dolphins approaching swimmers and boats and safe navigation.\n\nIdaho\n\nMeridian: Federal data shows the state’s largest cities have grown larger, with a second city now seeing its population topping 100,000 residents. The Post Register reports new numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau show the most dramatic growth was in this city neighboring the capital, Boise. Meridian’s population has jumped nearly 39% since 2010, with a population estimated at nearly 107,000. The data indicates Meridian grew the seventh fastest of the major cities across the country. Meridian is now second to Boise, which recorded a population of nearly 229,000 residents last year. Behind Meridian is Nampa with 96,000 people and Idaho Falls with 61,000.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: The head of the Army Corps of Engineers has sent Congress a $778 million plan to fortify a waterway in the state with noisemakers, electric cables and other devices in the hope that they will prevent Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes, where the aggressive invaders could leave other fish with too little to eat. Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite on Thursday approved the plan to install defenses at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam near Joliet, about 40 miles from Lake Michigan. The site is a crucial choke point in an aquatic pathway between the lake and the carp-infested Illinois River. Although only a few live Asian carp have been found past the barrier, the fish’s DNA has turned up there as recently as April, when water samples were taken from Chicago’s Lake Calumet.\n\nIndiana\n\nClarksville: A former Colgate-Palmolive factory could become the home of a hotel, housing and commercial space. The factory in this Ohio River town in southern Indiana made toothpaste and other personal hygiene products for decades until it closed in 2007. A plan recently approved by Clarksville officials and the Clark’s Landing development group calls for redeveloping the building, which is known for its large, iconic clock. Clarksville redevelopment director Dylan Fisher tells the News and Tribune the project is expected to include a hotel, multifamily housing, commercial space and a civic center. That proposal is part of a redevelopment planned for Clarksville’s south side. It will have elevated bike trails, a revamped riverfront area, and a mix of businesses, residential spaces and community spaces.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has vetoed a bill that would have lifted a cap on the potency of medical marijuana products available in the state. Reynolds vetoed the bill Friday afternoon, saying the state must proceed cautiously in any expansion of its medical marijuana program. Reynolds says she could support in the future a more limited effort to increase the potency of products. Democratic lawmakers who have supported expansion of the program criticized Reynolds’ decision, saying it would hurt sick people who get little benefit from products now available that have low levels of THC, the compound that causes a high. Rep. John Forbes, an Urbandale pharmacist, called the veto “distressing news for thousands of sick and vulnerable Iowans who deserve greater access to this life-changing medication.” The bill had been approved overwhelmingly in both legislative chambers.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Restored mission control consoles used by NASA to guide trips to the moon will soon be shipped from the state to the control room where they were used from the 1960s through the 1990s. The Hutchinson News reports that Cosmosphere’s SpaceWorks experts have restored 19 consoles in Hutchinson over the past year and a half. NASA picked up 10 of the consoles last year, and the remainder will be sent to the Johnson Space Center in Houston on Friday. The consoles, which will be unveiled in June ahead of the 50-year anniversary celebration of Neil Armstrong’s first steps on the moon, were used for the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. They also helped communicate with astronauts to fix an oxygen tank that exploded on Apollo 13.\n\nKentucky\n\nWilliamstown: In the Bible, the ark survived an epic flood. Yet the owners of the Noah’s ark attraction in the state are demanding their insurance company bail them out after heavy rains caused nearly $1million in property damage. The Ark Encounter says in a federal lawsuit that rains in 2017 and 2018 caused a landslide on its access road. The attraction’s insurance carriers refused to cover the damage. The 510-foot-long wooden ark has been a popular northern Kentucky attraction since its 2016 opening. The lawsuit says the road has been rebuilt. The ark was not damaged. The suit names Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings of Switzerland, its use company and three other insurance carriers. Ark Encounter seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The Swiss company hasn’t responded in court filings.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMetairie: A young bald eagle found soaked and stumping along a street in the neighborhood where it hatched will be released Tuesday in the same area. A resident brought the mottled brown eaglet to the Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine’s Wildlife Hospital on May 11, after making sure it needed help. Another neighbor has been collecting money for its care and posting health updates outside her home. Coastal consultant and photographer P.J. Hahn says it was on the ground, barely able to fly, and appeared to have a wing injury. Veterinary school spokeswoman Ginger Guttner says the eagle needed supportive care and has been in the school’s flight cage since May 20 so veterinarians could be sure it flies well enough to be released.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: Local Memorial Day celebrations have noted the absence of a particularly prominent veteran who died last year. The American Legion had two empty chairs in Kennebunkport’s Dock Square on Monday in memory of all of the times former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, watched the Memorial Day parade from that spot. Mark Matthews from American Legion Post 159 said organizers wanted to acknowledge the absence of Bush, a longtime summer resident and a Navy veteran. He missed last year’s parade after falling ill after attending an American Legion pancake breakfast earlier in the weekend. He died at age 94 on Nov. 30, months after his wife’s death. Town Manager Laurie Smith said the Bushes’ absence is felt every day. She said it will be a “strange” summer without their presence.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: To Marylanders, Old Bay is more than a seasoning – it’s a symbol of state pride. The yellow and blue tin with a red lid is tattooed on calves or placed in windowsills along with a crab and decorative mallets. A T-shirt proclaims: “I put Old Bay on my Old Bay.” Eighty-three percent of the state’s residents reported a favorable opinion of Old Bay, according to The Goucher Poll, a political survey of 808 adults. Yet the seasoning’s popularity belies a little-known truth: Cooks in restaurants and crab shacks rarely use Old Bay to steam crabs. The Baltimore Sun called dozens of crab houses in the region, and the majority – 18 out of 30 – said they steam crabs with either J.O. No. 2 seasoning or a custom blend made by the Halethorpe-based spice company.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities say a group of Jewish teens played a key role in saving the life of a drowning man with a tattoo of a swastika. NBC Boston reports it happened Thursday night as the four youths – all students at an Orthodox Jewish high school in suburban Brookline – spotted the body of a man partially submerged in Chestnut Hill Reservoir. Boston College police officer Carl Mascioli says two of the teens ran to his patrol car to alert him. Mascioli says he rushed down the embankment, pulled the man from the water and noticed the Nazi symbol tattooed on his hand. He says the unidentified students told him they don’t regret helping the man despite his anti-Semitic tattoo. Officials say the man is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Pvt. James Robinson played an important role in the final battle of the Revolutionary War, but like many African Americans who took up arms against the British, he received little lasting recognition. That’s about to change. Members of two patriotic lineage societies linked to historic wars are planning to unveil a special grave marker and give Robinson, who died in 1868, military funeral honors during a ceremony next month at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. “Over 5,000 African Americans served in the Revolutionary War, and Robinson is one of the most consequential figures of the period,” said Elijah Shalis, secretary of the Michigan Society Sons of the American Revolution. “He deserved this honor 151 years ago.” Robinson led a remarkable life. He was a slave and a minister who fought in two wars and died at age 115 as the last known living African American veteran of the Revolutionary War.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCook: A woman in northern Minnesota has donated a kidney to a volunteer firefighter who was the first responder when she and her child needed help. KARE-TV reports that their paths first crossed in 2016 when Becca Bundy’s 1-year-old daughter was having a seizure. She dialed 911, and Bearville volunteer firefighter Bill Cox was the first on the scene. Last fall, Bundy came across Cox tending bar and wearing a T-shirt that said he was in end-stage kidney failure and needed a donor. Bundy was a match, and the transplant took place in February. The 66-year-old Cox, who is now free from dialysis, says Bundy is his angel. She says she feels blessed to be on his journey with him.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked a state law that would ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, at about six weeks of pregnancy. “Here we go again,” U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves wrote in his order. “Mississippi has passed another law banning abortions prior to viability.” His new order stops the law from taking effect July 1. Reeves is the same judge who struck down a 2018 Mississippi law to ban abortion at 15 weeks. The Magnolia State is one of several states that have pushed this year to enact bans on early abortions. Opponents of abortion are emboldened by new conservative Supreme Court justices and are looking for ways to challenge the court’s 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The state has become the 20th to join a nationwide sex offender registry. OffenderWatch said in a news release last week that every Missouri law enforcement agency that manages or investigates registered sex offenders will be able to collaborate on offender records, aid each other in investigations and share notifications with the public. It won a five-year contract from the Missouri Highway Patrol. Missouri has about 16,000 registered sex offenders. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children says there are more than 900,000 registered sex offenders in the United States. OffenderWatch says its service allows different law enforcement agencies to collaborate on a single offender record, improving accuracy and aiding in public safety. Its technology is used by more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies in 37 states.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state will install a permanent monument on the Capitol grounds recognizing Native American contributions to the state and nation. Gov. Steve Bullock on Thursday held a ceremonial signing of legislation to erect a monument and display the flags of the state’s eight recognized Native American tribes. The bill’s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Marvin Weatherwax of Browning, called it a big honor and “well overdue.” Bullock says the monument will be a symbol of respect and understanding, as well as a recognition that the Capitol belongs to everybody. The measure was part of a package of bills Bullock signed dealing with Native American issues, including legislation meant to improve the response to reports of missing American Indian women.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: It’s not very often you get to touch a dinosaur. But that’s just one of the many cool things about the newly renovated Schramm Education Center at Schramm Park State Recreation Area near Gretna, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The pallid sturgeon touch tank lets kids feel the unique fish, which outdoor education specialist Amber Schiltz says is like a living dinosaur. That fish family has been around for 70 million years. School kids who recently visited loved to touch the bony plates of sturgeon when a curious one swam up to their hands. “They were squealing and getting excited,” Schiltz told the paper. “It was really fun.” The center will soon hold its grand opening after an almost two-year renovation that cost several million dollars, much of it funded by donors. The building, previously called Aksarben Aquarium, was gutted and expanded by about a third.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Lake Tahoe’s clarity rebounded last year from its worst level in a half-century of record-keeping as weather and streamflow returned to more normal conditions. Scientists at the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center say the dinner plate-sized disc used to measure clarity was visible at an average depth of 70.9 feet in 2018. That’s 10.5 feet better than the year before. The new clarity measurement is in line with the five-year average of 70.3 feet, which is an increase of nearly a foot from the previous five-year running average at the alpine lake that straddles the California-Nevada line. Scientists hope efforts to combat threats to lake clarity posed by development and climate change will eventually return the lake to its historic clarity level in excess of 100 feet.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nIsles of Shoals: The state has had an artist in residence at the White Mountain National Forest for years. Now it will have one at an island off its coast. The nonprofit Star Island Corporation is launching a weeklong Artist-in-Residence program. Star Island is one of a group of small islands among the Isles of Shoals, an hour’s boat ride from the New Hampshire and Maine coasts. A formal application process is being worked on for the program for next summer. For centuries, the Shoals have attracted artists drawn to the rugged beauty of the islands. The residency will require artists to share their time and talent with conference guests, day visitors and staff of Star Island. Exhibit space for artwork will be provided in the lobby of the 19th-century Oceanic Hotel.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Deptford: The largest U.S. seller of San Marzano tomatoes, known to food lovers as the best tomatoes to make pasta sauce, has been hit with two federal lawsuits claiming what’s inside the can isn’t the real thing. New Jersey-based Cento Fine Foods called the claims “wrongful” last week and assured the company’s tomatoes are true San Marzanos, meaning they were grown at the base of Mount Vesuvius in Campania in Italy. One suit filed in February alleges fraud, saying there’s no way Cento can produce that many San Marzano tomatoes. Another suit says the cans lack certain labeling that qualifies them as true San Marzanos. The company says that isn’t a requirement. San Marzano tomatoes are a favorite among foodies for their sweet flavor, stronger taste and low acidity.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: John Pinto, a Navajo Code Talker in World War II who became one of the nation’s longest-serving Native American elected officials, has died at age 94. State Senate colleague Michael Padilla confirmed Pinto’s death in Gallup on Friday after years of suffering from various illnesses that rarely kept him from his duties. After serving as a Marine, Pinto was selected to the New Mexico Senate in 1976 and represented a district that included the Navajo Nation for more than four decades. The region is one of the poorest in the country. Born on the Navajo Nation to a family of sheep herders, Pinto didn’t start formal schooling until he was nearly a teenager. “At the age of 12, I was in kindergarten,” Pinto told the Albuquerque Journal in a 2007 interview. “I guess I did all right.”\n\nNew York\n\nCobleskill: The State University of New York at Cobleskill is launching a new four-year program in “canine training and management” amid a surge in demand for specially trained dogs to detect threats and assist veterans in the wake of 9/11. While several institutions hand out training certificates, and at least one small private college awards a bachelor’s in dog handling, the program at Cobleskill is more ambitious in its scope. Professor Stephen Mackenzie says he developed Cobleskill’s Bachelor of Technology degree partly in response to a heightened demand for dogs capable of sniffing out explosives in the aftermath of Sept. 11. The need for service dogs trained to assist those with post-traumatic stress disorder or reduced mobility has also expanded as veterans started returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: As the 75th anniversary of D-Day approaches, historians and educators worry that the World War II milestone is losing its resonance with today’s students. In North Carolina as in many other states, D-Day isn’t part of the required curriculum, though some teachers do use the anniversary to spend extra time on the June 6, 1944, battle. It’s not a stand-alone topic in France, which was liberated from German occupation. German schools concentrate on the Holocaust and Nazi dictatorship. Schools in Russia avoid D-Day because they believe the victories on the Eastern Front won the war. In Cary, North Carolina, Kasey Turcol taught her students at Crossroads FLEX High School about D-Day, including lesser-known aspects like tales of a Spanish spy.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A group raising awareness about post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide among combat veterans has finished a 400-mile walk. Brady’s Border2Border Ruck March began on the state’s western border Tuesday and concluded Saturday in Fargo. The event honors Brady Oberg, who served in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. After coming home, Oberg suffered from PTSD and killed himself in 2015. KFGO- AM reports that a group of 16 family and friends participated in the march. They each carried a bag with 20 pounds to represent the 20 veterans with PTSD who take their lives every day. The first march took place a year ago. Oberg’s family started the Brady Oberg Legacy Foundation to raise awareness of PTSD.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The city is working to preserve the heritage of century-old trees planted to commemorate area soldiers who died in World War I. The planting of the 9-mile stretch of red oaks that runs through Cleveland and into suburban Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights marked its 100th anniversary on Memorial Day. Local officials are taking an inventory of remaining Liberty Row trees, many of which have died over the years, with some plaques lost or damaged. The greater Cleveland area was one of the first communities nationally to envision a multi-mile stretch of trees as a memorial to fallen soldiers. Between 1919 and 1924, more than 800 oak trees were planted, each with a bronze plaque at its base engraved with the name of a fallen soldier.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the state’s largest-ever appropriations bill, an $8.1 billion spending plan that funds pay raises for teachers and state workers and pumps tens of millions more dollars into public schools. Flanked by Republican legislative leaders, the first-year governor signed the bill Friday, a day after the Legislature adjourned the 2019 session. The deal also socks away an additional $200 million into a state savings account. When combined with additional revenue in the state’s Rainy Day Fund, the savings will give the state more than $1 billion in reserve funds. Democrats criticized the plan as not doing enough for working-class Oklahomans and argued the additional $200 million was needed to shore up previous cuts to core services.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge on Friday ordered a man to learn about the Sikh religion and submit a report to the court as part of his sentence for an attack on a Sikh shopkeeper in Salem, a civil rights group said. Andrew Ramsey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of intimidation and assault in the Jan. 14 incident targeting Harwinder Singh Dodd, according to a release from the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh civil rights organization in the U.S. The intimidation count is considered a hate crime, the group said. Witnesses said Ramsey pulled on Dodd’s beard after he refused to sell him cigarettes without an ID, punched him and pulled him to the ground. Bystanders restrained Ramsey until police arrived. Dodd, who came to the U.S. from India and owns the convenience store, noted in a written statement to the court that hate crimes are on the rise in America. The FBI says hate crimes increased by 40% in Oregon from 2016 to 2017.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Weather officials say the state has already recorded the average number of tornadoes for a year even before the summer period in which severe weather is most common. Meteorologist Sarah Johnson of the National Weather Service says 16 tornadoes – the yearly average – have had preliminary confirmation in the commonwealth so far this year. Severe weather is more common in June and into July, but that’s not a hard and fast rule. For example, Johnson says, a large outbreak of severe weather occurred Oct. 2 across Pennsylvania. In recent weeks, Johnson says, the high plains and Mid-Atlantic have been getting the brunt of low-pressure systems bringing precipitation. On Thursday, six tornado warnings were issued across the commonwealth in a span of just two hours.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The mansion once owned by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Edith Wharton is on the market for nearly $12 million. The Providence Journal reports that Land’s End in Newport, where Wharton and her husband lived in the late 19th century, is for sale at $11.7 million. It was more recently owned by socialite Marion Oates Charles, who died there in December. The 24-room mansion on a 5.6-acre estate was built in 1880. It’s located on a street that runs between two of the city’s most famous thoroughfares, Bellevue Avenue and the Cliff Walk. Kendra Toppa, the listing agent, said the property “truly epitomizes Newport real estate at its finest.” Wharton won the Pulitzer for 1920’s “The Age of Innocence” and also wrote “Ethan Frome” and “The House of Mirth.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The city kicked off 17 days of operas, plays, chamber music and jazz Friday as the world-renowned Spoleto Festival USA returns. The 43rd season of the arts festival began with the opening ceremony from Charleston City Hall. It will run through June 9. The spotlighted performance is the opera “Salome.” Spoleto plans a contemporary retelling of the 1905 Richard Strauss opera, based on an Oscar Wilde play of the same name about the Biblical story of the woman who asked for the head of John the Baptist. The Spoleto Festival USA choir will join the festival’s orchestra and the Charleston Symphony for a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach’s St. John Passion on June 4. The festival will take place in 11 indoor and outdoor venues.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHoughton: An 88-year-old man has made his mark on this farming community as a prolific gopher killer. Clayton Sanderson of Houghton estimates he has caught 22,000 of the varmints since he started hunting them down in 1997. Sanderson told the Aberdeen News he doesn’t poison the animals because poison is expensive, and he can’t reach their bodies if they go deep into their gopher holes to die, making it harder for him to turn them into profit. So he widens the top of the hole and sets a trap with two pressure-triggered arms. He says he’s been bitten only once in 22 years. Farmers hate gophers, he said, “with a passion,” because of the damage wrought on their farm equipment when they hit the mounds at the entrance of the gopher holes. Sanderson said he earns $3 for every set of gopher front paws he hands over to Shelby or Lansing township officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nJasper: A University of Tennessee doctoral student is resurrecting research that was abandoned nearly 80 years ago that could be crucial for Tennessee Valley Authority’s understanding of long-term weather patterns that factor into the agency’s decisions regarding water. Scientist Florence Hawley began research in the 1930s studying tree rings to understand long-term weather patterns in the Norris Basin, The Times Free Press reports. She worked at TVA in its earliest days but faced sexism on the job and was never allowed to publish her results, according to TVA officials. She abandoned TVA in the 1940s and went to work in the Southwest. Her research was recently found in the TVA archives. The utility provider approached the University of Tennessee about finishing the work, and doctoral student Laura Smith has taken on the task.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The police chief has announced a youth jobs program meant to give children something to do during high-crime summer months and better connect officers to underserved areas. The Dallas Morning News reports Chief U. Renee Hall says the DPD to You(th) initiative will focus on students from schools with higher rates of crime and arrests. The project involves recruiting 50 students, from schools primarily in South Dallas, and inserting them in occupations with city government agencies, nonprofits and the Dallas Police Department. Volunteers will mentor the students in the program. Assistant City Manager Jon Fortune says the program “is critical as we look for ways to have a greater impact on the lives of teens.” Police officials also aim to host a citywide youth community service day.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah Lake: On a recent visit to Utah Lake’s west shore, Alison Green scrutinized sandstone outcrops, measuring lines chiseled into the stone by ancient hands, then doing her best to replicate them on gridded sheets. The 12-year-old from Sandy inspected one petroglyph cut into rock hundreds of years ago by Fremont Indians. “It shows the person has braided legs, and that could be a birthing scene,” she said. “That could mean it was a fertile area.” Green was among two dozen middle schoolers from Sandy’s Blessed Sacrament Catholic School recently doing archaeological surveys at the Adelbert Doyle Smith Family Preserve as part of an effort to list the 196-acre site on the National Register of Historic Places. “The kids are doing the work the way an entry-level archaeologist out of college would,” says John McHugh, a science teacher at Blessed Sacrament leading the expedition. He calls the school’s archaeology club the Shovel Bums, after the moniker given to rookie archaeologists who do the grunt work at excavation sites.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Seven historic sites owned by the state are now open for the season. The sites include more than 80 historic structures and hundreds of acres of forest and farmland that opened Saturday. State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann says the historic sites include prehistoric camps, Revolutionary War sites and the homes of U.S. presidents. She says they all shed light on the history of Vermont. Among the sites that opened include the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch, the Old Constitution House in Windsor and the Hubbardton Battlefield in Hubbardton. More than 70 public events and programs are scheduled this season at Vermont’s State Historic Sites.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A new television series with Ethan Hawke starring as the fiery abolitionist John Brown is set to film in the state. Gov. Ralph Northam’s office announced Thursday that production of the eight-part series will start in central Virginia this summer. The show is based on the novel “The Good Lord Bird” by best-selling author James McBride and is set to air on Showtime. Brown led a raid in 1859 on a federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, in what is now West Virginia, hoping to start an armed slave rebellion. The rebellion didn’t happen, and Brown was later hanged for treason. Before the raid, Brown and a group of abolitionist settlers killed five pro-slavery settlers in Kansas in the Pottawatomie massacre.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane Valley: Proponents of creating a 51st state have held a bake sale to raise money for their cause. The Spokesman-Review reports that supporters of the proposed Christian conservative state, which would span parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, raised money by auctioning pies and other desserts. The Liberty State Gala drew about 200 people in the city of Spokane Valley on Thursday evening. Speakers included Washington state Rep. Matt Shea, a Spokane Valley Republican who has championed the Liberty State movement. Shea spoke of the cultural and political differences between eastern and western Washington, denied the existence of global warming, and claimed the United States is “a Christian nation” under siege by atheists and Communists. Spokane City Councilman Mike Fagen and county Prosecutor Larry Haskell also attended.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republicans in the state Senate have pitched a broad-based education plan that allows for charter schools but doesn’t include vouchers. Senate President Mitch Carmichael released a lengthy draft of the proposal late Friday and said it’s a compromise that folds in many ideas backed by Democrats. “Nobody gets everything they want,” he said. The legislation includes a pay raise for teachers, mental health services for students and a provision that would withhold pay for teachers if a school is closed because of a strike. The proposal comes as the GOP-led legislature nears special session debate on education measures. Carmichael said he put out the draft of the bill Friday to give lawmakers time to read it so they can come back this week and propose changes before the Senate reconvenes. Republican Gov. Jim Justice issued a statement praising the bill.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFifield: Rock music blared from speakers as spectators watched speedsters zoom around a track Sunday afternoon. It was a big day for racing, with NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 and the Indy 500, but the races in this northern Wisconsin community featured machines a bit slower than Indy cars – lawn mowers. While all the vehicles must start their careers as actual riding lawn mowers, racers make a few adjustments, resulting in mowers that can travel as fast as 60 mph. At Sunday’s races, which were a fundraiser for the Fifield Fire Department, 30 mowers competed in five classes on a dirt track an eighth of a mile long. Blades are removed from racing lawn mowers and steel welded on the frame for stability. In some classes, machines must run on original lawn mower engines. All must have hydraulic brakes.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Symphony Orchestra has named Christopher Dragon as its new conductor and music director after a search lasting a year and a half. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Casper orchestra announced Thursday the selection of the Australia-born conductor, who was one of four finalists for the job. Dragon programmed and performed a concert in January with the orchestra. Search committee chair Eric Unruh says Dragon was a hit with the audience and musicians, and his creativity and innovation stood out. Dragon has been an associate conductor with the Colorado Symphony for four years. He will be the Denver orchestra’s resident conductor for the next two years. Dragon says every concert in Casper next year will feature a Beethoven piece in honor of the 250th anniversary of the composer’s birth.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/politics/nancy-pelosi-future-speaker/index.html", "title": "Pelosi won't say if she wants to stay in charge. But will House ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNancy Pelosi sidestepped a question this week about whether she wants to continue leading House Democrats after November – but her own members are divided about whether they’d let that happen.\n\nIn interviews with more than two dozen House Democrats, a consensus is emerging: If they lose the majority, there would be overwhelming pressure for Pelosi to go, a prospect that Democratic sources say the powerful House speaker is keenly aware of.\n\nBut with polls and fresh momentum giving House Democrats some sparks of optimism about the midterm elections, multiple members say they are also starting to see how, if they do hold control, it could lead to Pelosi extending her time in power. Yet Democrats are split about that possibility, with a sizable contingent eager for new leadership regardless of the outcome, even if she’d be the heavy favorite to hold onto the gavel.\n\nThe 2018 deal Pelosi agreed to with dissident members limiting her to four more years as speaker was an informal agreement, and caucus rules were never changed imposing any time limits on her tenure. Several members told CNN that if the midterms go well for their party, a combination of shocked euphoria and deference to both her fundraising prowess and the importance of female voters, could make them reconsider.\n\nSeveral noted, though, that a surprising victory in holding the majority might be the perfect time for the exit that Pelosi has said she originally planned to make six years ago if Hillary Clinton won the presidency, and that any decision to stay would have to come with a clear timetable for leaving.\n\nDemocrats are not on the same page about the sensitive topic.\n\n“I support Pelosi,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a conservative Texas Democrat who owes Pelosi for helping him win his primary. “I’ll support her for whatever position.”\n\n“I think if we win the House, she’ll deserve it – it’s as simple as that,” said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, Texas Democrat.\n\nBut if they lose majority?\n\n“The dynamics change,” Gonzalez said. “I think it changes the game.”\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, speaks in September during a news conference at the US Capitol in Washington. Ting Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nOther Democrats say it’s time for new leadership no matter what happens in November.\n\n“It’s time for generational diversity of our leadership ranks – regardless of the outcome of the election,” said Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat who voted for Pelosi for speaker, calling her “one of the most extraordinary speakers in history.”\n\n“That doesn’t change my perspective that it’s time for a new generation,” Phillips said, noting that is a widespread view within the caucus.\n\nPrivately, the assessment tends to be blunter.\n\n“She has to go,” one senior Democrat said. “No way she can stay,” added another long-time House Democrat. “She doesn’t have the votes,” another veteran Democrat said, pointing to some vulnerable frontline Democrats who have vowed not to vote for her.\n\nIndeed, all this is running up against deep tensions among House Democrats, and in their party overall, that they’re overdue for major changes in their leadership. Yet Pelosi’s two deputies, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, who, like the speaker, are north of 80, have surprised colleagues by privately signaling they might be interested in succeeding her if and when she leaves.\n\nNot everyone is on board with that idea.\n\n“I certainly have long thought it’s time for new leadership,” said Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat from a New Jersey swing district, who didn’t vote for Pelosi in the speaker’s election last year. “She’s done an incredible job, but we really do need to grow new leaders. When you have the top three people in our caucus in their 80s. … There does need to be a new generation coming up and starting to lead. And that’s something that I think the Democratic Party shouldn’t be afraid of.”\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been critical of Pelosi in the past but has since worked out a more collegial relationship and voted to elect her as speaker, said she also hopes to see change in leadership after the midterms – but stopped short of calling on the speaker to retire.\n\n“I think if we’re in a minority then I think that the desire for change will be broader, potentially within the party. But I think that desire exists,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We saw and heard that desire in the last two terms that Democrats were the majority, so it really is just a question of, not if people want that, but how many?”\n\nRep. Andy Kim, a vulnerable New Jersey Democrat, said that if Pelosi were to attempt to stay as leader, he believes it would go against the commitment made in 2018, even if it weren’t written in stone.\n\n“I thought we had an agreement in terms of leadership and tenure,” Kim said when asked about the prospect of Pelosi staying. “I have an understanding of where I think this needs to go: We stick with what we agreed to before.”\n\nA number of Democrats believe that Pelosi is almost certain to leave and that she hasn’t fully shut the door because she doesn’t want to look like a lame-duck as she travels across the country to raise staggering sums of money to save her thin majority. Moreover, after a productive legislative session – that saw enactment on major issues on climate change, infrastructure and gun violence legislation – plus a high-profile visit to Taiwan amid tensions with China, many see her final moves as a capstone on her historic run atop the House as the first female speaker.\n\n“I feel very comfortable about what they are proposing,” Pelosi said in 2018 after reaching a deal with Democratic dissenters to limit her tenure to four more years as speaker. “And I feel very responsible to do that, whether it passes or not.”\n\nTerm limits for the top three Democratic leaders never were adopted.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Hakeem Jeffries talks to reportersin June 2021 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nDems jockeying behind the scenes\n\nNew York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, long seen as Pelosi’s likeliest successor, has kept a busy schedule in recent weeks in person, over the phone and on Zoom calls, and will be making another trip this weekend – to Iowa as a featured guest at the traditional Democratic Party steak fry fundraiser at the invitation of endangered Rep. Cindy Axne. California Rep. Adam Schiff, a close Pelosi ally, has also been traveling the country and fundraising on behalf of colleagues as he’s been exploring a leadership run and meeting with members about it.\n\nBut Hoyer, who’s been waiting out Pelosi for decades, has privately indicated to allies that he would run for the top job if Pelosi bowed out, according to multiple Democratic sources.\n\nHoyer wouldn’t confirm or deny those conversations.\n\n“I don’t think we’re ruling out anything,” Hoyer said. “We’re focused on winning the elections.”\n\nIt has long been viewed within the caucus that Hoyer would step down when Pelosi did. And several younger members expressed confusion that the 83-year-old moderate longtime leader would try to stand in the way of generational change in leadership, especially if that pits him against Jeffries, who is African-American and 30 years his junior.\n\nClyburn has privately expressed waves of interest in making history as the first Black speaker – despite telling CNN late last year that was not in his plans – but is seen as more willing than Hoyer to take an emeritus-style leadership role than to stand in Jeffries’ way. Likely, that question would be resolved internally first within the large and powerful Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n“I have not made any decisions,” Clyburn told CNN this week.\n\nPelosi has been sticking to her well-known bullishness about Democrats’ prospects, and her own sense of them. At a news conference on Wednesday, she looked out at the gathered reporters and said, “Even though there are some among you who belittle my political instincts and the rest, I got us here twice to the majority. And I don’t intend on giving it up.”\n\nWhen pressed on whether she would answer the question on whether she would seek another term as speaker, she refused to entertain it.\n\n“No. I said first we’re going to win. And that’s really the issue,” she said. “Are we speaking a different language? First we win, then we decide.”\n\nOne source close to Pelosi believes the speaker has yet to decide what she might do if Democrats keep control of the House.\n\nDrew Hammill, a spokesperson for the speaker, offered a stock answer when asked about speculation about her future: “The Speaker is not on a shift. She’s on a mission.”\n\nYet to continue her mission she may have to win over some dissenters.\n\nMichigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a vulnerable Democrat who has criticized House leadership in the past and hasn’t backed Pelosi for speaker, said she’d like to see a change in her caucus’ leadership after November.\n\n“I’ve always felt we need new leadership,” Slotkin said. “I also understand that leaders don’t – no leader I’ve ever worked with – says that they’re leaving long, long before they actually leave because you lose all your power.”\n\nUltimately, though, many Democrats say it’s Pelosi’s call.\n\n“Should Democrats retain control of the House in the 118th Congress, I am going to be with Nancy Pelosi for as long as she wants to be here,” said Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat. “I think that when she leaves, she should be given the opportunity to resign in dignity. It will be her decision, in my opinion.”", "authors": ["Manu Raju Edward-Isaac Dovere Daniella Diaz", "Manu Raju", "Edward-Isaac Dovere", "Daniella Diaz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}]}

She was 79.\n\nA member of Fleetwood Mac for more than 50 years – with a few intermittent breaks – McVie imbued the rock band's sound with a feathery touch.\n\nThe band posted a statement on their official social media accounts calling her “one-of-a-kind, special and talented beyond measure. She was the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life … We cherished Christine deeply and are thankful for the amazing memories we have.”\n\nFleetwood Mac’s representative, Kristen Foster, confirmed McVie’s death to USA TODAY.\n\nAccording to McVie’s family, she “passed away peacefully at (the) hospital following a short illness.”\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nMcVie joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970 and weathered the numerous dramatic upheavals within the band. She is the first member of the most commercially successful incarnation of the group – including her ex-husband John McVie (they were married from 1968 to 1976, but remained friendly as bandmates), Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and band founder Mick Fleetwood – to die.\n\n'Best friend in the whole world':Stevie Nicks mourns Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie\n\nNicks posted a tender note and song lyrics from the Haim song \"Hallelujah\" on social media, calling McVie \"my best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975.\" Nicks said she only learned of McVie's illness on Saturday and was told to wait before heading to London to see her ailing musical partner.\n\nIn June, McVie told Rolling Stone that she suffered from scoliosis and was trying to “get my back better and get myself into decent shape again.”\n\nAs an integral part of Fleetwood Mac's lush sound, her mellifluous vocals painted many of their biggest hits, including “Don’t Stop,” “You Make Loving Fun,” “Hold Me,” “Everywhere,” “Little Lies” and the song that closed many of the band’s concerts, “Songbird.”\n\nIn addition to her decades of success with Fleetwood Mac, McVie fostered a thriving solo career.\n\nHer eponymous second solo album, released in 1984, lifted her into the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 with “Got a Hold on Me,” another of her sweet-yet-sophisticated pop songs.\n\nIn 2017, McVie paired with Buckingham for the album “Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie,” and the pair embarked on a 38-date tour that summer.\n\n'Beautiful genius':Irene Cara, Oscar-winning 'Flashdance' singer and actress, dies at 63\n\nBut being on stage was never McVie’s calling. Following Fleetwood Mac’s 1990 Behind the Mask tour, McVie decided to stop touring with Fleetwood Mac, even though she remained a member of the band and continued to write songs for their records.\n\nAlong with Fleetwood Mac, McVie was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nShortly after their induction, the musician/singer took a lengthy reprieve from Fleetwood Mac – which she attributed to her fear of flying and panic attacks about performing – to live in the English countryside. She rejoined the band in 2014 for its On With the Show tour and returned to the stage with the Buckingham-less group in 2018 and 2019 for a worldwide run on the band’s most recent tour, An Evening With Fleetwood Mac.\n\nMcVie told Rolling Stone that during her time away from the band, she “enjoyed having my dogs, living in the country, going for long walks. I just wasn’t interested in playing music at that point.” She added that after she decided to return to Fleetwood Mac, she “never regretted it.”\n\nBorn Christine Perfect in Lancashire, England, on July 12, 1943, McVie was introduced to music at an early age, as her father, Cyril, was a concert violinist and college music teacher. Her grandfather was an organist at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThough McVie’s musical journey was initially steeped in classical music, hearing the songs of Fats Domino and The Everly Brothers shifted her focus to rock ’n’ roll.\n\nHer early band, the blues-based Chicken Shack, had a hit in the U.K. in 1969 with the blues staple “I’d Rather Go Blind.” That same year, she married John McVie, already the bassist for the similarly blues-rooted Fleetwood Mac.\n\n'Guess I'm a rock star now':Dolly Parton joins Eminem, Duran Duran in Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nLong a fan of the Peter Green-era of Fleetwood Mac – Christine played piano on the band’s second album, “Mr. Wonderful” – she officially joined the group in 1970 during a transitional period.\n\nAfter a few years of a rotating cast of musicians, the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks in 1975 kickstarted the commercial success of Fleetwood Mac, spearheaded by Christine-penned songs, “Over My Head” and “Say You Love Me,” on which she also sang lead vocals.\n\nThe intra-band drama of Fleetwood Mac has become legendary in the annals of pop music and much of it is documented in the band’s landmark 1977 album, “Rumours.” By then, a combination of drugs and fractured relationships – Buckingham and Nicks’ romantic tumult, the McVies' divorce – threatened to unravel the group. But instead, “Rumours” became its greatest success (it won the 1978 album of the year Grammy) thanks to tart pop songs such as “Go Your Own Way” and Nicks’ ethereal “Dreams.”\n\nAdele begins Las Vegas residency with emotion, tells fans:'Thank you for coming back to me'\n\nThe ensuing decades would bring McVie and Fleetwood Mac a more visual profile with the advent of MTV, as videos from 1982’s “Mirage” album (“Hold Me,” “Gypsy”) and 1987’s “Tango in the Night” (“Seven Wonders,” “Little Lies,” “Everywhere”) introduced the band to a younger generation.\n\nBut McVie, despite her vocal and songwriting prowess, never sought the spotlight, always content to stay perched behind her keyboards on stage.\n\nShe told Rolling Stone that one of the hardest parts about fame was “being noticed if you don’t want to be noticed.” But, she added, while not an extrovert, “I try to really be kind to people when they talk to me.

Fleetwood Mac were fantastic and really funny.”\n\nThe group underwent several member changes before Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined in 1974 and the band shot to super stardom.\n\nMcVie wrote and/or sang several of their hits including “Don’t Stop,” “Over My Head,” “You Make Loving Fun” and “Say You Love Me.”\n\nFleetwood Mac underwent some instability with both the ending of the McVies’ marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks’ personal relationship.\n\nBuckingham opted to leave the band and go solo in 1987, followed by Nicks who went solo in 1990.\n\nMcVie also went solo and earlier this year released a compilation of her solo work titled “Songbird (A Solo Collection).”\n\nBut despite the band’s interpersonal struggles, their musical chemistry was undeniable and they did eventually reunite.\n\n“I just wanted to embrace being in the English countryside and not have to troop around on the road. I moved to Kent, and I loved being able to walk around the streets, nobody knowing who I was. Then of course I started to miss it,” McVie told The Guardian about her 16 year hiatus from Fleetwood Mac. “I called Mick and asked: ‘How would you feel about me coming back to the band?’ He got in touch with everybody and we had a band meeting over the phone and they all went: ‘Come baaaack!!’ I felt regenerated and I felt like writing again.”\n\nFleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nHonoring a ‘sweet soul’\n\nTributes for McVie poured in to social media on Wednesday.\n\n“We were so lucky to have a life with her,” Fleetwood Mac said in their statement. “Individually and together, we cherished Christine deeply and are thankful for the amazing memories we have. She will be so very missed.”\n\nNicks, meanwhile, shared a handwritten letter to her bandmate on Instagram, along with a photo of herself with McVie. “A few hours ago I was told that my best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975, had passed away.

Kristi Noem.\n\nNoem announced the declaration Friday after the state released the latest COVID-19 data showing a one-day increase of 83 confirmed cases in the county.\n\nThe decision comes as state officials confirmed that 190 confirmed cases — \"primarily\" employees — have been connected to Smithfield Foods, a hot spot in Sioux Falls. That's more than double the number of cases confirmed two days prior.\n\nThe state is working to identify people who were in contact with those confirmed to have the disease. The state's contact tracing — a process where those who may have been in close contact with an infected individual are monitored for signs of infection — across all positive cases has shown an average of 10 people in close contact to a positive case, said State Epidemiologist Josh Clayton.\n\nWhat's behind South Dakota's coronavirus model? Health officials won't say.\n\nWhat’s in a model?\n\nTurns out South Dakota health officials are reluctant to share that information.\n\nThe people behind the state’s coronavirus response model, which Gov.

However, councilors this week OKed a two-week extension to the sunset, moving out the expiration date to April 22.\n\nNext week, Sioux Falls city councilors are expected to consider another extension to the \"no lingering\" ordinance.\n\nCase update: 89 new cases in South Dakota, most in Minnehaha\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health announced Friday that 89 more cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state.\n\nThe new cases bring the state's total to 536, a number that does not include pending tests in private labs and people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nNo new deaths were attributed to the disease. Six people have died from COVID-19 in South Dakota to date.\n\nThe number of people who have recovered from the disease increased to 177.\n\nIn Minnehaha County, 78 new cases were confirmed for a total of 352, while Lincoln County's confirmed case total rose by 5 to 38. The two counties combined account for 72% of the state's total cases.\n\nSioux Falls Health Department tours Smithfield facility, offers recommendations\n\nThe Sioux Falls Department of Health toured the Smithfield Foods facility and gave them some recommendations about how to curb the spread of coronavirus in the facility.\n\nSmithfield will close for three days Saturday after it was revealed that at least 80 workers tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nSioux Falls Public Health Director Jill Franken said the company is adding additional screening measures based on the health department's recommendations. That includes additional screening questions in addition to the temperature checks already being performed when workers arrive.\n\nThursday, April 9\n\nCafe worker in Lane, South Dakota tests positive for COVID-19\n\nA worker at the Lane Cafe in Lane tested positive for COVID-19, state health officials announced Thursday.\n\nThe person reported working last Wednesday through Saturday at the business.\n\nAnyone who visited the cafe during those dates should monitor for symptoms over the next 14 days, a news release from the South Dakota Department of Health said.\n\nThose who develop symptoms should call their health care provider and avoid contact with other people, according to the release.\n\nFirst responders ask for donated face masks amid COVID-19 outbreak\n\nThe City of Sioux Falls is asking residents to donate homemade face masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 among first responders.\n\nResponders use N95 masks during patient contact, but the city is asking for cloth masks for responders to follow CDC guidelines and wear around coworkers and the public.\n\nThe 600 masks are needed for dispatchers, emergency medical services and firefighters, according to a news release Thursday. They could also be distributed by first responders to vulnerable communities and individuals they respond to.\n\nMask drop-off bins will be placed at Sioux Falls fire stations, or they can be mailed to SFFR Station 3 on 2820 South Minnesota Avenue.\n\nGov. Noem announces app to help trace spread of coronavirus;\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced a new app available to South Dakotans to help with tracing the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nThe app, called Care19, comes through a partnership with North Dakota. It tracks the user's location, and, if the person later gets COVID-19, the app will help the health department track who may have been in contact with the infected person.\n\nUse of the app is voluntary, but it's intended for use by those who are essential workers or who must be out in the community to do essential business.\n\nData tracked by the app won't be used for anything but contact tracing, Noem said.\n\nNearly 500 people had chosen to use the South Dakota function of the app as of 3:45 p.m. Thursday.\n\nSmithfield closure another blow to livestock industry\n\nHog prices were already in a free fall.\n\nScott Kirsch is expecting things to get worse now that Smithfield Foods has closed its Sioux Falls plant for three days as it works to address an outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nKirsch co-owns the Platte Livestock Market, where he’s already noticed the effect of the novel coronavirus pandemic on the prices hog farmers are getting.\n\n“It’s going to be devastating to the industry,” he said of the closures caused by the worsening pandemic and resulting state of emergency.\n\nCase update: 54 more cases in South Dakota, majority in Sioux Falls area\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health announced that 54 more cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state.\n\nThat brings the state's total number of confirmed cases to 447, a number that does not include tests pending in private labs or people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of deaths in the state have not increased, remaining at 6.\n\nThe number of people who recovered from the disease increased to 161.\n\nMinnehaha County's confirmed case total increased by 46 for a total of 274 confirmed cases in the county, accounting for 61% of the state's cases. Adding Lincoln County's 33 cases, the Sioux Falls area accounts for nearly 69% of the states confirmed cases.\n\nSmithfield Foods to close plant for 3 days after becoming COVID-19 'hot spot'\n\nSmithfield Foods will close its Sioux Falls plants for three days, the company announced Thursday.\n\nThe closure comes less than 24 hours after Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdom confirmed that more than 80 employees had tested positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nThe company will suspend operations in a large section of the plant on April 11 and completely shutter the Sioux Falls facility on April 12 and April 13.\n\n\"Smithfield is taking this action out of an abundance of caution for its 3,700 employees in Sioux Falls, a portion of whom have tested positive for COVID-19,\" said a news release sent to media Thursday morning.\n\nWednesday, April 8\n\nMore than 80 cases reported with workers at Smithfield Foods\n\nMore than 80 employees at a Sioux Falls food processing business have tested positive for the coronavirus, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon confirmed Wednesday.\n\n\"There are a number of cases connected, that number has changed every day,\" Malsam-Rysdon said.\n\nShe added that the more than 80 confirmed cases were employees, and that number did not include others who may have become infected from those employees.\n\nSmithfield Foods, Inc. saw its first positive case on March 26, and nearly a week prior officials said the plant would maintain normal operations and would not close or send employees home amid the new coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCases update: Confirmed cases see biggest one-day jump\n\nState health officials confirmed a total of 393 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, in the state of South Dakota as of Wednesday morning.\n\nThat's an increase of 73 confirmed cases, or about 23% — the largest one-day total yet — since Tuesday, when the state had 320 confirmed cases of the disease, according to the South Dakota Department of Health's website. Those numbers don't include tests that are pending in private labs, or people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of people who have died from COVID-19 in the state remained at 6.\n\nMinnehaha County once again was the location of the majority of the new confirmed cases, with 63 more added on Wednesday for a total of 228. Minnehaha County and neighboring Lincoln County, which now has 31 confirmed cases, account for nearly two-thirds of the confirmed cases across the state.\n\nMayor: Sioux Falls has several 'hot spots'\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken announced Wednesday that city officials have identified several areas considered hot spots within Minnehaha County, or areas where the novel coronavirus is spreading rapidly.\n\nTenHaken would not go into specifics of where the hot spots are, but said healthcare officials are working closely with at least one particular employer within the city. The announcement came as part of the city's daily update to media about the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus that's become a global pandemic.\n\nAsked whether the hot spots included Smithfield Foods after employees have raised concerns about working conditions and at least one confirmed positive case has been found within the business, TenHaken did not say the Sioux Falls plant was considered a hot spot directly.\n\nTuesday, April 7\n\nYankton Walmart pharmacy employee tests positive for coronavirus\n\nThe Department of Health is warning people in the Yankton area about the risk of potential exposure to the coronavirus at a Walmart pharmacy.\n\nState health officials said Tuesday that an employee at the Yankton Walmart pharmacy tested positive for COVID-19 and potentially transmitted the virus to others while working shifts on March 25 and March 30.\n\nCase update: Two new deaths, confirmed cases at 320\n\nWith 32 new confirmed cases today, South Dakota has more than 300 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nThe state now has a total of 320 confirmed cases, a number that does not include tests pending at private labs and individuals who have the disease but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of deaths in the state increased to 6.\n\nTenHaken appears on CNN to discuss response\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken was on CNN on Tuesday morning discussing the city's coronavirus response as well as Gov. Kristi Noem's stance on stay-at-home guidelines.\n\nCNN anchor John King prefaced the interview by saying South Dakota was just one of a handful of states that hasn't issued a stay-at-home order even though Noem said 70 percent of the state's population could get infected.\n\nThat's especially important in a state like South Dakota, TenHaken said, because of how mostly rural the state is with a large population center in Sioux Falls.\n\n\"A blanket strategy that you could look at doing, in some cases, is probably hitting a nail with a sledgehammer,\" he said. \"But in places like Sioux Falls where we have the density, I think people would be open to (further restrictions).\"\n\nPOET scales back ethanol production amid slowdown\n\nSioux Falls-based POET announced Tuesday that it will idle ethanol production at some of its facilities amid a drop in demand for gasoline.\n\nThe world’s largest biofuel producer said it would idle production at facilities in Chancellor, S.D., and Ashton and Coon Rapids, Iowa, and delay the start-up of a new plant in Shelbyville, Indiana. The company estimated it would reduce corn demand by 110 million bushels and 330 million gallons of ethanol.\n\nMonday, April 6\n\nNoem executive order puts restrictions on Lincoln, Minnehaha county residents\n\nGov. Kristi Noem plans to extend and more strongly word an executive order related to how the state should operate amid the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"We are at a critical juncture,\" Noem said. \"In order for us to continue to flatten the curve, I'm taking additional steps that will help us do that.\"\n\nThe governor will also issue a separate order specific to the Sioux Falls area urging specific individuals to stay home for three weeks. That includes those who are over 65 years old or who have conditions like diabetes, lung disease, kidney or liver disease, moderate to severe asthma or who have weakened immune systems.\n\n\"I need this group in Minnehaha and Lincoln Counties to stay home,\" Noem said.\n\nGov. Noem says public schools will remain closed the rest of the school year\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced Monday that she's recommending schools to be closed and that online learning be continued through the rest of the year.\n\nThe decision comes after the confirmed number of coronavirus cases neared 300 Monday, and extends her initial recommendation made mid-March for school districts to close through May 1 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to help slow the spread of the virus.\n\n\"It just doesn't make sense to bring our kids back into our school buildings this year,\" Noem said.\n\nThe confirmed cases do not include tests pending in private labs or those who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nMeanwhile, summer classes for all public universities will be online or done remotely, the South Dakota Board of Regents announced Monday.\n\n48 new cases, two more deaths confirmed in South Dakota Monday\n\nSouth Dakota has reported 48 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThe new cases, reported Monday, bring the total number of confirmed cases in South Dakota to 288, a number that does not include tests pending in private labs, or people with or without symptoms who have not been tested.\n\nThe state's death total also increased to 4. It's unclear whether the newly-reported deaths are separate from the deaths of a resident at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community who died from the disease on April 3, or state Rep. Bob Glanzer, who also died on April 3 after being hospitalized with the disease in late March.\n\nMayor TenHaken issues 'stay at home' proclamation for Sioux Falls\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken on Monday issued a proclamation strongly encouraging Sioux Falls residents to stay at home.\n\nThe proclamation outlines recommendations to businesses and residents in the city to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. See the guidelines here.\n\nMeanwhile, TenHaken, along with more than 160 municipal and county officials, signed a letter Monday requesting Gov. Kristi Noem to declare a public health emergency.\n\n\"What little authority counties possess, which is also untested in these circumstances, is cumbersome at best. In these difficult times, local governments need to know with certainty they are able to adequately address the COVID-19 emergency and that all levels of government are working cooperatively,\" the letter states. \"To accomplish this, it is imperative for you to encourage the Secretary of Health to declare a Public Health Emergency in South Dakota with your consent and exercise your authority.\"\n\nSunday, April 5\n\n28 positives reported, increasing to 240 cases\n\nSouth Dakota reported 28 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to 240. That number does not include tests pending in private labs or those who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nOf the new cases, there were 23 new positive tests from Minnehaha County, totaling 104 patients. There were also new confirmed cases in Codington, Lincoln (2), Spink, and Turner counties.\n\nSaturday, April 4\n\nSouth Dakota reports 25 new confirmed coronavirus cases, now at 212\n\nSouth Dakota reported 25 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases to 212.

There were three new cases reported in Yankton, bringing the total to 14, while Lincoln County added two new cases to get to 21 total.\n\nThe state's death total remained at two, but two deaths presumably tied to the coronavirus were reported later Friday night and were not included in the numbers.\n\nCoronavirus claims life of South Dakota lawmaker Bob Glanzer\n\nHuron state Rep. Bob Glanzer has become the fourth known fatality in South Dakota from coronavirus, dying Friday in Sioux Falls, according to his son Thomas Glanzer via Facebook.\n\nGlanzer, 74, had been airlifted to Sioux Falls from Huron on the morning of Tuesday, March 24. The Republican lawmaker told the Argus Leader on March 23 that he had a fever that was worsening and that he received a positive test result the day prior. He said he’d been self-isolating for about a week and didn’t think he’d had contact with others who had tested positive in Beadle County.\n\nFriday, April 3\n\nRetirement home reports state's third death\n\nA resident at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community has died from the COVID-19 virus, according to Avera Health officials.\n\nThe resident was one of three residents who was infected with the virus this week. The other two patients are still being cared for at the facility, according to a news release.\n\nThe age or gender of the person has yet to be released.\n\n“The health and safety of our residents is our priority, and we are deeply saddened by this loss,” said Justin Hinker, administrator for Avera Prince of Peace. “We will take all precautions possible to stop the spread of this virus in our facility.”\n\nUp to 600,000 South Dakotans could get coronavirus, will peak in mid-June\n\nUp to 70% of South Dakotans could get the novel coronavirus, according to projections shared by Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday.\n\nNoem and health experts from the state's major hospital systems on Friday shared projections on how the novel coronavirus will spread throughout the state.\n\nPreviously, Noem had said she expected 30% of the state to become infected by the respiratory illness, but that number has expanded to include up to 70% of the state, or 600,000 people. That's taking into account those who get the virus but will show no symptoms or very minor symptoms.\n\nSanford, Avera to offer rapid testing\n\nBoth of Sioux Falls' major hospital systems will be offering rapid COVID-19 testing.\n\nSanford Health now has the capability to get test results for the disease in 90 minutes, according to a press release by the healthcare system Friday.\n\nAvera will also have rapid testing starting next week, and the expected turnaround is 45 minutes, according to a press release Friday.\n\nConfirmed cases keep rise to 187 in South Dakota\n\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Dakota hit 187 Friday.\n\nThat's with an addition of 22 known cases, a number that doesn't include pending tests or those who are not being tested. The state lab and hospitals are focusing primarily on high-priority cases, meaning those with symptoms who do not fall into high-priority categories may not be tested. The data also does not include people who may have the virus but are asymptomatic.\n\nIn Minnehaha County, the number of confirmed cases rose from 54 to 68. Sioux Falls officials have prohibited certain businesses from having more than 10 patrons on their premises and closed local parks.\n\nThursday, April 2\n\nNoem to call on National Guard to build 100-bed units in South Dakota\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced Thursday she will be requesting help from the National Guard to build up capacity in South Dakota's two major cities to deal with the upcoming surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe National Guard will set up 100-bed supplemental units in Rapid City and Sioux Falls in the coming weeks, state health secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, though it's unclear how soon the units will be ready. Officials have to find the right location first, she said.\n\nThe National Guard will go to those cities first, and then look at other communities across the state that may need help, Noem said.\n\nThe state will use federal funding to help cover the cost to use the National Guard.\n\nNeed to get tested for coronavirus? Here's what it will cost you\n\nSouth Dakotans with health insurance who get tested for the novel coronavirus hitting the country might never see a bill.\n\nBut for those who self-insure or go without, the cost could be hundreds of dollars, depending on where the COVID-19 swab is done.\n\nThe Argus Leader this week requested from the three healthcare systems in South Dakota — the state health office, Sanford Health and Avera Health — that are conducting the most COVID-19 testing how much each is charging for taking a sample, analyzing it and reporting the results back to the patients.\n\nSouth Dakota confirms 36 more cases Thursday\n\nSouth Dakota saw 36 more confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus as of Thursday morning.\n\nThat brings the state's total number of cases to 165 from Wednesday's count of 129 cases, a number that doesn't include the tests pending in private labs, or those without symptoms who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nThis is the largest one-day increase in known cases of the virus so far.\n\nFourteen more cases were confirmed in Minnehaha County, where nearly a third of the state's cases have been confirmed. Sioux Falls officials have prohibited certain businesses from having more than nine patrons on their premises, closed local parks and may issue a stay-at-home order.\n\nThousands more South Dakotans file for unemployment amid COVID-19 turmoil\n\nThousands more South Dakotans filed for unemployment benefits last week, a result of businesses across the state sending workers home and cutting hours amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn total, nearly 2,700 filed unemployment insurance claims with the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation in the week ending March 28. That's on top of the 1,761 who filed for unemployment the week prior, and continues a nationwide trend where a record-setting amount of people are out of work.\n\nWednesday, April 1\n\nSecond death confirmed, total jumps to 129 known cases in South Dakota\n\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has caused the death of a second person in South Dakota, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThat's along with 21 new confirmed cases in the state, including nine more in Minnehaha County — bringing the state's total confirmed cases to 129, a number that doesn't include tests pending in private labs, or people with symptoms who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nThe death announced on April 1 is the second caused by COVID-19 in the state, following the March 9 death of a man in his 60s from Pennington County. The age and gender of the person whose death was announced today is unknown at this time.\n\nQuint Hofer, husband of Mari Hofer, who died suddenly on Saturday morning at a Sioux Falls hospital confirmed that the 51-year-old mother of three from Huron tested positive for COVID-19. Quint Hofer said he received the positive test results Tuesday.\n\nInternet usage up as Midco adjusts to remote work, learning\n\nThe Sioux Falls area’s largest provider of broadband internet is making adjustments as it responds to the growing number of families working and learning from home.\n\nMidco staff noticed a jump in daytime traffic about mid-March as the state of emergency caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, reached Sioux Falls and the rest of South Dakota, forcing cancellations and closers and underlining the need for a home internet connection.\n\nAnticipating the greater need, the Sioux Falls-based telecommunications company made a number of proactive decisions designed to optimize the flow of data across its infrastructure, said Jon Pederson, Midco’s chief technology officer.\n\nVolunteers, businesses sew face masks during COVID-19 outbreak\n\nLinda Hoefert prays over each face mask she sews.\n\nShe prays for the nurse or doctor or technician who will wear the patterned cotton mask. She prays that it helps protect them as they work on the front lines of the COVID-19 outbreak and that the people they are helping would be protected as well.\n\nHoefert is one of several volunteers donating their materials, skills and free time to sew handmade masks for hospitals. While several healthcare systems across the U.S. are running out of protective gear like masks in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, South Dakota-based healthcare systems say they haven't had a shortage of supplies yet.\n\nTuesday, March 31\n\nTwo residents at Avera Prince of Peace test positive for COVID-19\n\nTwo residents at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community in Sioux Falls tested positive for COVID-19, according to a news release from Avera on Tuesday.\n\nNeither resident has needed to be transferred to the hospital, and they were isolated from others as soon as their symptoms appeared, according to the news release.\n\nThe retirement community restricted all visitors to the building two weeks ago, so officials believe the transmission likely came from an employee.\n\nLatest coronavirus numbers report 12 hospitalized\n\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Dakota continue to rise.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health's latest case numbers posted Tuesday morning online show seven more cases were discovered since the same time yesterday.

Forty four people have recovered.\n\nTuesday's new cases were reported in: Kingbury, Lincoln, Minnehaha (4) and Yankton.\n\nThe state has reported one death as a result of COVID-19, a man from Pennington County.\n\nNoem: Cities have public health powers, but counties left out in final legislative day\n\nSouth Dakota cities have the power to take broad measures to stem a public health crisis, Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday, but a similar move to give county governments the same power failed in the final hours of the legislative session.\n\nNoem, speaking hours after the Legislature closed a marathon final day that included the passage of several emergency bills, said lawmakers had good debate on a day that lasted more than 16 hours.\n\n“Well, we got through it,” she said.\n\nRetirement home employee in Clear Lake tests positive for coronavirus\n\nAn employee at the Deuel County Good Samaritan Society in Clear Lake has tested positive for the coronavirus, the retirement home confirmed in a statement.\n\nThe employee has not been publicly identified at this time, nor has the employee’s position at Good Samaritan Society.\n\nThe statement noted the retirement home facility is working closely with federal officials to monitor the situation. Families of residents have been notified that there has been potential exposure from the employee. Extra precautions are being taken to monitor health of the residents and staff, the release said.\n\nSioux Falls closing off parts of parks to limit gatherings\n\nThe city of Sioux Falls is closing portions of parks in Sioux Falls to reduce people from gathering in large groups.\n\nThe restrictions mean basketball hoops will be coming down, playgrounds will be taped off and dog parks will be closed, Mayor Paul TenHaken said. Skateboard parks will also be closed.\n\nThe bike trail will remain open and people can continue to go to parks to walk their dogs or run, but TenHaken wants to limit the number of people who are gathering in groups.\n\nThe restrictions do not affect Falls Park, but the visitor's center there remains closed.\n\nMonday, March 30\n\nHelpline center sets up 24-hour hotline\n\nAvera Health and the Helpline Center are creating a 24-hour hotline for people who need some mental health support because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Helpline officials announced today.\n\nThe hotline will be available immediately, according to a press release from the Helpline Center.\n\nSanford doctor in Watertown tests positive for COVID-19\n\nSanford Clinic of Watertown confirmed Tuesday that Dr. William Devine has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nSanford's policy is not to disclose identifying information regarding patients, but Devine chose to self-identify, according to the health care provider. His exposure is believed to be travel related, and he is now resting at home.\n\nBecause Devine self-isolated as soon as he developed symptoms, Sanford officials believe his exposures to patients was limited. Those who were seen by Devine on or after March 25 will be contacted by the South Dakota Department of Health. Sanford also encourages patients who have had recent contact with Devine to monitor themselves closely and call the Watertown clinic at 605-886-1565 or schedule an e-visit using My Sanford if they have COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nSouth Dakota reaches 101 total confirmed cases Monday\n\nSouth Dakota reported 11 new cases of COVID-19 Monday and brought the lab's pending test number to zero.\n\nThe new numbers provided by the South Dakota Department of Health Monday bring the total confirmed cases in South Dakota to 101.

There is no end date to the resolution.\n\nNoem says special session needed for 'significant' changes to state budget\n\nState lawmakers will meet next week to vote on a number of bills to help the state respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic, but Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday more work will be needed.\n\nThe governor said she's looking to call a special session in June to make \"significant changes\" to the state budget.\n\nNoem plans to sign existing bills in the meantime, but she's not going to spend those funds allocated for the next fiscal year until the state has a clearer picture of how the pandemic will affect state revenues.\n\nTwelve new confirmed cases reported in South Dakota\n\nTwelve new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state as of Friday, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThat brings the state's total to 58 confirmed cases, a number that does not take into account the state's 20 pending tests or those with symptoms who are not being tested.\n\nCommunity spread of the virus has also been confirmed in nine counties with substantial spread in Beadle and Minnehaha.

Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Steve Barnett to postpone the joint city-school district election. In a letter to Noem and Barnett, City Clerk Tom Greco cited several reasons for postponing the election, including disinfecting polling places and poll workers who tend to skew older. Older people have been a key demographic facing serious complications from the Covid-19 pandemic. Greco wrote that 80% of his poll workers are 60 and above.\n\nMunicipal elections scheduled for April 14 across the state face similar dilemmas.\n\nUnemployment office scrambling to keep up with surge in claims\n\nMore than 1,700 people in South Dakota filed for unemployment benefits last week as businesses across the state send workers home amid COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nThe new figures released Thursday morning by the U.S. Department of Labor show the rise in South Dakota claims as well as the surge in claims in unemployment offices nationwide.\n\nIn South Dakota, the 1,703 claims received by the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation was a 907% increase from the 169 claims filed the week prior.\n\nAnd the spike is forcing the department to add staff and phone lines to its call center.\n\nVisiting loved ones in a nursing home during coronavirus\n\nThree times a week Janis Hoogestraat would visit her 92-year-old mother who is in assisted living.

As she rolled her fine, silver hair into curlers, she would tell her mom about what her grandchildren have been up to. They would spend time together looking at photos and reminiscing on the past.\n\nHer visits look a little different now because of the coronavirus. Hoogestraat can no longer paint her mom’s nails but now has to talk to her through the window in her room at Edgewood Assisted Living.\n\nRead more\n\nWednesday, March 25\n\nSen.

Adjustments to the budget could include revision or elimination of the 2% pay increase for teachers, state employees and Medicaid providers originally included in the spending plan.\n\nTenHaken says city going 'as far as we can' to prevent COVID-19 spread\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken addressed reporters and the public Wednesday afternoon to address the advent of community spread of the novel coronavirus in both Minnehaha and Lincoln County.\n\nBecause of substantial community in Minnehaha, meaning five or more confirmed cases whose origin cannot be traced, TenHaken wanted to reiterate the measures his administration is taking to slow the spread.\n\nLincoln County has now seen a moderate level of community spread, TenHaken added.\n\nIn response, TenHaken is recommending that the city board of health enact an ordinance to limit businesses to having fewer than 10 patrons at one time.\n\n\"It's a very strict ordinance,\" TenHaken said. \"It will be enforceable by a Class 2 misdemeanor\"\n\nConfirmed coronavirus cases jump to 13 in Minnehaha County, 'substantial' community spread\n\nEleven more people have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus — eight of them in Minnehaha County, where the South Dakota Department of Health says there is now \"substantial\" community spread.\n\nThe updated numbers from the South Dakota Department of Health say that there are now 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, with 268 tests still pending at the South Dakota Public Health Lab. That doesn't include the number of tests pending in commercial labs.\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Tuesday that he'd heard community spread was likely occurring in the city.\n\nThe increase in Minnehaha County brings the total number of confirmed cases up to 13, the same number as Beadle County where community spread was also confirmed as \"substantial.\" Those two counties have the highest rate of confirmed cases in the state.\n\nTenHaken to recommend mandating businesses limit patrons amid coronavirus spread\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken is recommending the Board of Health and City Council force select businesses not let more than 10 people occupy their buildings at the same time, an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in Sioux Falls.\n\nThe types of businesses that would be affected if the recommendation is adopted will be those listed in an executive order signed by Gov. Kristi Noem earlier this week. Those include bars, restaurants, breweries, cafes, casinos, recreation or athletic facilities, health clubs and entertainment venues.\n\nBusinesses can remain open, but they must comply by allowing no more than 10 people at one time, under the mayor's recommendation. A Class 2 misdemeanor is punishable by a $500 fine and/or up to 30 days in jail.\n\nLawmakers to meet via teleconference on Veto Day due to coronavirus\n\nThe South Dakota Legislature will meet via teleconference for the final scheduled day of this year's legislative session.\n\nLawmakers were scheduled to convene on Monday in Pierre to consider action on any vetoes from Gov. Kristi Noem, but decided to hold the meeting remotely due to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nThe meeting may also be used to consider emergency actions like budget adjustments or legislative action in light of the global pandemic. The public will still be able to listen to the meeting.\n\nSurgeries continue at S.F. Specialty Hospital\n\nThe Sioux Falls Specialty Hospital continues to perform surgeries for patients who are in pain, but those surgeries comply with Gov. Kristi Noem’s order for providers to cease elective surgeries, the hospital’s chief executive officer said Tuesday.\n\nNoem’s executive order said health providers should postpone “all non-essential elective surgeries to conserve (and thereby maximize) supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).”\n\nHospital CEO Dr. Blake Curd said that the facility has been taking steps for weeks to prepare for the pandemic and that the facility is following guidelines set by federal and state officials.\n\nTuesday, March 24\n\nTenHaken: COVID-19 community spread has likely hit county, which would prompt further action\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Tuesday afternoon that he's received updates from contacts in the medical community that community spread of the novel coronavirus has hit Minnehaha County.\n\nAnd if it's confirmed, recommendations to limit the movement of people in Sioux Falls will be coming.\n\nTenHaken relayed the information to the Sioux Falls Board of Health during a meeting at Carnegie Town Hall where the seven-member panel got a briefing on the status of COVID-19 in the community.\n\n\"Even in the last hour, I have received phone calls and information ... that there is likely some confirmed cases of community spread in our county,\" he said during the portion of the meeting when the board received general input from the public. \"If that is confirmed, that raises our response.\"\n\nSchool District staff member tests positive\n\nA staff member at Laura Wilder Elementary has tested positive for COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement released by the Sioux Falls School District.\n\n\"All parents and staff members at Laura Wilder were notified of this confirmed case minutes ago,\" the statement read. \"We have provided guidance from the South Dakota Department of Health to families and staff.\"\n\nIt's unclear if this case is one of the 30 confirmed in South Dakota as of Tuesday, or if this is a new case in the state.\n\nPublic universities to hold remainder of classes online\n\nNow that South Dakota has instances of COVID-19 cases occurring through community spread, classes for South Dakota's six public universities and two special schools will be delivered remotely for the rest of the spring semester.\n\nThe South Dakota Board of Regents made the announcement in a press release Tuesday afternoon. The decision is effective immediately, and the spring semester is scheduled to end May 8, the release states.\n\nGraduations at each university have also been postponed.\n\nNoem: Escaped female inmates from same unit as inmate with COVID-19\n\nEight female inmates left a minimum-security unit in Pierre on Monday, the Department of Corrections said.\n\nThe inmates left the Pierre Community Work Center without authorization at 8:43 p.m. Monday by exiting an exterior door, according to a release from the DOC.\n\nWomen’s prison staff began escape procedures, and law enforcement was notified, according to the news release. The South Dakota Highway Patrol aircraft was used to assist ground operations to search for the inmates.\n\nThe walk-off occurred the same day the South Dakota Department of Health announced one case of COVID-19 at the Pierre Women's Prison, one of seven new cases on Monday. Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday confirmed those who escaped were from the same unit as the inmate who tested positive, but didn't know how close in proximity the women had been.\n\nSouth Dakota schools to remain closed until May; two more cases reported\n\nSouth Dakota schools will remain closed until May 1, Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday.\n\nThe governor said state employees will also continue to work remotely until May 2.\n\nShe added that the state will reevaluate in the coming weeks to see if students will return to school buildings before the end of the school year.\n\n\"With a virus that we're still learning about ... we're making sure that we're making the right decision and keeping kids out of school,\" Noem said.\n\nThe state saw two more positive COVID-19 test results as of Thursday afternoon, bringing the total confirmed positive cases to 30 with hundreds more test results pending.\n\nNoem said Tuesday that an additional two people have recovered from the virus.\n\nThe new cases are in Beadle and Brookings Counties.\n\nNoem also said she's still planning on holding veto day later this month. She's working to find ways to do that remotely, if possible.\n\nTenHaken: Health board and city council won't be taking actions on business closures today\n\nSioux Falls mayor Paul TenHaken says the city's health board and city council will not be taking actions today on whether non-essential businesses can stay open in the city.\n\nThe meeting at 2 p.m. is informational, he said, and the board will be discussing options.\n\n\"Businesses can stay open, but we are really going to be pinging you to operate in the most appropriate fashion,\" TenHaken said.\n\nOn Monday, Governor Kristi Noem issued an executive order that didn't mandate that businesses close, but that they must take actions to frequently clean and limit the number of patrons who are inside the building at a time.\n\nThat puts the onus on business owners, TenHaken said.\n\nSioux Falls police opt for citations, not arrests to prevent coronavirus spread\n\nSome offenses that typically merit a trip to the jail are meriting only citations and an ordered court appearance in light of COVID-19.\n\nBoth the Sioux Falls Police Department and the Minnehaha County Sheriff's Office have shifted priorities over the last couple of weeks to focus on keeping both officers and the community safe.\n\nThe police department last week announced changes to the reporting process for some crimes, urging the public to use online resources to alert police of offenses when a suspect or suspects are not present.\n\nAnd Monday, Police Chief Matt Burns told the Argus Leader that officers have been directed to issue summons and citations \"in lieu of some arrests\" to minimize exposure to the general public while the novel coronavirus continues to be a health threat for the community.\n\nAvera Health closing doors to most to visitors\n\nAvera Health is closing its hospitals to nearly all visitors to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, the Sioux Falls-based health care system announced Tuesday.\n\nThe only exceptions will be for births, pediatric cases, NICU and end-of-life care. Those visitors will be limited, according to Avera's announcement.\n\n“We understand that these restrictions will be difficult for patients, family members, friends and loved ones,\" Chief Medical and Innovation Officer Dr. David Erickson said in an emailed statement. \"Top priority is the protection of everyone, especially those who are most vulnerable.\n\nMonday, March 23\n\nCoronavirus cases could swamp South Dakota hospitals if projections hold\n\nGov. Kristi Noem estimated Monday that 30% of the state’s population is expected to get infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\nThat estimate – which could be optimistic – would likely overrun the state’s medical capacity if cases are not spread out over a period of months. And it underscores why medical leaders have been stressing the need to space out infections over time – the “flatten the curve” approach to managing the disease.\n\nA 30% infection rate in South Dakota would lead to about 265,000 infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that about 20% of people who get infected are ill enough to require hospitalization. The most severe cases require intensive care unit treatment.\n\nThat rate would see about 53,000 hospitalizations.\n\nBut South Dakota doesn’t have nearly enough hospital beds to serve that level of hospitalizations. The South Dakota Department of Health currently licenses 11 hospitals statewide that have a capacity of 2,006 beds.\n\nNoem signs executive order after community spread found in 'several' counties\n\nGov. Kristi Noem signed an executive order on Monday setting a baseline for decision-making related to the novel coronavirus in South Dakota.\n\n\"We are doing this now because we do have community spread in South Dakota in several counties,\" Noem said. \"This is what South Dakotans should do. It is direction on doing the right thing.\"\n\nThe order is intended to set a baseline of guidance for businesses, community owners and health care providers. It recommends businesses limit groups to 10 or fewer and that health care providers stop doing elective surgeries.\n\nLyman, Hughes and Beadle County have seen community spread, Noem said. The Hughes County case is an inmate in the women's prison, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon confirmed.\n\nRead the full executive order.\n\nRemote learning will continue in Sioux Falls schools 'until further notice'\n\nSioux Falls Superintendent Brian Maher says his district is prepared for the possibility of a long-term closure, and that starting Tuesday, students will participate in remote learning until further notice in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMaher made the announcement during a briefing with the press Monday, before the district holds its first school board meeting since Gov. Kristi Noem recommended South Dakota schools be closed this week to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that's affected hundreds worldwide.\n\nAs of Monday, South Dakota had 28 cases, including one death, across the state as well as hundreds of pending tests. Noem announced the state also had its first cases of community spread in multiple areas after an increase in confirmed cases over the weekend.\n\nMinnehaha County, which includes Sioux Falls, currently has five confirmed cases, per state data. The state also closed schools the week prior as a precautionary measure to give school districts a chance to clean facilities and plan for the possibility of an extended closure.\n\nAvera, Sanford labs to begin coronavirus test processing\n\nBoth Avera and Sanford Health announced Monday that they will begin processing tests for coronavirus after winning regulatory approval from the government.\n\nAvera said it would have capacity to process about 200 tests daily, and Sanford said in a separate announcement that it would process 400 tests, with plans to double that capacity in coming weeks.\n\nTests will be processed at both of the systems' Sioux Falls laboratories.\n\nSen. Thune rebukes Democrats for 'dillydallying' over coronavirus bill\n\nU.S. Sen. John Thune accused Democrats of holding up the Senate's coronavirus bill during a partisan debate on the Senate floor on Monday.\n\nThune raised his voice at Democrats in frustration during a debate on the Senate floor that devolved into screaming matches over the $1.8 trillion bill after Senate Democrats blocked the passage of the bill on Sunday. Thune's comments came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had a tense exchange with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., in which Manchin said the bill helps big businesses and Wall Street instead of health care workers and smaller businesses.\n\n\"Really?\" Thune responded. \"Are we going to do that again? Are we going to do this again, you guys coming over here to block votes and use the line that this is a bailout for big corporations?\"\n\nTenHaken recommends closure of non-essential businesses in Sioux Falls\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken said Monday he will recommend that the city health board close non-essential businesses.\n\nWithout a mandate from the state, TenHaken said, he's asked the board to consider closing businesses if the data provided supports that, and it does.\n\n\"We're at that point,\" TenHaken said, citing community spread of the novel coronavirus in Beadle County.\n\nThe health board will meet at 2 p.m. Tuesday. Public Health Director Jill Franken said their discussions will depend on a planned executive order from Gov. Kristi Noem, which is expected to provide clarity to businesses and municipalities across the state.\n\nSeven more cases reported, bringing state's total to 28\n\nGov. Kristi Noem said Monday that 30% of South Dakotans could get sick, according to projections.\n\n\"That is literally tens of thousands of people in our state,\" she said.\n\nThe state saw an increase of seven cases between Sunday and Monday, she added. That brings the state's total to 28. Positive cases of COVID-19 will continue to increase until May or early June, Noem said.\n\nAs the number of cases increase, the governor said she won't be able to specifically address each new case. She encouraged the public to rely on the data from the Department of Health website: http://covid.sd.gov/.\n\nRep. Bob Glanzer of Huron tests positive for coronavirus\n\nRep. Bob Glanzer, a Republican from Huron, has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nHe said he's had a fever that kept ramping up. He received the positive test result on Sunday. He's been self-isolating for about a week and doesn't believe he's had contact with any of the 10 people who have tested positive in Beadle County, he said.\n\nGlanzer, in his second term, represents Beadle and Kingsbury counties in the South Dakota House. He said he's not planning to attend the Legislature's final day on March 30.\n\nSunday, March 22\n\nNoem: Coronavirus won't peak in S.D. until at least May\n\nCoronavirus cases will continue to increase in South Dakota until at least May, according to projections Gov. Kristi Noem shared Sunday.\n\nNoem, in a Facebook live video Sunday afternoon, advised residents that the virus is \"not a short-term thing\" in the state.\n\n\"We will in June, July, August still be watching this trend going through South Dakota,\" Noem said. \"This isn't going to be over in two weeks.\"\n\nNoem also said we will have community spread in South Dakota, likely within days. Seven more cases were reported Sunday, bringing the state's total to 21.\n\nSioux Falls City Council asking governor to postpone election\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken, all eight city councilors and the City Clerk are urging Gov. Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Steve Barnett to take emergency action to postpone Sioux Falls' April 14 election.\n\n\"As Chair of the Sioux Falls City Council, I am writing to you on behalf of my colleagues and Mayor Paul TenHaken. We urgently request that you delay our local election until the June 2, 2020 Primary Election,\" wrote Sioux Falls City Council chairman Marshall Selberg in a letter sent to Pierre Sunday.\n\nIn a separate letter sent to the governor, City Clerk Tom Greco said the novel coronavirus and the response its compelled across the country could hinder Election Day in Sioux Falls, drive down voter turn out and cause voter confusion due to the necessity to change precinct polling places if the election is held next month.\n\nHuron closing restaurants, bars, other businesses\n\nHuron and Beadle County officials closed restaurants, bars and other businesses Sunday afternoon just hours after Gov. Kristi Noem announced that Beadle County had become the nexus for coronavirus cases in the state.\n\nNoem said Sunday morning that Beadle County had six additional cases and the county was on the verge of reaching the stage where coronavirus was being spread throughout the community. Noem called on officials in Beadle County to take action to curtail the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe closures included all recreation facilities, theaters and schools beginning at 12 a.m., as well as the public landfill. It did not apply to groceries or businesses serving off-site food. The closures were until further notice.\n\nWill Sioux Falls shut down businesses? That's up to city council\n\nThe Sioux Falls Board of Health will meet Tuesday to review next steps to combat the spread of COVID-19, which could include asking councilors to OK closing bars and restaurants in the city, the mayor's office said Sunday.\n\nThe development comes just minutes after the mayor of Rapid City on Sunday announced an emergency meeting of the City Council there, in which they will consider an ordinance to enact emergency measures that include the closure of restaurants, bars, coffee houses, clubs, cafes, casinos and recreation facilities.\n\nIn Sioux Falls, Mayor Paul TenHaken has said repeatedly that he can't force private business closures through executive action. His deputy chief of staff, T.J. Nelson, told the Argus Leader Sunday that enforcing that sort of action can only be done through ordinance.\n\nAnd while there's no immediate plans to ask the City Council to do that, Nelson said it will be discussed by the Sioux Falls Board of Health, which will ultimately make any recommendations on further action to be taken up by councilors.\n\nHuron, Beadle County officials hold emergency meeting after more cases announced\n\nHuron and Beadle County officials are in an emergency meeting this afternoon after Gov. Kristi Noem called on local officials to take more measures to halt the spread of coronavirus.\n\nNoem on Sunday announced that six new cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Beadle County and that community spread was likely just days away. The county has the most cases in the state with 10 of the 21 announced.\n\nA joint city/county commission meeting was not open to the public. During the meeting, Huron Police Capt. Mark Johnson said Mayor Paul Aylward had been on the phone with Noem to discuss available options and what legal authority local officials have to enact more stringent measures.\n\n“Right now we want the public to know we are on top of this,” Johnson said.\n\nSeven more cases reported in South Dakota\n\nGov. Kristi Noem released more details on the confirmed positive novel coronavirus cases in South Dakota. Six of the seven new cases were in Beadle County. Here's the breakdown of the demographics of those cases:\n\nMale, age 60-69\n\nFemale, age 50-59\n\nFemale, age 20-29\n\nMale, age 20-29\n\nFemale, age 10-19\n\nMale, age 10-19\n\nThe seventh new case is a 60-69 year old man from Brown County. His case was related to travel.\n\nNoem said the new cases in Beadle County were related to the existing cases. After initial conversations\n\n\"Beadle County could be in a community spread situation within a manner of days,\" she said.\n\nSaturday, March 21\n\nLatest data from state shows little change, unclear how many tests run\n\nThe latest coronavirus data from the South Dakota Department of Health showed little change Saturday.\n\nNo new positive COVID-19 test results were reported, leaving the number of confirmed cases at 14. It is unclear both how many pending tests were run since the latest results Friday and how many new tests have been received by the state in the same time period.\n\nThe number of negative cases saw a decrease, but that number no longer shows a clear picture of the state's results. Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said that commercial labs processing tests from South Dakota were not sending the number of negative results, only the positives.\n\nFriday, March 20\n\nNoem to Trump: State had to get 'pushy' for chemical to run coronavirus tests\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem expressed her frustration at not being able to get a chemical to process coronavirus tests to the president and his leadership team during a call with governors on Thursday.\n\nSouth Dakota’s backlog of unprocessed kits grew to 385 after the state ran out of reagents earlier this week. The state lab in Pierre, where the processing is done, was able to resume on Thursday after getting some of the processing chemical.\n\nOn the call with President Trump, Noem said the state had to get “a little pushy with a few people” in order to get the supplies. She questioned how the testing agents were being triaged by the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n“I just don’t want to not be a priority area because we’re a smaller state and less populated,” Noem said.\n\nTrump responded: “That will never happen to you, and it will never happen to your state.”\n\nSouth Dakota moves to cancel standardized testing amid coronavirus concerns\n\nSouth Dakota Secretary of Education Ben Jones is asking the federal Department of Education to cancel annual standardized tests for K-12 students.\n\nJones announced Friday that he'll be applying for a waiver with the department.\n\nThe waiver would allow the state to complete the school year without state assessments and standardized tests for third through eighth grade and 11th grade students.\n\nWith the school closures brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic, Jones said any testing done this year wouldn't provide useful data.\n\nNumbers unchanged from Thursday\n\nSouth Dakota reported no additional testing of COVID-19 Friday morning, a day after about 100 tests were completed after needed testing resources were delivered to the state.\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced on Thursday three additional presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. According to an update on the South Dakota Department of Health website, that number didn't change as of noon Friday because the state did an update Thursday night. The total reported positive cases in the state remained at 14.\n\nThe state announced on Wednesday that it had run out of supplies to test the samples collected from patients on Monday. The state lab resumed testing Thursday on what they called high-priority cases after receiving reagent, a substance or mixture used in chemical analysis or other reactions.\n\nSioux Falls officials plead with residents to practice 'social distancing' this weekend\n\nSioux Falls officials have an important message for residents heading into the weekend: Don't give up on practicing social distancing.\n\n\"I can't stress this enough,\" Sioux Falls Public Health Director Jill Franken said. \"With the weekend coming, continue to practice social distancing for the entire health of the community.\"\n\nEven though there has been no reported community spread, Franken said people need to remain diligent.\n\n\"We do not have a vaccine to protect people in our community,\" Franken said. \"Our only course of action is to follow recommended community mitigation efforts. ... Given that our cases have remained steady, what we are doing is working, but we can't get into a false sense of security because we don't have community spread yet.\"\n\nThursday, March 19\n\nThree more cases reported in state\n\nGov. Kristi Noem said the state tested 94 high-priority COVID-19 tests on Thursday. Three of those came back positive, all from Beadle County. The infectious disease team is working to determine if any of those cases indicate community spread.\n\nNone of those cases required hospitalization, Noem said. Ages ranged from 30 to 60, and the cases were two men and one woman, though more specific information wasn't available.\n\nThat brings the total number of positive tests to 14, with 663 negative and 270 pending.\n\nNoem says testing will resume today\n\nThe number of pending COVID-19 tests in South Dakota continues to rise after the state public health lab ran out of supplies to run the tests, though Governor Kristi Noem said some high-risk tests would be processed Thursday.\n\nThere are now 385 pending tests for the new coronavirus, according to the South Dakota Department of Health. No new deaths have been reported, and the number of positive cases remains at 11 and the number of negative cases remains at 551.\n\nTenHaken closing all non-essential city buildings\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken is closing the few city-owned buildings in Sioux Falls that remained open after the city's COVID-19 response already shut the majority of them down.\n\nTenHaken said during a morning news briefing Thursday the closure of the City Center administration building and City Hall, as governments across the country continue to respond to the novel coronavirus. The closures are effective as of noon on Thursday.\n\nScheduled public meetings will continue at Carnegie Town Hall, though that building will also be closed when those proceedings are not in session.\n\nSioux Falls police urge online crime reporting to limit officers' exposure to public\n\nSioux Falls police are modifying the way they respond to certain calls, by asking the public to file online reports when possible in an effort to limit officers' exposure to others in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSpokesman Sam Clemens said if someone wants to file a police report, and the suspect is present, to call police right away. For everything else, online reports are encouraged.\n\nAvera announces postponement of some elective surgeries\n\nAvera Health announced Thursday that it will suspend some of its elective surgeries amid concerns over coronavius response.\n\n“Our physicians are working to balance patient safety and quality with the resources available. These resources include protective equipment like gowns and masks and intensive care beds,” said Dr. Kevin Post, MD, Chief Medical Officer for Avera Medical Group. “We emphasize that we are looking to postpone procedures, rather than canceling them altogether.”\n\nThe decision comes as hospitals across the country ramp up for an expected wave of coronavirus patients.\n\nHow the state plans to move forward with COVID-19 testing\n\nState lab officials were relieved Wednesday to receive \"critical\" supplies to test a hundreds-deep backlog of COVID-19 kits, and they're looking ahead to get more testing capabilities.\n\nGov. Kristi Noem on Thursday announced that the state had received testing supplies and could begin testing the most critical samples immediately.\n\nThe state, Noem said, received a shipment of reagent a substance or mixture for use in chemical analysis or other reactions.\n\nIn statewide situation update conference calls Thursday morning, state public health lab leaders advised healthcare providers to send the lab samples from the most critical patients.\n\nWhitney: Will social distancing tear us apart? Not on your life.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 10, there was little indication that our world was changing forever.\n\nMy biggest concern was finding a parking spot to cover the Summit League women’s basketball finals at the Denny Sanford Premier Center, where nearly 8,000 fans turned out to watch South Dakota defeat South Dakota State for a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this is a magical time of year. March Madness is tipping off, spring break finds its footing, baseball is around the corner and outdoor wonders await. People are ready to expand their daily experience amid the lingering woes of winter.\n\nThat Tuesday night, I returned to watch the Summit League men’s finals with my son, greeting familiar faces in the concourse. As we took in the action, commenting on the players, there was no way to know that it would be the last stretch of normalcy we’d experience for a while.\n\nWednesday, March 18\n\nAirport taking hit as outgoing travel plummets\n\nTraffic at the Sioux Falls Regional Airport is down dramatically as travelers respond to coronavirus concerns, causing a significant drop in revenue.\n\nIncreasingly strict guidelines for travel and social gathering have already created what will be a lasting financial impact for Sioux Falls' airport and its airlines, which are likely just days away from announcing significant schedule reductions, said Dan Letellier, the airport's executive director.\n\nThe bulk of the decrease so far is a drop in outgoing travelers as people look to cancel their trips, though the Sioux Falls airport is still seeing travelers returning earlier from trips.\n\n\"The people you're seeing are those trying to get home,\" Letellier said.\n\nTenHaken urges businesses to adhere to 'no more than 10' gathering guidelines\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken says there are no plans to mandate the closure of bars or restaurants in Sioux Falls.\n\nTenHaken said he doesn't have the authority to do so, but he is strongly recommending that restaurants, bars and other businesses where people gather adhere \"religiously\" to the recommendation that no more than 10 people gather in one place at one time.\n\nSen. John Thune says coronavirus needs 'swift and bold response' from federal government\n\nU.S. Sen. John Thune said the federal government needs to restore confidence in the U.S. economy and provide a \"swift and bold response\" to the coronavirus.\n\nThe stock market's drop in recent weeks due to the coronavirus is \"very concerning,\" Thune said in a media call on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think what's important right now is to calm the markets and to restore the confidence, is to demonstrate that our leadership in this country understands what's at stake and is prepared to go big and go bold and take the decisive action that's necessary to restore confidence,\" Thune said.\n\nWhat you need to know about collecting unemployment amid COVID-19 fallout\n\nThe country's response to the novel coronavirus is expected to put thousands, if not millions, out of work, with those in the food service industry heavily affected.\n\nUndoubtedly, many South Dakotans will fall into that category. That's why various funds are being set up to help soften the blow of the economic fallout from forced quarantines and closures.\n\nFor those who find themselves left without a job entirely, the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation offers unemployment benefits for those who qualify.\n\nSouth Dakota's public health lab lacking COVID-19 test supplies\n\nThe South Dakota public health lab hasn't had the supplies needed to run COVID-19 tests since Monday, according to a state update.\n\nThe state didn't receive the supplies it needed and there isn't a time frame for when the supplies will be available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or commercial suppliers, according to an update emailed by state epidemiologist Josh Clayton. He noted that there's a nationwide shortage of the supplies needed to run the tests.\n\nTuesday, March 17\n\nS.D. will not have school next week, Noem says\n\nSouth Dakota schools will not be in session again next week, Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday afternoon.\n\nNoem was in Sioux Falls this afternoon to meet with medical providers about COVID-19 after meeting with her Cabinet this morning.\n\n\"We will not be holding school next week in the state of South Dakota,\" Noem told reporters during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nCancelling school will give the state time to ensure adequate lab testing and supplies are in place for \"whatever may come our direction,\" the governor said.\n\nMayor wants $250K for 'One Sioux Falls' fund\n\nThe mayor's office is asking Sioux Falls City Councilors to set aside $250,000 for a new fund to help those who lose paychecks over COVID-19 quarantines and closures.\n\nAs proper safety guidelines change by the day, Sioux Falls businesses, owners and workers face uncertain times with financial hits as the only certainty. That's why a fund has been established to help people in Sioux Falls negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus and the quarantines in place.\n\nThe fund is set up in collaboration with the Sioux Falls Area Community Foundation, which will benefit residents in the greater Sioux Falls area and help avoid evictions and financial hardships if they are unable to work while closures and work restrictions last. It would also help them if they are unable to qualify for federal or state assistance.\n\nMinnehaha County reports new case, bringing state's total to 11\n\nOne positive COVID-19 case was reported in Minnehaha County on Tuesday, bringing the county's total to five cases.\n\nThe case was the only new positive case in South Dakota. The state as a total 11 positive COVID-19 cases and 551 negative tests as of Tuesday, according to the state Department of Health. The state had 35 pending cases on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe new case in Minnehaha County is a woman in her 50s, according to the health department.\n\nAvera, Sanford joining forces on coronavirus testing\n\nThe laboratories of Avera Health and Sanford Health will work together to begin processing coronavirus test results, the chief executive officers of the two regional health systems said Tuesday.\n\n“We’re made for this,” Avera CEO Bob Sutton said. “This is a calling we all have.”\n\nSanford CEO Kelby Krabbenhoft said the systems hope to be able to process hundreds of tests by the end of week to speed up results. The goal, he added, is to manage the disease as it works through the community.\n\n“It’s going to take its toll,” Krabbenhoft said. “It’s not going to be avoidable.”\n\nTesting is a key to monitoring and detecting the disease, and Avera Chief Medical Officer David Erickson said health officials want to do more. The two health entities working together can speed up getting those results to patients.\n\nSioux Falls to limit limit public gatherings at city-owned buildings to 10 people\n\nSioux Falls officials are asking the city council to limit the number of people who can gather at city-owned buildings at 10 people.\n\nThe Sioux Falls City Council will consider the regulations Tuesday night during its weekly meeting.\n\nThe new recommendation comes a day after the city proposed limiting public gatherings to 50 people. CDC and President Trump revised that guidance to 10 people Monday morning, and Sioux Falls is following suit.\n\nRestaurants and bars are not being forced to close, but Mayor Paul TenHaken says he is encouraging restaurants to offer delivery or drive-up service for food. He said bars and restaurants do not have to close, but they should limit how many people can be in the same proximity.\n\nHere's what we know about COVID-19 testing in state\n\nSouth Dakota now has COVID-19 tests for about 3,200 people after state officials said they requested more last week.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health will continue to request additional testing supplies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as needed, according to department spokesman Derrick Haskins.\n\n\"This is a very rapidly evolving area of South Dakota's response to COVID-19,\" he said.\n\nSouth Dakota's public health lab in Pierre is still able to provide test results to the requesting medical provider on the same day that it's tested at the lab, according to Haskins. The CDC has stopped requiring states to send tests to the federal agency for confirmation and has also stopped requiring two tests per person. A nasal swab is now only taken for the test. The decrease in per-person tests means providers can conserve the specimen collection supplies, he said.\n\nMonday, March 16\n\nNoem confirms one death in S.D. related to COVID-19\n\nGov. Kristi Noem confirmed Monday that one death in South Dakota can be directly linked to the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe governor addressed media and the public Monday afternoon after the state saw one additional positive case bringing the total number of positive tests to 10. The state has 494 negative tests and none pending, as of noon Monday.\n\nShe said her heart goes out to the family during this difficult time. The person who died was a resident of Pennington County but had not been in that county for two weeks prior to his death. He was in Davison County at the time of his death. His death had previously been announced last week, but Noem said at the time it wasn't clear if the coronavirus was the direct cause of death.\n\nMeanwhile, the state lab had up until this point been able to get test results back to patients within 24 hours, but due to lack of supplies to run the tests, results may take up to 48 hours. High- and medium-risk tests will be prioritized, Noem said, and she expects the delayed test results to be a very short-term situation.\n\nPublic universities moving classes online\n\nBeginning March 23, all classes at all public universities in South Dakota will be moved online temporarily, according to a press release Monday from the South Dakota Board of Regents.\n\nOn-campus and in-person classes are currently scheduled to resume April 6, the release states.\n\nThe regents are expected to revisit the situation and communicate any potential additional changes March 27.\n\nWhat's next for Sioux Falls schools?\n\nSuperintendent Brian Maher said it's too early to tell what the next steps could be, but he answered as many questions as he could during a media briefing with the Mayor Paul TenHaken, and Sioux Falls Public Health officials Monday.\n\n\"Our chief role is the development of students,\" Maher said. \"Almost always that development is academic in nature, but our role has changed from an academic responsibility to a social responsibility. Part of that responsibility is closing down our schools this week, and then who knows. That may be the beginning of this interruption.\"\n\nClick here for what schools are doing.\n\nSDHSAA cancels spring high school sports through April 5\n\nThe spring sports season has been canceled through April 5 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to a South Dakota Activities Association memo to member schools obtained by the Argus Leader.\n\nPractice for spring sports/activities is a \"local decision,\" the email reads, with schools asked to make the decision based on CDC guidance, state entity guidance, local information, the number of participants involved, the nature of the activity and local control.\n\nAdditionally, state basketball tournaments remain \"suspended/postponed\" at this time, as do all-state band and region music contests.\n\nOne new coronavirus case reported in Minnehaha County\n\nOne new positive COVID-19 case was reported in South Dakota on Monday after a weekend of no new cases.\n\nThe new case is a man in his 20s in Minnehaha County, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThe new case brings the state to 10 positive COVID-19 cases. The number of negative tests is at 494, as of Monday.\n\nAll 10 cases resulted from travel out of state, the Department of Health said.\n\nSioux Falls planning to restrict gatherings to 50 people at city-owned buildings\n\nThe city of Sioux Falls is moving forward with a plan restricting public gatherings to 50 people or less in city-owned facilities based on CDC guidance.\n\nJill Franken, Public Health Director for the City of Sioux Falls, said the City Council will be discussing the plan to limit gatherings at city-owned facilities to 50 people at it's next city council meeting. The CDC guidance was for eight weeks, but it's unclear how long the restrictions will be for Sioux Falls.\n\nA state of emergency issued last week limited gatherings to 250 people at city-owned facilities.\n\nFranken is urging business owners and residents to also restrict gatherings to 50 people or less.\n\nAmerican Red Cross closes physical locations in South Dakota\n\nBoth chapters of the American Red Cross in South Dakota have closed their physical locations in response to the spread of the new coronavirus in the state.\n\nGretchen Hjelmstad, Regional Communications Officer and Marketing Director for the American Red Cross' Dakotas Region, said that non-essential staff will work remotely \"for the foreseeable future,\" but the organization will otherwise be operating as normal.\n\nNot many staff members work in the offices, Hjelmstad said, but the buildings can get a lot of foot traffic at times.\n\nAnyone in need of service should use the region's website or call the appropriate chapter's office number, Hjelmstad said. The 24/7 disaster hotline will also remain staffed.\n\nHere's what South Dakota daycares should be doing amid coronavirus concerns\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Social Services is urging childcare providers to take precautions to ensure the health and safety of children and families amid concerns about COVID-19.\n\nGov. Noem has asked the department to work closely with childcare providers across the state to institute commonsense practices to assist families in need, while also safeguarding the health of all South Dakotans.\n\nThose practices include:\n\nCovering coughs, staying home when sick and enhancing already required hand washing and sanitizing practices\n\nLimiting entry into the facility or home by putting into practice child drop off at the front door\n\nAssessing potential risk with staff and parents from travel to affected areas\n\nEnsuring that employees and children are not admitted when ill. Those showing signs of illness should be sent home and advised to call their primary healthcare provider for further screening and testing, if necessary\n\nReducing, postponing or cancelling events and gatherings, especially those involving large groups or exposure to the public\n\nUsing spring break or temporary closures while children are away to deep clean and disinfect the facilities, especially surfaces and items in high-touch areas. The CDC provides guidance regarding cleaning and disinfection\n\nImplementing regular deep-clean practices in addition to daily cleaning\n\nCoordinating with DSS licensing specialists, local public health officials and emergency management\n\nNoem working to activate business loan program amid coronavirus\n\nGov. Noem announced on Monday that she's working with the U.S. Small Business Administration to help South Dakota businesses affected by COVID-19.\n\nThe Governor's Office is working with the SBA to activate the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program in South Dakota to help eligible small businesses and nonprofits impacted by COVID-19, according to the announcement.\n\nAffected small businesses and nonprofits need to download, complete and submit the EIDL worksheet.

The cities of Birmingham and Anniston called off their parades in recent days as caseloads and hospitalizations increase across the state. The cities of Bessemer, Gadsden and Madison were among those that previously called off their Christmas parades, citing safety concerns related to the virus. Some places are still planning events like tree lightings that residents can watch online, and other places are creating alternative events. Hartselle plans a contest in which residents can compete for prizes by decorating their homes. Tuscaloosa announced a “reverse” parade in which people can stay in their cars and drive past decorated floats in a park, but organizers canceled it, citing low participation.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Bars and restaurants in the city will be closed for indoor service, employers must allow people to work from home if possible, and many businesses will be limited to 25% capacity for the month of December as the state’s largest city tries to stem the increase in coronavirus cases, Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson said Wednesday. The new rules go into effect Tuesday and don’t end until Jan. 1, she said during a teleconference. “Today, we find ourselves in a situation that nobody wants to be in. There are no easy answers, but we must act because continuing on this path is the worst of all bad options,” she said. The director of the Anchorage Health Department, Heather Harris, said the agency “has been waving red flags for weeks as we have experienced record-breaking case counts.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With their annual Thanksgiving meal for disadvantaged students canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak, alumni from one local community college held a drive-thru food distribution Tuesday so people could cook their own holiday dinner. The vehicles of 100 students who signed up beforehand lined up in the Phoenix College parking lot. Masked staff and volunteers placed a bag with turkey, mashed potatoes, pie and other fixings in the back of each vehicle. It’s an example of how traditional meals for the disadvantaged have had to be reimagined this year to prevent spread of the virus even as the ranks of the needy have grown. “A lot of the students are focused on trying to figure out what they are going to eat” for Thanksgiving, said Monique Briones, a nursing student helping distribute food. She also signed up for her own family to receive food for a holiday meal donated by the Phoenix College Alumni Association. Briones is living with her boyfriend, their five children and his parents during the pandemic.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state hit another record high Wednesday, crossing the 1,000 mark for the first time since the pandemic began. The state saw an increase of 40 virus hospitalizations to bring the current number to 1,028, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. That tops Tuesday’s record high of 988 hospitalizations. Arkansas reported 1,965 new cases and 20 more deaths. One in every 243 people in Arkansas tested positive in the past week, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. “While we express our thanks across the state in smaller groups than normal years, I am more grateful than ever for the dedication of our health care workers,” Hutchinson said in a statement. “The new hospitalizations today adds to the burden, and let’s all go the extra mile to protect each other.” On Tuesday, the state’s largest school district said it would temporarily switch to virtual learning after the Thanksgiving break because so many teachers were quarantined because of the virus. The 22,000-student Springdale School District said classes will be remote until Dec. 7 because of a shortage of available substitute teachers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state reported a record number of coronavirus cases Wednesday as Los Angeles restaurants prepared to close for three weeks and as firefighters in Silicon Valley were being enlisted to enforce public health rules to try to halt the spread of infections. Cases of COVID-19 have been climbing at an alarming rate for weeks and hit a new high of 18,350 recorded Tuesday, surpassing a previous record of more than 15,000 cases announced Saturday, state officials said. The seven-day average of positive tests has gone from 5.3% to 6.5% in the past week. “We are really, really concerned,” said Dr. Marty Fenstersheib, COVID-19 testing officer for Santa Clara County. “All of the metrics that we have been following, that have done well in previous months, are now going up very steeply. Our positivity rate in our county is rising and especially in our most affected communities.” Nearly all of the state is now under a 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew and subject to the strictest regulations for businesses to operate, including a ban on indoor dining and limited capacity in stores. But Los Angeles has gone even further. As cases spiked in the past week, it ordered restaurants to stop serving meals after Wednesday night and has been mulling another stay-home order.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis warned Tuesday that some restaurant owners who defy or ignore strict state health orders to stem spread of the coronavirus could lose their licenses to operate. Colorado’s restaurant sector has been hit hard during the pandemic, with many forced to close and thousands of workers laid off. In recent days, restaurants in counties designated “red” by the state in a color-coded scheme that gauges increasing COVID-19 infection cases have been forced to halt indoor dining. “Every business in the state of Colorado needs to follow our laws and, whether you agree with it or not, in red counties, not having indoor dining is the law of Colorado,” Polis said. “Any type of business that violates a health order, whether it’s hepatitis, salmonella or COVID … could lose their license to operate.” The Democratic governor’s comments came after several Loveland businesses in Larimer County signed a letter stating that they will continue operating at full indoor capacity even though the county was placed in the “red” restriction category Tuesday. Polis said government financial aid for the restaurant sector is coming – possibly in the form of sales tax breaks – when the Legislature convenes in a special session next week.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A small number of flagrant violations and concerns about the holiday shopping season prompted Gov. Ned Lamont to impose a steep, new $10,000 fine on businesses that break the state’s coronavirus rules. The new fine was to replace the current $500 maximum penalty beginning at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, the Democratic governor announced Tuesday evening. A small number of restaurants have been cited for essentially operating as bars, which have been ordered closed during the pandemic. The governor said the harsher fine was the result of concerns by municipal leaders, public health officials and people in the business community. He also cited concerns about keeping workers and customers safe during Black Friday and the rest of the holiday shopping season. The state has an array of rules on businesses during the pandemic. Restaurants, for example, are limited to 50% capacity, with a maximum of eight people per table, and must stop inside dining service at 9:30 p.m. Local health directors or other municipal officials can issue the fines with the support of police.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State officials are inviting residents to get outside Friday as an alternative to going shopping, especially amid rising coronavirus case numbers. Officials are waiving state park and Brandywine Zoo entry fees on Black Friday as part of the nationwide #OptOutside movement. State parks will open at 8 a.m., with the exception of Fort Delaware State Park, which is closed for the season. The Brandywine Zoo and its new Madagascar Exhibit featuring rare lemurs and radiated tortoises will be open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Reservations are required by calling, and members can reserve time at the zoo online. Visitors who are kindergarten age or older must bring face coverings with them to enter a park and wear them when they cannot maintain social distancing from other visitors.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As a second wave of the pandemic meets a second blood shortage nationwide, the Red Cross in the D.C. region reported a “grave” scarcity of convalescent plasma, WUSA-TV reports. The critical liquid part of the blood in COVID-19 survivors can be harnessed and used to treat coronavirus patients in intensive care. Blood plasma from coronavirus survivors contains antibodies, which may help trigger immune responses in people severely stricken by the virus. The Red Cross is now testing all blood, platelet and plasma donations for coronavirus antibodies, so if donors didn’t know they once had the virus, their plasma can help patients in dire need of treatment. “The need for convalescent plasma supersedes all the needs that we have right now,” Red Cross spokesperson Regina Boothe Bratton said. The Red Cross is imploring people looking for ways to help over the holidays to visit the organization's blood donation website and schedule an appointment. The organization said it generally experiences a blood shortage between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, but COVID-19 has compounded the problem.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A popular waterfront festival has been postponed amid a surge in confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state. The annual parade Gasparilla Pirate Fest that attracts about 200,000 people to Tampa’s downtown waterfront is typically held every January but is now planned for mid-April amid continuing health care concerns. Organizers said they consulted with city leaders and health care providers and decided to postpone the festival until next spring to restrict events that attract large crowds. Meanwhile, the Miami Herald said Miami Beach hotels were experiencing last-minute bookings for the Thanksgiving holiday week that may get them near full occupancy for the first time since they were forced to shut down to curb the spread of coronavirus in March. Other events in the state that attract large crowds in the winter such as Art Basel have already been scrapped. The prestigious December art fair draws collectors, socialites and celebrities from around the world.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: As the ravages of the coronavirus forced millions of people out of work, shuttered businesses and shrank the value of retirement accounts, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged to a three-year low. But for Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., the crisis last March signaled something else: a stock buying opportunity. And for the second time in less than two months, Perdue’s timing was impeccable. He avoided a sharp loss and reaped a stunning gain by selling and then buying the same stock: Cardlytics, an Atlanta-based financial technology company on whose board of directors he once served. On Jan. 23, as word spread through Congress that the coronavirus posed a major economic and public health threat, Perdue sold off $1 million to $5 million in Cardlytics stock at $86 a share before it plunged, according to congressional disclosures. Weeks later, in March, after the company’s stock plunged further following an unexpected leadership shake-up and lower-than-forecast earnings, Perdue bought the stock back for $30 a share, investing between $200,000 and $500,000. Those shares have now quadrupled in value, closing at $121 a share Tuesday.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: The first coronavirus death on the island of Kauai has been reported. Mayor Derek Kawakami announced in a statement Monday that an elderly resident with no travel history died. COVID-19 has killed 232 others in Hawaii. “It is heartbreaking to report this news especially as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches this week,” Kawakami said. “As a community, we share in this painful loss together and we extend our sincere prayers, love and aloha to the family and loved ones of this individual.” Another Kauai resident died in Arizona earlier this year, The Garden Island reports. Kawakami said Tuesday that he wants to reinstate a requirement that all travelers arriving in his jurisdiction quarantine for 14 days, regardless of whether they have obtained a negative coronavirus test. Kauai had no cases of community spread of the coronavirus for several months starting in July. But it’s had six cases of community spread since Oct. 15, when the state began allowing travelers to bypass the two-week quarantine if they tested negative for the disease 72 hours before arriving. Kawakami asked Gov. David Ige for permission to temporarily opt out of the pre-travel testing program.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has proposed using millions of dollars in coronavirus relief aid to have additional safety technology including “walk-through disinfectant cubes” installed at the state Capitol in Boise. McGeachin, a Republican, promoted the “very high-tech equipment” manufactured by Xtreme Manufacturing in Las Vegas to reporters Tuesday while criticizing Republican Gov. Brad Little’s coronavirus response, the Idaho Press reports. “A person can walk through a cube and be disinfected from head to toe, including on the bottom of their feet,” she said. But the technology has been widely disputed. The National Institutes of Health published a study in June that found “walk-through sanitation gates” were ineffective and potentially dangerous, noting that the practice violates World Health Organization standards. “Fumigation is meant for inanimate objects and surfaces, and it should never be used on people,” the study said. The proposal calls for spending about $17 million, including $80,000 for two walk-through disinfectant cubes, three mobile units for emergency overflow and staffing for the units.\n\nIllinois\n\nLaSalle: State officials are investigating a coronavirus outbreak at a veterans nursing home in rural Illinois that has infected nearly 200 residents and staff and killed 27 veterans. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office and the state’s Department of Veterans Affairs are attempting to determine what caused the outbreak at the state-run LaSalle Veterans Home in LaSalle, about 90 miles southwest of Chicago. The department on Tuesday requested an independent probe into the facility, which was the focus of a state Senate committee virtual hearing on the outbreak. “The tragedy of what has unfolded at the veterans’ home cannot be understated,” said state Sen. Sue Rezin, who represents the district where the home is located. The current outbreak was identified in late October when a staff member and a resident tested positive for the virus. Since the beginning of November, two-thirds of residents and employees have tested positive, according to the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. State officials have increased staff testing at the facility, and the governor said an infection control team was sent to the home.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University plans to reward its faculty and staff with a $750 bonus for their “heroic work” keeping the West Lafayette campus open amid the coronavirus pandemic, school officials announced Wednesday. The university said more than 15,000 faculty, staff and graduate student staff hired before Sept. 1 will get the money in their checks in December. Part-time staff will get a prorated amount. Purdue President Mitch Daniels said staff in executive-level positions will not get the $750 bonus. Daniels congratulated faculty and staff in a campuswide letter sent Wednesday morning for getting through the in-person portion of the fall semester. He called the bonus an “appreciation award” for their work that kept the campus open during the pandemic. “I admit I was far from certain that even a collection of can-do problem-solvers like ours could pull off that achievement,” Daniels wrote in the letter. “Well, we’re here, and only because of the collective effort we could only imagine in August.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state reported its highest single-day increase in COVID-19 deaths Wednesday, topping the mark set one week prior. The Iowa of Department of Public Health reported another 47 deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. In total, 2,271 people with COVID-19 have died in Iowa, according to the state’s Coronavirus.Iowa.gov website. Another 3,365 coronavirus cases were added to the state’s tally Wednesday. The increases come as Iowa hospitals struggle with the coronavirus surge. On Tuesday, Dr. Tammy Chance, the chairperson of the Iowa Hospital Association, warned that the Iowa hospital region that includes the state’s most populous area has at times in the last week been down to two or three intensive care unit beds as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of beds and staffing shortages have forced some Iowa hospitals to transfer patients to other facilities, said Kirk Morris, the president of the association. Other doctors said their regions were experiencing similar shortages.\n\nKansas\n\nGreat Bend: Resistance to masks appears to be weakening as the coronavirus surges, straining the capacity of the state’s hospitals. Gov. Laura Kelly’s latest effort to require face coverings took effect Wednesday, although Kansas law still allows the state’s 105 counties to opt out. Most counties did so the first time Kelly tried to require masks in July. But with the average new case numbers more than nine times higher now than then, there appears to be less pushback. The governor told reporters Tuesday that adoption of mask orders by counties had so far been “pretty good,” The Wichita Eagle reports. “I think it’s because people are so much more aware of how serious this is, how widespread it is,” Kelly said. “And it is no longer an urban issue. I mean, it’s clearly from border to border.” In Barton County, commissioners voted Tuesday to unanimously adopt a countywide mask mandate that went into effect immediately. The commission had rejected mandates twice before, instead appealing to the public to do the right thing. Enforcement is an oft-cited concern. “I don’t want to be on the wrong side of history when it goes down and says we did nothing,” Barton County Commissioner Jennifer Schartz said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Payments that are part of a federal program to aid those unemployed because of the ongoing pandemic will end this weekend under federal rules, affecting roughly 4,700 Kentuckians, the Kentucky Labor Cabinet said Tuesday. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Labor notified the state agency that the number of people receiving extended benefit unemployment insurance as a percentage of the labor force had fallen below the qualifying threshold for the state to continue dispersing funds under the program. As a result, the state will be barred from such payments for a minimum of 13 weeks. Kentucky’s seasonally adjusted preliminary October unemployment rate was 7.4%, the Kentucky Education and Workforce Development Cabinet announced last week. The preliminary October jobless rate was up nearly 2 percentage points from September. Gov. Andy Beshear said there was no recourse to reverse the federal agency’s decision and acknowledged that Kentucky families are hurting financially because of the pandemic. After Saturday, no new applications will be accepted, and claimants who have yet to exhaust all benefits will not receive the balance of their funds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Caddo Parish is weighing whether to pay $500 to families who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Legislation was introduced Nov. 19 by Caddo Parish Commissioner Stormy Gage-Watts at a parish council meeting that would pay $500 to 500 eligible families. Families would have to apply and meet income requirements, give proof of income, and provide a statement of how the pandemic has affected their family’s finances. The money, which would be available on a first-come basis, would come from money already set aside for emergency disaster assistance. “Just a couple of years ago, we were able to be able to provide allocations for tornado victims, so we did that through a special fund, which is an emergency ordinance, and this is the same thing. It’s no different,” Gage-Watts told KTBS. The station said there will be a public hearing on the issue Dec. 3.\n\nMaine\n\nGuilford: A local medical supplies manufacturer has been awarded more than $11 million from the federal government to produce millions of additional testing swabs. Puritan Medical Products of Guilford received the money through the federal Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Monday. The company will increase its production of swabs by 3 million per month, Collins said. Puritan has played a major role in the nation’s efforts to conduct enough testing to help corral the coronavirus pandemic. The White House announced in June that the federal government was providing more than $75 million for Puritan to double its production to 40 million swabs per month. The company’s total production of flock tip swabs and foam swabs is at least 90 million per month now, Collins said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: “Answer the call” and “download the COVID Alert app” have joined the growing list of pandemic precautions as the Maryland Health Department battles a pandemic surge this holiday season. Dr. Katherine Feldman, director of the Maryland Department of Health’s contact tracing unit, told Capital News Service it was important for Marylanders to enable the MD COVID Alert exposure notification app, answer calls from contact tracers, wear a mask, socially distance and continue to take other protective measures to “reduce transmission and have all of us stay safe and healthy.” MD COVID Alert is a passive system that users enable on their iPhone or download to their Android phone in order to receive notifications when they have come in close proximity to another user who may have tested positive for the coronavirus. The state Department of Health launched the system Nov. 10 and reported over 1 million Marylanders, about 17% of the state’s population, downloaded the app within the first week. Gov. Larry Hogan said at a press conference last week that while the number of state contact tracers has been “ramped up,” there are other challenges to address. “Our problem is that so many people refuse to give the information,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is doing its part to control the spread of COVID-19 by handing out free face coverings at several subway stations and trolley stops. The service that launched Monday is backed by athletic footwear company New Balance, which donated 100,000 masks to the MBTA. MBTA commuters have been required to wear face coverings since early May. Transit police can fine people not wearing a mask up to $300. “Wearing a face covering is one of the most effective ways to combat the virus,” MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak said in a statement. “We ask that riders do their part by wearing face coverings while within the MBTA system and distancing while on public transit.” The masks will be offered during peak morning and evening commute times at the Charles/MGH, Downtown Crossing, Forest Hills, Hynes Convention Center, Maverick, Orient Heights, Park Street and Quincy Center stations.\n\nMichigan\n\nTrenton: Restaurant owner Jeremy Syrocki hit frustration overload with the latest restaurant restrictions shutting down indoor dining for the second time this year, and he’s using an inflatable Grinch to show how he feels. New rules from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services came in an announcement Nov. 15 by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and took effect last Wednesday. Syrocki decided to take a stand and do something about it. While shopping for portable patio heaters, he spotted an inflatable of the main character in the Dr. Seuss classic “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” The Grinch reminded Syrocki of Whitmer, he said. The 10-foot-high creature now stands on Truago’s patio in downtown Trenton – one of Syrocki’s three downriver restaurants. The inflatable has a sign hanging from its neck that reads “Gretch the Grinch.” Syrocki also added red lipstick to the Grinch. In a Facebook post the morning after the Grinch went up, Syrocki wrote that the stunt is about getting the attention of the governor. He said he voted for Whitmer but now believes he shouldn’t have.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A surge in COVID-19 cases has led to critical staffing shortages at some nursing homes and assisted living facilities, forcing the state to send the National Guard to help out and ask all state employees to consider volunteering in facilities. New data from the Minnesota Department of Health shows 90% of the state’s nursing homes and 58% of assisted living facilities have active virus outbreaks. The data includes more than 70 senior care homes that didn’t have any coronavirus-infected residents one month ago, the Star Tribune reports. Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Tuesday that 47 long-term care facilities are in “a crisis staffing situation” and are receiving active support from the state, including help from federal health nurses. Gov. Tim Walz’s administration has taken the unusual step of emailing all state employees and asking them to consider volunteering for two-week stints in long-term care facilities, particularly in greater Minnesota. The email, which was sent to the heads of all state agencies, says no prior experience is required, and the state would cover travel and temporary housing costs.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves announced Tuesday that he is expanding his mask mandate to cover half of the state’s 82 counties. Reeves had previously placed under the mandate 22 counties with the highest number of new cases of coronavirus. “It’s clear we are in the middle of our second surge,” Reeves said during a briefing at which he announced he was adding 19 counties to that list. Dr. LouAnn Woodward, vice chancellor and dean of the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s School of Medicine, had called on the governor Monday to reinstitute a statewide mask mandate. She said last week that no intensive care unit beds were available at the hospital, Mississippi’s only level-one trauma center. “I think we have reasonable evidence to believe that the county-by-county approach is not working,” she said Monday. Meanwhile, Mississippi’s top health official said this week that he is exhausted trying to convince people in the state to take the coronavirus seriously and follow public health guidelines. “It’s just going nowhere,” Dr. Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi’s state health officer, said Monday during a meeting with members of the state Senate. “We have chosen, very clearly, to prioritize social events over disease transmission.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The state’s two largest metropolitan areas are cracking down on restaurants that violate rules designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Kansas City’s liquor control authorities found two dozen bars and restaurants in violation of the city’s new COVID-19 restrictions after a weekend sweep of 185 establishments. The city’s Department of Regulated Industries, which governs liquor licenses, used to rely primarily on complaints to enforce restrictions. But as the latest set of rules issued by Mayor Quinton Lucas took effect Friday – limiting bars and restaurants to 50% capacity and a closing time of 10 p.m. – the city became more proactive. Meanwhile, the St. Louis County Department of Public Health sent certified letters to three dozen bars and businesses ordering them to cease indoor service or face lawsuits or criminal charges. Eleven of those establishments had already received a second notice from the county, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Many of the restaurants were among the same establishments that are suing the county seeking to block its suspension of indoor dining.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Schools will receive nearly $13 million in additional coronavirus relief funds before Dec. 30, Gov. Steve Bullock announced Wednesday. Public and private schools were allowed to request additional funding in October after Bullock directed $75 million in July from the state’s coronavirus relief funds to K-12 schools. More than 180 schools were approved for additional funding. The new funding includes about $5.7 million in unspent funding from the original $75 million allocated to schools and about $7.2 million in newly allocated funds. Federal coronavirus relief funds must be spent by the end of December, and Bullock called on Congress to pass additional school financing relief for 2021. “While this additional funding will serve our schools with continued needs through the end of this year, our schools head into the new year empty handed,” Bullock, a Democrat, said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A meatpacking plant has been accused in a lawsuit of failing to take adequate precautions to protect workers from the coronavirus. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the federal lawsuit Monday against Noah’s Ark Processors in Hastings, Nebraska. The suit said the plant has made no effort to spread workers out to limit the spread of the virus, and it fails to promptly replace workers’ masks when they become soiled with blood and sweat. The plaintiffs include several former workers at the plant. “Noah’s Ark has shown a shocking indifference to its employees and the community by failing to take common-sense steps to protect them from the spread of COVID-19,” ACLU attorney Spencer Amdur said. Company officials declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday. The meatpacking industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic because workers stand shoulder-to-shoulder as they toil inside the plants and often crowd together in locker rooms and on breaks. The ACLU lawsuit said managers at Noah’s ark pressured people to continue working even when they were sick and showing symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The coronavirus is spreading so fast in the state that one person is diagnosed with it every minute, and someone is dying from it every two hours, state health officials said Wednesday. Nearly half of the state’s 142,239 total cases since the start of the pandemic in March have occurred since September – fully one-fourth of those in the month of November and 10% in just the past seven days, according to the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services. “We have COVID-19 exploding in our community. It is spreading rapidly,” Washoe County Health District Officer Kevin Dick told reporters in Reno. “We have exponential growth going on.” While the majority of the state’s cases and 2,071 total deaths have been reported in Clark County – the most populous county that includes Las Vegas – the Reno-Sparks area in Washoe County has been hit the hardest in recent weeks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State legislators are working on a bill to offer price protections for adult vaccines, such as those pending for COVID-19. Rep. Jerry Knirk, a Democrat from Freedom, told WMUR-TV that by expanding a New Hampshire nonprofit association that pools insurance company money to buy vaccine doses in bulk, the savings to the state and patients could be immense. The process is already done in New Hampshire for pediatric vaccines, he said. The bill would expand the New Hampshire Vaccine Association, which purchases vaccines for children under 19, to all adults. “In the pediatric program, we purchase about $38 million worth of vaccines for about $28 million,” Knirk said. “The savings is roughly about 26%. For the adults, it is estimated it should be very similar in terms of the degree of savings.” The federal government is expected to pay for a COVID-19 vaccination, but the bill could come in handy if gaps in funding arise next year or if suddenly states find themselves in the position of trying to obtain more vaccine.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: With COVID-19 cases rising at an “alarming rate,” Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday abandoned the formula to determine which out-of-state travelers should quarantine once they reach New Jersey. Instead, Murphy said anyone coming into the Garden State from beyond the four-state region of Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania should isolate for 14 days. “Given the increased risk of spreading COVID-19 for both residents who travel outside the state and for visitors into the state, New Jersey continues to strongly discourage all non-essential interstate travel at this time,” Murphy said in a statement. His announcement came on one of the busiest traveling days of the year. About 50 million people were expected to travel in the United States for Thanksgiving, according to AAA. That would be a decline from past years, but federal and state officials, including Murphy, have urged people to stay home this year and keep their celebrations to immediate family members and fewer than 10 people to avoid spreading the virus.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State lawmakers on Tuesday passed a bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that will deliver a one-time $1,200 check to all types of unemployed workers and up to $50,000 for certain businesses. The bill also provides smaller stimulus checks to immigrants without legal status in the country and dependents, as well as additional funds for food banks, virus testing and contact tracing efforts. Republican lawmakers were unsuccessful in their efforts to provide aid for low-income essential workers. Democrats said federal guidelines would prevent such spending, and they promised to find ways during the regular session in January to address the issue. Most of the proposed spending will be made possible by federal relief funding previously assigned to New Mexico, including about $319 million in unspent funds that were expected to expire soon. An additional $10 million in state general funds was allocated for the testing and tracing efforts.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City Winery, an upscale chain, is trying a novel approach to indoor dining during a pandemic: Two nights a week, all patrons and staffers at its Manhattan location have to take a rapid virus test on-site and get an all-clear before coming in. Other nights unfold without testing but with precautions including temperature checks and spaced-out tables. Costing diners $50 per person on top of their tabs, it’s an elite experiment – complete with a free glass of sparkling wine – and health experts caution that a test isn’t a failsafe. So does City Winery CEO Michael Dorf, but he thinks the idea is worth trying as restaurants try to get through a year of shutdowns and social distancing. With winter looming over New York eateries’ outdoor-dining lifeline, “how do we get people to dine inside, feel comfortable, feel as safe as possible so that they can spend money in our restaurant, and our staff can feel comfortable?” asked Dorf, who said City Winery’s business is down 85% compared to 2019. A hotel with a rooftop lounge and restaurant in Queens’ hip Long Island City neighborhood briefly tried a similar testing program this summer. But it’s not clear how many other restaurants might follow suit.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Some of the state’s colleges plan to require students to show a negative coronavirus test in order to return to campus after their winter break. At the University of North Carolina System Board of Governors meeting last week, President Peter Hans said schools will do reentry testing or require students to show a negative test before they can return for the spring semester. None of the universities in the UNC System required students or employees to be tested for the virus before coming to campus in the fall. While many offered ongoing surveillance testing throughout the semester, it was mostly voluntary. UNC-Chapel Hill, N.C. State University and East Carolina University each had to send students home, close dorms and move classes online because of spikes in coronavirus cases in August. Now, each is requiring students to get tested for the coronavirus at the start of the spring semester.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The head of the largest hospital in the city is pleading for people to wear masks, warning that not following COVID-19 safety measures could have other consequences aside from spreading the coronavirus during the holiday season. Sanford Fargo President and CEO Bryan Nermoe said the failure of people to follow COVID-19 protocols could force some patients who need treatment for ailments other than the virus to be put on waiting lists or sent to facilities hundreds of miles away. In Fargo alone, the city’s three hospitals were down to four staffed intensive care unit beds and 19 staffed inpatient beds, according to state data compiled Tuesday. That included no ICU beds and 17 regular beds at Sanford, which recently opened 14 new patient rooms at its main facility in southwest Fargo. Nermoe is asking people to keep front-line caregivers in mind when deciding whether to wear masks, wash hands, maintain social distancing and avoid large gatherings. “On behalf of them, mask up,” Nermoe said. “Do it for them because they are really going above and beyond, 24/7, 365, of really trying to meet the needs of people in our region.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Seven of the state’s biggest counties on Wednesday urged residents to stay home and follow guidelines on social gatherings and wearing masks. The counties said in a joint statement that they want people only to leave home for work, school, medical appointments or buying essential items such as groceries. “Cases and hospital admissions are at the highest levels we have seen during this pandemic, by far. These county health advisories reflect the urgent need for all of us to protect ourselves and our families to stop the spread of this virus,” said Denise Driehaus, president of the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners. The counties are Franklin, Cuyahoga, Hamilton, Summit, Montgomery, Lucas and Mahoning. Cases in Ohio continue to spike. The state’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 5,049 new cases per day Nov. 10 to 8,495 new cases per day Tuesday, according to an Associated Press analysis of data provided by the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma State Department of Health announced Wednesday that public schools will be allowed to offer in-school quarantines for students exposed to the coronavirus. Schools in Mustang became the first in the state to adopt the policy, the department said. “In the past, if a student had tested positive for COVID-19, any students who interacted with the case – up to the entire class – would have been required to move to distance learning for 14 days,” said Dr. Jared Taylor, Interim State Epidemiologist. “An in-school quarantine option is the best way to keep our kids in school and prevent them from falling behind.” Mustang Superintendent Charles Bradley said in a statement that the policy allows the suburban Oklahoma City district to avoid moving entirely to online teaching. Students who are quarantined will be allowed to go to school to take part in virtual classes but kept out of individual classrooms in buildings such as gyms or an auditorium, where they would be socially distanced and must wear masks. The policy will be in effect from Nov. 30 through Dec. 23.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Bars and restaurants can reopen for limited outdoor service next week, but many restrictions will remain in place until a vaccine against the coronavirus is widely available, Gov. Kate Brown said on Wednesday. She pleaded with Oregonians to stay safe during the holidays and protect others by not ignoring safety protocols, like wearing masks and limiting personal contacts. Meanwhile, the rate of infections continue to skyrocket. A total of 8,687 new daily cases occurred last week, a 34% increase over the previous record-high week. Weekly hospitalizations rose to a record 366, a 26% increase. The revamped restrictions take effect when the current two-week “freeze” expires Dec. 3. Currently, only takeout restaurant service is allowed. The restaurant industry pushed hard against the restrictions, as several eateries closed for good, and others were at risk of doing so. Asked if at a virtual news conference if she was bending to industry pressure, Brown said: “I’m in the business, frankly, of saving lives and also preserving livelihoods.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Cellphones across the state received an alert Wednesday afternoon notifying them of a growing COVID-19 emergency. The alert was shared on the day Pennsylvania surpassed 10,000 coronavirus deaths. More than 6,700 new cases were announced Wednesday, and 3,897 hospitalizations were reported. Of those people hospitalized, 895 were in intensive care units. “In PA, COVID-19 rates are rising & hospitals could soon be at capacity. Stay home if possible,” the phone alert said. “If you must go out, maintain social distance, wear a mask, wash your hands for 20 seconds. Stay up to date on the spread of COVID in your community so you can protect your loved ones with the COVID Alert PA app.” The alert was sent by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency through the national Wireless Emergency Alert system. Wednesday was the first time Pennsylvania used that system to share a message about COVID-19, and it reached phones about a half-hour before bars and restaurants were required to stop serving alcohol on what is typically the biggest drinking night of the year.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state will provide an additional $100 million in relief to businesses and residents expected to suffer during a two-week period of new restrictions starting Monday meant to control the current spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Wednesday. Half of the federal stimulus money will be available for businesses that must close or will be severely limited during that period, the Democratic governor said at a news conference. Raimondo said she wants businesses to use the money to continue to pay employees during the two-week pause. “The program that we have developed is meant to ensure that companies who are being put out of business or severely limited by the pause can get a check in their bank account quickly to help make up for the lost revenue of these two weeks,” she said. The other $50 million will go to provide an additional $400 to Rhode Islanders already collecting unemployment insurance benefits. She also reminded state residents who are in the U.S. illegally that they can apply for $400 debit cards through Dorcas International, a nonprofit that provides services to immigrants and refugees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: University of South Carolina President Bob Caslen said Wednesday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. Caslen said he tested positive Tuesday evening and is isolating at home, according to a news release, which added that he is asymptomatic. The test was administered through the university, which offers saliva-based and nasal swab testing to students, faculty and staff. “My diagnosis reinforces the need for everyone to get COVID tested regularly to protect yourself and your loved ones,” Caslen said in a statement. He had announced earlier this week that the university would institute monthly mandatory testing for students, faculty and staff who work on campus or are enrolled in at least one face-to-face or hybrid class. Those living, learning or working on the Columbia campus will also have to show proof of testing before returning to school in the spring. After reports of large crowds of students at Columbia bars, Caslen visited some establishments on Halloween night to see the conditions himself, WACH-TV reports. He also stopped by a neighborhood where thousands of students had gathered at an outdoor party earlier in the fall.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The head of one of the largest regional health systems in the Midwest was replaced Tuesday, less than a week after telling employees he had recovered from COVID-19 and was not wearing a mask around the office. Sanford Health said in a release that it has “mutually agreed to part ways” with longtime CEO Kelby Krabbenhoft, who took over in 1996 and helped expand the organization from a community hospital into what is billed as the nation’s largest rural nonprofit health system. Krabbenhoft left the executive position after telling employees in an email that he believes he’s now immune to COVID-19 for “at least seven months and perhaps years to come” and isn’t a threat to transmit it to anyone. He said wearing a mask would be merely for show. Other Sanford executives tried to distance themselves from the comments. Sanford Health, based in Sioux Falls, has 46 hospitals and more than 200 clinics concentrated in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. It employs about 50,000 people. The Dakotas have for weeks had the country’s worst spread rates of the coronavirus, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that COVID-19 vaccines will be optional in the state’s K-12 public schools, once they become available. The Republican said at a news conference that vaccines will be very important for Tennessee to “ultimately really be able to handle” the virus. But he said he doesn’t foresee COVID-19 mandates for school districts in Tennessee. “Vaccines are a choice, and people have the choice and will have the choice in this state as to whether or not they should take that vaccine,” Lee said. “That will be our strategy, and that is what we think will happen all across the state.” The comment comes as the state and the country look toward initial, limited doses of vaccine that could arrive in the next few weeks, amid a surge in the coronavirus that is increasingly straining hospital systems. In Tennessee, the first doses, likely through Pfizer, could arrive around Dec. 15, with the initial Moderna vaccines expected a week later, said state Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The value of oil fields in West Texas has plummeted due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused the demand for crude to go down. Eli Huffman, a land broker and attorney at Houston-based Lone Star Production Co., said he has seen land prices fall below $1,000 an acre for property that used to be worth more than $10,000 an acre. “When (oil) prices are too low, no one is buying land,” Huffman said. “Everybody is risk-averse at the moment.” The average price of U.S. shale acreage has fallen by more than 70% in two years – from $17,000 per acre in 2018 to $5,000 per acre in 2020, according to Norwegian energy research firm Rystad. Despite that, the prices of some shale plays has held up, the Houston Chronicle reports. The Permian-Delaware basin is still valued at $30,000 per acre, and the Midland basin is valued at $17,000 an acre, Rystad said. But prices for devalued oil and gas lands will not be able to bounce back as quickly if the pandemic worsens and lockdowns keep pressure on demand for petroleum.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Dixie State University said testing will be encouraged but not mandatory despite state health orders mandating college students get tested weekly for the coronavirus. “The truth is we don’t have enough tests to even test everyone,” said Jordon Sharp, vice president of marketing and communication at Dixie State. “Now, if that changes, then then we’ll see what happens.” Republican Gov. Gary Herbert issued health orders earlier this month requiring that college students get weekly COVID-19 tests starting no later than Jan. 1, KUER-FM reports. Sharp said the university received 2,000 kits, which it hoped to administer to students before Thanksgiving break, but that it is unlikely to happen because there are not enough tests to give to its 12,000 students. “There’s just really no process in place because we don’t have enough tests,” Sharp said. “So we’ll begin testing any student that would like (one).” Herbert said the goal is to screen 250,000 students a week at all the colleges and universities in the state, but the institutions are waiting for more equipment from the federal government.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A school district in Orange County is concerned about families not complying with quarantine rules after a cluster of coronavirus cases turned up in the district that serves Randolph, Braintree and Brookfield. The Orange Southwest School District has moved to remote learning but is encountering apathy from some people contacted during contact tracing, WCAX-TV reports. Superintendent Layne Millington estimates about a third of the families that were called discounted concerns about possible exposure or exposing others to the virus that causes COVID-19. “ ‘Didn’t care’ is probably a good expression for a lot of them,” Millington told WCAX-TV. “And then we had at least one family that had positive cases that said they were going to be noncompliant with the quarantine.” Gov. Phil Scott has said the state can impose penalties for people unwilling to comply with contact tracing requirements, but he’s reluctant to do that. “We don’t want to use our limited resources in public safety to go after people,” he said. “We’re asking people to tell the truth to protect others. I don’t think it’s tattling on anyone.”\n\nVirginia\n\nVerona: Recent accounts from inmates at Middle River Regional Jail have shed light on the growing threat of COVID-19, as inmates now find themselves bunking with the pandemic. Four nurses, 25 officers and 15 inmates had tested positive for the coronavirus as of Tuesday. A number of people are still quarantining at home, waiting for their test results, according to a press release from MRRJ. While officers and nurses have the option to avoid the crowd, the inmates don’t get that luxury. MRRJ conducted a spot test only on two housing units and people who showed symptoms. Kandi Harner, 32, tested positive and was told of the results Tuesday. She had been working a laundry job in the jail and said she was sent back to her pod after she suffered from nausea, a sore chest and an excruciating headache. Her pod consists of 35 women, 10 of whom tested positive. Harner said none of the 10 women were removed from the pod. “They still haven’t done anything for us or changed anything, short of giving us a mask,” Harner said by phone from the jail Tuesday. “This morning they tried to send me to work again, but I refused to go because I’m feeling so bad.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new report shows people infected with the coronavirus in the state’s most populous county in recent weeks have been mostly exposed in homes, during social activities and gatherings, and in workplaces. Instead of a few “hot spots,” the report shows the risk of exposure is now widespread throughout King County as cases have increased in the past two months. Public Health – Seattle & King County released the report on outbreaks and exposure settings Wednesday showing where people most frequently reported being exposed. Cases related to social activities and out-of-state travel have increased over the course of the pandemic, while cases associated with long-term care and other health care facilities have decreased in the county, according to the report. It also noted differences in potential sources of exposure by race and ethnicity, geography and age. In many communities of color, for example, particularly in south King County, workplaces are more frequently reported as possible exposure sites, the report said, whereas in the north Seattle and suburban Shoreline area, the most common exposure settings are social gatherings.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice blasted critics of his mask mandate Wednesday, saying he would not follow the lead of other Republican governors rejecting the advice of public health experts. “I don’t want to be South Dakota,” Justice said at a news conference. He then played a news clip from the state, where Gov. Kristi Noem has refused to issue a mask mandate, reporting that South Dakota has the most deaths per capita linked to COVID-19 in the world. There are 13 states currently without a statewide mask mandate in effect, all led by Republican governors. “I know that we are a strong-willed people in West Virginia, and we have our rights, and no one is trying to infringe on your rights in any way,” Justice said, a reference to some conservatives in the state who criticize his pandemic executive orders. Justice has vocally defended mask-wearing and recently tightened a mandate to wear one indoors when in public at all times, as cases have skyrocketed in rural enclaves. He has resisted more stringent lockdown measures and championed for schools to stay open where outbreaks are less severe.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in the state continued to tick downward Wednesday, a rare bit of good news for health officials as they struggle to contain the deadly disease. The state Department of Health Services reported 5,469 confirmed coronavirus cases Wednesday. The number of confirmed cases has now declined for five days, an encouraging sign after the state saw a record-high 7,989 cases Nov. 18. What’s more, the seven-day average of positive tests was 28.3% as of Tuesday, continuing a downward trend from a record-high 36.6% on Nov. 11. But the disease is still running rampant across the state. According to DHS, the total number of confirmed infections stood at 369,442 as of Wednesday. The disease was a factor in 63 more deaths, bringing the death toll to 3,178, according to the department. Wisconsin remains sixth in the nation in per-capita infections, according to Johns Hopkins University. And any progress against the disease appears fleeting. Health officials are bracing for another surge in infections and deaths stemming from Thanksgiving gatherings.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Officials in northern Wyoming have voted to remove Dr. Ed Zimmerman from his position as Washakie County health officer, a decision Zimmerman believes is in response to his implementing a mask mandate. Washakie County Commission Chair Fred Frandson said Tuesday that Zimmerman’s departure was not a result of the local mask mandate but said he could not discuss why he was removed because the county does not publicly discuss personnel matters, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Zimmerman said there were several health officials who were worried they could lose their jobs by implementing mask mandates. “It had to do with the health order in some way,” Zimmerman said of losing his job. Zimmerman said he met with the county’s three commissioners Nov. 17 to discuss the forthcoming mandate and said the commissioners “were really, really not happy with me” about the decision. Zimmerman said he then received a call on Monday from Frandson informing him that his contract was terminated and that all his duties would end immediately.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/04/22/nuns-emerge-missouri-sues-china-soldiers-sew-news-around-states/111582550/", "title": "Nuns emerge, Missouri sues China: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: Bennie G. Adkins, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism during the Vietnam War, died from complications from COVID-19. The Bennie Adkins Foundation announced the death on social media Friday. He was 86. Adkins served more than 20 years in the U.S. Army, with 13 of those years spent as a Green Beret. He was deployed to Vietnam three times and awarded the Medal of Honor in 2014 for heroism in a 1966 battle. According to the Medal of Honor citation, Adkins carried wounded soldiers to safety – sometimes drawing fire on himself to allow the wounded to be rescued – and fought off waves of attacking forces. Following retirement in 1978 at the rank of command sergeant major, he graduated from Troy University and founded an accounting firm in Alabama. He lived in Opelika.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said Alaskans soon could be making appointments at barbershops and nail salons again, as the state looks to further reopen parts of the economy shut down or restricted because of coronavirus concerns. Dunleavy said Monday that details are expected this week. Other areas he said were being looked at include restaurants and retail shops, businesses he said employ many people and could put in place safety protocols while meeting demand for services. He said Alaskans will be asked to continue washing their hands, cleaning surfaces, maintaining social distance and wearing masks, particularly when shopping. The state feels pretty good about its numbers and its health care capacity, equipment and ability to track cases, he said. The state has reported at least 321 cases of COVID-19, with 161 of those cases recovered and nine deaths.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Banner Health is setting up makeshift grocery stores for workers on the front lines tending to coronavirus patients. The provider announced Monday that select metro Phoenix hospitals will have on-site locations where health care workers can pick up provisions. Fruits, vegetables, bread, dairy products and eggs are among the essentials that will be available to physicians, nurses and other staff at a discounted price. Banner officials say they hope to ease the burden for workers who are putting in especially long shifts. The facilities that will offer groceries are in Queen Creek, Glendale, Scottsdale and Phoenix. In Mesa, Banner Desert Medical Center will instead have grocery boxes available to buy. Arizona-based Banner Health, one of the largest nonprofit health care systems nationwide, owns and operates 28 acute-care hospitals.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Nearly a third of the inmates at a state prison have tested positive for coronavirus, state health officials said Monday. About 600 inmates in the Cummins Unit tested positive for the virus, an increase of about 250 from a day earlier, state Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith said. Prison officials announced the first case at the facility a little over a week ago. Smith said the department has completed most of its testing of inmates at the prison. A health department spokeswoman said the agency has tested more than 1,000 inmates and is awaiting results from 25 more. “Until we have completely interrupted chains of transmission in the prison, I’m not going to say it’s over,” Smith said. “Once we know who’s positive, who’s negative, who’s exposed, who’s not exposed, then we can begin moving people around, and that, I would say, is the beginning of containment.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: An estimated 320,000 adults in Los Angeles County may have been infected with coronavirus, according to preliminary results of a study that suggests the illness is far more widespread than current testing shows and the death rate is much lower. The study conducted April 10-11 by the county and the University of Southern California estimated that approximately 4.1% of the county’s adult population of 8 million has antibodies to the virus. When adjusted for margin of error, the infection rate ranged from 2.8% to 5.6%, or about 220,000 to 440,000 adults. The study, which was criticized by some outside experts, follows other research that has suggested more people have had coronavirus than previously determined through testing – many without symptoms or without feeling ill enough to seek a test. But it also means more people have been silent carriers of the virus that has killed more than 1,200 people in California.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado will let its statewide stay-at-home order expire next week, allow a gradual reopening of nonessential businesses, and permit nonelective surgical procedures and other activity suspended by the coronavirus fight as long as strict social distancing and other protective measures continue, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday. Polis credited widespread compliance with social distancing and shelter-in-place orders for state information that suggests COVID-19 hospitalizations are leveling off, allowing the most severe restrictions imposed last month to expire April 27. He urged residents who can work at home to keep doing so and all to stay at home as much as possible, avoid large gatherings, and wear masks and other protective gear. Details on specific measures will be released this week, Polis said. State and local authorities are empowered to reimpose restrictions in response to health crises, he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has teamed up with a group of scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and other research institutions who’ve created a new app that will provide more information about the spread of COVID-19 as officials prepare to eventually reopen Connecticut. Gov. Ned Lamont said the state is the first to officially partner with the developers of the HowWeFeel.org app, which enables residents to report daily about how they’re feeling and their symptoms. He encouraged people to download the app, noting it does not require logging in or sharing any personal information, such as name or email address. It’s one of several ways the state plans to use technology to help inform officials on how and when to slowly restart parts of society. For example, Lamont said the state has received 3,500 “smart thermometers” that will upload data about residents’ temperatures to a cloud-based system.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A state panel has drastically lowered official government revenue estimates as the coronavirus outbreak continues to wreak havoc with the national and state economies. The Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council on Monday lowered its revenue estimate for this year by $416 million, or 9%, compared to its March estimate. This year’s revenue total is currently predicted to be almost 6% less than the amount collected last year. The panel also lowered its revenue estimates for the fiscal year starting July 1 by $273 million, or 6%, compared to its March estimate. The downward revisions were largely due to significant declines in estimates for personal income taxes and corporate income taxes. But estimates were also down significantly for lottery and gross receipts tax revenue. The only increase was in insurance taxes and fees, along with a slight uptick in dividends and interest for the current year.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Numbers from the D.C. Office of Unified Communications show a spike in calls for noise complaints and mass gatherings once the coronavirus pandemic came to the area, WUSA-TV reports. Overall, the amount of 311 calls handled by the city is up 7% since the city began modifying operations the week of March 15. According to statistics from OUC, dispatched noise complaints soared 17% beginning in March and continuing into April. Following the spread of the virus, OUC dispatchers also saw 2,150 service requests come in regarding concerns with mass gatherings, and 195 reported complaints of nonessential businesses being open or not in compliance with social gathering parameters. Dispatchers saw a 24% spike in 311 calls the week of March 15. “People were asking questions like where are the tests, are schools closed, are they going to give out meals,” Director of Unified Communications Karima Holmes said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Six Super Bowl rings may get you special treatment in a lot of places, but former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady learned Monday that it won’t get you anything when you’re caught working out in a park that is closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said during a news briefing that the new Buccaneers quarterback was spotted working out by himself at a park downtown. A member of staff patrol went over to tell him he had to leave, and she recognized the man to be the 42-year-old Brady. The City of Tampa tweeted from its page Monday, “Sorry @TomBrady! Our @tampaparksrec team can’t wait to welcome you and our entire community back with even bigger smiles – until then, stay safe and stay home as much as you can to help flatten the curve.” The four-time Super Bowl MVP left the New England Patriots and signed a two-year, $50 million contract with the Bucs in free agency, joining a team with the worst winning percentage in league history.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPooler: America’s Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia will host a drive-thru emergency food distribution event at 9 a.m. Wednesday at the Tanger Outlet Centers in the city. It will be a first-come, first-served distribution while supplies last for residents of Pooler, Executive Director Mary Jane Crouch said in a press release Monday. In the light of the COVID-19 virus, strict precautionary measures will be taken to keep staff and the public safe during the distribution. Clients must remain in their cars and have a space cleared in the trunk of their vehicle available for the Georgia National Guard to load a box of nonperishable food, produce and protein into their vehicle. “We can only provide one box per vehicle, and no exceptions will be made,” Crouch said. A variety of nonperishable goods and fresh produce will be distributed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The federal coronavirus relief funds for Hawaii residents are not expected to cover a single month of expenses because of the state’s high cost of living, an economic analysis found. The one-time, $1,200 payments from the government’s coronavirus rescue package are likely to be less effective in Hawaii because the average cost of living is 20% higher than the national average, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Beth Giesting, director of the nonpartisan Hawaii Budget and Policy Center, said when accounting for the local cost of living, the $1,200 payment is more like $960 elsewhere in the U.S. “In no case does it cover a full month’s expenses,” she said. How far the money goes depends on location. On Oahu, the most expensive island, $1,200 does not cover even half the average monthly expenses for a single person, Giesting said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With students completing school work remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, officials say more youths are filling their days by doing farm labor and other agricultural jobs. Educators and farm-worker advocates are worried that could take a toll on students’ education and health, the Idaho Statesman and Idaho Ed News report. The majority of child work-related fatalities occur in agricultural jobs, according to a 2018 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, as kids can encounter pesticide exposure, dangerous equipment or extreme temperatures. “This is definitely a concern,” said Sarah Seamount, migrant education coordinator for the Idaho State Department of Education. “Although these students are not at school, they are still in school and are expected to continue their education during this soft closure, just like all Idaho public school students.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The number of black Chicago residents becoming infected with the coronavirus and of those dying of the disease remains disproportionately high, city officials said Monday. Black residents made up about 46% of the 12,571 confirmed tests for the coronavirus and about 60% of the 500 deaths in the city linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, despite making up 30% of the city’s population. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city and neighborhood organizations working to share information about the virus and preventing its spread are focused on three neighborhoods: Auburn Gresham, South Shore and Austin. Health conditions that are more common among African Americans can make people more vulnerable to the virus, including diabetes and asthma. Experts also have pointed to higher uninsured rates and poorer access to health care.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor said Monday that he was easing restrictions on hospitals from performing elective surgeries even as the state health commissioner remained concerned about whether coronavirus infections were slowing. Gov. Eric Holcomb said while he was extending the statewide stay-at-home order until May 1, hospitals would be allowed starting Tuesday to resume procedures to diagnose and treat medical conditions. A halt to elective procedures had been ordered last month to help preserve hospital equipment and protective gear if needed to treated people seriously ill with COVID-19 respiratory infections. State officials have not reported shortages of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators even as Indiana’s coronavirus death toll has topped 550 in little more than five weeks since the state’s first known death.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Gov. Kim Reynolds said Monday that the state’s meatpacking plants must stay open despite coronavirus outbreaks that have sickened hundreds of workers, saying shutting them down would be devastating for farmers and the nation’s food supply. Reynolds said at a news conference that the virus spreads quickly and easily at the plants because so many workers are in close proximity, acknowledging “we will continue to see clusters of positive cases” in them. “But these are also essential businesses and an essential workforce,” she said. Coronavirus outbreaks at Tyson Foods pork plants in Columbus Junction and Waterloo and a National Beef plant in Tama have contributed to a surge in positive cases in Iowa in recent days. Tyson resumed limited operations Tuesday at its plant in Columbus Junction, where more than 200 workers have become infected and at least two have died.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The coronavirus has arrived at a third correctional facility as the state’s largest prison outbreak grows to include nearly 90 positive cases. Kansas Department of Corrections Secretary Jeff Zmuda said in a news release that one staff member tested positive Monday at the Topeka Correctional Facility, which is the state’s only all-female prison, with a capacity of 948. Health officials are conducting contact tracing to determine who has been in close contact with the worker. The largest outbreak is at the Lansing Correction Facility, where 47 staff and 40 inmates are infected. An inmate at a work-release facility in Wichita also tested positive, prompting corrections officials to move 113 prisoners earlier this month to Lansing, where they are being quarantined. With advocacy groups demanding action, Gov. Laura Kelly has said efforts are underway to identify inmates who are close to finishing their sentences and can be released.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A legal organization representing an area church that filed a lawsuit against Gov. Andy Beshear is calling on churches around the country to follow Maryville Baptist’s lead and reopen early next month. Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit that provides legal assistance in cases involving evangelical causes, has dubbed May 3 as “ReOpen Church Sunday,” according to a news release from the group, and is encouraging churchgoers to fill the pews as they did earlier in April at Maryville Baptist Church in Bullitt County. The call to action notes that families who attend services, which are currently banned in Kentucky as the commonwealth fights the spread of the coronavirus under Beshear’s “healthy at home” restrictions, should practice social distancing and “include appropriate measures of sanitization,” as well as including other options like reduced seating, live videos online and parking lot services.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Authorities arrested a pastor on an assault charge Tuesday after he admitted he drove his church bus toward a man who has been protesting his decision to hold mass gatherings in defiance of public health orders during the coronavirus pandemic. The police department in Central, a suburb of Baton Rouge, said on Facebook that Tony Spell, pastor of Life Tabernacle Church, turned himself in and was arrested on charges of aggravated assault and improper backing. Spell was taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish prison, where about 70 of his parishioners, dressed in their Sunday best, arrived in church buses to show support. Gathering in a parking lot across the street, they stood close to each other, praying and singing hymns. Trey Bennett, the protester Spell is accused of assaulting, also showed up at the jail, carrying his protest sign, which said “Close this church” on one side and “Danger: coronavirus incubator” on the other.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Social distancing rules imposed to protect against the new coronavirus also appear to be reducing incidence of the flu. The number of flu diagnoses in Maine increased by 184 in the three weeks since late March when most of the social distancing policies began in the state. The number of flu cases grew by 1,812 during that same period a year earlier, the Bangor Daily News reports. “What those data suggest is that by staying inside and abiding by Gov. (Janet) Mills’ recommendations and rules, we’ve not only gotten a hold of COVID-19, but we’ve also dropped the number of influenza cases as well,” Maine Center for Disease Control Director Nirav Shah said. The state has still seen more flu cases overall this year than last. But the number of flu-related hospitalizations has dropped noticeably. As for the new coronavirus, Maine has now recorded more than 875 cases and 35 deaths from COVID-19.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state has dramatically boosted its testing capacity for the new coronavirus with a shipment of 500,000 tests from a South Korean company, the governor announced Monday, noting his Korean-born wife played a major role in championing the $9 million purchase. As states have scoured the world for testing supplies, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he asked wife Yumi Hogan on March 28 to help negotiate the purchase, tapping into the goodwill she has sought to foster between the state and South Korea. Hogan said 22 days of negotiations led to the shipment’s delivery by air Saturday. The governor noted that President Donald Trump had told state officials the states need to lead on boosting their testing capacity. The purchase was cited at Monday’s press briefing at the White House, with Trump opining that he didn’t believe it was necessary. Administration officials have been pushing governors to step up testing, while some governors have said testing infrastructure is inadequate.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: School buildings in the state will remain closed through the end of the academic year, but remote learning will continue, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Tuesday. There hasn’t been any strong guidance about how to operate schools safely as the state works to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the Republican governor said. “We believe therefore that students cannot safety return to school,” he said, adding that all non-emergency child care programs will remain closed until June 29. Baker’s announcement came a day after Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat, suggested schools would not reopen until September. “I also think next year when school comes back in September, it could be a very different looking situation in the classrooms,” Walsh said Monday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday said the state is working with major retailers to open more drive-thru sites to test as many as 1,000 people a day for the coronavirus, especially people who don’t have symptoms but still are required to work outside their home. “Robust testing is essential to have confidence about our strategies for safely reducing risk and reengaging sectors of our economy,” Whitmer said. She said Walmart, Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are part of the plan to open eight test sites across the state. Whitmer cautioned, however, that there’s a shortage of swabs and chemicals needed to complete tests. If labs had all the supplies they needed, 11,300 tests a day could be performed, the governor said. “The reality is we’re about half of that because we need additional swabs and reagents,” Whitmer said. “However, those supplies are in demand globally, and we are competing to get them and working incredibly hard so that we can ramp up to that 11,300 capacity and hopefully beyond.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Muslims in south Minneapolis will be able to maintain safe physical distance during the call to prayer throughout the holy month of Ramadan. The call to prayer will be broadcast by speaker five times each day in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood to allow residents to pray together starting the first day of Ramadan and lasting throughout the holy holiday. Mayor Jacob Frey facilitated the noise permit after the community requested the service. The Council on American-Islamic Relations paid for the audio equipment for the broadcast from the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque. The broadcasts are expected to reach thousands of residents while allowing residents to maintain safe physical distance for prayer during the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, Frey said the broadcast should offer “a measure of stability and reassure our entire city that we are all very much in this together.” Ramadan starts Thursday and ends May 23.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday that he believes the state is reaching a “plateau” in the increase of new coronavirus cases, and he will consider in coming days how the state should ease into reopening parts of its economy. “We are confident … that our health care system is not going to be overwhelmed,” the Republican said during a news conference, joined by the state health officer. Many businesses deemed “nonessential” have been closed, and claims for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed. Reeves announced last week that starting Monday, some closed businesses, including clothing stores and florists, could sell items for delivery or curbside pickup. Some smaller businesses had said they were losing money to big chain stores that have remained open. The state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, said Monday: “Big box stores are still pretty crowded. It makes me very nervous. And I’m not seeing a lot of folks wearing masks in the community, necessarily.”\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the global pandemic. The lawsuit, filed in federal court by the state’s top prosecutor, alleges Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.” “The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,” Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement. “They must be held accountable for their actions.” Lawsuits against other countries are typically fruitless because U.S. law generally prohibits them with rare exceptions, said Ashley Deeks, an international law expert at the University of Virginia School of Law. Missouri Democratic Party Executive Director Lauren Gepford called the lawsuit a “stunt” by a Republican attorney general who is up for reelection this year.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A cloistered order of nuns, devout in their vows of poverty and seclusion, the Poor Clares are not often seen in public. For the vast majority of their time, the six sisters remain in anonymity, quietly praying that the blessings of God be granted to all, even during the most common of times. But these are not common times. For the first time in their 20-year history in the city, the Poor Clares have emerged from their monastery to raise their hands in blessing over Great Falls and sing the blessing of St. Clare. “We wanted to bless the city, especially the health care workers,” Sister Judith Crosby said. “We see the city, and we are very aware of its needs and continually pray for them,” added Sister Jane Sorenson. “It’s been strongly on our minds for as long as we’ve been here. But at this point in time with the pandemic, we just believe it would be good for us to (be) visible, let people know that they are in our prayers.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Five more people have died from COVID-19, bringing the state’s total deaths to 33 since the new coronavirus outbreak this year, health officials said. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release that three of the deaths reported Monday were in a hard-hit area of south-central Nebraska. They included a woman in her 60s from Hamilton County and a woman in her 80s and a man in his 60s, both from Hall County. The other two deaths came from the Omaha area in Douglas County, where a man in his 40s and a man in his 70s – both with underlying health conditions – died of the disease. Word of the new cases came after Gov. Pete Ricketts announced Monday that he will lift the state’s ban on elective surgeries for hospitals that have at least 30% of their beds, intensive-care unit space and ventilators available. Hospitals must also have at least two weeks’ worth of personal protective equipment in stock.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A strip club business has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Small Business Administration after not receiving money from the $2 trillion federal coronavirus aid bill. Little Darlings owner Jason Mohney has struggled obtaining emergency funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act after Congress grouped the business into the category of operations of a prurient sexual nature, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Mohney argues the exclusion is discriminatory toward a class of workers who perform a legal and legitimate service through the Flint, Michigan-based company, which operates 200 exotic dance clubs in Las Vegas and multiple other cities. Not all companies in the sexual business have been denied funding. Bella’s Hacienda Ranch brothel owner Madam Bella Cummins received a notification that her funding application was approved for about $70,000, but the federal program had run out of money by then.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Catholic Medical Center, one of the state’s largest hospitals, is furloughing hundreds of workers as it loses millions of dollars a month because of the coronavirus pandemic. The hospital said Tuesday that it will put 423 workers, or 13% of its workforce, on a 60-day furlough, starting Saturday. An additional 914 workers will have their hours reduced, leaders at the vice president level and above are taking a 15% pay cut, and executive directors are taking a 5% cut. Like other facilities, the hospital has eliminated elective procedures and scaled back outpatient visits to prepare for a surge of COVID-19 patients, to conserve protective equipment, and to protect other patients and staff. The hospital lost $11 million in March and expects to lose up to $70 million by July. Last week, the company that runs Elliot Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center announced 650 workers would be furloughed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s COVID-19 death toll saw its biggest spike yet Tuesday, climbing by 379 deaths, Gov. Phil Murphy said. The increase comes as the number of new cases has been leveling off, the first-term Democrat said at a news conference. New Jersey has had 4,753 deaths from the virus and more than 92,000 cases, up from about 89,000. Despite some positive signs, like the leveling off of cases and the increasing time it takes for the number of people with COVID-19 to double, Murphy said there are still weeks to go of social distancing. “We cannot rush to reopen anything and risk undoing all the extraordinary work you’ve done so far,” Murphy said. Murphy also on Tuesday toured the state’s third and newest field hospital to open during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Atlantic City Convention Center field hospital is aimed at alleviating pressure on local hospitals and will treat non-coronavirus patients in 258 beds.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A team of national defense scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory that studies contagions with award-winning accuracy has developed its own U.S. forecast for the spread of the coronavirus. It’s one model that states are utilizing as they consider the duration of directives on social distancing and restrictions on business. With support from the U.S. Energy Department, the Los Alamos model builds upon a decade of past experience in forecasting contagions, including the seasonal flu, the Ebola virus and mosquito-borne Chikungunya. Last year Los Alamos statisticians beat out more than 20 teams in a CDC competition aimed at improving flu forecasting using supercomputing power. The lab’s “Dante” model was most successful in predicting the peak and short-term intensity of the unfolding flu season – and became the basis for the new COVID-19 model.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Hospitals in parts of the state will be able to conduct outpatient elective surgeries again, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday as he pledged to consider regional differences when reopening New York’s outbreak-stalled economy. The governor said elective treatments will be allowed in places where the outbreak is less severe. “We’re going to allow it in those hospitals and counties in the state that do not have a COVID issue or we wouldn’t need their beds in case of a surge,” Cuomo said. The hospital restrictions will remain in effect in New York City and suburban Westchester and Rockland counties, as well as Albany, Dutchess and Erie counties, he said. By Monday, more than 250,000 people in the state had tested positive for COVID-19 – a milestone figure that likely undercounts infected residents by a significant margin. People in New York City, a worldwide hotspot, were advised to seek testing only if they were ill enough to possibly require hospitalization.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFort Bragg: It’s become a competition for the soldiers of 647th Quartermaster Company to see who can crank out the most face masks during a shift to protect against the coronavirus. The parachute rigging unit is essential to airborne operations at Fort Bragg. On any given day, the soldiers’ shed is filled with paratroopers in red ball caps, busy packing parachutes and readying supplies for jumps. While that work continues, soldiers across the room are laser-focused on tiny pins and buzzing sewing machines. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, riggers are now making cloth face masks to fight the virus for personnel around the sprawling Army base. Initially, Company Commander Captain Anthony Williams set a goal for his soldiers to produce 600 masks a week. “With the soldiers and their adaptability and their resilience, we’re actually producing 600 masks a day,” Williams said. North Carolina State University donated 4,000 meters of unwoven material that’s being used to construct new personal protective equipment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: A local company is working with universities and a medical school on using unmanned aerial vehicles in the fight against the coronavirus. SkySkopes, based in Grand Forks, has launched demonstrations to show a variety of ways in which its drones could be used in the pandemic. KFGO reports SkySkopes CEO and President Matt Dunlevy says the drones can deliver supplies to hospital, check people’s temperatures from the air and even sanitize playground equipment. The company said it’s working with the University of North Dakota’s medical school and its Center for Innovation as well as North Dakota State University and Grand Forks County. The company had planned to conduct testing in Hillsboro but met with some opposition. City Commission President Terry Sando said a small number of people expressed concerns about the drone testing.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Schools across the state will stay closed for the remainder of the school year while classes continue remotely, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine announced Monday. DeWine, who was the first governor in the nation to shutter schools statewide, said his latest decision stems from concern for the continued safety of students, teachers and communities. He said returning students to their classrooms could lead to new cases of COVID-19. DeWine said teachers and administrators also worried that another disruption to a school year already interrupted by the coronavirus might negatively affect students, who need continuity. “We have to think about the risk to teachers, students and our communities,” DeWine said. The governor said no decision has been made about the fall but said a blend of in-person and online learning might be an option for districts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt’s attempt to ban abortions during the coronavirus pandemic cannot be enforced, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Charles Goodwin issued a preliminary injunction late Monday after abortion providers sued Stitt over the ban. The injunction replaces a temporary restraining order that the same judge issued last week that allowed most abortions to continue. The injunction ensures abortions can be performed in Oklahoma while the case continues in federal court. Stitt’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but a spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said he intends to appeal the decision. Stitt attempted to ban abortions as part of a prohibition on elective surgeries aimed at preserving personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks, gowns and gloves, during the public health crisis.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The governor’s office on Monday circulated its own version of a three-phase federal guideline to lift restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic, including allowing child care facilities and possibly restaurants to reopen in the first phase. The Trump administration’s guidelines say there first must be downward trajectories, during a 14-day period, of influenza-like illnesses, COVID-19-like cases, documented cases or positive tests as a percent of total tests, as well as “robust testing and contact tracing.” Oregon, however, has some counties with no or few COVID-19 cases. The draft circulating among state leaders says Oregon will likely use modified metrics, especially for rural counties with small numbers. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s draft plan, which comes as Republicans in the Legislature ramp up pressure on her to lift economic restrictions in rural areas, offers no time frame, saying experience in other countries and modeling says reducing social distancing too quickly will create a spike in cases.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Transporting bodies from a hospital to the medical examiner’s office in the back of a pickup truck is “unacceptable,” a city Department of Public Health spokesman said after images of a contractor stepping on the bodies while unloading them from the truck bed were captured over the weekend. A photographer for The Philadelphia Inquirer captured images of the delivery of five or six bodies that were enclosed in white body bags and covered by mats in the back of the pickup truck Sunday afternoon. The bodies were delivered to a facility where the city has secured several refrigerated trailers to help with an increased need for body storage from hospitals and private funeral homes. James Garrow, a spokesman for Philadelphia’s public health department, said Tuesday that the delivery was an isolated occurrence that was not up to the standard transportation protocols.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has made available at no cost 700 single-occupancy dorm rooms for front-line workers who need a safe place to stay during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Tuesday. The rooms are for health care workers, nursing home employees, public safety personnel and others at high risk of contracting the virus who do not want to worry about infecting family members by staying at home, the Democrat said at her daily news briefing. The rooms are not for people who have tested positive for the disease and need to stay in isolation. Laundry and meal service are available for a fee, she said. The Rhode Island Department of Health reported 394 additional cases of COVID-19 and 16 new deaths Tuesday. The 394 new cases, a single-day high since the pandemic began, bring the total number of positive cases in the state to 5,500. The state now has 171 deaths.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Some beaches in the state reopened Tuesday, with mayors and other leaders enthusiastically telling people to soak in the sun while being careful and continuing coronavirus precautions like social distancing. But other beach towns took a more cautious approach, citing federal guidelines for determining whether the spread of the virus had slowed that have not yet been met in South Carolina. Part of the struggle for local governments is determining where the state is in terms of the pandemic’s spread. State health officials quietly changed their estimate of the peak over the weekend from April 30 to sometime the week before. But while the number of new COVID-19 cases from April 12 to April 19 dropped by nearly 17% in South Carolina, the number of coronavirus tests done over that same period fell more than 27%, according to data from the Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nJefferson: Racing promoters plan to go ahead with an event at a track in Jefferson this weekend with some modifications for social distancing. Sprint car promoter and racing veteran Terry McCarl is bringing the Open Wheel Nationals to Park Jefferson Speedway on Saturday. But the drivers won’t be racing for a packed house. Instead only 700 tickets have been sold for a speedway that seats more than 4,000, KELO-TV reports. McCarl said that should give each person more than 6 feet of distance from the next fan. Concessions will be limited with distancing marks on the ground. And attendees are encouraged to bring a covering for their faces. Gov. Kristi Noem is one of the few governors who hasn’t issued a statewide stay-at-home order.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee announced Monday that businesses across the majority of the state will begin reopening as early as next week. The Republican governor said his mandatory safer-at-home order will expire April 30, which will pave the way for 89 out of the state’s 95 counties to begin opening businesses. However, Lee’s announcement does not apply to the state’s counties with the largest cities, including Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Madison, Shelby and Sullivan counties – areas that are not overseen by Tennessee’s Department of Health but have their own public health districts. Some businesses will be allowed to reopen as early as April 27, but it’s unclear exactly which ones will be granted such clearance. Lee told reporters such details would be finalized by his economy recovery team later this week. Most state parks will reopen Friday.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Most state parks reopened Monday as the state began what Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said will be a gradual unraveling of restrictions that were put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Eager hikers and fishermen lined up early as parks reopened for the first time since temporarily closing April 7 as part of statewide social distancing restrictions. At Enchanted Rock State Natural Area in the Hill Country, about 120 people made reservations Monday to enter one of Texas’ most popular park destinations, park ranger Tina Johnson said. Visitors had to remain in their car while grabbing trail maps, and signs reminded them to wear masks and keep 6 feet apart from other hikers. In Houston, dozens of families flocked early to Sheldon Lake State Park, where most but not all visitors wore masks as required.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: All but one of the state’s 28 confirmed coronavirus deaths have been people over the age of 55, health officials said Monday. That breakdown mirrors national trends: More than 9 in 10 of the 15,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States were in that age group, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest reported death among Utah residents was a 68-year-old man who was serving as a senior missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Allen Dee Pace, of Willard, had been serving with his wife in Detroit when he was diagnosed with COVID-19 in early April, said church spokesman Daniel Woodruff. He died Saturday. Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko said 27 of the state’s 28 deaths have been people over the age of 55. The vast majority had underlying health conditions and died in hospitals, state epidemiologist Angela Dunn said.\n\nVermont\n\nMarshfield: The board of the struggling Vermont State Colleges system on Monday considered a plan to close three campuses because of added financial troubles brought by the coronavirus outbreak, while earlier in the day students and other critics protested in a car parade through Montpelier. Under a proposal announced by Chancellor Jeb Spaulding on Friday, the two campuses of Northern Vermont University in Johnson and Lyndon and the campus of Vermont Technical College in Randolph, which has another campus in Williston, would close. Liberal arts programs in Johnson and Lyndon would be moved to Castleton University. Not every program would be transferable, Spaulding said. The board and chancellor said they received more than 1,000 emails over the weekend from students, faculty and community members, with some painful stories. The schools’ faculty assemblies and unions voted no confidence in Spaulding, and a petition was started to keep the Northern Vermont University at Lyndon campus open.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Staff at the University of Virginia Medical Center threw away convention to find a way to extend the life of personal protective equipment in the face of the highly communicable and deadly new coronavirus, The Daily Progress reports. With a pandemic raging, staff across the center’s departments worked to find ways of extending the life of protective gear as shortages of N95 masks and other equipment used when treating patients grew critical in other parts of the country struck by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Staff wound up playing MacGyver with a robot designed to clean hospital rooms of virulent organisms, turning it into a virus-killing, gear-cleaning, ultraviolet ray gun called Tru-D. Set at maximum power, Tru-D can disinfect hundreds of masks with each 20-minute cycle.\n\nWashington\n\nPasco: The sheriff of a county in eastern Washington state is telling residents he will not enforce Gov. Jay Inslee’s stay-at-home orders or any guidelines “that infringe on your constitutional rights.” Franklin County Sheriff J.D. Raymond sent a letter to constituents Monday in which he said he does believe the coronavirus pandemic is real and “needs to be dealt with appropriately.” “I believe that social distancing and taking appropriate and proper steps to slow the spread of the virus and control its transmission is important,” Raymond said. But Raymond, who has been sheriff for six years in the county of about 95,000 people whose biggest city is Pasco, also said he believes adults are capable of policing themselves, and “we have the capability of adjusting our habits to these trying times.” KOMO-TV reports Raymond thinks local businesses and houses of worship can reopen while adhering to strict social distancing standards.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: The city responded Monday to a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union that raised concerns with officials’ plans to clear a homeless encampment. Authorities in Wheeling began efforts last week to remove informal living setups erected in a section of city-owned property after receiving numerous criminal complaints from residents and contractors, The Intelligencer reports. The West Virginia ACLU chapter asked the city Sunday to commit to halting the removal of the encampments and instead establish housing options for the individuals who would be displaced, according to a copy of the letter obtained by news outlets. The organization contended that clearing the camp would go against the statewide shelter-in-place order meant to protect against the spread of the coronavirus – as well as Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending homeless encampments not be vacated. Wheeling City Manager Robert Herron said Monday that officials were reviewing the concerns but did not say whether they would be addressed, according to news outlets.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican leaders of the Legislature asked the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court on Tuesday to block an order from Gov. Tony Evers’ administration extending a stay-at-home order until May 26. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald asked the Supreme Court to take the case directly, a move that would skip lower courts and get a final ruling sooner. Evers on Thursday announced he was directing state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm to extend the order closing most nonessential businesses from April 24 to May 26. Vos and Fitzgerald said Tuesday that there was “immense frustration” with the extension. They argue that Palm exceeded her authority in issuing it. Evers has said he believes the order was made legally. Vos and Fitzgerald said the order is eroding the economy and liberty of people in the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Flanked by bodyguards wearing virus-protection face masks, Gov. Mark Gordon told about 100 raucous protesters Monday that he didn’t know when Wyoming would get back to normal but was talking with state officials about how to reopen businesses. On the one-month mark after his orders to close schools and a variety of businesses to limit the spread of the coronavirus, he came out of the Capitol to engage with the group carrying the U.S. and the Gadsden “Don’t Tread on Me” flags and signs reading “Don’t Flatten the Economy” and “Defend Liberty.” Gordon began by reading a prayer but didn’t quiet the group, who demanded to know what businesses and jobs he thought were essential. “They’re all essential!” somebody else shouted before Gordon could answer. Wyoming’s measures set to run through at least April 30 aren’t as strict as those in neighboring states that have issued statewide stay-at-home orders, Gordon pointed out.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/09/10/school-starts-paper-masks-hero-pay-news-around-states/113747132/", "title": "School starts, paper masks: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The city eased pandemic restrictions and began allowing bars to reopen with limits Tuesday, days after the University of Alabama reported nearly 850 new cases of the coronavirus, which has affected more than 2,000 students at the school. The change followed complaints from bar owners that a two-week shutdown, meant to stem the spread of the illness on campus, was unfair and hurting business. But critics charged that allowing bars to reopen after the closure would make it easier for the new coronavirus to infect people. School and city officials said the university appears to be headed in the right direction in combating the virus despite reporting 846 new cases Friday. That equaled 121 new cases daily from Aug. 28 to Sept. 3 as opposed to more 160 new cases reported each day Aug. 25-27. Some bars tried to lure patrons by announcing the reopening on social media with drink specials and games.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawsuit filed Tuesday asks a judge to block election officials from enforcing during the COVID-19 pandemic a requirement that Alaska absentee voters have someone witness them signing their ballots. The plaintiffs are the Arctic Village Council, a tribal government; the League of Women Voters of Alaska; and two individuals who the lawsuit says have health concerns. The lawsuit seeks to have the witness requirement declared “unconstitutionally burdensome” on the plaintiffs’ right to vote amid the pandemic. Maria Bahr, a state Department of Law spokesperson, said the department needs time to evaluate the complaint. The lawsuit names as defendants Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer, who oversees elections; Gail Fenumiai, director of the Division of Elections; and the division. Meyer has encouraged voters to “think creatively” about how to fulfill the witness requirement “in a safe manner.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State health officials reported just over 80 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths Tuesday, fueling some business owners to call for an end to operating restrictions. The Department of Health Services reported 81 additional cases statewide. The last time the state saw a daily case count below 100 was in March, according to online data. So far, 5,221 people in the state have died of the disease caused by the coronavirus, and there have been 206,045 confirmed cases. The state, once a national hot spot for infections, continues to see a downward trend in infections and hospitalizations. The number of reported infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State health officials on Tuesday said their biggest growth in new coronavirus cases is among college-aged people, with the number of active infections at the University of Arkansas’ main campus approaching 1,000. The Arkansas Department of Health on Tuesday reported 294 newly confirmed virus cases statewide, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 66,021. Cases among people 18 to 24 years old grew by nearly 17% last week, two to three times more than any other age group. The state Health Department said the school has 961 active cases. The spike comes days after the school moved to restrict on-campus events and off-campus parties over concerns about the outbreak. The school told students they would treat organizing or attending large parties without masks or social distancing as a violation of the student code.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Significantly fewer people are testing positive and being hospitalized for the coronavirus, but Gov. Gavin Newsom and his top health official said Tuesday that they won’t speed up the deliberate process they established last month for reopening the state. The system allows counties to reopen more businesses and activities as they meet thresholds for infection rates and cases. There are four color-coded levels, and five new counties – Amador, Orange, Placer, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz – moved out of the highest tier, clearing the way for their restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and churches to resume limited indoor activities. Statewide, California’s infection rate has dropped steadily for weeks and now sits at 3.8% for the past seven days. Hospitalizations total about 3,100, the lowest since mid-June and down 24% in two weeks. “If those appear to be promising numbers, it’s because they are,” Newsom said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Coloradans will soon be able to download or activate a free app that will notify them when they might’ve been exposed to COVID-19, Gov. Jared Polis announced at a Tuesday press conference. Also at the press conference, Polis detailed plans for in-person attendance at the upcoming Sept. 27 Denver Broncos game, when an estimated 5,700 fans will watch the game at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium. Paired together, the two pieces of news preview a return to “quote-unquote normalcy” if Coloradans can keep up social distancing, Polis said. The exposure notification app, called EN Express, will be available on smartphones at the end of September as an iOS update for Apple users and an app for Android users. The voluntary, free app won’t track or share people’s location or personal information, said Sarah Tuneberg, Innovation Response Team Lead for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSomers: Two schools have been temporarily closed, and staff members in several others have been sent home to quarantine following positive tests for the new coronavirus just days into the start of a new academic year. The Valley Regional High School in Deep River, which opened Sept. 1, was closed Tuesday and Wednesday after two students were diagnosed with COVID-19, according to Regional School District 4 Superintendent Brian White. The school continued classes online while staff worked to clean the building. Families of children in the Somers Elementary School, which opened Tuesday, received similar news after a staff member in a pre-kindergarten class there reported a positive test. That school announced it will be closed to in-person learning through Thursday for cleaning. Schools remained open in Waterbury, Glastonbury, Plainville, Newington, Washington, Cornwall and Coventry despite positive tests for the virus.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state is investigating what might be behind a slight increase in coronavirus cases over the past week or so. The cities of Wilmington, New Castle, Newark and Dover in particular are seeing a rise in cases. Gov. John Carney said the state has made progress but still needs to do more. “We have an upper hand, but we’re not completely winning,” Carney said. “We’re not hammering down this virus like we need to. And that just requires everybody to lean in just a little bit more and to wear that mask when you’re in public.” Carney said the focus of the outbreaks are the young adults who are less concerned about the virus and have a “sense of invincibility.” He pointed to parties on college campuses as well as bars and restaurants. Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, said the University of Delaware has reported 41 cases since Sept. 3. Investigators have been unable to find a single point of exposure.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Unemployed D.C. residents are set to get more much-needed relief and money from the federal government, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the District of Columbia Department of Employment Services said federal officials approved the district’s application to participate in the Lost Wages Assistance Program, allowing D.C. to offer an additional unemployment compensation benefit of $300 per week to eligible unemployment insurance recipients. The LWA program has helped provide money for unemployment after the expiration of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation’s $600 weekly benefit in July. Payments would be retroactive to Aug. 1, and the district expects recipients will start receiving payments by the first week of October.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The number of Florida State University students testing positive for COVID-19 showed a marked increase in the past week. Figures released Tuesday show more than 700 Florida State University students tested positive in the past week, compared to the previous week. The latest numbers show 839 students and 14 employees testing positive. The university pointed to an overall positivity rate of 7.32% for cases collected since Aug. 2. That rate includes data from before many FSU students arrived for the first day of class Aug. 24. The spike in positive tests at FSU comes as Leon County was recently listed as a hot spot, having been on The New York Times’ online map of coronavirus cases. The vast majority of new cases have been in the school- and college-age group.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Workers coming to the coast to cut apart and remove a giant cargo ship that overturned a year ago will be sequestered at a nearby resort, which will close to the public for up to four months, in an effort to prevent coronavirus infections among the salvage team. Tuesday marked a year since the South Korean freighter Golden Ray capsized off St. Simons Island. Experts determined the ship was too badly damaged to be floated out intact, so they plan to slice it into eight massive pieces for removal by barge. Cutting had been scheduled to begin in late July but was delayed after nine workers tested positive for COVID-19. The salvage team hopes to begin cutting in early October, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Himes, a spokesman for the multi-agency command overseeing the salvage. He confirmed the command booked the resort Epworth by the Sea to keep about 100 salvage workers housed in a “bubble” for a four-month period.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mayor Kirk Caldwell said Tuesday that he would extend the city’s stay-at-home order for two weeks to control the coronavirus but will modify the rules to allow solo activity at beaches, parks and trails. The stay-at-home order will be kept in place through Sept. 24. Individuals will be able to go to beaches, parks and trails to run, sit or eat by themselves beginning Thursday. Caldwell said he extended the order because the number of new COVID-19 cases hadn’t declined as much as he wanted to loosen rules more significantly. He said he wants to discuss over the next two weeks how to cautiously reopen more activities. Caldwell said the city relaxed restrictions too quickly when it lifted the previous stay-at-home order, contributing to a surge in cases. The mayor said he wants to avoid that outcome this time. The state Department of Health reported 66 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, a lower figure than in recent days.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State tax revenue for August blew past predictions for the second consecutive month, state budget officials said Tuesday. Idaho’s state tax revenues came in $37 million, or 13%, over forecasts, and the state is looking at a potential $500 million in surplus tax revenue for the fiscal year that started in July. Republican Gov. Brad Little told the Associated Press the latest numbers bode well for his plan to reopen the economy while handling the continued impact of the coronavirus pandemic. But he said he’s viewing the latest budget numbers cautiously. “We’re budgeting in a time of great uncertainty,” he said. “One or two months does not make a long-term trend, but it’s darn better than having to go the other way.” He attributed some of the good numbers to conservative budgeting and cuts to regulations.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: Bradley University is requiring its entire student body to quarantine for two weeks because of clusters of COVID-19 on campus and is reverting to remote learning, officials announced Tuesday. Officials of the private university said they have linked a spike of the coronavirus to off-campus gatherings. The Peoria school is requiring students to limit nonessential interactions; stay in their off-campus apartments, residence halls or Greek houses; and take classes remotely beginning Tuesday. In announcing the measure, the university said it has tallied about 50 COVID-19 cases so far, adding that emergency measures are needed to respond to the outbreak without disrupting academic progress. Most of those who tested positive are asymptomatic carriers, and others have experienced mild symptoms, Bradley President Stephen Standifird said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Mayor Joe Hogsett on Tuesday announced the city will devote millions in federal coronavirus aid to provide rehousing services to the homeless. About $7.1 million will be used to connect hundreds of Hoosiers who are currently experiencing homelessness with up to 12 months of rental assistance and wraparound services to help them find housing and stay housed long-term. A tenet of the city’s housing-first strategy to combating homelessness, rapid rehousing has three main components, said Chelsea Haring-Cozzi, executive director of the Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention: housing, rental assistance and connections to services, including employment, to provide long-term solutions to homelessness. An estimated 90% of those who have been housed through rapid rehousing programs remain housed after two years, she said.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: The city approved a mask mandate Tuesday, joining with others in the state that have taken similar moves amid continued high numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases. Cedar Falls joins Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, Dubuque, Iowa City, Mount Vernon, Muscatine and Waterloo in enacting mask requirements. Enforcement of the rules varies but is primarily focused on education, with police in some communities instructed to hand out masks to those not wearing them. Gov. Kim Reynolds has declined to approve a statewide mask order because she said it would be impossible to enforce. Reynolds has told local jurisdictions that because she hasn’t issued an order, they don’t have the authority to enforce their mask mandates. In Cedar Falls, the mask rule takes effect immediately and will last for six weeks. It requires masks for people older than 5 while in indoor public places and outdoors when it’s not possible to maintain a distance of 6 feet.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: Students and teachers facing an already challenging new school year dealt with technology issues as more school districts reopened Tuesday with many students working online. In Olathe, service was interrupted Tuesday when nearly 50,000 users on separate devices tried to log on to the district’s online teaching system that is designed for 30,000 students, school officials said. Middle and high school students were using only remote learning, while elementary students started with a hybrid of online and in-person classes. The district had previously increased its bandwidth. After more servers were added, the disruption was cleared by mid-morning, spokesman Cody Kennedy said. In Wichita, where students in sixth through 12th grades were only online and elementary students started with the hybrid model, the district had enough devices for online students but still needed hot spots for some, Superintendent Alicia Thompson told KAKE-TV.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Leaders with the Metro Disability Coalition protested Tuesday what they called a “horrible situation” facing drivers with disabilities aboard Transit Authority of River City buses. Marcellus Mayes, president of MDC, stood in front of TARC headquarters and compared buses to a “nursing home on wheels.” He and Bobbie Jones, vice president of MDC, said TARC isn’t enforcing personal protective equipment on buses; isn’t providing drivers with enough cleaning supplies and PPE for their routes; is not making drivers coming in from hot spots or other countries quarantine before driving; and is not treating a personal care attendant as an individual who factors into the headcount. TARC has a 25-person limit on fixed routes, and TARC3, which provides transportation for people with disabilities, has a two-passenger limit on buses and a one-passenger limit on vans and cars.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Republican state officials’ reluctance to allow expanded mail-in voting this fall – despite having done so for summer elections – is at issue in a federal case unfolding this week amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Voting rights advocates have filed a lawsuit against the current, limited plan for absentee mail balloting drawn up by Louisiana’s Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. Ardoin, a Republican, has said he could not get needed approval from GOP lawmakers for anything more expansive. But Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards’ approval also is needed, and he has said Ardoin’s plan does too little to protect voter health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Edwards has asked U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick in Baton Rouge to resolve what amounts to a stalemate by ordering broader mail-in voting in the state. Dick presided over an online hearing where preliminaries were discussed Tuesday.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Public health officials monitoring the spread of coronavirus in other states are no closer to easing travel restrictions put in place because of the virus. Maine requires travelers from other states to produce a negative coronavirus test or quarantine for two weeks. It exempted New Hampshire and Vermont from those requirements in late June and added Connecticut, New York and New Jersey to the exempt list in early July. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Nirav Shah said Tuesday that the state recently reviewed case statistics in other states and “didn’t see anything that prompted us to move any states into the ‘can visit without negative test’ category.” That means the travel restrictions still apply to Massachusetts, which sends droves of tourists to Maine every summer and fall. But Shah said the number of new cases per million in Massachusetts was 769, more than three times the number in Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Hospital workers out front in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic would receive “hero pay,” or bonuses, under a bill proposed by a U.S. representative. Democratic Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland’s Second Congressional District plans to roll out his proposal Thursday, The Baltimore Sun reports, citing a news release from the congressman’s office Tuesday. The plan would provide hazard pay to doctors, nurses, specialists and nonmedical staffs in hospitals such as custodians who work in close proximity to COVID-19 patients within federally designated virus hot spots, the news release said. It’s not immediately clear how much workers would receive or where funding for the plan would come from. Ruppersberger named the bill after Dr. Joseph Costa, the director of the critical care unit at Baltimore’s Mercy Medical Center who died of COVID-19 in July.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A coronavirus testing lab that counts dozens of nursing homes among its clients has been suspended by the state after it returned nearly 400 false positive tests, state officials say. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health opened an investigation in early August after it became aware of an unusually high positive rate of COVID-19 tests reported by Orig3n Laboratory, the agency said in a statement Tuesday. Retests found at least 383 false positives that were actually negative. The state late last month notified Orig3n of “three significant certification deficiencies that put patients at immediate risk of harm,” including failure of the lab’s director to provide overall management and a failure to document the daily sanitizing of equipment used for coronavirus testing. An Orig3n spokesman told Gannett New England, which first reported the story, that the false positives were due to “human error.”\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: More than 120 students last week reported positive results for the coronavirus – a “wake-up call to our community,” Michigan State University said Tuesday. The students, nearly all living off campus, had symptoms and were tested on campus or reported the results from tests performed elsewhere. President Samuel Stanley Jr. said the numbers were “disappointing but not unexpected.” “As students return to off-campus housing, some are attending large gatherings where people are in close contact without an appropriate face covering,” he said. “This is the easiest and fastest way for the coronavirus to spread.” MSU said 124 students and two employees tested positive. The Ingham County health department has limited outdoor gatherings in East Lansing to 25 people who aren’t from the same household. East Lansing also is requiring masks on streets and sidewalks in popular commercial areas.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Winona State University quarantined itself for two weeks starting Tuesday amid an increasing spread of the coronavirus on the southeastern Minnesota campus, while most of the state’s elementary and secondary schools kicked off a school year that will test whether their preparations to teach amid the pandemic will pay off. The day after Labor Day marks the traditional return to school for most Minnesota school districts, though some started earlier. The state’s colleges and universities have been seeing a lot of coronavirus spread already, said Kris Ehresman, the infectious disease director at the Minnesota Department of Health. Besides Winona State, she cited Concordia-Moorhead and Minnesota State-Moorhead as collectively having a large number of cases. Minnesota State-Mankato has stabilized, she said, “but we’ll see what comes after the holiday weekend.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said it’s “unfortunate” that the coronavirus pandemic broke out during an election year, and the upcoming election has made conversations about the virus overly political. “It’s certainly unfortunate that if we’re going to have a pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t seen in over 100 years, that it would happen to occur – maybe it wasn’t happenstance – but that it would happen to occur during an election year, which has made a large number of people look at every single decision from a political viewpoint,” Reeves said at a Tuesday press briefing. He said initiating those conversations “certainly hasn’t always been helpful.” The governor did not elaborate on what he meant when he said “maybe it wasn’t happenstance” that the pandemic occurred during an election year. He said he believes President Donald Trump has gone above and beyond in his response.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: A 34-year-old teacher has died after a three-week-long hospitalization with COVID-19. AshLee DeMarinis taught social skills and special education at John Evans Middle School in the Potosi School District in eastern Missouri. Superintendent Alex McCaul announced her death in a letter Monday that was posted on the district’s Facebook page. The letter didn’t cite a cause of death. But DeMarinis’ sister, Jennifer Heissenbuttel, said DeMarinis had been hospitalized with the coronavirus and died Sunday. Heissenbuttel said her sister had not yet begun teaching students when she became ill last month but had returned to the classroom to prepare for the school year. McCaul said contact tracing has found DeMarinis had no close contact with any other teachers or staff. The district’s school year began Aug. 24 with in-person classes, though students can opt to attend classes virtually.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A tribal college in southern Montana is waiving tuition and fees for the fall semester in an effort to ease hardships created by COVID-19, school officials said. Little Big Horn College on the Crow Indian Reservation announced the waiver last month, The Billings Gazette reports. Course registration closes in mid-September. The college plans to offer a mix of online-only and hybrid courses to limit the number of students on campus, President David Yarlott said. The college is using federal coronavirus relief funding to offset the loss of tuition, Yarlott said. Big Horn County, where the college is located, has been hit hard by COVID-19, with 735 cases and 19 deaths, two of which were announced by the county health department Wednesday. Montana reported 90 new cases of COVID-19 Wednesday, as the total number of known cases since mid-March neared 8,500.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has suspended six sorority and fraternity chapters on its campus after photos and videos showed students in those organizations violating local public health guidelines and university policies. The suspensions were handed down Tuesday, the Lincoln Journal Star reports, to Alpha Omicron Phi, Alpha Xi Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Phi Delta Thea and Sigma Phi Epsilon. During the suspensions, the Greek chapters may not host or participate in any activities or events, nor participate in universitywide events as an organization. UNL administrators learned several Greek houses had hosted large gatherings Monday, which was bid day for several sororities. Attendees were not wearing face coverings or observing social distancing guidelines, officials said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Area health officials said Tuesday that eight children under age 14 who tested positive for COVID-19 since March were also diagnosed with a rare inflammatory condition linked with the coronavirus. The Southern Nevada Health District said all eight children were hospitalized and released, and the district has begun adding daily tallies of confirmed cases of the illness dubbed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children to its daily online coronavirus response report. While there isn’t a known cause, many children with the illness had COVID-19 or had close contact with someone who did. Not all children exhibit the same symptoms. They can include fever, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Researchers say the illness can cause inflammation of the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The pandemic changed not just how candidates campaigned leading up to Tuesday’s state primary but the act of voting itself. Temporary changes to state law allowed anyone with concerns about the virus to vote by absentee ballot. Those who voted in person stood 6 feet apart in line and were greeted by volunteers sitting behind Plexiglas shields. Some communities required voters to wear masks, while setting aside separate areas for those who declined to wear a mask or couldn’t do so for health reasons. “It was as smooth as silk,” said Reed Cotton, of Concord, who wore a mask and gloves and was carrying her toddler grandson. She considered getting an absentee ballot but decided to go vote, instead, since the number of coronavirus cases was so low. “I’m free!” Mick Swanwick exclaimed to his wife, Susan, as they removed their masks after leaving the polling place. “It was needlessly elaborate, but it seemed safe enough.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Students across the state started school Tuesday, with most returning to hybrid in-person and remote lessons, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said. The school-year shake-up stems from the state’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has resulted in nearly 195,000 positive cases and more than 14,000 deaths. Murphy said 388 school districts opted for a hybrid model, which entails classroom and remote learning. There were 69 districts with all in-person learning and 238 with all-remote starts. Some 28 districts contain schools that went with a combination of those models, Murphy said. There were about 280 new positive cases reported overnight, the governor said, putting the total at about 195,000. There were five deaths reported, leaving the death toll at 14,213. The rate of transmission ticked up to 1.10 from 1.09 on Monday. The rate reflects the number of people to whom an infected person passes the virus.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials clarified Tuesday that teachers won’t be on the hook for lawsuits that might stem from COVID-19 outbreaks. “In no way will teachers or school employees be held personally liable for litigation arising out of COVID-19,” said Richard Valerio, executive director of New Mexico Public Schools Insurance Authority. School districts can be on the hook for negligence that leads to students getting sick, however. The insurance agency sent a letter last week to districts urging them to follow safe COVID-19 practices to avoid getting sued. Valerio said it’s “wait and see” as to how much legal risk schools will face. No lawsuits have been filed in New Mexico, which has had some in-person learning for certain at-risk students. Teachers are immune from personal liability for virtually all lawsuits, such as a personal injury claim from a student who contracts a virus at school.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants in the city can resume indoor dining Sept. 30 at 25% capacity with other restrictions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. Cuomo said all customers will undergo temperature checks at the door, and one member of each party will have to provide information for contact tracing if needed. Customers will not be served drinks at bars, which will be used only to provide drinks for table service, and restaurants must close at midnight. Tables will be required to be 6 feet apart, and customers must wear masks while not at the table. Indoor dining is already allowed in restaurants elsewhere in New York state. “We knew that compliance was lacking in New York City. That was a reason for caution,” Cuomo said. He said the state could halt indoor dining if infection rates go up. But if it remains steady, New York City could lift more restrictions on indoor dining starting Nov. 1.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: At least 1,000 East Carolina University students have tested positive for the coronavirus since fall classes began Aug. 10, according to the college’s COVID-19 case count. ECU’s COVID-19 dashboard, updated Tuesday afternoon, showed 1,084 students tested positive for the virus between Aug. 9 and Sept. 5, thus making ECU the first college in the state to eclipse 1,000 cases since classes restarted. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University, which started in-person classes the same day as ECU, are also approaching 1,000 student coronavirus cases. UNC had more than 900 student cases through Sept. 3, while N.C. State reported nearly 800 through Aug. 29, according to their university dashboards. Police shut down several parties during ECU’s opening weekend, including one with about 400 attendees.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Several groups in the state are working to increase tribal participation in the 2020 U.S. census to ensure they are not undercounted or underfunded. Overall, North Dakota has an 86% response rate and about a 64% self-response rate. But participation of the state’s five tribal nations ranges from 21% to 40% for self-response, U.S. Census Bureau data shows. Census advocates credit many factors to the low response, most notably the coronavirus pandemic, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “The ability for workers going door to door, social distancing – that’s been a big, big part of it,” North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission Executive Director Scott Davis said. “That’s probably been the biggest factor that I’ve seen experienced.” Davis also pointed out that reservations can be harder to count because of rural settings and a lack of housing.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: About 48,000 Ohioans have been notified they received an overpayment of unemployment benefits during the coronavirus pandemic, the state human services agency said. That’s about 6% of the nearly 800,000 Ohioans who have been paid regular unemployment benefits since the start of the pandemic in March, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. About 1.7 million Ohioans filed jobless claims during the pandemic. The state has paid out $6.2 billion in state unemployment compensation to almost 800,000 people and distributed more than $5.4 billion in federal payments. In most cases, the overpayments are the result of individuals not reporting or underreporting money they made during weeks for which they filed claims, said Bret Crow, a Job and Family services spokesperson. Overpayments as the result of a state error don’t have to be repaid.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: City Council members, torn between slowing the spread of COVID-19 and restricting struggling businesses, backed away from a plan Tuesday night to reduce Campus Corner bar and restaurant capacity by 50% on days when the University of Oklahoma football team plays at home. Instead, the council voted 7-1 to amend the city’s existing mask and social ordinance by allowing bars and restaurants to operate at 75% of capacity inside and outside, including patios and blocked-off streets, where patrons will gather Saturday for OU’s season opener against Missouri State. Mayor Breea Clark supported the amendment but expressed concerns about Norman’s rising infection rate, which she called “concerning.” The existing ordinance already limits most bars and restaurants to 50% capacity, but some that operate near the OU campus have struggled to meet those requirements, council member Kate Bierman said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The positivity rate of COVID-19 tests in the state dropped for the sixth consecutive week, according to a new report from the Oregon Health Authority. The positivity rate was 4.3% the week of Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, when there were a reported 1,163 positive tests out of 25,855 tests administered. It was the lowest Oregon had been since the week of June 21-27, when the positivity rate was 4.8%. The rate was a drop from 4.4% the week before and 6.2% the week of July 26 to Aug. 1. The number of tests administered has dropped steadily since mid-July, when 40,887 were administered the week of July 12-18.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLancaster: Gov. Tom Wolf is urging the Legislature to extend the statewide moratorium on evictions to avoid the ouster of thousands of tenants who have lost jobs because of coronavirus shutdowns. The commonwealth’s moratorium, which ended last week, legally cannot be extended by the governor alone. “Pennsylvania is still racing toward an eviction cliff when thousands of families will face months of unpaid rent and fees,” Wolf said at a press conference in Lancaster on Tuesday. Last week the Trump administration implemented a national four-month moratorium on residential evictions, but Wolf said that alone would not do enough for Pennsylvanians at risk of losing their homes. “It only helps some renters, not all,” Wolf said. “It doesn’t stop mortgage foreclosures at all, and it doesn’t assist landlords who are struggling to pay their mortgages and pay their taxes. So I am continuing to ask our General Assembly to act.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A British company with a factory in the state has started manufacturing recyclable paper masks it says address two problems brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. MOO Inc.’s masks, made of heavy gauge cotton paper, can affordably help protect workers at businesses when customers forget to bring a mask, and they cut down on trash. “It’s a single sheet of paper with no plastic, no elastic, so it’s completely recyclable,” the company’s chief operating officer, Nicholas Ruotolo, told The Providence Journal. “It’s a great solution to the challenges that we face, both the health challenges and the environmental ones.” MOO, which prints business cards, letterhead, fliers and other business products at its Lincoln facility, can even customize the masks with a company logo. The company, which began production last week, is donating 5,000 masks to Crossroads Rhode Island, an agency that works with the homeless.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina says it has drawn among its largest freshman classes in history, along with increases in enrollment at its flagship campus for the fall semester, beginning amid the coronavirus pandemic. The state’s largest four-year college reported welcoming its second-largest freshman class, among more than 35,400 total undergraduate and graduate students, for the fall semester, The Post and Courier reports, citing preliminary data released this week. About 7,750 new students are on the Columbia campus, and more than half of the new students are South Carolina residents, according to the university’s data. While the flagship campus reported a slight increase in overall enrollment, most of its seven satellite campuses did see slight decreases compared to October 2019 data, according to the preliminary numbers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration announced Tuesday that it is using federal coronavirus relief funds to pay for a $5 million tourism ad campaign aimed at drawing people to the state, even as it emerges as one of the nation’s top hot spots for COVID-19 infections. The 30-second spot, which premiered on Fox News alongside Noem’s speech at the Republican National Convention last month, features the governor saying that “with our breathtaking landscapes and wide-open spaces, we’re a place to safely explore.” But the state currently ranks second in the country for new cases per capita over the past two weeks, with 439 new cases per 100,000 people. The ad, narrated by Noem, offers dramatic footage of South Dakota scenery such as Mount Rushmore and Badlands National Park, then concludes with the governor introducing herself and pitching a visit to South Dakota.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The chancellor of the University of Tennessee said Tuesday that COVID-19 cases are increasing “way too fast” and that specific actions to address the jump will be announced in the coming days. In an online message, Chancellor Donde Plowman said there are 600 active cases at the Knoxville campus. She said more than 2,100 people are in quarantine or self-isolation, the vast majority of whom are students split about evenly on and off campus. She said the university has added a hotel to isolate on-campus students who test positive and is doubling its number of contact tracers. Plowman cited reports of fraternity leaders communicating to houses how to have parties, avoid getting caught and avoid the police; stories of a fraternity renting space off-campus to have a party crammed with people in close quarters; and of frat members being told not to get tested or how to get tested so the results aren’t shared with the school.\n\nTexas\n\nArlington: The marquee National Finals Rodeo is moving this year from Las Vegas to Texas due to coronavirus restrictions, event officials announced Wednesday. Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association and Texas Rangers officials said the Western horse sports championship will be held Dec. 3-12 at Globe Life Field, a retractable-roof stadium in Arlington that opened this year and seats more than 40,000 people. Texas has 50% occupancy guidelines due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and rodeo officials project up to 17,000 ticket-buyers daily – with some seats empty, masks required and hand-sanitizing stations added. Arlington Mayor Jeff Williams called the event the Super Bowl of rodeo. Betsy Price, mayor of nearby Fort Worth, said Texas knows rodeo, and officials have roped a big one. Las Vegas Events President Pat Christenson said no single event has a bigger impact on Las Vegas than the National Finals Rodeo.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Great Salt Lake is shrinking every year, but experts are implementing measures to slow the water loss, according to a new report. The Great Salt Lake Advisory Council says the water depth has dropped about 11 feet over the past 10 years, KSTU-TV reports. “It will continue to decrease at about the same amount over the next couple of decades if more is not done to bring water to the lake,” Great Salt Lake coordinator Laura Vernon said. The lake is crucial to the region’s recreation, migratory birds and billion-dollar economy. The advisory council said the shrinking water level left unchecked could also cause increased air pollution from the wind blowing minerals out of the exposed lake bed. The council narrowed a list of 70 strategies to 12 “actionable” measures that could keep the lake from evaporating, Vernon said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House has given preliminary approval to $5 million in stimulus payments amid the coronavirus pandemic for residents who did not receive stimulus checks from the federal government based on their immigrant status. Under the Vermont Coronavirus Economic Stimulus Equity Program approved Tuesday, eligible adults would receive $1,200 and $500 for each eligible child. They must have had adjusted gross income of less than $99,000 last year or, if filing jointly, an adjusted gross income of less than $198,000. The proposal was up for a final reading in the House on Wednesday before heading to the Senate. Vermont reported two new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday for a total of 1,656 cases since the pandemic began. One person was hospitalized with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the Health Department. The total number of deaths has remained at 58 since July 28.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A regional jail is on lockdown after approximately 70% of its inmates recently tested positive for COVID-19, officials said Wednesday. James Willett, the superintendent of the Pamunkey Regional Jail, said there have been no deaths or hospitalizations as a result of the positive tests, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Willett said officials found out Monday that 124 of the 178 offenders tested were positive, and 20 of the 129 staff members tested were positive for the virus. Willett also said the “vast majority” of those who tested positive showed either mild symptoms or no symptoms. The virus made its impact on the jail despite precautions instituted in March that included isolation areas for the newly arrested, screening, temperature checks, enhanced cleaning, and the cancellation of all unnecessary visits and programs as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Willett said.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: School districts in the state have distributed thousands of computers and other devices to students to assist them with remote learning during the pandemic, but many families are still facing connectivity issues in rural areas. Families in Kitsap County raised concerns about digital access as schools reopened online for the year to limit the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the risk of in-person schooling. “Supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly delayed a shipment we placed last spring,” the Central Kitsap School District said on its website Aug. 28 regarding delays in delivered devices. “Until we receive that shipment, we ask families who already have devices in their homes to wait before requesting a district Chromebook.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Children returned to classes for the start of the school year throughout the state Tuesday. In nine of 55 counties, students began the year with remote learning due to the coronavirus pandemic. The state issued an updated color-coded map Saturday night showing the nine counties in either orange or red, meaning public schools were prohibited from conducting face-to-face instruction. Meanwhile, in Huntington, Marshall University announced it will start picking about 60 students, faculty and staff at random daily to test for the coronavirus. The university is also testing more than 175 football players and staff several times a week. The school has contact tracers on staff to follow up with positive cases. Testing data is set to be posted on the university’s website.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Carroll University suspended three students for hosting an off-campus party with at least 20 guests. The three hosts are suspended for the duration of the fall semester. They were notified Aug. 26, and their appeal was denied Sept. 3. They will be refunded 80% of their tuition. The party occurred Aug. 22, two days before the start of classes. The 20 students found to have attended the party are in quarantine. As of Sept. 3, the university had 13 active cases of COVID-19. In total, 14 students have tested positive. University President Cindy Gnadinger said she does not know if any of the students who attended the party tested positive. The university’s COVID-19 rules – which Gnadinger said were communicated to students “extensively” and apply to off-campus settings – limit gatherings to 10 people and require social distancing and masks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The beginning of the fall semester at local schools has been a masked, socially distanced affair still teeming with excitement, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. How long schools stay open is the open question. Most officials accept that it’s a matter of when, not if, the coronavirus makes its way into Casper schools. At Park Elementary, parents sent their kids through the gate into the playground, where they hung around or ran off to play, masks on. Parents weren’t allowed into the playground or the building itself – not without an appointment. Teachers handed out heart stickers for kindergartners and their parents to wear on their hands, so they could look down and think of each other throughout the bizarre first day.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/10/21/covid-essentials-tohono-oodham-nation-hoover-dam-news-around-states/114453572/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: A spike in drunken driving cases in Morgan County has led to speculation that the stresses associated with the coronavirus pandemic might be behind the increase. County sheriff’s spokesman Mike Swafford said his department made 43 DUI arrests in the first nine months of 2019. This year, the total is 66 through Sept. 30, an increase of almost 54%. Swafford told The Decatur Daily that sheriff’s officials believe the pandemic is a factor. “People are stressed more,” he said. “We’re seeing more cases of domestic violence, people arguing with their neighbors that we attribute to the stress of everyday living during this pandemic.” But there has also been an increase in patrols under Sheriff Ron Puckett. And, another likely factor, he said, is the closure of two bridges on a U.S. highway that created a 16-mile detour. Another state jurisdiction also is seeing an increase in DUI cases compared to other localities. Town Creek Police Chief Jerry Garrett believes the pandemic is behind the rise his department has seen in recent months. The police force had 19 DUI arrests from March 1, 2019, to Sept. 30, 2019, but the total jumped to 27 for the same period this year.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Personnel stationed at a military base in Alaska’s largest city were ordered to avoid bars and interior dining at restaurants amid rising coronavirus cases on and off the base. Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson placed the restrictions on airmen and soldiers in Anchorage, The Anchorage Daily News reported Saturday. Members of the 673rd Air Base Wing are not allowed to visit businesses that “primarily engage in preparing and serving alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption,” an Oct. 8 memo from base Commander Col. Kirsten Aguilar said. The order keeps active-duty airmen assigned to the 673rd Wing from visiting bars, breweries, pubs and nightclubs. The restrictions were enacted as a “precaution” because of increasing COVID-19 cases statewide, Media Operations Section Chief Erin Eaton said. “The decision was made based on data and inputs from the medical team through their contact tracing efforts, and through base leadership’s evaluation of risk,” Eaton said in an email. The regulation might be reviewed within 30 days. Aguilar said in a video posted on social media Friday that the base has moved into HPCON Charlie, a military health protection level requiring additional limitations on certain base services and potentially more telecommuting.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Citing an urgent situation, particularly for communities of color, the Tohono O’odham Nation said it will donate $2million to advance COVID-19 research in the state. Leaders of the Tohono O’odham Nation of southern Arizona were in Phoenix to make the announcement that they would be giving $1 million each to the University of Arizona and Arizona State University to advance ongoing COVID-19 research, including the development of rapid tests. The money comes from gaming revenue earned by the tribe’s four casinos. Part of the tribe’s gaming compact with the state requires the donation of 12% of revenue toward local community programs. The tribe operates Desert Diamond casinos near Tucson, Sahuarita, Why and in the West Valley near Glendale that reopened in June. Native American communities across the U.S. have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In Arizona, Native Americans make up just 5% of the state’s population, yet 11% of its known deaths, tribal chairman Ned Norris Jr. said. Norris announced the grants after a prayer led by Tohono O’odham legislative council chairman Timothy Joaquin at the UA College of Medicine - Phoenix on Monday afternoon. UA President Robert Robbins and ASU President Michael Crow were both in attendance to accept the donation, along with officials from the Arizona Board of Regents. Robbins and Crow said their universities are working on developing easy, rapid tests that can give results in minutes that they hope to have ready by spring.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Monday hit a new record for number of people hospitalized because of the illness caused by the coronavirus. The Department of Health reported 41 more people hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing its total number to 613. Ten more people died, bringing the state’s total fatalities to 1,714. The state’s new cases, however, dropped from the previous day. The state’s probable and confirmed cases rose by 531 to 99,597. A day earlier, the state reported 644 new total cases. Arkansas ranks 13th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he remained hopeful that cases would stay low through the week. “Let’s stay vigilant, and while cases usually go up in the next four days, let’s remember that it is up to each of us to do our part to help slow this virus and protect ourselves, our family, and our neighbors,” Hutchinson said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state won’t allow any distribution of coronavirus vaccines until it is reviewed by the state’s own panel of experts, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday. Vaccinations for the pandemic “will move at the speed of trust,” said Newsom, a Democrat, and the state wants its own independent review no matter who wins the presidential election next month. “Of course we won’t take anyone’s word for it,” Newsom said as he named 11 doctors and scientists to review any rollout of vaccines by the federal government or vaccine developers. The board members hail from top California universities and medical providers, along with state and local public health officials. The pledge raises the possibility that California residents might not receive a vaccine as distribution begins in other states, though the governor said widespread vaccinations are unrealistic until sometime next year. At most, 45 million doses will be available nationwide before the end of this year from the two most advanced vaccines, Newsom said. Each person must receive two doses, three weeks apart. If California were to receive 12% of the doses, commensurate with its percentage of the nation’s population, that would be 5.4 million doses, or enough to treat 2.7 million of the state’s nearly 40 million residents. Most would go to front-line medical workers and first responders, he said, then to the most vulnerable in the population.\n\nColorado\n\nLone Tree: With many U.S. stores closing during the coronavirus pandemic, especially inside malls, the owners of a chain of retail stores called COVID-19 Essential have seized on the empty space, as well as the world’s growing acceptance that wearing masks is a reality that may last well into 2021, if not longer. Masks have evolved from a utilitarian, anything-you-can-find-that-works product into another way to express one’s personality, political leanings or sports fandom. And the owners of COVID-19 Essentials are betting that Americans are willing to put their money where their mouth is. Prices range from $19.99 for a simple children’s mask to $130 for a top-of-the-line face covering, with an N95 filter and a battery-powered fan. Almost all shops and many pop-up kiosks in the Park Meadows mall now sell masks. But COVID-19 Essentials also carries other accessories for the pandemic, including hand sanitizer and other sanitation devices. The chain has locations in New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Las Vegas, and is looking to open stores in California, where wildfires have only added to the demand for masks.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is planning to revamp its benchmarks for when people entering the state from locations with large COVID-19 rates will need to quarantine. Currently, state residents and out-of-state travelers coming from states and territories with 10 cases per 100,000 population or 10% positivity rates must fill out a state travel form and isolate for 14 days. Under the new rule, people must take such steps if they come from locations with 10 cases per 100,000 and 5% positivity rates. “The other threshold was so broad that it was including about 85 percent of our states across the country. It was becoming unenforceable,” said Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. As of Monday, Connecticut itself surpassed the threshold of 10 cases per 100,000 with 11.2 new cases per 100,000. The state’s seven-day rolling average for positive cases as of Monday was 1.7%. Lamont said the state will continue to issue fines for Connecticut residents and out-of-state residents who violate the quarantine and state notification rules. As of last week, the state has issued 45 fines, most to people from Connecticut. Lamont said his administration is still trying to determine how to handle workers who live in one state and work in another if Connecticut reaches the new benchmark.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A health care system said it is seeing “overwhelming demand” for flu shots this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beebe Healthcare, a not-for-profit system based in Lewes, has vaccinated more than 3,100 community members through 13 flu clinics, the Delaware State News reported Saturday. That’s about 75% of the total number of vaccinations Beebe recorded last year in more than 30 clinics. This year’s total from Beebe doesn’t include its team members. More than 2,200 were vaccinated in a 48-hour period in September, according to the newspaper. “We’ve seen an overwhelming demand for flu shots from the community this year, which is really encouraging considering how important being vaccinated is with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Bill Chasanov, clinical transformation officer and infectious disease physician at Beebe Healthcare. Health officials and medical groups are urging people to get either the flu shot or nasal spray, so that doctors and hospitals don’t face the extra strain of having to treat influenza in the midst of the pandemic. Last year Delaware had more than 7,000 cases of the flu, with 400 individuals hospitalized and 11 deaths.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly described the nature and location of Beebe Healthcare, which is seeing high demand for flu shots. It is a not-for-profit, independent health care system based in Lewes, Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city will launch a new COVID-19 exposure notifications app for residents to aid in contact tracing, WUSA-TV reported. The app, DC CAN, which became available Tuesday, was developed by Apple and Google and can be used by iPhone and Android users based on whether the smartphone user activates the specific region/state on their phone. D.C. Health Director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt said if users opt in, their phones will send out “beacons” to other nearby phones using a randomly generated ID that changes every 10-20 minutes. According to Nesbitt, the exposure notification system once a day will download a list of keys belonging to people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and report their diagnosis through DC CAN. Users will then receive a notification informing them if they have come in contact with an individual diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:Florida State University President John Thrasher and his wife, Jean, are free of COVID-19, the president posted on his Twitter account Monday afternoon. “I am happy to share that Jean and I were cleared Friday by the Florida DOH after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month, and we are resuming many of our regular activities,” Thrasher said. “We are feeling good and appreciate all the prayers and well wishes!” Jean Thrasher learned of her positive diagnosis on Oct. 5 after a recent stay in the hospital and a local rehabilitation facility for an unrelated condition. President Thrasher, who tested positive Oct. 6, has continued to conduct university business at home. On Monday, FSU reported 26 students tested positive last week, along with one employee, according to the university’s dashboard. In total, 2,031 people were tested at the Tucker Center last week, with a low positivity rate of 1.33%. At Florida A&M University, eight students reported testing positive for the coronavirus for the week ending Friday, according to its weekly dashboard. That is the highest student number since the week of September 25, when nine positive students tests were reported.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The number of COVID-19 cases is rising in Georgia, although infections in the state are not climbing as fast as those nationwide. Even with relatively few infections reported Monday, the state’s seven-day average is close to 1,300, more than 10% above the recent bottom on Oct. 8. The number of people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19 has also been rising for a week, crossing back above 1,300 on Monday. A ray of light for Georgia is that the positivity rate has stayed level over the last two weeks at just above 6%, even as the number of DNA-based tests rose modestly, on average. Georgia’s transmission rates still remain below those being seen nationwide, with the state ranking 35th per capita among states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico over the last two weeks, according to data collected by the the Associated Press.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A state program providing rental assistance to tenants struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily stopped accepting applications. The Rent Relief and Housing Assistance Program called a halt to applications after reaching its processing capacity, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Sunday. The program launched in early September received more than 20,000 applications and overwhelmed Catholic Charities Hawaii and Aloha United Way, which are helping administer the program. The charities are working out how to manage the current backlog. “Right now we’re meeting with them daily to figure out how to work through it as quickly as possible,” said Kent Miyasaki, spokesman for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. The program was expected to disburse $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funding through monthly payments to the landlords of tenants struggling to pay rent. The program approved $5.8 million in payouts, although only $2.3 million has been distributed, Miyasaki said.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho: State officials approved a contract with Florida-based vendor ClassWallet to distribute $50 million in federal coronavirus emergency money to low-income families to help children learn during the coronavirus pandemic. The Idaho State Board of Education awarded the no-bid contract Monday that with various fees will cost the state about $2 million to administer. The program will provide up to $1,500 per child with a maximum of $3,500 per family and help about 30,000 children. The program starts Wednesday, and families can apply between then and Dec. 8. Applications will go out in waves based on need until the money runs out. The board unanimously signed off on the contract that’s part of the Strong Families, Strong Students initiative program put forward by Republican Gov. Brad Little. The money is intended to make it less likely for parents to leave the workforce or dip into household money while their children learn amid the challenges posed by the pandemic. The money will be distributed based on income and can be used to purchase educational materials, computers and other services. Many of Idaho’s 310,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade are learning at home as school districts and families try to avoid spreading COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials warned Monday of “worrying trends” in increased COVID-19 cases, calling it a second wave that could trigger additional restrictions to curb the spread. Such restrictions have returned to other areas of the state. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, speaking Monday in Murphysboro, announced an end to indoor restaurant and bar service in parts of southern Illinois, along with limits on groups of more than 25 from congregating. In Chicago, there has been a more than 50% increase of positive cases in the past two weeks to more than 500 daily cases, according to the Chicago Department of Public Health. Commissioner Allison Arwady said it is the most cases since late May, which was the end of the pandemic’s first wave. There also has been a 25% increase in hospitalizations. There are spikes across all groups of Chicagoans and parts of the city. The increase coincides with an increase statewide. The Illinois Department of Public Health on Monday announced 3,113 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and 22 additional deaths.\n\nIndiana\n\nCovington:A county clerk in rural Indiana said she will not wear a mask while overseeing early voting despite the county’s surge of coronavirus cases and warnings from a state official. Fountain County Clerk Paula Copenhaver said she will “not be part of the government overreach” and contends social distancing and hand sanitizer are enough. Valerie Warycha, spokeswoman for the secretary of state, confirmed Friday that Connie Lawson contacted Copenhaver to ask her to wear a mask. Lawson also wrote in an email on Friday to clerks and election officials in all 92 Indiana counties that if poll workers refuse to wear masks or other protection, clerks should thank them for their service “and ask that they voluntarily resign.” Lawson did not mention any clerks or counties by name in her email, and she did not issue any mandates. State elected officials do not have the authority to do that, Warycha said. Lawson said the election is “the time to be careful, not cavalier,” and that clerks needed to put public health before personal preference, the Journal & Courier reported.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: State Auditor Rob Sand warned the governor’s decision to spend $21 million in federal pandemic relief funds on a new executive branch software system would not be allowed and should be abandoned. Sand said that using the federal money to pay for Workday, a cloud-based program for the executive branch’s human resources and finances, is an inappropriate use under the law. He said that if the money isn’t redeployed for a different purpose, Iowa taxpayers could be on the hook to repay the federal government $21 million later on. Sand, a Democrat, said his conclusion was shared by the Treasury Department’s Office of Inspector General, which is responsible for overseeing the appropriate use of federal funds. He noted that the administration of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a five-year, $20 million software contract with Workday in 2019, long before the coronavirus pandemic started. In addition, the state anticipates spending about $28 million more on implementation costs. Earlier this year, Reynolds’ office decided to partly pay for the program with money from the $2. trillion coronavirus aid package approved in March by Congress, which has sent billions of dollars to Iowa. Reynolds’ office has sought to justify its decision to pay for Workday with the money by arguing that it would allow the state to “act quickly to assist essential government employees.” The program could help workers request COVID-19 hardship assistance and time off for family and medical leaves, for instance.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A coronavirus outbreak has killed 10 residents in a nursing home in a northwestern Kansas county that proportionally already had the nation’s largest increase in cases over two weeks. The health department in Norton County reported Monday night that all 62 residents and an unspecified number of employees at the Andbe Home in Norton had tested positive for the coronavirus. The agency also said one Andbe Home resident was hospitalized, and the remaining 51 were being treated at the home. “Steps are being taken to prevent any further outbreak, including quarantining residents in their rooms and not allowing outside visitors into the facility,” the county health department said in a statement Monday night. The outbreak at the nursing home came after the state Department of Health and Environment last week reported more than 100 cases at the state’s prison in Norton over the two weeks ending Wednesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The moratorium on disconnecting utilities for nonpayment is ending in Kentucky, but relief funds are being designated to help when residents are at risk of having services cut off during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Beshear signed an executive order ending the statewide moratorium on Nov. 6, but his office said the order also designates $15 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to help Kentuckians who face disconnections. The order also requires utilities to provide a payment plan over at least six months for residential customers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette:Five members of a sorority at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have tested positive for COVID-19, university officials said. Officials did not identity the sorority but stated the members followed protocols and self-reported their illnesses, UL Lafayette spokesman Eric Maron said in the release. They are now in isolation, he confirmed. An additional 16 sorority members were in close contact with the women who tested positive and are now in quarantine, Maron said. The university is conducting contact tracing to identify others who may have been in close proximity to the members. Student Health Services will notify anyone who is determined to have been in close contact with anyone who tests positive. Members of the sorority are being offered free, on-campus testing. Once the cases are confirmed through documentation, the cases will be added to the university’s public COVID-19 dashboard. Since March, 138 students and faculty have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the dashboard.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Restaurants and retailers will be allowed to continue operating outdoors through the holiday season in Maine’s largest city. The Portland City Council approved a plan Monday night that extends through Jan. 4 provisions letting businesses operate on private property, public sidewalks and in parking lanes. “Certainly most people in the city are more comfortable dining outdoors than they are indoors right now, so we’re hoping that will provide some flexibility and relief for businesses that are really struggling right now,” Councilor Justin Costa said. In the Old Port, Dana, Milk, Exchange and Wharf streets are closed. Under the plan, all of these roads will reopen to traffic and parking except Dana Street from Fore to Wharf streets and Wharf Street from Union to Dana streets. Businesses on Middle Street cxan continue to use the parking lane with some changes to help with winter operations. City Manager Jon Jennings said the plan accounts for safety and public health standards, along with expeditious removal of snow. Businesses will have to reapply for a permit to continue outdoor dining, but all fees have been waived.\n\nMaryland\n\nHurlock:The governors of Maryland and Delaware have announced new grant programs to help contracted chicken farmers offset losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Each state’s program will offer grants of $1,000 per house, up to $5,000 per farm, with $10 million in funds from the federal CARES, Act. The help is intended to boost family farmers who are contract growers for big companies, like Perdue or Tyson, the governors said in a news conference in Hurlock on Monday. Poultry is the region’s top agricultural commodity and is Delaware’s No. 1 industry. “This COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is continuing to cause great hardship for so many people, not just here in our state, but all across the country and all around the globe,” said Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. “And our farmers certainly are no exception... It’s been a very difficult time for our ag community.” Farms that were forced to euthanize entire flocks – a production reduction measure done in response to processors having reduced capacity – will be eligible for an additional $1,500 per house. Applications are open for the programs, called the Maryland Farmer COVID-19 Relief Program and the Delaware Contract Poultry Grower Grant Assistance Program. The application deadline is Dec. 1.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A cluster of COVID-19 cases that affected nearly 60 staff and patients at Brigham and Women’s Hospital has been contained, hospital officials said. The cluster was identified Sept. 22 in two inpatient units, and 42 employees and 15 patients were potentially connected, the hospital said in a statement on its website. The hospital has not had any new potentially contagious cases on the units that were affected since Oct. 3. The possible factors that contributed to the cluster included a highly infectious source patient, several people with very high viral loads, inconsistencies in patient masking and the use of eye protection among providers, and a lack of physical distancing among staff while eating. The likely source patient was not admitted because of the coronavirus, but had symptoms of a respiratory infection and twice tested negative for COVID-19, Dr. Michael Klompas, hospital epidemiologist, told The Boston Globe. The patient infected a roommate who was then transferred to another unit, he said. In response to the cluster, the hospital instituted an aggressive testing protocol for staff and patients, tested the HVAC system and thoroughly cleaned the affected areas.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: Misdemeanor charges are being dropped against a barber who defied Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and reopened his shop last spring during the coronavirus pandemic. The case against Karl Manke of Owosso fizzled after the Michigan Supreme Court on Oct. 2 said Whitmer used an unconstitutional law as the foundation for emergency orders to control the virus, attorney David Kallman said. Barbershops and salons were closed for months until June 15. But Manke, 77, reopened in early May, declaring that “government is not my mother.” He inspired people from all over Michigan to drive to his shop for a haircut. Manke cut hair on the grounds of the state Capitol during a protest in May. Kallman said the Shiawassee County prosecutor’s office is dropping the case. “It is definitely a weight off my shoulders,” Manke said. “I just want to earn a living, and I am not a health threat to anyone.” State regulators still are trying to revoke his barber license, Kallman said. A hearing is set for Nov. 19.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Monday’s lunchtime crowd at the White Horse restaurant and bar included Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan after she listened to the owner’s feedback on how the pandemic has affected her small business. Flanagan stopped in St. Cloud on a half-day trip to Central Minnesota as part of a statewide small business listening tour. Flanagan also stopped at Stoney Brook Farms in Foley earlier in the day. White Horse owner Jackie Lee told Flanagan and state Rep. Dan Wolgamott, D-St. Cloud, how much she appreciated financial help in the form of the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan – especially with the potential for forgiveness. Flanagan said she continues to advocate for cities and counties to dole out Coronavirus Relief Fund money established by the federal CARES Act. The Minnesota Department of Revenue distributed more than $837.5 million to 85 counties and 1,521 cities and townships, which could be used to support, among other things, grants to businesses impacted by COVID-19. She said the state wants to make sure that money gets to where it needs to be. Cities have until Nov. 15 and counties to Dec. 1 to spend that funding. Unspent aid will then return to the state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said he is imposing a mask mandate for public indoor spaces and other restrictions in nine counties to curb the spread of the coronavirus amid weeks of steadily rising case numbers. “Here in Mississippi, we have seen this before,” Reeves said, referencing a spike in cases the state saw in the summer. “We know what can happen if we allow this to get out of control, so want to be proactive to prevent that from happening.” Reeves said explicitly that he does not think what is happening in Mississippi qualifies as a spike. “We’ve seen a relatively slow, slight increase over the last six weeks, which has really been exacerbated over the last 10 or 11 days,” he said. In the past week, Mississippi had two days when the number of new cases reported in one day reached more than 1,000, something the Department of Health hadn’t reported since mid-August. The seven-day rolling average of daily new confirmed cases in Mississippi has risen from 518 per day on Oct. 4 to 725 cases on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins data analyzed by the Associated Press.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Dr. Alex Garza of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force is warning that hospital workers are “overworked and demoralized” after months of fighting the coronavirus, and the worst might yet to come. Garza said hospitalizations are getting higher and intensive care unit beds are filling up at a time when the flu season is about to create even more strain on the health care system. The St. Louis region is actually in better shape than the rest of the state, according to data released Tuesday on the state health department’s COVID-19 dashboard. Hospitalizations are at or near record levels in virtually every region except St. Louis, which was hit hardest in the spring. But, according to Garza, even St. Louis is seeing an uptick. In Springfield, CoxHealth constructed a temporary building on the parking lot of Cox Medical Center South to serve the expected overflow of COVID-19 and flu patients. The state dashboard showed that ICU capacity statewide was down to 29%, with 476 of Missouri’s 1,439 COVID-19 patients receiving intensive care. The data also shows that 788 ventilators are in use, a figure that includes non-COVID-19 patients.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Students at Montana State University have sued the university claiming it broke a contractual agreement when it canceled in-person classes because of the pandemic without offering to refund or reduce tuition and fees. Anthony Cordero, who was an undergraduate student in the spring semester, filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in September on behalf of himself and other students who paid tuition for in-person classes that were forced online because of the pandemic, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The lawsuit said Cordero paid about $6,500 for the spring semester and was not provided a prorated refund for his in-person classes that were discontinued and moved online, or the mandatory fees he paid after school facilities and events were canceled. The university said in early March that it would transition to fully online because of health concerns, and did not offer in-person classes again until Aug. 17. The lawsuit alleged that since the students did not choose to attend an online-only higher education institution, they were deprived of both the education and on-campus experiences they paid for when they chose the Bozeman-based university. Kalispell-based attorney Dale Cockrell, who is representing the university, said he was reviewing the lawsuit and expects to file a response toward the end of November. University spokesman Tracy Ellig said the university doesn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and another inmate who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 has died. The state said the number of people hospitalized with the virus jumped to 380 on Monday and eclipsed the previous day’s record of 343. The new record is 64% higher than the spring peak of 232 set on May 27, according to the state’s online virus tracker. But Nebraska officials said 37% of the state’s 578 intensive care beds remain available, so it appears that hospitals have the capacity to handle the recent surge. Nebraska has the fifth-highest rate of new virus cases in the nation. The rate of new cases per 100,000 Nebraska residents over the past two weeks reached 547.25 on Monday, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. The state Corrections Department said an inmate in his 60s died Sunday – three weeks after testing positive for the coronavirus. He is the second inmate to die after being diagnosed with the virus, although officials said he had other health problems.\n\nNevada\n\nBoulder City: The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation reopened Hoover Dam to the public Tuesday, seven months after it closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal officials said visitors will be able to access all open areas and visit the Mike O’Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge plaza and walkway. The visitor center will remain closed with no tours or exhibits available. Visitors to the dam at the Nevada-Arizona border are being asked to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines when it comes to preventing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state attorney general’s office has fined a restaurant where at least 18 people have tested positive for COVID-19. Fat Katz Food and Drink restaurant has been fined $2,000 for violating emergency orders related to the coronavirus after it moved a karaoke event inside. The Hudson restaurant told authorities that it moved the event inside after receiving noise complaints and because of colder weather. In issuing the fine, the state in a letter to the restaurant said the decision to move the event inside after being told it wasn’t allowed indoors and allowing individuals to participate without bringing their own equipment not only violated the state’s emergency order but also was “reckless.” The cases linked to Fat Katz include a person who went to the restaurant while aware of their COVID-19 diagnosis when they were supposed to be in isolation, and a second person who went there when they were knowingly supposed to be in quarantine. No one responded to a request for comment at Fat Katz.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gov. Phil Murphy conditionally vetoed a bill that would have expanded charitable groups’ ability to sell raffle tickets online based around sporting events, determining that the measure was too close to internet gambling. Because the coronavirus pandemic has drastically reduced or even eliminated in-person attendance at large sporting events in the state, some legislators proposed expanding the law to let people buy tickets to such raffles over the internet, regardless of whether they were in a stadium or not. Although lauding the intent of the bill, Murphy sent it back to lawmakers with recommended changes, including allowing such an expansion only during times of a declared public health emergency, and requiring the same sort of geolocation technology that New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks use to ensure that a person making an online casino or sports wager is physically located within the state’s boundaries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Netflix has halted production of its Western film “The Harder They Fall” after at least two people on the set tested positive for the coronavirus while working in New Mexico. The production did not identify the people infected with the virus, and declined to comment beyond confirming that production stopped as of Thursday. It is unclear when production is expected to resume. Productions usually wait two weeks with no positive tests before resuming. The New Mexico Rapid Response report listed the positive test at Santa Fe Studios, the Albuquerque Journal reported. The New Mexico Environment Department, which publishes a daily list of entities in the state reporting newly confirmed coronavirus tests, reported that Netflix confirmed at least five positive test results between Oct. 8 and Oct. 19, with at least two of those reports listed as “THTF,” an acronym for the film, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. The production has been required to adhere to state safety guidelines, including facial masks and social distancing. The cast and crew was also subjected to multiple tests a week.\n\nNew York\n\nRamapo:After repeated complaints by the state and county, the Town of Ramapo and Village of Spring Valley have committed personnel to the COVID-19 cluster enforcement task force that’s patrolling Rockland County’s red zone. “We just had online training, Ramapo Town Supervisor Michael Specht said. He said six full-time code enforcement and parking enforcement workers are now dedicated to the task force, including at least one person who is fluent in Yiddish. Another five part-time town workers will be made available this week, Specht said, if the state needs them. Amid growing clusters of COVID-19 cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo launched enforcement zones, or red zones, with strict regulations – which closed schools and cut religious gatherings to just 10 people – designed to tamp down the spread of the virus. Downstate zones, including in Rockland County, mirror the footprint of large Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities. The 12.5-mile diameter zone in Rockland focuses on eastern Ramapo and portions of the Village of Spring Valley.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreenville: East Carolina University has announced temporary furloughs and pay cuts for its athletics staff because of budget deficits caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The salary reductions and furloughs for coaches and staff members at the university will start next month, Jon Gilbert, the university’s athletic director said in a statement Monday. They are based on salary, and will be effective through June 2021. The entire athletics staff was recently furloughed for five days to reduce the school’s deficit by $4.7 million, the statement said. The university estimated a $25 million budget shortfall this fall, The News & Observer reported.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nTown: Mayor Tim Mahoney said he would like to see a statewide mask mandate as the coronavirus spins out of control and in the meantime invoked emergency powers to require face coverings in most settings that don’t involve family members. Mahoney, who in addition to being Fargo’s mayor is also a general surgeon, has been largely supportive of Republican Gov. Doug Burgum’s approach to managing the pandemic. But he said up to one in four people being tested for the virus in his city in recent weeks has tested positive, and Mahoney said it “would be great” if Burgum issued an order for the entire state. Cass County, which includes Fargo, had more than 200 new cases Monday and has had nearly 8,000 since the pandemic began. It has been one of the hardest-hit spots in a state that has ranked worst in the nation for daily new cases per capita the past two weeks. North Dakota leads the nation in the number of new cases per capita in the last two weeks, a distinction it has held many times in the last couple of months, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of people hospitalized in the state because of the coronavirus hit a new high, the Ohio Department of Health reported. The agency said Monday that 1,154 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 related symptoms, with 158 on ventilators. That’s the highest hospitalization figure since July. Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday he was caught off-guard by the recent spike in cases and pleaded again for Ohioans to wear masks and keep themselves socially distanced. The Health Department reported 1,837 confirmed and probable cases on Monday, well above the 21-day case average of 1,515. The numbers reflect a recent and continuing spike in cases, including a record 2,178 cases reported on Oct. 15.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association is renewing the group’s call for a statewide mask mandate as the number of people hospitalized because of the coronavirus has reached record levels. OSMA President George Monks said in a tweet Sunday that cities in Oklahoma that have adopted mask ordinances have seen lower rates of infection. “We need face mask mandates to protect more of our Oklahoma citizens,” Monks tweeted. The association has been calling for a statewide mask mandate since the summer, but Gov. Kevin Stitt has repeatedly said he has no plans to do so, citing concerns about how such a mandate would be enforced.\n\nOregon\n\nAlbany: At least 19 students in Greater Albany Public Schools attended a gathering without masks, spurring new COVID-19 cases and setting back progress made toward holding in-person classes, officials said. At least three positive cases have been traced to a large gathering in a local home with students from West Albany High School, South Albany High School and Lebanon High School, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported. “In addition to the large gathering, a number of the same individuals have been together since then,” Schools Superintendent Melissa Goff said. “So we have an additional six students who should be quarantining right now.” The families of the students have been contacted by local health authorities but according to Goff, some families might not be cooperating with efforts to trace the potential outbreak. Before the latest positive cases, the school district was holding limited in-person instruction for students who receive special services while monitoring the increasing case load around the county. A total of 142 students at 14 district sites were receiving in-person instruction. Those services have been paused and all teachers and staff who are able to work from home have been asked to do so by the district.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg:The state’s COVID-19 quarantine list for out-of-state travelers has grown a bit larger over the past few weeks. But Georgia and Louisiana were removed from the travel advisory, meaning travelers coming from there will no longer be subject to a 14-day self-quarantine upon arrival in Pennsylvania. Ten states – Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming ––have been added to the quarantine list, pushing the total to 25 states. The recommendation for travelers coming into Pennsylvania marks a notable shift in which states are being flagged nationwide for the most alarming increases of coronavirus cases. The list of states is fluid though and will be updated regularly, according to the governor’s office. Essential workers – including truckers and others in transportation – are exempt.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A state facility that houses federal detainees has seen a recent surge in coronavirus cases, according to documents filed with a federal court. The Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls had 52 active cases among detainees, and eight among staff as of Monday, The Providence Journal reported. A spokesman said the facility anticipated additional cases and is prepared to respond appropriately. The center has had more than 150 cases total among detainees and staff.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg:Blood supplies are getting dangerously low because there haven’t been any blood drives during the coronavirus pandemic. Schools, churches and businesses usually hold blood drives during the year, but many haven’t returned to a normal working schedule and most outside activities have been canceled. In addition, blood banks have seen some people who are concerned about donating blood because of fears of becoming infected with COVID-19. All of these issues have forced The Blood Connection in Spartanburg to supply hospitals with only enough blood for immediate needs. Allie Van Dyke, The Blood Connection media coordinator, said during the early months of the pandemic, blood donations declined and the trend has continued. September is usually a time when college campuses host blood drives but those also didn’t happen because of the pandemic. And in addition to the lack of donations, she said some area hospitals are beginning to perform some elective surgeries again and that has depleted the blood supply even more. Spartanburg Medical Center is among the hospitals that receive donations from The Blood Connection. Hospital officials understand how low the blood supply is and are calling on donors for help.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state reported seven more deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday, along with an increase in hospitalizations by 25 people. October has been the deadliest month of the pandemic in the state, with the Department of Health reporting 107 deaths. A total of 330 South Dakotans have died from COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic. Gov. Kristi Noem has said her focus is on hospitalizations, offering assurances that the state’s hospitals are still capable of caring for people with severe cases of the virus. But hospitalizations have reached a new high at 329 people. Health officials reported that about 40% of general-care hospital beds and 33% of Intensive Care Units are available, along with staff to operate them.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: First-time voters in Tennessee won’t have to appear in person to vote while a court appeal proceeds, as the Oct. 27 deadline to request an absentee ballot approaches. In a 3-0 decision, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Monday declined the state’s request to reinstate the in-person requirement while the court mulls the case. The decision maintains a lower court’s order last month. The blocked law requires first-time voters to cast a ballot in person or show ID at the local election office before voting by mail, if they qualify. Instead, officials are requiring certain first-time voters to submit a copy of their ID during the absentee voting process. In Monday’s opinion, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons said “disrupting the new rules at this point poses significant risk of harm to the public interest in orderly elections.” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the ruling, coupled with expanded eligibility, means “thousands of first-time voters should not be forced to risk their health in order to vote.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Schools in the state’s largest school district resumed in-person classes Monday for the first time since campuses doors were closed in March at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. About 80,000 of the school district’s 190,000 students were back on campuses, where they were required to wear masks and practice social distancing. Movement within campuses was also going to be limited during the school day and only essential visitors would be allowed inside, said Interim Superintendent Grenita Lathan. District officials have worked to put necessary safety protocols in place, purchased needed supplies, and relied on science and data to provide a safe environment and address any concerns teachers and others might have, Lathan said. The first six weeks of classes in the current school year for Houston school district students were held online. Those children who chose not to return to campuses on Monday will continue to attend classes virtually and will have a chance after every six-week grading period to change their minds.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The southwest Utah health district reported 92 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, a record for a single day, as the St. George area has joined a statewide spike in numbers at the beginning of the fall season. Local health officials have reported 430 new cases over the past seven days, also a record for any seven-day period since the pandemic began. As recently as mid-September, the region was counting fewer than 200 cases per week. The southwest district, which includes Washington, Iron, Kane, Beaver and Garfield counties, has now counted 424 total hospitalizations and 45 new deaths. Washington County, home to the St. George area, has seen the majority of the numbers, with 4,034 total cases and 38 deaths as of Thursday. The jump comes just as hospitals across Utah are warning that they could run out of beds, with Gov. Gary Herbert having just declared the state’s rapidly rising case numbers an “unsustainable” trend.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The outbreak of people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 traced to a Montpelier hockey rink has expanded to 30, the Vermont Health Department said Monday. The cases are linked to adult and youth hockey leagues and an adult broomball league at the Central Vermont Memorial Civic Center. The Health Department is planning a pop-up testing clinic Thursday at the Barre Auditorium. Testing is for people who are not showing any symptoms of COVID-19, but had direct links to the teams and their close contacts. The Central Vermont Medical Center will also be holding special testing clinics from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. through Friday at its Acute Respiratory Clinic on the Barre-Montpelier Road.\n\nVirginia\n\nHopewell:A Hopewell City Public Schools employee has tested positive for COVID-19, the school division said Monday. The employee works in the division’s technology department. The individual works “across our schools” and was “on site” on Oct. 15. In a press release, the school division encouraged anyone who had contact with technology department staff between Oct. 12-15 to monitor their symptoms and reach out to a primary care provider if needed. Hopewell is one of two local school divisions, along with Petersburg, that has not opened schools to students for in-person learning, so it is unlikely a student was in contact with the individual. Hopewell is considered an area of “highest risk” for the spread of COVID-19 in schools, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Petersburg, Prince George and Dinwiddie counties are also considered “highest risk.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Republican state Rep. Tom Dent of Moses Lake is the second Washington lawmaker known to have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Yakima Herald-Republic reported Monday that Dent, who is up for reelection, talked about his diagnosis on NewsTalk-KIT Radio and said he has been recovering at home. “So far I think I’ve gone through every symptom anybody’s talked about,” he said. “And, you know, it’s crazy. It started out pretty benign in the beginning and then kind of started to go away and came back a little stronger. It’s played this game now, today will be day 15.” Lawmakers haven’t been at the Capitol since they adjourned in March. Any meetings have been held remotely, and it’s unknown what the 105-legislative session will look like when it convenes in January.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The federal government has authorized the West Virginia National Guard to increase the number of personnel on active status to support the response to the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Jim Justice said. There are 379 members of the state National Guard on active status. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will allow that to increase to 400. The federal government will reimburse the state for 75% of the related costs for these personnel, the governor’s office said. The National Guard’s state response has included producing and distributing personal protective equipment, performing virus tests, disinfecting vehicles and facilities, and virus prevention training for businesses, long-term care facilities, medical practices and residents, the statement said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Like Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa, Aurora St. Luke’s Medical Center on Milwaukee’s south side is investigating an outbreak of COVID-19 on an inpatient rehabilitation unit where patients go to recover from surgeries, strokes and other ailments. As of Monday, St. Luke’s was investigating at least 15 cases of COVID-19 among patients on the rehabilitation unit and tests were pending on staff members who were potentially affected. “We have taken the appropriate steps to isolate and care for these patients and have suspended new admissions to this unit at this time,” spokeswoman Cheri Mantz wrote in an email to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Mantz said the source of the outbreak had not been determined. St. Luke’s had not been routinely testing staff members for the virus or taking their temperatures before they showed up for work. Like Froedtert, they were relying on employees to self-report their temperatures and any symptoms via an app. It’s unknown the extent to which the hospital has been testing the patient population for the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: In the first week of October, Wyoming was averaging about 105 newly confirmed cases a day, officials said. That average is now above 162 new daily cases, outpacing any previous time period since March. Wyoming also reached a record on Friday for new confirmed cases in a day with 248. The state’s largest hospital, Wyoming Medical Center, opened its COVID-19 surge unit for the first time and activated its Code Orange Incident Command, which establishes special protocols and appoints a team to evaluate daily concerns and communicate them with the rest of the staff. The facility also stopped accepting nonemergent patients transferred from outside Natrona County, hospital interim CEO J.J. Bleicher said. Those patients are now being transferred out of state. “We expect this to continue for several weeks, based on COVID projections in our community,” hospital spokesperson Kristy Bleizeffer said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/15/assailing-columbus-vr-seniors-otter-attack-news-around-states/40319855/", "title": "Assailing Columbus, VR for seniors: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The U.S. Army is defending a decision to close its historic, 57-year-old space and technical library at Redstone Arsenal. Army officials say it was a joint decision made by interested parties. Al.com reports that the Redstone Scientific Information Center closed its doors Sept. 30. The center was established in 1962 by a charter between the Army and NASA. It was overseen by a board of directors made up of senior leaders and scientists at Redstone’s various missile organizations. Dr. Wernher von Braun and Maj. Gen. Francis “Frank” McMorrow agreed to build the original facility, which held information about rocketry and space science used to advance United States rocket programs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A man says he rescued his family’s dog from an attack by river otters in a small lake inside a local park. Alaska Public Media reports Kenny Brewer waded waist-deep into Taku Lake and suffered a bite on his hand while pulling the dog away from the river otters that converged on the pet. The 27-year-old Anchorage dietitian says he and his wife were walking the husky-mix, which was bitten by a group of otters that dragged the dog underwater temporarily. Brewer says a veterinarian cleaned the dog’s cuts, sliced away damaged tissue and stitched a drain tube into its leg. Wildlife biologists say they were not aware of previous attacks by river otters in Anchorage. One biologist says the animals likely perceived the dog as a threat.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Two retirement communities in the city are the launching pad for a program to see how virtual reality technology helps senior citizens with cognition, dementia, loneliness and other issues. The Arizona Daily Star reports Watermark Retirement Communities wants to eventually make the technology available at dozens of facilities nationwide. With a cordless headset system called Oculus Quest, elderly residents have been able to ride a roller coaster, visit the Egyptian pyramids and visit places they used to live. Watermark also wants to allow residents across its communities to be able to meet up virtually. Grayson Barnes, a 20-year-old Rochester Institute of Technology student, spent two years developing the Engage VR program for Watermark. He says most research suggests dementia patients are more like themselves after experiencing virtual reality.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge says he’s running for a seat on the state’s Supreme Court, setting up another potentially expensive and heated race in a state that has drawn heavy involvement from outside conservative groups. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Morgan “Chip” Welch on Monday announced he was running for the seat currently held by Justice Jo Hart in next year’s election. Hart, who has served on the court since 2013, has not said whether she’s seeking reelection next year. Arkansas’ nonpartisan Supreme Court races in recent years have drawn the focus of outside conservative groups that have spent millions on TV ads and attack mailers. A state justice won reelection last year after two conservative groups spent nearly $2.5 million trying to unseat her.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will ban the sale and manufacture of new fur products starting in 2023. Legislation signed Saturday by Gov. Gavin Newsom makes California the first state to enact such a ban. It doesn’t apply to used fur products or fur used for religious or tribal purposes. And it excludes the sale of leather; cowhides; deer, sheep and goat skin; and anything preserved through taxidermy. There’s a fine of up to $1,000 for multiple violations. Democratic Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, the bill’s author, says there are “sustainable and humane” substitutes for fur. Opponents of the legislation have said it could create a black market and be a slippery slope to bans on other products.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A report by the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative says the state’s 54 highest summits continue to see an increasing number of people seeking to climb the fourteeners, or those at least 14,000 feet high. The Gazette reports that an analysis by the nonprofit initiative estimates 353,000 people were attracted to the peaks during 2018’s hiking season, up 5.7% from the 2017 count. That’s almost 100,000 more than the first report from four years ago. Colorado Fourteeners executive director Lloyd Athearn says the heightened numbers come with his organization increasing its monitoring capabilities on the mountains. According to the report, Mounts Bierstadt, Elbert, Lincoln, Bross, Democrat and Sherman as well as Quandary, Grays, Torreys and Longs peaks all see more people. And for the first time, Quandary Peak was the busiest fourteener. Bierstadt previously held the rank.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new state report shows the state’s utilities are “well aware of the increasing dangers” of cyberattacks and appear to have successfully thwarted recent threats they encountered. Four utilities participated in the third annual cybersecurity review of Connecticut’s electricity, natural gas and public water utilities. The list includes Eversource, Connecticut Water, Aquarion Water Co. and Avangrid. The report says the utilities conducted “extensive new work” over the past year to boost their cybersecurity resilience, including vetting the hiring of all employees and vendors. Phishing, spear phishing, threats to cloud information storage and insider threats are cited as some of the most worrisome threats facing the state’s utilities. The report highlights a need for better information sharing between the federal Department of Homeland Security and the state utilities concerning cyber compromises.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: ChristianaCare researchers say they have created a new computer program that will allow scientists to see the impact gene editing has on tumor cells, an idea they hope to patent. It wasn’t invented by a hospital doctor or a researcher, though they did help. The idea came from Rohan Kanchana, a junior at Newark Charter School who interned there last winter. The 16-year-old is too young to do technical lab work at ChristianaCare’s cancer center, but he could code. The new computer program revolves around a technology called CRISPR, the genetic version of spell-check on a Word document. If a person has an incorrect word – or, in this case, a gene – the technology will identify and correct it, says Eric Kmiec, director of the Gene Editing Institute at ChristianaCare’s Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Plans are in the works to add potentially thousands more dockless scooters to D.C. streets, WUSA-TV reports. As of now, 6,210 dockless scooters are permitted in the district. For 2020, the District Department of Transportation is considering a proposal that would boost the number to 10,000. The comment period to add more scooters goes until the end of October. After that, DDOT officials say they will evaluate the responses and determine the next steps. The proposal also includes the addition of dockless bikes, allowing for up to 10,000 in the district. The vehicles wouldn’t be designated to one area but spread out across all eight wards.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Gatorland has built new homes for some of its most distinctive-looking residents, thus creating an exhibit for a rare albino gator and two even-more-rare leucistic gators, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The White Gator Swamp will be the site of a baby gator boom, officials hope. Those very light-skinned residents are now being encouraged to make offspring. “It’s the largest breeding facility for white alligators anywhere in the world,” says Mark McHugh, Gatorland’s CEO. The white gators were introduced to their new digs Oct. 4. Leucistic gator Trezos hesitated to enter the waters, while his brother, Feros Zombi, dived off the side of a ramp after raw-chicken inspiration. Albino alligator Pearl did a reptilian sort of strut before making a splash. Albino gators have no pigment at all, while leucistics have some coloring in their skins. All three have separate waters and potential mates to explore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: Marine salvage experts seeking to remove an overturned cargo ship close to the state’s seacoast say they will haul it away in pieces because it cannot be safely righted and refloated intact. Their Unified Command said in a statement Saturday that the hull of the 656-foot Golden Ray would be dismantled, along with the ship’s other components and cargo, and taken away in what it described as a “complex situation.” The Golden Ray overturned Sept. 8 near the Port of Brunswick. Rescuers drilled into the hull’s steel plates and rescued four crewmen trapped in the bowels of the ship for more than a day in scorching heat and darkness. The Coast Guard has said it would take “weeks, if not months,” to remove the ship, which overturned while heading to sea.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: As Rep. Tulsi Gabbard travels throughout Iowa and New Hampshire trying to kickstart her Democratic presidential bid, she is facing a serious challenge back home in Hawaii for her U.S. House seat. State Sen. Kai Kahele, a fellow Democrat, is picking up endorsements and criticizing Gabbard for not paying enough attention to constituents in Hawaii while she campaigns for president thousands of miles away. The 45-year-old Native Hawaiian is a combat veteran and pilot for the Hawaii Air National Guard. He flies passenger jets for Hawaiian Airlines and is a member of the pilots union, a helpful attribute in union-friendly Hawaii. Gabbard hasn’t indicated whether she will run for reelection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Authorities have released plans to stop devastating wildfires in southwestern Idaho, southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada with one option creating 1,500 miles of fuel breaks up to 400 feet wide along existing roads. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Friday released a draft environmental impact statement for the Tri-State Fuel Breaks Project and is taking public comments through the end of November. The BLM says creating fuel breaks by clearing vegetation will help firefighters stop wildfires and protect key habitat for sage grouse and other wildlife on land also used by ranchers and outdoor enthusiasts. The BLM says options include fewer miles of fuel breaks all the way down to no fuel breaks at all. The region in recent decades has seen repeated giant rangeland wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nMarengo: A French religious order has reached a preliminary agreement with a northern Illinois county that would allow nuns to build a winery, brewery, gift shop and coed boarding school there. The consent decree between McHenry County and Fraternite Notre Dame Inc. could end nearly four years of litigation and local opposition to the order expanding its operation in Marengo. The order sued the county in 2015, alleging that by blocking the expansion, the county was violating the U.S. Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Chicago Tribune reports that U.S. Magistrate Judge Iain Johnston is scheduled to decide this month whether to approve the agreement. McHenry County State Attorney Patrick Kenneally and county board Chairman Jack Franks declined to comment.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Butler University has raised more than half of the $250million it needs for a campaign to invest in science education, increase enrollment beyond resident undergraduates and boost community outreach. The private university has pooled $171 million from more than 27,000 donors during its largest fundraising campaign, which runs through May. The university plans to add a $100 million science facility. But university President James Danko says the campaign will also help fund efforts to encourage working professionals to enroll. Melissa Beckwith, vice president of strategy and innovation, says the university could partner with local companies to provide education for employees who aren’t enrolled as undergraduates. The university will also try to offer Indianapolis public school students dual degree credits.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Backers of a skateboard park under construction downtown say they have reached their $6.3 million funding goal. The Lauridsen Skatepark will be the nation’s largest when completed in spring 2020. The 88,000-square-foot skate park is being built on 5 acres of land between Second Avenue and the Des Moines River. Recent gifts by the Lauridsen Family Foundation and the state’s Enhance Iowa fund enabled organizers to reach their fundraising goal. Nix and Virginia Lauridsen have donated a total of $1.6 million to the project. Besides the skate areas, the park will include viewing platforms, handicap accessible walkways, shade structures and landscaping. Organizers expect about 40,000 skaters a year will use the park. They note skateboarding will be an Olympic sport in 2020.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The Kansas City T-Bones are officially locked out of their stadium. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, changed the locks and padlocked the gates to the stadium Monday because the team has failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid debts. The government issued an eviction notice in August after the T-Bones accumulated more than $760,000 in back rent and utility payments. The team was given a one-month reprieve in September after making a $50,000 payment. The Kansas City Star reports team owners have said they are working to sell the team, but no deal has been reached. The T-Bones played in an independent league and have no Major League Baseball affiliation.\n\nKentucky\n\nWinchester: Daniel Boone National Forest officials say multiple fires have burned hundreds of acres there, with almost all the fires caused by people. WTVQ-TV in Lexington reports three crews from Puerto Rico have volunteered to restore what they can in the forest. Officials want to clean up damage from fires before dry weather returns. The volunteers are working 16 hours a day performing such tasks as reseeding, preventing erosion, and knocking down trees that could fall and hurt someone. Volunteer Roberto Martinez told the station people from the U.S. went to Puerto Rico to help when Hurricane Maria struck there, and now it’s his chance to return the favor. Daniel Boone representatives say it could be a few more weeks before parts of the forest open to the public.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The National World War II Museum’s $25 million education and outreach building will open Thursday. After an opening ceremony, it will break ground for its final exhibit hall and hold an open house at the new building, called the Hall of Democracy. It features a research library, classrooms, an auditorium, the Institute for the Study of War and Democracy, and the WWII Media and Education Center. There’s also a special exhibit gallery. The opening exhibition is about the capture, extradition and trial of Adolf Eichmann, who played a major part in the Nazi mass executions of Jews. The new building is the museum’s sixth, including three exhibit pavilions, a theater and a restoration building. Its 239-room hotel and conference center is expected to open in late fall.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A scientist with an environmental group says she has found what she believes is the first recorded appearance of a potentially damaging species of crab in Maine waters. Marissa McMahan of the Massachusetts-based group Manomet says she located the smooth mud crab earlier this month on a research trip. The crabs, which are typically found south of Cape Cod, can pose problems for aquaculture businesses because they prey on young oysters. The single specimen is still alive, as McMahan collected it. Other outside species of crabs already pose a threat to Maine’s ecosystem. Acadia National Park officials said earlier this fall that a molted shell of an Asian shore crab was found along the shore. It was among the first confirmed reports of the species in the area.\n\nMaryland\n\nAdamstown: A rural fire chief says an “elusive” 3-foot-long alligator has finally been caught. WJLA-TV reports the gator was caught Saturday in a retention pond on a private property in Adamstown after animal control officers and others spent hours Thursday and Friday trying to capture it. The station reports officers ended up placing a live animal cage trap with bait on the muddy shoreline after initial efforts using a fishing line failed. Carroll Manor Volunteer Fire Chief Mike Smallwood says he found the “crafty and smart” reptile inside the metal cage about 6:30 a.m. Saturday. Maryland residents are not allowed to own exotic animals, including alligators. The station reports Frederick County Animal Control says the alligator was likely abandoned by its owner due to its size.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Two state lawmakers want to make it easier for communities to purchase dormant railroad tracks to convert into recreational trails. The MetroWest Daily News reports state Sen. Jamie Eldridge and state Rep. Carmine Gentile, both Democrats, jointly filed legislation that, if approved, would allow cities and towns to use Community Preservation Act money to purchase railroad lands to transform into trails for walking, running and bicycling. Community Preservation Act money can be used to preserve open space and historic sites, create affordable housing and develop outdoor recreational facilities. But the state Department of Revenue has ruled it cannot be used to buy federal rail banks and rights of way. Eldridge, of Acton, says rail trails improve public health by providing safe opportunities for exercise and boost economic development.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A church that served as a popular venue for national civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, is getting a grant for needed renovations. The National Park Service has awarded the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office $500,000 for King Solomon Baptist Church. Work includes rehabilitating the roof and preparing construction drawings. The church built in 1917 for a white congregation was bought in 1955 by an African American congregation. King spoke twice at King Solomon, and Malcolm X gave his “Message to the Grassroots” speech there in 1963. King Solomon’s pastor, the Rev. Charles Williams II, says the goal “is to continue the church’s tradition of empowerment, education and research.” The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: More than 100 mannequins in blaze orange sweatshirts were set up along Minnesota Highway 23 in the city Saturday. The display, organized by Pathways 4 Youth, represented the number of youth experiencing homelessness on any given night in Central Minnesota. “A lot of people in the community just don’t know,” says Tim Wensman, board chair and president of Pathways 4 Youth. The event kicked off the organization’s “Now That You Know” campaign, which aims to raise awareness on youth homelessness, as well as highlight how people can support the organization’s efforts. Pathways 4 Youth is a resource center for youth ages 16 to 24 who are experiencing homelessness. The center helps them finish their education, find secure employment and gain stable housing. It also connects youth with a place to shower, food and hygiene products, and a warm evening meal.\n\nMississippi\n\nMeridian: The city promises there will be sunshine Oct. 26, even if it’s a cloudy day. That’s the day Meridian will honor the late David Ruffin, one of the lead singers of the Motown group The Temptations. He sang the hit “My Girl,” which included that sunny lyric. The Meridian Star reports the city will add signs ceremonially naming four blocks of a downtown street “David Ruffin Boulevard.” Born in nearby rural Whynot, Ruffin claimed Meridian as home. Mississippi’s Arts + Entertainment Experience will also place Ruffin’s star on its walk of fame, while Jackson State University’s marching band, the “Sonic Boom of the South,” will lead a parade. LaMont Robinson, head of the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame and Ruffin’s son-in-law, presented the idea to the city.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The CEO of Dow Inc. has donated $6 million to a new University of Missouri health institute focused on personalized medicine. The university says the gift from Jim Fitterling is one of the first from an individual donor for the NextGen Precision Health Institute. The $220.8 million center is expected to open in October 2021. The state has contributed $10 million so far, with other funding coming from a combination of private and corporate support. Fitterling said in a statement that as a cancer survivor, he is “keenly interested in advancing research that helps patients and their families enjoy better outcomes and better qualities of life.” He began working at Dow just two weeks after graduating from the University of Missouri’s College of Engineering in 1983.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: State forest experts have proposed a timber harvest and prescribed-burns project to reduce the risk of wildfires in the Lolo National Forest. The Missoulian reports the proposed treatments were designed to contribute to the overall forest health and fuel-reduction objectives and make the forest more resilient to drought, wildfire, insects and disease. Forest experts say the project would cover about 36 square miles in Missoula and Mineral counties and include harvesting timber for mills, tree thinning and prescribed fires. Experts say some existing roads are expected to be decommissioned for work. Experts say they are seeking additional public input on the proposal at a meeting Wednesday. Submitted comments would be accepted by mail, electronically and hand-delivered for the next 30 days.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: People who want to help preserve monarch butterflies can obtain free milkweed seed pods through the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. The pods, seeding instructions and monarch educational information will be available while supplies last at Game and Parks’ Northeast District Office in Norfolk. Milkweed is the host plant for the monarch. Monarchs lay eggs only on milkweed, and it’s the only plant monarch caterpillars will eat. Scientists say the monarch population has drastically declined over the past 20 years. Contact Jamie Bachmann at 402-370-3374 or Jamie.bachmann@nebraska.gov for more information.\n\nNevada\n\nTonopah: Nye County has decided to abandon a controversial proposal that would have further limited the hours when legal prostitutes were allowed to leave licensed brothels. The southern Nevada county had proposed an ordinance that would have barred brothel workers from leaving for more than six hours during a 10-day period. Brothel owners, local prosecutors and others supporting the proposal said they were concerned prostitutes would have unprotected sex when they left brothels. The Las Vegas Sun reports Nye County decided to drop the plan after receiving criticism from sex workers and advocates who said it violated their rights. Sex workers and advocates say they also want the county to repeal an existing rule requiring prostitutes to be retested for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV any time they leave for more than 24 hours at a time.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Shakers have long been known for the simple design of their furniture and household objects, but a new exhibit at the Currier Museum of Art explores their cutting-edge skills in brand management. The Manchester museum is featuring a new exhibit called The Shakers and the Modern World, drawn from both its own collection and the holdings of Canterbury Shaker Village. Andrew Spahr, the museum’s director of collections, says the Shakers at one time caused anxiety with attempts to convert outsiders to their religion, but then they developed a branding strategy to counter negative public opinion and were quick to embrace printed media and photography to promote a more positive view. The exhibit will be accompanied by public and educational programs developed with Canterbury Shaker Village, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s black bear hunt is underway this week. The first three days of the hunt beginning Monday are for hunters armed with bows and arrows. Archers and muzzleloading rifle hunters can participate on Thursday and Friday. The hunt is restricted to five zones. Gov. Phil Murphy has again prohibited hunting on state lands. The bear hunt for firearms only is set to begin Dec. 9. Hunters killed 225 bears in 2018, the lowest amount since 2003.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Police data shows 42 Native Americans have been reported missing in the city so far this year, after 36 in 2018. Dawn Begay, the city’s Native American affairs coordinator, says the figures represent open missing persons cases in Albuquerque. Figures from U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey show the metro area is home to roughly 50,000 Native Americans. Of the 36 missing in 2018, 15 were women. Begay shared the numbers Friday at an event held to highlight the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women in New Mexico’s largest city. An Urban Indian Health Institute study last year listed Albuquerque among cities with the highest number of missing Native American women. Authors of the report had counted 37 missing and homicide cases total for Native American women and girls.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state Department of Environmental Conservation is selling patches to support maintenance work on outdoor recreation facilities. The latest design of the New York State Trail Supporter Patch resembles the round yellow disks marking connector trails on state lands. The previous design was red, like markers used by DEC on east-west directional trails. The patch is available for $5 at sporting license outlets or online at the state’s fishing and hunting license portal. The patch was introduced in 2007 to help raise funds to maintain trails across the state. Sales have raised more than $41,000 to date. Projects supported by patch sales include a boardwalk in Texas Hollow State Forest, foot bridges on the Northville Placid Trail, maintenance of Otter Creek Horse Trails and lean-tos in the High Peaks Wilderness.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper aims to create a state-funded program to help residents in four counties recover from Hurricane Dorian after the federal government declined a request for assistance targeting them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency last week told Cooper there wasn’t enough damage from last month’s storm to individuals and households in Carteret, Dare, Hyde and New Hanover counties to warrant a federal declaration. So Cooper wrote Friday to the U.S. Small Business Administration requesting another kind of declaration for low-interest loans in the four counties and those surrounding them. If it’s approved, Cooper’s office said he would create a grant program to supplement the loans for individuals and businesses.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota auditor says the Commerce Department broke state law on bidding contracts for the state’s new “Be Legendary” logo. State Auditor Joshua Gallion released the audit Monday. The logo sparked criticism earlier this year when the contract for it was awarded to a Minnesota firm headed by a woman who once worked for Gov. Doug Burgum’s old Fargo software business. The company was awarded the $9,500 job without competition because it came in below the $10,000 threshold required for additional bids. Gallion says the audit of the agency found another contract related to the logo, bringing its total cost to more than $87,000. The Commerce Department says it did nothing wrong.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A local air base is facing the increasingly common dilemma of an aging workforce. The Dayton Daily News reports about half of the 30,000 people working at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are nearing the end of their careers. Air Force Gen. Arnold Bunch Jr. says filling those jobs and taking care of employees is “critical.” More than a third of employees at the Air Force Research Laboratory are eligible to retire. This could be challenging because nearly 70% of the lab’s workforce has at least a master’s degree. According to a U.S. census estimate from 2017, only 10% of Ohioans 25 and older hold an advanced college degree. The president of the Southwestern Ohio Council for Higher Education says the Air Force should focus on attracting and recruiting nontraditional candidates.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A Republican state senator who unsuccessfully tried to criminalize abortion has announced plans to challenge GOP U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin next year. Sen. Joseph Silk, from Broken Bow, says he’ll try to unseat Mullin, who has served four terms representing eastern Oklahoma in the U.S. House. In a statement, Silk says he chose to enter the 2020 Republican primary for the 2nd Congressional District because he was frustrated with what he called the “very liberal” leadership in the Oklahoma Legislature. Republicans hold overwhelming majorities in both the Oklahoma House and Senate. Mullin’s chief of staff, Mike Stopp, says Mullin intends to run for another term, but he declined to comment on Silk’s candidacy.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The frustrated owner of North Portland’s never-used Wapato Jail has announced he will bulldoze the facility unless someone comes up with funding to convert the facility into a homeless shelter in the next two weeks. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Jordan Schnitzer, president of Harsch Investment Properties, said Thursday that he planned to sign a demolition contract by the month’s end. Assuming no last-minute stakeholder steps in, Schnitzer said his company will break ground on a new warehouse there by spring. Schnitzer said he was “sickened” that a year-and-a half-long quest to convert the 150,000-square-foot jail into a shelter would end with the facility reduced to rubble. But city leaders, along with local nonprofits, had been reticent to place people lacking shelter in adapted jail cells 11 miles away from Portland’s downtown core.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDoylestown: Some of Bucks County’s covered bridges will be getting a makeover due to a $2.5 million refurbishment project, to include all seven county-owned spans. At one point there were more than 50 covered bridges in Bucks County, but now only a dozen remain. Those still standing were built between 1832 and 1874, when horse-drawn buggies were the main means of transportation. Ten bridges still carry cars and trucks as well as the occasional walker and cyclist. The other two are in parks. While mostly made of wood, many of the spans are held up by steel structures that need to be stripped and repainted. County operations director Kevin Spencer says other work includes fireproofing interior and exterior wood surfaces, replacing cedar facing and siding boards, and other maintenance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A statue of Christopher Columbus was vandalized Monday, on the U.S. holiday named for him. The statue in Providence was splashed from head to toe with red paint, and a sign reading “Stop celebrating genocide” was leaned against the pedestal. The word “genocide” was written in orange paint on the rear of the pedestal. The statue has been the target of vandals on Columbus Day in the past. The New World explorer has become a polarizing figure. Native American advocates have pressed states to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day over concerns that Columbus spurred centuries of genocide against indigenous populations in the Americas. Police are investigating, and a spokeswoman for Mayor Jorge Elorza said the statue would be cleaned.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is adding a new area code. The latest set of digits will augment the Palmetto State’s oldest area code – 803. In the region stretching from Aiken to Rock Hill with Columbia at its center, new numbers beginning with 839 will be available in the Midlands starting May 26, 2020. The Post and Courier reports historically, the 803 area code was the only one in the state after World War II ended. In 1995, 864 came to the Upstate. The coastal 843 area code was created in the late 1990s. Ahead of the new number’s availability, millions of landline callers are asked to practice dialing the area code before every local number. Calls dialed without area codes will stop going through April 25, 2020.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Krystal Trull’s daughter went months without autism treatments after the family lost insurance coverage. Trull lost access to the therapy that first gave 4-year-old Nikole the gift of speech. She worried if Nikole would be able to recover. Months after petitioning state leaders to require insurers to cover an intensive form of autism treatments called Applied Behavior Analysis, Trull commended a decision announced Friday that Sioux Falls-based insurers would again cover the therapy for some families. Sanford Health and Avera Health will begin offering coverage in 2020 after a loophole in state law caused South Dakota families such as the Trulls to lose insurance coverage this year. Gov. Kristi Noem, Sanford and Avera announced the coverage in a joint statement Friday.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A woman whose father was executed for murder 13 years ago asked a judge Monday to order the testing of DNA evidence in the case. The hearing in Memphis focused largely on whether April Alley can legally bring a petition for DNA testing on behalf of her father’s estate. Sedley Alley was convicted of the 1985 murder of 19-year-old Marine Lance Cpl. Suzanne Collins in Millington. She had been out jogging when she was kidnapped, beaten, raped and mutilated. Alley confessed to the crime but later said the confession was coerced. He was executed by lethal injection in 2006. April Alley’s attorneys include Innocence Project co-founder Barry Scheck, who told the court they filed the petition for DNA testing after law enforcement officers in St. Louis contacted him about a possible alternative suspect in Collins’ murder.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: The Mayborn Museum moves the outside inside to teach kids some basic lessons on the natural world in its new Backyard Ecology Hall. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports the hall, a $1.2 million revamping of the museum’s first-floor children’s space, consists of four large exhibit rooms and a spacious common area for live demonstrations – and families needing a place to sit and rest. The rooms blend interactive activities, live reptiles, insects and specimens from some of the Mayborn’s collections to shape lessons with connections to local ecosystems. The exhibits, created specifically for the Mayborn, aim at students from fourth- to eighth-grade levels but contain material for younger children, older students and adults, assistant exhibits director Rebecca Nall says.\n\nUtah\n\nClearfield: Two firefighters are receiving praise after they found a creative way to keep a young girl calm at the scene of a car accident. North Davis Fire District Fire Chief Mark Becraft said the firefighters let a young girl paint their nails after she and her mother were in a car accident Saturday in the northern Utah city of Clearfield. Chief Allen Hadley and Captain Kevin Lloyd checked on the crying, screaming girl while medics evaluated her mother. Nobody was seriously injured. They asked her about the nail polish she was holding and offered to have their nails painted. Both men have young daughters. Becraft said the girl was instantly soothed. Hadley and Lloyd left the scene with purple manicures.\n\nVermont\n\nWallingford: A group of outdoor lovers is working to raise the profile of the White Rocks National Recreation Area in the Green Mountain National Forest, and they’re looking for some help. The Rutland Herald reports Nate Rand, of Wallingford, says he and a friend have talked about forming the White Rocks Outdoor Collaborative, and they’ve been using a social media group to gather potential members and coordinate their efforts. Rand says about 100 people have joined a Facebook page, but the idea is still in the formative phase. Rand says many people are familiar with the White Rocks hiking trails, but comparatively few are aware that the White Rocks National Recreation Area offers opportunities to hike, snowshoe and cross-country ski.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A federal appeals court has put a hold on two permits needed for construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday issued a stay of permits from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service while it reviews a lawsuit filed by environmental groups in August. The Sierra Club said in a statement that the suspension effectively means construction must stop on the 300-mile natural gas project. The lawsuit alleges that the Fish and Wildlife Service’s approval of the project failed to adequately protect endangered species along the pipeline’s path. Also on Friday, the company building the pipeline agreed to pay more than $2 million and submit to enhanced monitoring to settle a lawsuit brought by Virginia officials.\n\nWashington\n\nSpanaway: A food bank that serves roughly 1,100 people in Pierce County has been damaged in a fire. Spanaway Food Bank director Harold Smith says families in need of food showed up throughout the day Friday and were directed to other food banks for help. Smith says the food bank’s freezers and refrigerators were lost, and the food might not be salvageable. The fire was reported about 6 a.m., and Central Pierce Fire & Rescue spokesman Darrin Shaw says the structure was heavily involved when crews arrived. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. Smith says the facility, which has operated for four decades, hands out about 15,000 pounds of food every month.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Department of Education data says more than half of the state’s teachers missed more than 10 days of school last year. WSAZ-TV reports 52.75% of teachers missed more than 10 days, according to its research of data from the education department. The prior year’s number was 52.46%. The year before that it was 51.44%, and in 2016 it was 50.83%. State Superintendent Steve Paine says teachers have a hard, stressful job, but some are missing too much school. The percentage of teachers who missed more than 20 days was nearly 11%. The omnibus education bill that passed a few months ago included a $500 attendance bonus for teachers who miss fewer than four days. Paine said the state needs to determine if that has an effect.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city’s natural history museum is hoping its new live spiders exhibit can educate visitors instead of scaring them away. The Milwaukee Public Museum is hosting the Spiders Alive! exhibit through January. It features 17 species of live arachnids from around that world, including tarantulas, black widows, brown recluses and wolf spiders. It also includes some relatives of spiders, including scorpions. The exhibit’s on-site curator, Jon Bertolas, says he guarantees that visitors will leave with a greater appreciation of spiders. Visitor Sandra Romanshek says she decided to check out the exhibit because spiders are important for the environment, even though she thinks they are creepy crawlers.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State lawmakers have advanced legislation that would help expand a network of highway crossings for wildlife. The Casper Star-Tribune reports a legislative committee unanimously approved three bills Friday creating a special wildlife conservation account to help fund additional crossings, signage and game fences in sensitive wildlife habitats. Lawmakers say the committee is expected to sponsor the bills in the 2020 session. Officials say the fund could increase federal dollars appropriated under an infrastructure bill containing $250 million for wildlife crossings at key migration chokepoints. Lawmakers say migration corridors were a means of preserving wildlife and striking a balance between energy development and conservation interests.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/15"}]}

Four of the 12 unions representing rail workers have since rejected the deal, setting up the impending work stoppage.\n\nThe agreement includes a 24% pay increase over five years, $5,000 bonuses, voluntary assigned days off, but only one paid day off. An additional measure passed in the House would have provided rail workers with seven paid sick days.\n\nMore:Get political news, fast and to the point, delivered to your inbox.\n\nBut the Senate rejected the addition of paid sick time over the demands of progressives who said railroads could afford to treat their workers better.\n\nThe legislation needed 60 votes and Democrats, who control 50 seats, could only muster 52 votes despite the urging of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who noted that the rail industry is one of the few industries in America that do not offer universal paid sick leave.\n\n\"This is America. 2022. You don't treat people (this way) – especially people in the rail industry who are doing dangerous, difficult work,\" Sanders said on the Senate floor before the vote.\n\nA separate vote on a GOP-sponsored amendment to delay the strike by 60 additional days so union leaders and railroad companies would have more time to negotiate also was defeated.\n\nSenate passage is the final step before the bill heads to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law.\n\nBiden urged Congress to pass legislation before the Dec. 9 deadline, warning that a shutdown of the system would cost the economy about $2 billion each day and immediately claim 750,000 jobs.\n\n\"What was negotiated was so much better than anything they ever had,\" Biden said of the tentative deal, noting that eight of the 12 unions signed approved it. He said he will \"continue to fight\" for paid leave for all American workers, which he unsuccessfully pushed in Congress last year.\n\n\"We're going to avoid the rail strike, keep the rails running, keep things moving, and I'm going to go back and we're going to get paid leave not just for rail workers, but for all workers.\"\n\nSanders led a group of Democratic senators in urging his colleagues to quickly pass the legislation with the additional paid sick days for rail workers.\n\nThe Democratic senators said rail workers, who get no paid sick time, deserve the benefit having kept U.S. commerce rumbling on the tracks during the COVID pandemic and supply chain shortages.\n\n\"During the first three quarters of this year, the rail industry made a record-breaking $21.2 billion in profits,\" they said in the statement. \"Guaranteeing 7 paid sick days to rail workers would only cost the industry $321 million a year – less than 2 percent of their total profits. Please do not tell us that the rail industry cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to their workers.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/25/rnc-live-melanie-trump-mike-pompeo-speak-second-night-republican-convention/3433672001/", "title": "Republicans sought to strike a hopeful tone on Day 2 of their ...", "text": "Refresh often for updates throughout Day 2 of the RNC.\n\nWASHINGTON – Republicans sought to strike a more hopeful tone during the second night of their national convention Tuesday, featuring members of President Donald Trump’s family – including first lady Melania Trump – and placing an emphasis on the less controversial aspects of the president’s first term.\n\n“It has been inspiring to see what the people of our great nation will do for one another, especially when we are at our most fragile,” the first lady said in an address from the Rose Garden where the president joined a live audience watching and -- in a rare occurrence during the pandemic -- applauding her remarks.\n\nThe first lady focused much of her speech on what she described as the American spirit to overcome crisis, from COVID-19 to natural disasters. She steered widely clear of both policy arguments and political attacks on Democrat Joe Biden.\n\n“The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another,” Melania Trump said in address that also touched on mental health and addiction with a weight few others have given to those issues.\n\nThat softer approach was set before the first lady walked onto the podium in the historic garden that was recently renovated under her direction. Unlike the convention’s opening night, most speakers Tuesday focused their fire on Biden’s policies – particularly his desire to roll back Trump’s tax cuts on high earners -- rather than on dark premonitions of “socialism” or the “destruction” of suburbs.\n\n“Americans are going back to work,” said Larry Kudlow, one of Trump’s top economic advisers. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.”\n\nSpeakers sought to tout the progress made confronting the economic crisis without offering proposals for dealing with the current dramatic increase in unemployment. Many featured speakers, including the first lady, discussed the coronavirus in broad terms, arguing that the president “would not rest” until a vaccine or therapy had approved to treat the illness.\n\nLara Brown, director of George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management, noted that some Republicans spoke as if COVID-19 was already in the past and the economy had already recovered.\n\n\"Both of those descriptions about the present moment and near future seem disconnected from the reality that most Americans are experiencing,\" Brown said.\n\nThe Republican convention started Tuesday with a recognition of the high-profile shooting in Wisconsin of Jacob Blake, a Black man shot in the back by police in an incident that has aired for days on cable news. The convention’s opening prayer, offered by a Las Vegas minister, called for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake.\n\nTrump himself made two remarkable appearances: Formally pardoning Jon Ponder, a Las Vegas man who helps ex-prisoners re-enter society, and leading a naturalization ceremony for five new U.S. citizens. Both highly unusual events were criticized by Democrats as a questionable use of presidential authority during a political event.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, wondered if the president delayed the pardon so that it would coincide with the convention.\n\n\"The main thing I find troubling is that Trump knew Jon Ponder, knew his story, knew of his good works, and didn’t get around to pardoning him until today,\" she said.\n\nBut they also set a far different message than Trump’s usual rhetoric on immigration: Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, was barely raised at all. Neither were his efforts to limit legal immigration through unilateral changes to asylum and visa programs.\n\n\"Congratulations,” Trump told the group in a video the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast. “Great going.\"\n\nConvention speakers touted the tax cut law Trump signed in 2017, the recent agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. The convention featured a video noting the number of women Trump had appointed to top jobs in the White House, including the current and previous two White House press secretaries.\n\nThe night was not entirely devoid of harsh criticism of Biden. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, in particular, used her remarks to attack the former vice president's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine, revisiting an argument she raised during the president’s impeachment defense.\n\n“If they want to make this election a choice between who's been saving America and who's been swindling America, bring it on,” Bondi said.\n\nNor did the convention’s second night go off without a hitch: Organizers had to pull a speaker from the lineup after she promoted anti-Semitic, QAnon conspiracy theory on Twitter. Mary Ann Mendoza -- an advocate for stricter immigration policies whose son was killed in accident by a driver who was an undocumented immigrant – was dropped shortly before the event got underway.\n\nBut for the most part, the convention’s second night appeared to stick to a different script.\n\n“Donald is a husband that supports me in all that I do,” first lady Melania Trump said. “We will be honored to serve this incredible country for four more years.”\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nMelania Trump confident the nation will recover from COVID-19\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump headlined the second night of the GOP convention with a keynote address from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, opening her remarks by acknowledging the coronavirus pandemic and the devastation and anxiety it has caused across the country.\n\n“I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy COVID-19 swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us,” she said. “My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering.”\n\n“I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know. You are not alone,” she continued. “My husband's administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone.”\n\nAre the trees gone?:Melania Trump did not remove cherry trees, historic roses from Rose Garden\n\nTrump’s homage to women’s suffrage and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as part of the campaign’s wider effort to appeal to the crucial female voting bloc. A recent ABC/Washington Post poll found that Joe Biden leads Trump 56% to 40% in support among women.\n\n\"I reflected on the impact of women's voices in our nation's story and how proud I will be to cast my vote again for Donald, this November,\" she said. \"We must make sure that women are heard. And that American Dream continues to thrive.\"\n\nThe first lady’s address is her biggest prime-time speech since the 2016 GOP convention, where she was accused of plagiarism after portions of her speech closely resembled parts of a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama.\n\nA Trump Organization employee later issued a statement taking responsibility for the similarities.\n\nTrump has mostly stayed out of the political spotlight as her husband has campaigned in recent months but used the address to highlight her favorite moments as the first lady.\n\nIt also gave her a chance to showcase the renovations she oversaw of the Rose Garden though not without controversy. Delivering her speech from the Rose Garden, part of the official White House, raised ethical questions about whether it blurred the line between the government and the president’s re-election campaign.\n\nShe also opened up about her experience of coming to the U.S. from Slovenia, even as her husband has sought to curb legal and illegal immigration.\n\nTrump said becoming a citizen was \"one of the proudest moments in my life, because with hard work and determination, I was able to achieve my own American dream.\"\n\n\"As an immigrant, and a very independent woman. I understand what a privilege is that we have,\" she said. \"There are no words to describe how honored humbled and fortunate I am to serve our nation as your first lady.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nKentucky attorney general: Biden ‘a backwards thinker’\n\nKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron slammed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as “a backwards thinker” and suggested President Donald Trump could live up to the “mandate” of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nCameron, the state’s first Black attorney general, blasted Biden for saying during a radio interview earlier this year that African Americans who don’t vote for him “ain’t black” and warning in 2012 that Republicans would put Blacks “back in chains.”\n\n“Joe Biden is a backwards thinker in a world craving forward-looking leadership,” Cameron said. “There’s no wisdom in his record or plan, just a trail of discredited ideas and offensive statements.”\n\nCameron, a rising star in the Republican Party, has come under criticism from activists who want his office to speed up its investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her Louisville apartment in March. Her death has sparked protests across the country.\n\nIn his remarks at the Republican National Convention, Cameron criticized anarchists who “mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police officers and innocent bystanders.”\n\nRepublicans “recognize those who earnestly strive for peace, justice, and equality,” he said.\n\nCameron, who was raised just a few miles from Lincoln’s birthplace in Kentucky, said the nation’s 16th president – who is also the first Republican president – believed “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present … and we must rise to the occasion.”\n\n“I believe President Trump can meet Lincoln’s mandate, even as Joe Biden remains trapped by his party’s radicals and his own failed record,” he said\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nPompeo touts Trump’s 'bold' foreign policy in remarks from abroad\n\nSpeaking from Israel while traveling on official government business, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump has “led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world” to secure peace and “keep us safe and our freedoms intact.”\n\n“It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked,” Pompeo said in defense of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy that has alienated traditional U.S. allies, even as Trump courted foreign adversaries. He recorded his remarks during a stop in Jerusalem, part of a four-country diplomatic mission in the region.\n\nThe State Department said Pompeo was speaking in his personal capacity, not as America’s chief diplomat. But Pompeo talked about policy decisions.\n\nThe successes he touted included holding China accountable “for covering up the China virus,” killing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, lowering the temperature with North Korea, exiting the “disastrous nuclear deal with Iran” and moving the U.S. Embassy to “this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland.”\n\nIn 2017, Trump delivered on a campaign promise to break with decades of U.S. foreign policy and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That decision, among other pro-Israel policies, has helped bolster Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a pivotal constituency for the GOP.\n\nPompeo’s remarks broke diplomatic protocol and perhaps the State Department's own policy on engaging in partisan political activity.\n\nBefore he spoke, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opened a probe into Pompeo’s decision, saying he has \"a gross disregard\" for ethics rules and \"a blatant willingness to violate federal law for political gain.\"\n\n— Maureen Groppe and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nEric and Tiffany Trump step into the spotlight to tout father's record\n\nEric Trump, Trump’s third eldest son, joined a list of relatives who spoke or are slated to speak at the Republican convention. He used his remarks to tick off a list of his father’s accomplishments and echoed his brother, Donald Trump Jr., in painting a Joe Biden presidency as “the empty, oppressive and radical views of the extreme left.”\n\n“He is a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business,” Trump said.\n\nLike his brother, Eric Trump falsely claimed that Biden wants to defund the police, a call by some on the left to shift public resources from law enforcement agencies to social programs and public safety alternatives. Biden has said he does not back defunding police and instead called for additional funding for local police forces.\n\nEric Trump rounded out his remarks by speaking directly to his father, saying he missed “working alongside you every day but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight.”\n\nTiffany Trump, the fourth of the president’s five children and perhaps the least visible, offered a stinging critique of the media, technology companies and even the nation’s education system for promoting what she described as “groupthink” that stands in opposition to the president.\n\n“People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for may and are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,” said Tiffany Trump, who graduated from Georgetown Law this year. “If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another.”\n\nTrump’s family was heavily represented on the second night of the convention at a difficult time: The president’s brother died of an undisclosed illness Aug. 15. President Trump has also been forced to contend with a critical book written by his niece, Mary Trump, and recorded audio of sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ripping him for “phoniness” and “lying.”\n\nThere was little indication of that strife on Tuesday, though.\n\nTiffany Trump implored Americans to see “beyond the façade – the masks – that so many other politicians employ” and she urged voters to “make your judgment based on results and not rhetoric.”\n\n— John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nPolice officer touts Trump efforts on opioids\n\nMarrying two key criminal justice messages often addressed by President Donald Trump, the Republican convention on Tuesday turned to an Albuquerque police officer who adopted the baby of a woman addicted to heroin.\n\nRyan Holets recalled an incident in 2017 in which he approached a pregnant woman preparing to inject heroin. The woman confessed she seeking a family who would adopt her baby.\n\n\"God showed me exactly what I had to do,\" Holets said. \"Without hesitation, I told her that my family would adopt her baby.\"\n\nThe story hit on several important themes for Trump: First, the president has frequently touted the importance of police in communities, even as some departments have come under criticism for high-profile deadly interactions with Black citizens.\n\nThe story also spoke to an issue Trump has frequently discussed: The growth of opioid addiction in the U.S. Trump has signed several executive orders on the issue, and the administration has worked to reduce the number of opioids prescribed by doctors.\n\n\"I hold a special place in my heart for those facing opioid addiction,\" Holets said. \"That’s why I’m enormously grateful to the president for his leadership in fighting this deadly enemy.\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nNunez: Trump will oppose socialism\n\nFlorida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, the first Latina in that post in state history, urged voters to support President Donald Trump to put “America first” in economic policy and for religious freedom.\n\n“Let us join our president in his vow that America will never be a socialist country,” said Nunez, whose parents fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. “He’s defended our religious freedom, stood with democratic allies like Colombia, and shown unwavering resolve while confronting tyrants in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China and Nicaragua.”\n\nShe said Trump would support law enforcement. She said he would fight to provide the best quality education by preserving school choice.\n\n“Americans have a choice,” Nunez said. “We can go down a dark road of chaos and government control, or we can choose the path of freedom and opportunity that was paved by those who sacrificed everything to preserve the American Dream for future generations.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nIowa governor: Trump ‘had our back’ during floods, storms\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds credits President Donald Trump with helping her state recover from devastating floods and storms.\n\nWhen 100-year floods breached nearly all levees and devastated communities along the Missouri River in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri last year, Trump approved their request for federal aid in record time – just two days, Reynolds said.\n\nAnd when a storm called a derecho, with hurricane-force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops just two weeks ago, Trump approved the state’s disaster aid request in less than 24 hours, she said.\n\nTrump “had our back,” said Reynolds, a Republican and Trump supporter.\n\n“The president cut through the bureaucracy to do what needed to be done, and to do it quickly,” she said.\n\nIowa is expected to be a key battleground state in November’s election. Trump carried the state in 2016 by nearly 9.5 percentage points. But polls show him in a tight race with Democratic challenger Joe Biden this year. Trump leads Biden by just 1.7 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of state polls.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nRepublican lawyer references Trump impeachment - to attack Joe Biden\n\nSurprisingly, President Donald Trump's impeachment came up at the Republican convention on Tuesday.\n\nNot surprisingly, a Republican lawyer used it to attack Joe Biden.\n\nFormer Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who helped Trump with his impeachment defense, used her speech to attack Joe Biden's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\"Joe Biden says he'll build back better,\" Bondi said at one point. \"Yeah ... build the Biden's Back Better.\"\n\nBondi provided no evidence that Hunter Biden's business activity in Ukraine was illegal, or that Biden himself acted improperly.\n\nDemocrats quickly pointed out that Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine into investigating Biden, despite the lack of evidence, and for threatening to withhold military aid if it did not follow through.\n\nSteve Schmidt, a former Republican and now a Trump opponent, tweeted that Bondi is \"ethically challenged,\" and \"lying about the Biden Family and repeating the talking points of Russian Intelligence Services.\"\n\nBondi has a close relationship with Trump, first as a long-time confidant from her days as attorney general and later as one of the lawyers who defended the president during the Senate impeachment trial earlier this year.\n\nShe also faced heavy criticism in 2013 when a Trump foundation sent her campaign a $25,000 check around the time her office decided not to join a New York state probe of consumer complaints against Trump University. Bondi has repeatedly said the donation had nothing to do with a decision made by independent investigators in her office not to pursue the investigation.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC speaker pulled from lineup after boosting QAnon-tied conspiracy\n\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory made its way to the Republican National Convention Tuesday.\n\nShortly before the second night of programming began, Mary Ann Mendoza was pulled from the RNC lineup after earlier in the day retweeting an anti-Semitic Twitter thread with ties to the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nMendoza tweeted “Do yourself a favor and read this thread,” linking to a lengthy thread from a QAnon conspiracy theorist that claimed the Rothschilds, a famous Jewish family from Germany, created a plan to terrorize “goyim” — non-Jewish people — by having \"the goyim destroy each other\" and “rob the goyim of their landed properties.”\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nKudlow: Trump’s actions spurred coronavirus recovery\n\nLarry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser, says the U.S. economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic thanks to “a great bipartisan rescue” led by President Donald Trump.\n\nA tax hike would disrupt the recovery, he warned.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans, has had a catastrophic impact on the U.S. economy since March. A mind-boggling 57.3 million workers have filed for unemployment over the past 22 weeks. Just two weeks ago, some 1.1 million Americans filed first-time applications for unemployment, the Labor Department said, signaling that the recovery will remain volatile.\n\nBut Kudlow struck an upbeat tone in his remarks to the Republican National Convention.\n\n“Americans are going back to work,” Kudlow said. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.”\n\nLooking ahead, the Trump administration is planning more tax cuts and regulatory relief for small businesses, Kudlow said.\n\n“Our economic choice is very clear,” Kudlow said. “Do you want economic health prosperity opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation recession and pessimism? There can’t be better economic policies than we’ve had in recent years.”\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTaxes become theme of RNC\n\nRepublicans are working hard during the second night of the Republican convention to drive home a message about Democrat Joe Biden, arguing his administration would quickly increase taxes – as soon as Day 1.\n\n\"You're coming out of a pandemic, and he wants to raise taxes?\" asked Larry Kudlow, one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers. \"That's crazy.\"\n\nIt was a theme that was repeatedly raised throughout the evening.\n\nJohn Peterson, owner a metal company, said Biden is \"ready to raise taxes, crush us with regulations.\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that Trump is the candidate to support for voters \"who want lower taxes.\"\n\nBiden has vowed to repeal the Trump tax cuts approved early in his presidency, but for top earners -- those earning over more than $400,000 – as well as corporations. If elected, Biden would need buy in from Congress to roll back the tax cuts, a move unlikely to take place on his first day.\n\n—John Fritze\n\nControversial former Planned Parenthood employee appeals to anti-abortion voters\n\nAbby Johnson, an anti-abortion advocate known for turning against Planned Parenthood after working as the director of a clinic, touted President Donald Trump’s anti-abortion agenda.\n\n“For me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like; I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even had a smell? I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women,” Johnson said on Tuesday.\n\nJohnson, author of the memoir “Unplanned” that was also adapted into a film, told the story of witnessing an abortion that changed her views on the issue while wearing a “1972” pin to symbolize the year before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal.\n\n“I left the clinic, looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life,” she said.\n\nShe praised Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who would be sympathetic to pro-life ideals and for withdrawing federal funds from clinics that conduct abortion referrals.\n\n“Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans,” Johnson said. “And this election is a choice between two radical, anti-life activists, and the most pro-life president we’ve ever had. That’s something that should compel you to action.”\n\nJohnson has come under fire for a number of controversial opinions. Vice reported Tuesday that she said in a video she thinks it is “smart” for police to be “on more high alert” when interacting with her biracial son than with her white sons because “statistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons.”\n\nRecent tweets by Johnson also show she supports head-of-household voting rights, which would only allow one representative from a household to cast their vote rather than each adult citizen. “In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say,” she said.\n\nIn a tweet ahead of her RNC appearance on Tuesday, Johnson accused abortion rights activists of being scared of her speech and “scrambling to try to find anything to detract people from my message.”\n\n—Jeanine Santucci\n\nChallenging the media\n\nNicholas Sandmann, the student at the center of a media storm, urged voters Tuesday to support President Donald Trump because he refuses to allow news coverage “to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts.”\n\n“I believe we must join a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism,” Sandmann, 18, said before putting on a red “Make America Great Again” hat. “This is worth fighting for. This is worth voting for. This is what President Donald Trump stands for.”\n\nThe news coverage that focused on Sandmann unfolded in January 2019, when the northern Kentucky teenager stared at Native American elder Nathan Phillips, who played a drum. A viral video of the moment played repeatedly on cable news and was reported in newspapers.\n\nSandmann, then a student at Covington Catholic High School, was attending a March for Life. Phillips was attending an Indigenous Peoples March. Sandmann said unfair coverage of the event changed his life forever in one moment without reporters asking for his side of the story or investigating Phillips’ motives.\n\n“What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage,” Sandmann said of his portrayal as a smirking boy in a red hat because of Trump’s opposition to abortion. “My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode.”\n\nSandmann sued CNN for $275 million by claiming the network defamed him, and the Washington Post. He reached undisclosed settlements in January.\n\nIn March, Sandmann sued five more outlets, including Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY.\n\n“I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being cancelled. As in annulled. As in revoked. As in made void,” Sandmann said. “Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant. But I would not be cancelled.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBilly Graham’s granddaughter praises Trump as a 'fierce advocate' for religious groups\n\nCissie Graham Lynch, the daughter of evangelist Franklin Graham and granddaughter of legendary preacher Billy Graham, hailed President Donald Trump as a “fierce advocate in the White House” for people of faith who stands up for religious freedoms that were “under attack” during the Obama administration.\n\n“Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced. Not bullied,” she said. “But during the Obama-Biden administration, these freedoms were under attack.”\n\nThe president is trying to shore up support among conservative Christians and white evangelicals who helped him secure his 2016 victory, but his approval rating among religious groups has slipped in recent months. A Pew Research Center survey last month found that 59% of white evangelicals say they “very strongly” approve of Trump, down eight points from April. But the survey also found that 82% would still vote for him if the election were held in July.\n\nGraham Lynch, whose father is scheduled to speak on Thursday, said Trump-appointed judges who “respect the First Amendment,” supported religious beliefs in court and “ensured religious ministries would not be forced to violate their beliefs.”\n\nShe added there was “no room for people of faith” in the Biden administration, though the former vice president has frequently talked about how his Catholic faith has helped him survive the death of his first wife and their daughter in a 1972 car crash, as well as the death of his son in 2015.\n\n“Whether you’re a baker, a florist or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God or to Caesar,” she said. “Because the radical left’s god is government power.”\n\nGraham Lynch’s comments came hours after Jerushah Duford, another granddaughter of Billy Graham, penned a searing rebuke of Trump and her uncle Franklin Graham for his support of the president. Duford, who wrote in USA TODAY that her faith and church have become “a laughing stock,” called on evangelical Christian women to speak out against Trump’s actions.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nRNC turns to a more hopeful message\n\nBreaking with the dire messaging of \"socialism\" and \"Loch Ness\" monsters that dominated the first night of the RNC, Republicans embraced a softer tone Tuesday -- at least in the early minutes -- ahead of first lady Melania Trump's address.\n\n\"He has followed through on his promises,\" asserted Maine lobsterman Jason Joyce.\n\n\"More than any president in my lifetime, he's acknowledged the importance of farmers and agriculture,\" said dairy farmer Chris Peterson.\n\nIn the most notable example of the shift, Trump appeared himself briefly in a taped appearance from the White House and signed a pardon to Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society.\n\nThe event drew scrutiny from Democrats, some of whom questioned the president's use of an official act at a political convention, but it nevertheless underscored more of a focus on the president's accomplishments rather than on what Republicans see as Biden's failures.\n\n\"Today, I’m filled with hope,\" Ponder said. \"I have been given a second chance.\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nFishing for votes\n\nJason Joyce, an eighth-generation lobsterman from Swan’s Island, Maine, said he didn't support President Donald Trump in 2016 because he expected the president \"to flip flop on his campaign promises.\"\n\nBut Joyce strongly supports Trump’s reelection this year because the president listened to fishermen’s views and adopted them. In contrast, Joyce characterized the Obama administration and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, as ignoring industry views.\n\n“As long as Trump is president, fishing families like mine will have a voice,” Joyce said. “But if Biden wins, he’ll be controlled by the environmental extremists who want to circumvent longstanding rules and impose radical changes that hurt our coastal communities.”\n\nTrump has promoted Maine lobster since a June 5 roundtable in Bangor. He reversed the Obama administration order that closed off 5,000 square miles of ocean to fishing for what is called the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.\n\n“This action was deeply unfair to Maine lobstermen,” Trump said.\n\nThe monument is about 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod – too far for Mainers to reach. And Obama grandfathered lobster and crab harvesting for seven years in the 2016 order, so those fisheries haven't been affected yet. But the decision still rankled fishermen.\n\n“Although Maine's lobstermen don't fish there, Obama's executive order offended us greatly. It circumvented the fisheries counsels’ input,” Joyce said. “President Trump reversed that decision, reinstating the rules that allow stakeholder input, and he supports a process that seeks and respects fishermen's views.”\n\nLobster is a valuable seafood market, with 133 million pounds landed in 2017 worth nearly $600 million, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Mainers landed more than 80% of the U.S. lobster catch that year.\n\nBut trade wars have damaged the industry. The European Union agreed Friday to lift tariffs of 8% on U.S. lobster and 20% on lobster products, which had hurt trade compared to Canadian lobster that faced no tariffs.\n\nChina also imposed a tariff on U.S. lobster in 2018 that now stands at least at 35%. Trump asked the Agriculture Department for monthly reports on the China tariff starting Aug. 15.\n\nJoyce said he strongly supported Trump's reelection.\n\n\"When he sees something isn't right, he’s fearless in fixing it,\" Joyce said. \"He listens to working people.\"\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nRand Paul: 'If you hate war ... support President Trump'\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican known for his anti-interventionist view of global affairs, praised Trump’s approach to “end war rather than start one,\" trying to portray a stark contrast between the president and Joe Biden when it comes to making the planet safer.\n\n\"I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home,\" said Paul, who has often joined the president in calling for the wind-down of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\"If you hate war like I hate war…if you want us to quit sending $50 billion every year to Afghanistan to build their roads and bridges instead of building them here at home, you need to support President Trump for another term.\"\n\nTrump has touted his unconventional strategy on foreign policy, including efforts to build bridges with authoritarian figures such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea despot Kim Jong-Un.\n\nHe’s also drawn bipartisan fire for trying to undermine the NATO alliance and for pulling troops out of Syria, a move that prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nPaul, who did not appear at the RNC in 2016, had some unkind words for Trump four years ago when both were running for the White House. He called the billionaire businessman \"a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag.\" Trump in turn criticized Paul's looks and called him \"a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.\"\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nPrayers for Jacob Blake during RNC\n\nNorma Urrabazo from the International Church of Las Vegas opened Tuesday’s events with a prayer for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake, the Wisconsin man who was shot multiple times in the back by police officers Sunday while he was leaning into an SUV.\n\n“I’m going to invite you to join your faith with mine and let’s prayer in agreement,” Urrabazo said. “Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.”\n\nIn addition to prayer for Blake and his family, Urrabazo asked for protection for those who have “put their lives in harm’s way, to bring safety and security to our streets.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nRNC courts Native American vote for Trump\n\nNative Americans will make up a tiny slice of the electorate in November, but they could have an outsized influence on the election where it counts: Several battleground states.\n\nSo it was no surprise the RNC opened its second night with Myron Lizer, vice president of the Navajo Nation – a territory that covers portions of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.\n\n“Our people have never been invited into the American Dream,” said Lizer, who appeared with Trump at an event in Phoenix this year. “We’ve for years fought congressional battles with past congressmen and senators that were part of a broken system that ignored us.\n\n“That is, until President Trump took office,” he said.\n\nLizer pointed specifically to billions of dollars in economic stimulus to help tribal communities address COVID-19.\n\nTrump has had a complicated relationship with Native Americans. He repeated use of the word “Pocahontas” to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been offensive to some.\n\nMore recently, Trump slammed the decision to change the name of the Washington, D.C., NFL team, a word that is a slur used to describe Native Americans.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 5.2 million people identified as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, or in combination with at least one other race.\n\nThe vast majority vote Democratic, except in states where energy is a large focus of the regional economy, such as Alaska, North Dakota or Oklahoma. Native Americans could also be a factor in Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\n—John Fritze and Ledyard King\n\nTrump's surprises: Swearing in new citizens, pardoning a prison activist\n\nPresident Donald Trump used a \"surprise appearance\" at Tuesday's Republican political convention to swear in five new U.S. citizens.\n\nWhile some analysts questioned Trump taking official actions at a political convention, the president supervised the swearing-in of five new U.S. citizens born in Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Ghana and Sudan.\n\n\"Congratulations – great going,\" Trump told the group in a video that the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast.\n\nNoting that one of the new American citizens has a degree in psychology, Trump said: \"In other words, she can figure me out.\"\n\nWhile Trump used the ceremony to tout the virtues of legal immigration, Democrats said his crackdowns at the border are designed to keep out any person of color.\n\nCritics said Trump should not make such political use of the presidency at a political convention.\n\nBen Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted that the GOP meeting \"is infused with the illegal and unethical use of everything from the White House to the presidential pardon power.\"\n\nBefore the immigration ceremony, Trump signed a federal pardon for Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society.\n\n\"Jon's life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption,\" Trump said\n\nThe state of Nevada had already granted clemency to Ponder, a convicted bank robber.\n\nTrump, who has made criminal justice reform a part of his agenda, praised Ponder's work with ex-prisoners, he did not mention voting rights. The president has opposed restoring voting rights for felons, and criticized governors who support the idea.\n\nIn thanking Trump for his federal pardon, Ponder said \"we live in a nation of second chances.\"\n\nRichard Beasley, a retired FBI agent who once arrested Ponder but is now a friend, also appeared in the video, saying, \"I'm so proud of Jon with his life's turnaround, and for all the lives that he's helped to change.\"\n\nCritics said Trump's use of the presidency violates at least the spirit of the Hatch Act that forbids government employees engaging political activity. (Presidents, however, are exempt from the law.)\n\n\"The Hatch Act is a law designed to separate politics from public service,\" tweeted Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Those lines are being erased tonight.\"\n\nIn his latest break from political tradition, Trump is making appearances every night at the Republican convention.\n\nThat will include his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night.\n\nLocation: The White House.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC viewership fell 29% from 2016\n\nThe first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday averaged 15.9 million television viewers – 29% less than viewership four years ago and 15% less than the first night of last week’s Democratic National Convention.\n\nIt closely resembles the 27% nosedive in viewers for night 1 of the DNC convention, which averaged 18.7 million viewers. The opening night of the 2016 RNC convention in Cleveland, Ohio drew about 22.5 million viewers.\n\nThe Nielsen figures, reported by Variety and the Los Angeles Times, combine viewership on the three main networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, and leading cable new networks CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nFox News set the pace Monday leading with 7.1 million viewers followed by CNN’s 2 million viewers; ABC, nearly 2 million; NBC, 1.7 million; MSNBC, 1,6 million; and CBS, 1.5 million.\n\nFacing challenges of a global pandemic, both conventions ditched arenas and live audiences in favor of many recorded speeches and prepackaged videos. Democrats pieced together four nights of two-hour television shows while several Republican speakers shared the same stage at Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. while President Donald Trump was featured in multiple videos shot in the White House.\n\nAlthough last week’s DNC viewership was down significantly, the campaign for Democratic nominee Joe Biden touted a record 10.2 million digital viewers, totaling 28.9 million viewers overall when combined with television viewership.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nMelania Trump big draw of RNC's second night\n\nOn its second night, the Republican National Convention will get personal.\n\nThe virtual lineup for Tuesday includes first lady Melania Trump and two of the president's children – Eric and Tiffany – along with a series of business people, advocates for Republican causes and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nMelania Trump, rarely seen campaigning with the president, will be the big draw of the evening. The first lady will speak in prime time from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, a project she supervised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself is also expected to show up during the online convention Tuesday. He plans to appear every night this week, leading up to his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night, also at the White House.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDems push economic counter program during RNC\n\nThe battle over who gets credit for the pre-COVID economic recovery has become a defining issue of the conventions as well as this year's presidential election. Not surprisingly, Democrats argued Tuesday that Joe Biden deserves much of the credit.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, speaking as part of the Biden campaign's RNC counter-programming, said it was the Obama-Biden administration that led the country out of the worst economic downturn in generations. Trump, she said, drove that progress into the ground through his trade wars and haphazard pandemic response.\n\n“Donald Trump has severely worsened our country’s economy,” Whitmer said. “Workers and families cannot afford four more of years of that.”\n\nTrump and other Republicans have argued that the recovery under Obama, who signed a major economic stimulus in 2009, was one of the slowest in the nation's history. While unemployment and market indicators were improving under Obama, they note those numbers took off at a faster rate once Trump was in the White House.\n\nThe debate is important because both candidates are positioning themselves as best able to help the nation recover from the economic catastrophe caused by COVID-19.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., cited figures about how 1.5 million fewer jobs were created during the first three years of the Trump administration, compared to the final three years of the Obama administration. Booker also slammed Trump's tax cut bill as benefiting the rich while racking up enormous federal budget deficits.\n\n“We know people all across New Jersey are hurting and need some relief,” Booker said. “Working families know that the president isn’t looking out for them.”\n\n– Bart Jansen and John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/13/beckoning-tourists-evangelical-outreach-vaccine-sweeteners-news-around-states/116175936/", "title": "Beckoning tourists, evangelical outreach: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: With the state’s jobless numbers already nearing pre-pandemic levels and competition on the rise in a changed job market, the search for hospitality workers may not end with Alabama’s participation in federal supplemental unemployment benefits. Some who lost jobs in the industry “went off and found a job that has more … dependable wages,” said Jacqueline Allen, spokeswoman for state workforce development agency AIDT. “Everybody who basically wants a job right now has a job.” That’s My Child youth nonprofit founder Charles Lee said every member of his teens-to-work training program now graduates with a job, and the phone keeps ringing with employers asking for more. Meanwhile, he said federal relief payments and jobless benefits have changed people’s outlook on what’s possible. “It’s the most money some people have ever seen,” Lee said. “I think it’s just whoever is willing to go up to that $15 is going to get that workforce.” Transportation and child care issues were complicated by the pandemic, too. Child care alone is pricey in the best of times, if it’s available at all. Sam Addy of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama estimated better access to child care could bring 120,000 more people into the state’s labor force.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The runoff race for mayor remained too close to call after Tuesday’s election, with the two candidates separated by only about 100 votes and thousands of ballots still uncounted. Preliminary election results showed Forrest Dunbar leading opponent Dave Bronson by a slim margin, garnering 50.08% of the votes tallied thus far, Anchorage Daily News reports. The election was on track for a record number of votes cast. An unknown amount of ballots cast in person Tuesday, left in secure ballot boxes throughout the city or postmarked by Election Day continue to arrive. As more ballots arrive, it’s likely that turnout will eclipse the city’s last record in the 2018 race for mayor. While technically nonpartisan, the mayoral race has been heated, fomenting partisan divisions among residents who disagree over how the city should move forward. The two candidates take starkly contrasting approaches to issues like the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the homelessness crisis and the city’s economy. Bronson has criticized Anchorage’s public health measures and restrictions on businesses and targeted Dunbar over the city’s handling of homelessness. Meanwhile, Dunbar has largely supported the city’s pandemic policies, saying that without them, more people would have died from COVID-19.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey’s order last month rescinding the mask mandate for schools inflamed and confused the debate over face coverings, as many parents incorrectly interpreted it as a “masks off” directive. Ducey’s action tossed the decision to school administrators, putting them in the driver’s seat on mask policy. For many, it has been a hot seat. “It’s been pretty wild,” said Deb Dillon, president of the Prescott Unified School District board. Prescott opted to make mask usage voluntary last month but reversed itself May 4 after a coronavirus outbreak. The Prescott meeting was orderly, in contrast to earlier events in southern Arizona, where anti-mask protesters crowded into lobbies outside the board meetings of the Vail and Tanque Verde districts, demanding to speak. Both meetings were canceled. The protesters at Vail held a mock election to appoint themselves school officials. That led to incorrect accounts that circulated nationwide that their complaints had scared the official board members into quitting. The Arizona School Boards Association issued a statement condemning actions that threaten school board members. “Too often this year they have been treated as faceless bureaucrats who are optimal targets to release rage and frustration over the circumstances of the pandemic,” the statement said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday formed a panel to come up with ways to spend the $1.5 billion the state is receiving from the latest federal coronavirus relief package. The Republican governor formed a 15-member steering committee for the state’s share of the $1.9 trillion relief measure that became law in March. Hutchinson formed a similar committee for the coronavirus relief money that was approved last year. The panel will be made up of eight Cabinet members and three members each from the state House and Senate. “We have to be methodical about this and not rushed,” Hutchinson told reporters. The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday issued broad guidance on how the relief funds can be spent. Hutchinson said he believed the priority for the state’s share of the relief spending should be capital investments, citing broadband and cybersecurity as two areas he’d like funded with the additional money. “It needs to be investments we can make that do not incur long-term spending and indebtedness of the state,” Hutchinson said. Because Arkansas’ unemployment rate is not significantly higher than its pre-pandemic level, the state is eligible to receive just half of its $1.5 billion allotment immediately, with the rest being provided one year later.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: The city is offering tickets to the Aquarium of the Pacific as an incentive to overcome resistance to COVID-19 vaccinations. Long Beach will give two aquarium tickets to anyone receiving their first dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at city-run vaccination sites, the city said Tuesday. The offer runs through Saturday. “While we have made tremendous strides in vaccinating 60% of eligible Long Beach residents and 96% of our seniors, we know that vaccine hesitancy for some is real,” Mayor Robert Garcia said in a statement. “We are going to do everything we can to encourage folks to get vaccinated, and that includes incentives.” The Aquarium of the Pacific is one of the Los Angeles region’s major attractions, drawing about 1.7 million visitors annually. A regular adult general admission ticket costs $36.95. City Health and Human Services Director Kelly Colopy said the recent slowdown in vaccinations in California includes Long Beach, and officials are looking for innovative solutions.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Some health officials have warned that continued high numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations point to the pandemic not being over yet despite the state’s average infection rate decreasing by nearly a third since April. Colorado was averaging 1,731 newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day in late April – the most since Jan. 19 – but the numbers have fallen nearly every day since then, The Gazette reports. The state has averaged 1,182 newly confirmed cases over the past week, health officials said. “Colorado is heading in a positive direction again, and vaccination coverage is almost certainly playing a key role in this decline,” said Glen Mays, chair of the Colorado School of Public Health’s department of health systems. But Elizabeth Carlton, who also works for the department, said there are more worrying metrics, including hospitalizations. Carlton said the state was averaging about 100 new hospital admissions from COVID-19 daily since April 28, but that figure has risen to more than 650 as of Monday. Carlton said the metric means the “the number of people developing severe COVID-19 in Colorado doesn’t appear to be declining right now.” Some researchers said infection control efforts have fallen, and the time people spend away from home is rising, meaning current trends could continue.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing home workers continue to struggle with severe staffing shortages, a lack of protective equipment and low pay during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released Monday, days before planned employee strikes across the state. The report also accuses nursing home owners of failing to follow federal guidance on the use of protective equipment and having inadequate infection control, testing and quarantine procedures during the pandemic. It alleges state officials haven’t done enough to oversee nursing homes and hold them accountable. The report, titled “We Were Abandoned: How Connecticut Failed Nursing Home Workers and Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was written by Yale Law School students for the Service Employees International Union’s District 1199 New England, which represents about 5,000 nursing home workers in Connecticut. “These workers risk their lives and the lives of their loved ones back home to care for these residents in unsafe conditions and for low pay,” Yale student Aaron Bryce Lee said at a news conference Monday. “The state must make the financial investments necessary to improve compensation, benefits and staffing levels.” Workers at 33 nursing homes are ready to strike beginning Friday if demands for better wages, benefits and staffing aren’t met.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware State University will cancel more than $700,000 in student debt for recent graduates who “faced financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the school announced Wednesday. The average eligible student will qualify for about $3,276 in debt relief, the school said. The funds, which will total $730,655, became available through the federal government’s latest coronavirus relief package. More than 200 students qualify, according to the university. A spokesperson for the school, Carlos Holmes, said most students should already know if they’ve qualified, but they can check with financial aid. School President Tony Allen said the debt reduction is consistent with the school’s initiatives to keep student debt manageable. “We haven’t raised our tuition in over six years; we issue every incoming student an iPad or a MacBook; we are replacing traditional textbooks with less expensive digital editions, and our Early College High School saves the average family of nearly $50,000 in college expenses,” he said in a statement. “Our students don’t just come here for a quality college experience. Most are trying to change the economic trajectory of their lives for themselves, their families, and their communities. Our responsibility is to do everything we can to put them on the path.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents face a Friday deadline to apply for a local program to help those who have fallen behind on their mortgage because of the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. The Home Saver Program, offered by the D.C. Housing Finance Agency, has $4 million on the table to aid families in need, said Christopher Donald, executive director and CEO of the agency. “You’ve got to be a resident of the District of Columbia,” Donald said. “If they own a home here, and it’s their primary residence, and they’re behind on their mortgage, they’re either unemployed or underemployed, they can get up to 16 months of assistance, up to $60,000.” Money is also available through the Restore Program for people who have returned to work but need a boost to get out of the red. “The assistance does cover delinquent condo fees and HOA fees,” Donald said. The money comes in the form of a grant, so it doesn’t have to be paid back, and there is no income requirement to apply. Relief is also available for small landlords who have taken a financial hit during the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nPensacola: Hot dogs, hamburgers, minor league baseball and COVID-19 shots are coming together. This week at Blue Wahoos Stadium, adult ticket buyers are eligible to receive the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at several games. The shots were distributed Tuesday and will also be available at games Saturday and Sunday. J&J’s vaccine requires only one dose. Shots will be available to eligible fans for free, with no appointment necessary. “The Blue Wahoos’ mission statement is to improve the quality of life in our community, so when we had the opportunity to partner with the Florida Department of Health, it was a no-brainer for us,” said Donna Kirby, the team’s vice president of operations. “We thought, ‘Absolutely.’ What great fun to have fans back for baseball, to be able to provide them with vaccinations if they so choose.” A total of 500 doses will be administered at the ballpark on a first-come, first-served basis. They will not be divvied up over the course of the three games, Kirby said, so there is a possibility that all 500 shots could be administered before the end of the three-game stretch. To get in the spirit, team President Jonathan Griffith will receive his shot during the seventh-inning stretch of Saturday’s game.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Twelve-year-old Jane Ellen Norman is looking forward to a little more freedom in her life and a possible return to summer camp after getting her first dose of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, one day after U.S. regulators expanded its use to children her age through 15. Georgia is one of the first states to open up the shots, Reuters reports. Being able to see her friends without staying far apart and worrying they might get sick was top of mind for Jane Ellen after her shot at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta. “I hope they all get vaccinated,” the sixth grader said. Jane Ellen’s mom, English Norman, said she scheduled an appointment for her daughter and 14-year-old son immediately after hearing about the FDA authorization. She said her kids have been good about wearing masks, washing their hands and staying socially distant, but they’ve still been very anxious about leaving the house. “I think it’s exciting that now their anxiety can start to lessen and they can feel safe,” she said. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said Monday that the authorization brings the country “closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic.” For Jane Ellen, that means a chance to go back to her summer camp, which was canceled last year as the pandemic raged. “I’m excited to go there and see all my camp friends,” she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The chief executive of a company accused of defrauding banks of money meant to assist businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic pleaded not guilty Wednesday. Martin Kao, CEO of Martin Defense Group LLC, formerly known as Navatek LLC, is charged with bank fraud and money laundering. Authorities say he defrauded banks of more than $12.8 million through the Paycheck Protection Program, which Congress authorized to provide emergency financial assistance through forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and other expenses. Kao transferred more than $2 million into his own personal accounts, according to an indictment. Investigators talked to an executive and a former employee who said the company wasn’t affected by the pandemic, court documents said. Authorities describe his company as a “research, engineering, design, and innovations company that specializes in novel systems for the Department of Defense and other partners in academia and other scientific fields.” During a brief arraignment via telephone Wednesday, defense attorney Michael Green entered the not guilty plea on behalf of Kao.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is moving into a new stage of Gov. Brad Little’s coronavirus reopening plans and lifting restrictions on the size of gatherings. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen made the announcement Tuesday, noting that the state’s health care system isn’t strained and that plenty of vaccine is available for interested residents. “Eighty-three percent of hospitals are operating as normal, and there’s no hospital in the state that has a resource limitation going on,” Jeppesen said during a news conference. In November and December, some hospitals were intermittently turning away people or sending them elsewhere because they didn’t have enough healthy staffers or available beds to admit them. In Stage 3 of the reopening plan, gatherings were supposed to be limited to 50 or fewer people, though political, religious, educational and health care events were exempt from the restriction. The current move to Stage 4 means there is no limit on gatherings, though public health officials are encouraging people to follow guidance from federal and local health agencies on how to gather safely. Face coverings are still recommended at times when physical distancing is difficult, and people and businesses should continue to follow physical distancing and sanitation recommendations, Jeppesen said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Capitalizing on the availability of vaccines, cabin fever and an imminent easing of pandemic restrictions, Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday launched a $6million advertising campaign to promote road-trip tourism and revive Illinois’ devastated hospitality industry. The “Time for Me to Drive” campaign makes use of a play on words from the 1978 song “Time for Me to Fly” by REO Speedwagon, a rock band that got its start in Champaign. The campaign will focus on attracting visitors from within Illinois and from surrounding states to hundreds of sites where they can enjoy Chicago architecture, southern Illinois wineries, hiking in state parks, restaurants throughout the state, and Springfield’s Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. “More and more travelers are ready to get back out there,” Pritzker said at a news conference at the presidential library. “Recent surveys show that half of Americans plan to travel this summer, and half of them intend to drive. ... After an incredibly difficult year in which the pandemic kept us all close to home and staying apart, lifesaving vaccines are bringing us back to life and heading toward a summer of fun and venturing out.” More than 60 potential driving itineraries are available online at enjoyillinois.com.\n\nIndiana\n\nFishers: The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra is bringing back its popular Symphony on the Prairie performances, a year after the pandemic forced the cancellation of the long-running outdoor concert series. Officials announced Monday that this year’s Kroger Symphony on the Prairie season will begin June 25 with the symphony’s rendition of songs by the Beatles performed for an audience on the grassy lawn at suburban Indianapolis’ Conner Prairie. A series of other performances will be held throughout the summer at the venue in Fishers, just north of Indianapolis, with the last performances set for early September. Tickets go on sale May 24. This year’s concerts will be different after last year’s shows were canceled for the first time in the events’ 40-year history due to the threat that the coronavirus posed to musicians, staff and patrons. The symphony plans to sell only up to 4,000 tickets – or 50% of the venue’s capacity – for the first concerts to help patrons maintain social distance. The dance floor in front of the performance stage will also be closed, and there will be limits on table rentals and reserved seating. People will also have to wear masks when entering the venue, on pathways, in restrooms, and when they wait in line for food and drinks.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: Simpson College won’t require students, staff or faculty to get vaccinated before the fall semester, but it also plans to hold off on returning to normal campus operations until most have gotten their COVID-19 shots. The college’s crisis management team, led by Heidi Levine, vice president for student development and planning, and Simpson President Marsha Kelliher’s leadership cabinet, announced the decision on the college’s online COVID-19 dashboard last week. According to the announcement, the team hopes to see 80% of the campus community vaccinated before transitioning to a “Green” operating phase, but it also plans to strongly encourage everyone on campus to get vaccinated. Some colleges across the country have recently announced vaccine requirements, “but that is still the minority of colleges,” Levine said, adding that Grinnell College is the only Iowa college of which she’s aware that plans to require students to be inoculated by August. Grinnell College officials announced the requirement last month but said students will be able to request an exemption for medical or religious reasons.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The families of 16 students have sued two suburban Kansas City school districts, arguing their children should be allowed to attend school during the pandemic without wearing masks. “The parents are terribly, terribly upset. There’s a groundswell of dissatisfaction,” said their attorney, Linus Baker. The Kansas City Star reports the lawsuit against the Blue Valley and Olathe school districts in Johnson County argues students should be granted individual exemptions to mask mandates. The parents contend masks are interfering with their children’s ability to learn. Districts offer medical exemptions, generally for students with special needs or disabilities. They also relax mask rules for students during some sports and other activities. Two parents already have medical exemptions but are suing to seek reimbursement for the costs to obtain them. Both districts have fielded challenges since the Legislature passed a bill that empowers parents to fight COVID-19 restrictions. But their school boards have so far upheld their mask mandates. District officials have argued that the mandates cannot be repealed under the new law because they were enacted last summer. The law requires individuals to contest them within 30 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state government will receive more than $2.1 billion from the latest round of federal coronavirus aid – a smaller-than-projected amount due to the commonwealth’s improving economic performance, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. The U.S. Treasury announced state allocations based on a formula that included each state’s share of the nation’s unemployed from October through December 2020, Beshear said. Kentucky performed better than expected during that period, he said. As a result, its allotment will be $2.18 billion, down from an initial estimate that state government would receive $2.44 billion, he said. “In other words, Kentucky has recovered stronger than the federal government anticipated, faster than most, and it impacted a little bit on the dollars that will be available to us,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. Beshear has pointed to a recent series of upbeat economic developments – from record sales tax collections to a credit rating agency’s upgraded assessment of the state’s financial outlook – in touting Kentucky’s prospects as more people get COVID-19 vaccines. He has used the economic news to try to deflect criticism from some prominent Republicans calling for a much faster pace in lifting remaining virus restrictions.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: New research being done at LSU Health Shreveport offers an up-close view of how SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can spread to the brain. The study helps explain the alarming array of neurological symptoms reported in some patients with COVID-19 and reveals clues as to why some patients suffer severe neurological effects, while others experience none at all. The researchers, working with colleagues at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha in Spain, report evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect both neurons, the nerve cells that power the brain, and astrocytes, the cells in the brain and spinal cord that support and protect neurons. “Our findings suggest that astrocytes are a pathway through which COVID-19 causes neurological damage,” said Dr. Ricardo Costa, a postdoctoral fellow at LSU Health Shreveport and the study’s first author. “This could explain many of the neurologic symptoms we see in COVID-19 patients, which include loss of sense of smell and taste, disorientation, psychosis and stroke.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state is rolling out free fishing licenses, baseball tickets and L.L. Bean gift cards to encourage more residents to get vaccinated before the end of the month, Gov. Janet Mills announced Tuesday. The Democratic governor unveiled the public-private program, “Your Shot to Get Outdoors,” during a virtual discussion President Joe Biden hosted with several governors. The items include up to 5,000 hunting licenses, fishing licenses, Maine Wildlife Park day passes and state park day passes, along with up to 10,000 $20 L.L. Bean gift cards and up to 5,000 Portland Sea Dog tickets and passes for Oxford Plains Speedway. “Whether you’re an angler or a hunter, a baseball fan or a racing fan, or someone who just all-around enjoys being outside, now is a great time to protect yourself from COVID-19 and take to the outdoors,” Mills said. The program led by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services comes as the number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered dipped to less than 63,000 last week, down from a peak of more than 125,000 doses in the first week that eligibility opened to all adults. The state hopes the new program along with federal approval of a COVID-19 vaccine for younger teenagers will encourage more vaccinations.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Seeking a big comeback after a pandemic-decimated 2020, city officials are hoping a new ad campaign will remind Americans of just why they love visiting the resort for summer vacation. About this time last year, Ocean City was reopening its hotels, beach and Boardwalk after COVID-19 forced closures. Despite reopening for the 2020 summer season, the pandemic wreaked havoc on Ocean City, causing businesses and the town to lose millions. This May, hotels, as well as the beach and Boardwalk, are all open, and “the pathway to the summer much brighter than it was last year,” Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan said. This year’s ads offer a relatively traditional message, reminding viewers of the memories they’ve made at the beach and encouraging them to come make new ones. In one commercial, heartfelt music plays as a narrator reminds viewers that the 10 miles of beach in Ocean City aren’t “just made of sand and water; it’s made of memories.” That message has been carefully crafted since the end of last year, said Jessica Waters, the city’s acting tourism director. The two ads, “10 Miles of Memories” and “Ocean Calling,” were developed to focus on the “simple moments” and memories people create at the beach.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: While there was a slight increase in the overall number of confirmed and suspected opioid-related drug overdose deaths in the state in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, overdose deaths among Black men soared by almost 70%, health officials said Wednesday. There were 2,104 confirmed and suspected opioid-related overdose deaths in the state last year, a 5% increase over the prior year, according to a report from the Department of Public Health. Among Black, non-Hispanic males, the confirmed opioid-related overdose death rate increased 69%, from 32.6 to 55.1 per 100,000 people – the highest increase of any ethnic or racial group in 2020. “The disparities in overdose trends among Black men underscore the need to continue our public health-centered, data-driven approach to the opioid epidemic that is disproportionately impacting high-risk, high-need priority populations,” Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel said. Battling opioid use was complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, but Massachusetts is among the states with the smallest increases in all drug overdose deaths last year, officials said. “Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid epidemic have underscored the importance of supporting disproportionately impacted communities,” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Health officials on Wednesday urged primary care physicians to enroll to administer COVID-19 vaccines, as the state prepared to quickly begin vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds following U.S. authorization. “The most important thing we can do right now is to make vaccines available for whenever someone is ready,” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief health deputy, said during a news conference. “We know that patients trust their doctors, and when they are ready to get vaccinated, we want you to have vaccine on hand.” She encouraged doctors to check whether their patients have been vaccinated and ask if they have any questions. About 55% of Michigan residents ages 16 and older have been inoculated. The push to make doses available in physicians’ offices will complement the state’s focus on taking mobile clinics to places such as churches and vaccinating people who are homebound. Dr. Srikar Reddy, president-elect of the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, said it is time to shift attention to residents who are hesitant about the vaccine and to the newly eligible children. “It only makes sense to visit your family physician to get vaccinated and to get your teenager vaccinated, too,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state government will get about $200 million more than it was expecting under President Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief package, and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz expressed hope Monday that new guidelines for how states can spend the aid might help speed up the slow pace of negotiations over Minnesota’s next budget. The legislative session is due to adjourn next Monday, but the governor and leaders of the divided Legislature have yet to agree on target numbers for a dozen broad spending bills at the core of the state’s next two-year budget, which is expected to come in at about $50 billion. Walz told reporters that at least they now know how Minnesota can and can’t spend its $2.8 billion in federal relief. “The clarification from Treasury is huge,” he said. “That’s what we’ve been waiting on.” Republican leaders said the new federal guidance clears the way for Minnesota to exempt Paycheck Protection Program loans and extended unemployment insurance benefits from state taxes, which have been GOP priorities this session. Democrats have sought to cap the PPP exemption so that larger, profitable companies would pay taxes on forgiven loans.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will stop accepting supplemental unemployment benefits from the federal government next month, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday. Reeves said the weekly supplement of $300 per person was intended to help people “who are unemployed through no fault of their own” because of the coronavirus pandemic. “After many conversations over the last several weeks with Mississippi small business owners and their employees, it has become clear that the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and other like programs passed by the Congress may have been necessary in May of last year but are no longer so in May of this year,” Reeves wrote on Facebook. He said he’s directed the Mississippi Department of Employment Security to tell the federal government that the state will opt out of the additional federal unemployment benefits June 12, the earliest date allowed by federal law. Without the federal supplement, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit in Mississippi is $235, according to the department. “It has become clear to me that we cannot have a full economic recovery until we get the thousands of available jobs in our state filled,” Reeves wrote. A 40-hour-per-week job at the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would pay $290 a week before taxes are taken out.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers pushed back Wednesday against local coronavirus restrictions, passing legislation limiting the duration of public health orders that have shut down businesses and schools and limited how many people can gather. The legislation would limit emergency orders restricting businesses, churches, schools or gatherings to 30 days, unless extended by the local governing body. It would take effect immediately upon Gov. Mike Parson’s signature, meaning it could affect pandemic restrictions still in place in St. Louis County or other jurisdictions. It also would affect any future local health orders. “We want to be able to get this enforced as soon as possible,” said House Speaker Pro Tem John Wiemann, R-O’Fallon, who handled the bill. The House and Senate passed the legislation by overwhelming votes and with little discussion. Lawmakers have complained repeatedly during this year’s session about local pandemic restrictions that they say infringe on individual liberties and the ability to earn a living. The bill would allow local governing bodies to halt public health orders at any time by a majority vote. It also would prohibit cities and counties that receive public funds from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to use public accommodations or transportation systems.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is sharing COVID-19 vaccines with Canadian truck drivers from neighboring Alberta. About 2,000 truck drivers from the province who transport goods from Canada to the U.S. are eligible to be vaccinated at a highway rest stop near Conrad through May 23, according to a memorandum of understanding signed between the state and the Canadian province. “By working together and taking this critical action, we keep our trade channels open between Montana and Alberta,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a statement. The border between Canada and the U.S. has been closed to all but essential traffic since last spring. “Alberta depends on trade with our American neighbors and this program will ensure our goods get to market while stopping the spike of COVID-19,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said in a statement. The province has reported record numbers of new COVID-19 cases this month. A similar program to vaccinate truck drivers from Canada began in North Dakota last month. The announcement came after the Blackfeet tribe in northern Montana gave about 1,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to their relatives and neighbors across the border last month.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A sweeping bill that would shield businesses and local governments from coronavirus-related lawsuits won initial approval from state lawmakers Tuesday, despite complaints that senators haven’t done enough for workers who were at risk. Lawmakers advanced the proposal, 39-3, through the first of three required votes. The measure would bar pandemic-related lawsuits against businesses or governments as long as they were following federal public health guidelines. At least 29 other states have enacted laws addressing the issue, including 12 that are similar to the Nebraska proposal, said state Sen. Tom Briese, of Albion, the measure’s sponsor. He said Nebraska businesses face the threat of “needless, unwarranted” lawsuits from the pandemic if lawmakers don’t pass legal protections. The proposal has strong backing from Nebraska businesses, hospitals, schools, counties and cities. Organizations representing Nebraska trial attorneys and public school teachers opposed it. Some senators also criticized the bill because they said lawmakers haven’t done enough to help on-the-ground workers who faced the pandemic directly, risking their own health. Lawmakers this year have rejected paid sick-leave requirements for businesses and additional coronavirus protections for meatpacking workers.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gambling giant MGM Resorts International on Wednesday joined a growing number of Las Vegas Strip casinos with state regulatory approval to open casino floors at 100% capacity and no person-to-person distancing requirement. The company said the Nevada Gaming Control Board granted its waiver for nine properties based on its workforce vaccination rate. “We will continue working to vaccinate as many people as possible and remain vigilant with health and safety protocols,” company CEO & President Bill Hornbuckle said in a statement. Approval applies to casino floors at the Bellagio, ARIA, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, New York-New York, Luxor, Excalibur and Park MGM. Three-foot distancing and 80% occupancy restrictions remain at restaurants, swimming pools and other non-gambling areas. Masks are still required. Clark County lawmakers with jurisdiction over Las Vegas-area businesses have approved plans to allow 100% occupancy once 60% of eligible county residents get a vaccine shot. As of Tuesday, the figure was 47%. Southern Nevada Health District Chief Health Officer Dr. Fermin Leguen said the county might not reach the threshold by June 1, given lagging demand.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Prouty, an annual event to raise money for cancer research, is allowing some in-person participation this year, its 40th, after going virtual last summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Prouty combines cycling, walking and other events to raise funds for the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center. This year, in-person options include golf July 9 in Grantham, a 20-mile cycle July 10 in Hanover and a 5K walk July 11 in Hanover. Designated start times will be assigned to small groups to meet capacity restrictions. Local health guidelines and enhanced safety protocols will be followed. People can participate in activities virtually between June 1 and July 10. “The Prouty has always been about hope, and this year’s hybrid model is a stepping stone to a return to normalcy from the pandemic,” said Jacklynn Rodriguez, executive director for the Friends of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center. Since its inception in 1982, The Prouty has raised more than $50 million to support cancer research and patient and family support services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: For the second year in a row, Rutgers University will host virtual commencement ceremonies for graduates of its New Brunswick, Newark and Camden campuses. However, the school announced Tuesday that it will commend the graduates of 2020 and 2021 with in-person celebrations this fall. A notice on the university’s website asks students to save dates for their campus’s events: Rutgers New Brunswick and Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences on Oct. 22-23, Rutgers Newark on Nov. 8-10 and Rutgers Camden on Dec. 1-4. “While we had hoped to bring you together sooner, the continuing public health emergency associated with the pandemic prevented us until now,” said a statement signed by University President Jonathan Holloway and each school’s chancellor. Details on the events will be posted to the university’s website at a later date. “We are excited that Rutgers will have the opportunity this fall to bring you together in person and salute you for your accomplishments,” the announcement said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A year after holding only drive-thru graduations, the school district for the state’s second most populous city has scheduled in-person graduation ceremonies at the district’s soccer stadium for its six high schools over two days later this month. Las Cruces Public Schools scheduled ceremonies May 21 for Onate and Mayfield high schools and Arrowhead Park Early College High School and on May 22 for Las Cruces and Centennial high schools and Rio Grande Preparatory Institute. Each graduating senior can invite up to 16 ticketed people, with the limit set due to the COVID-19 pandemic plus construction-related traffic in the area of the Field of Dreams stadium. Social distancing and mask-wearing will be required for all attendees while inside the venue. “I do want to thank all the graduates for their continuous resilience throughout this whole pandemic and really doing the best that they can,” interim Superintendent Ralph Ramos said. “We want to have this ceremony.” Ramos said the district is looking into ways to celebrate the class of 2020, which didn’t have a normal graduation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State regulators will soon draft rules that will require employers to protect workers from airborne infectious disease. A new state law tasks state labor and health officials with coming up with minimum workplace standards around things like the availability of personal protective equipment, social distancing and quarantine requirements. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law last week. Employers will have to come up with safety plans that comply with the yet-to-be written state standards and provide them to workers. Employers who don’t comply could face fines. Workers could also sue for up to $20,000 from employers who don’t follow safety standards or retaliate against workers for reporting noncompliance. The law was intended to help people like Maritza Ovalles, who has worked in the nail salon industry for over two decades but left her job when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and left her exposed in a workplace that she said lacked adequate health and safety protections. “When the pandemic began, the level of risk of not having proper protections was life or death,” said Ovalles, who advocates for better working conditions as a member of the NY Nail Salon Workers Association.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Public health officials across Western North Carolina are asking the public to get involved as they work to identify the most pressing health needs for the next three years, such as impacts from COVID-19, cancer or infant mortality. National research firm PRC will conduct phone surveys with 300 Buncombe County residents through June, a confidential survey asking about residents’ health status, behaviors and experiences, according to a statement announcing the start of data collection. The 20-minute surveys will go to randomly selected households, but even folks who don’t get the call can take the survey online at www.buncombecounty.org/publichealth. Buncombe County Public Health Director Stacie Saunders urged residents to take part. “If you receive the call to participate, please do lend your voice to the survey,” she said in the release. “This is your opportunity to help us identify health priorities in our community.” Buncombe is joining 17 other counties this year in the regional community health assessment, WNC Healthy Impact, a collaboration with hospital organizations, public health departments and other community partners.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The United Tribes Technical College International Powwow and associated events will return late this summer after a year’s hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Tribal Leaders Summit that’s traditionally held at the Bismarck Event Center before the outdoor powwow has been called off for a second year. The Bismarck Tribune reports this year’s powwow will be the weekend of Sept. 10-12, starting with the grand entry Friday night and continuing through Sunday. Associated events will include Powwow Youth Day that Friday, a golf tournament Friday, a three-day softball tournament and a three-day youth basketball tournament beginning Friday, and the Powwow Thunderbird Run on Saturday. The powwow put on by the five American Indian tribes in North Dakota typically brings about 10,000 people to Bismarck and boosts the area economy by more than $4 million, according to the college. It attracts dancers from dozens of tribes across the U.S. and Canada and awards more than $100,000 in prize money. It’s considered one of the top powwows in the nation. United Tribes uses proceeds to fund student scholarships.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: State lawmakers have passed changes to ensure that if Kroger is allowed to sell flowers during a pandemic, the local florist can, too. Senate Bill 134, also known as the Business Fairness Act, passed the Ohio Senate 31-0 on Wednesday. The measure would prevent Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration from closing small businesses while their larger competitors remain open, assuming everyone can follow the same safety guidelines. “I would argue you are safer in a small business where you may be the only customer in that business at that time,” Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester, said on the floor Wednesday. The disparity came to light in March 2020 when DeWine’s state health department closed a slew of businesses to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but allowed groceries, pharmacies and other businesses to remain open. The result: Wal-Mart and Kroger stayed open, while the local jeweler had to close. “The playing field must be level,” said Chris Ferruso, a lobbyist for Ohio’s National Federation of Independent Business. “The government should not be picking winners and losers.” And small businesses were among the losers last year. A survey of National Federation of Independent Business members found 1 in 3 closed because of COVID-19 orders.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new state law that creates a sales tax exemption for the University Hospitals Authority and Trust will grant OU Health funding to train more medical professionals. The law recently approved by the Legislature and Gov. Kevin Stitt restores a sales tax exemption that will allow the health system to train 160 additional nursing graduates and nurse practitioners annually and 70 additional medical residents within three years. State lawmakers and University of Oklahoma officials said the law will help address Oklahoma’s nurse and physician shortage and improve medical care across the state. Oklahoma has 40% fewer nurses per capita than the national average, said OU College of Nursing Dean Julie Hoff. “These nurses will soon be on the front lines of health care, allowing our facilities to increase their staffing levels and making it easier for everyone in the state to get the care they need,” she said. The state is 46th in the nation for physicians per capita, OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown on Tuesday announced statewide and county COVID-19 vaccination targets, with the hope of reopening the state’s economy. Most statewide restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents 16 and older receive their first vaccine dose, Brown said. In addition, counties will be eligible to move into the “lower risk” category when 65% of the area’s eligible population is vaccinated. “We still have some work to do to reach our 70% goal, but I am confident we can get there in June and return Oregon to a sense of normalcy,” Brown said. “We each play a part.” Currently, more than half the state’s eligible population has received a first dose. “For the first time since the start of the pandemic, we’ll be able to say the virus no longer controls the timelines in our lives – we will if enough Oregonians make the choice to get vaccinated,” said Pat Allen, the Oregon Health Authority’s director. Counties with 65% of their 16-and-up population inoculated will be eligible for the “lower risk” category, which permits indoor gatherings of 10 people or outdoor gatherings of 12 people. Restaurants, gyms and indoor and outdoor entertainment can open up to 50% capacity. Benton and Hood River counties have already vaccinated more than 65% of adult residents and are ready to move to the lower risk category May 21, unless they opt out.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is allowing more people at indoor and outdoor events. Beginning Monday, occupancy limits will be increased to 50% of capacity for indoor events, up from 25%, and to 75% for outdoor events, up from 50%. “As more Pennsylvania adults get vaccinated and guidance from the CDC evolves, we can continue to move forward with the commonwealth’s reopening efforts,” Gov. Tom Wolf said in a statement Tuesday. The state has previously announced that nearly all pandemic restrictions will go away on Memorial Day, including capacity limits on bars, restaurants and other businesses, as well as indoor and outdoor event gathering limits. The state’s mask mandate will remain until 75% of adults are fully vaccinated. Statewide, about 45.6% of people 18 and older had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Philadelphia, meanwhile, city officials announced pandemic restrictions will be eased beginning later this month and will go away almost entirely June 11. Starting May 21, retail stores and offices will no longer have to operate at reduced capacity, and the city is lifting its rule that bars and restaurants can only serve alcohol with food. Capacity limits on gyms, exercise classes and theaters will be eased, as well as for catered events.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: With no baseball team in town, McCoy Stadium is being put to good use with the opening of a vaccination clinic at the site on Wednesdays. The drive-up, walk-up site will be open every Wednesday from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m., according to a statement from the city. Residents can make an appointment for a COVID-19 shot at the state’s vaccine signup portal, but people without an appointment are also welcome and encouraged, city officials said. The goal is to make getting vaccinations as convenient as possible. “We want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to get a vaccine,” Pawtucket Public Health and Equity Leader Elizabeth Moreira said. “We believe that opening this site gives everyone another great option for vaccination appointments later on in the day.” The clinic will be run in partnership with the Rhode Island National Guard and Rhode Island Medical Reserve Corps Disaster Medical Assistance Team. The coronavirus testing site at the stadium will continue operating.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s public schools chief on Wednesday said the governor had no legal basis for allowing parents to opt their children out of wearing masks in schools, writing that Gov. Henry McMaster is “inciting hysteria and sowing division” as the school year ends. In guidance sent to state education superintendents Wednesday, education officials said the agency could find “no legal grounds” for the governor to set aside a policy instituted by another constitutional officer, under his or her own powers and not due to an emergency declaration. On Tuesday, the Republican governor issued an executive order letting parents opt their children out of wearing masks in public schools, citing widespread COVID-19 vaccine access for adults across the state. In response, education officials said state Superintendent Molly Spearman had opted to rescind a face-covering policy, with the exception of a federally instituted school bus mask mandate, “rather than wage a debate over constitutionality that would pit elected officials, students, and families against one another.” Guidance had required that students, teachers and staff wear face coverings while entering school buildings, moving through hallways and other instances where social distancing is not possible or optimal.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The South Dakota Department of Health said Wednesday that the state has crossed the 50% threshold for the percentage of adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Health officials say more than 304,000 residents have received their shots. “I want to take this opportunity to thank all South Dakotans who have chosen to get their COVID-19 vaccine– protecting themselves, their family and their community,” Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said. “Vaccines are safe and are the quickest way out of this pandemic.” State health officials began Phase 2 of South Dakota’s vaccination plan April 5. It made vaccines available to all residents age 16 and older, in addition to any eligible person who had not been inoculated in the first phase. Parents, schools and vaccine clinics are rushing to begin inoculating younger children after U.S. regulators this week endorsed Pfizer’s vaccine for those as young as 12, a decision seen as a breakthrough in allowing classroom instruction to resume safely around the country. A handful of cities started offering shots to children ages 12 to 15 less than a day after the Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine emergency use authorization for that age group.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: As she oversees the state’s response to the pandemic, Dr. Lisa Piercey knows getting back to normal may hinge on her ability to convince Christians and conservatives to get vaccinated. Piercey, 43, Tennessee’s top health official, is navigating a crisis of vaccine hesitancy that runs rampant in the rural swathes of the Volunteer State. “Being the hands and feet of Jesus is the way to go,” said Piercey, a 2019 appointee of Gov. Bill Lee. “They might not do it for themselves, but they should do it to help other people.” She said her office is unleashing a media campaign aimed partly at the people who are most hesitant, and she is reaching out to faith leaders to convince those residents on the virtues of vaccination. “It’s their pastor they trust,” Piercey said. And she’s confident the approach will work because she is one of them. An evangelical Christian farm girl from West Tennessee, Piercey said she doesn’t believe in evolution and struggles with the timelines of dinosaurs and man, but she still wears a mask around other people and has strict vaccination rules in her family. On May 20, the mother of four’s triplets will turn 16. “On that morning, they will get the vaccine first and their driver’s licenses second,” Piercey said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: With the coronavirus pandemic not yet licked, some activities will look a little different again this summer, including dips in the city’s beloved, “68-degrees-year-round” watering hole, Barton Springs Pool. Starting later this month, anyone planning a swim at Barton Springs will need to make an advance reservation online. Two-hour time slots will help the pool “to manage capacity for the safety of staff and guests,” according to the city’s website. Those who have purchased a season pass, are older than 80, are city employees, or are veterans or active military members will be allowed to enter the pool without a reservation, but that won’t apply to anyone accompanying them. At this time, Barton Springs Pool is not accepting group reservations. Reservations can be made on a city website. A reservation fee will cost Austin residents $2 if they’re between 1 and 11 years old, $3 for those 12-17, $5 for all adults and $2 for anyone over 61. For nonresidents, it’s $4 for those 1-11, $5 for those 12-17, $9 for all adults and $5 for anyone over 61. All payments must be completed online ahead of time. Those with a seasonal swim pass will also not need to reserve a spot ahead of time before visiting Barton Springs. Passes went on sale earlier this week.\n\nUtah\n\nRoy: A resident has said a hacker stole her personal information and swapped out her banking information to steal about $400 of weekly unemployment benefits. “I feel like being robbed at gunpoint would’ve been better than what’s going to happen now,” said Heidi Howell, who lost her job in March and had her identity and unemployment check stolen. Howell told KUTV-TV that she is now waiting to find out if she can still claim the unemployment check. She also froze her credit reports, filed a police report and changed her bank account numbers. Kevin Burt, director of the Utah Unemployment Insurance Division, said this is the first case he’s seen among 450,000 people seeking benefits in the state during the coronavirus pandemic. He believes the hacker got her login information from another website. “Make sure that you have a secure password,” Burt said. “I think that helps quite a bit – that’s different than your other passwords that you use for more casual online interactions.” Howell said she used a unique password and is not sure how someone gained access. Burt said the state has not seen much of a rise in hacks to the unemployment system, although fraud is up nationwide because of the historic volume of claims being filed.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A community group of members of the state’s minority populations is working to make sure as many of those residents as possible are vaccinated against COVID-19. The Vermont Health Equity Initiative said it will be providing vaccinations for those who are Black, indigenous and people of color through July 10. Clinics are being offered with support from the Vermont Department of Health and the City of Burlington. So far, the initiative has collaborated to deliver more than 2,800 total doses of the vaccine. The group said that as of Monday, about 70% of white, non-Hispanic Vermonters in Chittenden County had received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 58% of minority members had received at least one dose. The clinics were established in an effort to close the racial gap in vaccinations to protect the larger community and in response to the city of Burlington’s declaration of racism as a public health emergency in July 2020. “We’re offering an in-person experience that has been missing for vaccinations for these members of our community,” said Belan Antensaye of the Racial, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Department of the city of Burlington and the Vermont Professionals of Color Network.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Restaurants and drinking establishments will be able to seat up to 100 patrons indoors and a maximum of 250 guests outdoors starting May 15, Gov. Ralph Northam recently announced, but establishments say they may not be able to accommodate more guests due to a shortage in workers. Eric Terry, president of the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging & Travel Association, estimated about 100 Richmond restaurants closed in 2020 but said there have been minimal closures this year. Many restaurants are likely nearing 80% of their pre-pandemic revenue levels, according to Terry. While full recovery for the industry is underway, Terry said the biggest revenue factor is a restricted labor force. “I was on the phone yesterday with two restaurant operators who said they are having to close two days a week because they can’t get enough staff,” he said. The new limit will double the number of indoor guests allowed as of April 1. Restaurants may return to selling alcohol past midnight, and dining room closures between midnight and 5 a.m. will no longer be required. Northam has said all restrictions will be lifted June 15 if the number of new COVID-19 cases remains low and vaccinations rise. But restaurants with limited staff will not be able to accommodate diners at full capacity, Terry said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities say schools in the state won’t consider a requirement to mandate COVID-19 vaccines in schoolchildren until a vaccine is fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA on Monday signed off on emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. The state’s secretary of health, Umair Shah, said Tuesday that more than 370,000 Washington teens and adolescents are in that age group. Vaccines undergo rigorous review before they’re fully approved, but the FDA can allow use under so-called emergency use authorization in instances when vaccines meet certain criteria and there are no approved alternatives. The Seattle Times reports that until a COVID-19 vaccine is formally approved, officials from the Washington State Board of Health – the board that oversees state vaccine policies – say they won’t consider adding it to the list of required immunizations. “The board would not require a COVID-19 vaccine for school entry until it’s approved by the FDA and recommended by Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices,” Kelie Kahler, spokesperson for the board, wrote in an email, referring to a committee housed within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that sets national vaccine guidance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin is joining first lady Jill Biden and actor Jennifer Garner during a visit to the state Thursday. Biden’s office announced Wednesday that she and Manchin will arrive at Yeager Airport in Charleston before joining Garner at a COVID-19 vaccination center and delivering remarks at Capital High School. A previously announced visit to Arnoldsburg Elementary School in Calhoun County has been scrubbed due to a coronavirus quarantine in the school district. Biden and Manchin will then visit with members of the West Virginia National Guard and their families at the airport before departing, the first lady’s office said in a statement. Garner grew up in Charleston. She has previously testified before Congress in support of education programs for preschoolers in poverty.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Native Americans are struggling to overcome increased drug abuse related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a tribal leader said in the annual State of the Tribes address. Speaking to Assembly lawmakers at the state Capitol on Tuesday afternoon, Lac du Flambeau President John Johnson Sr. said increased drug abuse has claimed those most vulnerable during the public health crisis. “The flow of drugs into the Northwoods has escalated during the pandemic, as mental health, economic and social challenges exert growing pressure on our people and families,” Johnson said. He said Gov. Tony Evers’ budget proposal for a regional mental health center in northern Wisconsin is “a crucial building block and a foundation of dismantling the scourge of drugs,” Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Evers has proposed investing more than $150 million in mental health services, including more than $25 million over the next two years for regional crisis centers, training and other services. Republican state lawmakers have stripped hundreds of proposals from the governor’s budget. Johnson also said tribes continue to face harassment and racism as they defend their federal treaty rights to hunt, fish and gather. He specifically highlighted harassment of those spearfishing in northern Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The governor has announced that the state will end its participation in federal supplemental benefits intended to address high unemployment across the U.S. caused by the pandemic. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon said Tuesday that the decision will end the weekly $300 payments starting June 19 and no longer expand eligibility to people who previously could not collect benefits, such as self-employed residents, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Wyoming Department of Workforce Services reported last month that the unemployment rate in the state was 5.3% in March – below the national 6% rate. “Wyoming needs workers; our businesses are raring to go,” Gordon said. “I recognize the challenges facing Wyoming employers, and I believe it’s critical for us to do what we can to encourage more hiring.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/23/nuns-donate-home-canines-court-swine-control-news-around-states/118941372/", "title": "Nuns donate home, canines in court: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: Archaeologists are analyzing pieces of pottery, nails and glass found at Pope’s Tavern, an inn and stagecoach stop for travelers dating back to the early 1800s before Alabama achieved statehood. A state team funded by a grant recently conducted a dig at the northwest Alabama site, which has a museum that focuses on the history of the city of Florence. Museum curator Brian Murphy told the TimesDaily pottery was the most common item discovered during the work. “They pulled out a bunch of artifacts that are being cleaned and processed right now,” Murphy said. “They will give us a really good image of the types of materials and type of utensils used, and really a glimpse into the daily life of the people who lived there and used that space.” The crew also found the brick remains of an old structure that could have been a hearth or outbuilding, he said. “They are seeing what type of materials are associated with that, using flotation, which brings up microscopic material to a level that can be processed. After they do that, they’re going to get back to us with the larger picture of what it all means and what might be under there still that could be the source of a future excavation,” he said. Pope’s Tavern was built in the the 1830s, he said, and artifacts found on the grounds dated to the 1820s and ’30s.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials are aiming to make the first wave of dividend payments to state residents the week of Oct. 11, a Department of Revenue spokesperson said. Genevieve Wojtusik, the department’s legislative liaison, said in an email Wednesday that the first wave would include those who filed for dividends electronically. She said the second mass payments, which would include those who filed paper applications, would go out about two weeks later. The Legislature last week approved $730.5 million for dividends this year of about $1,100 and for administrative and other related costs. Wojtusik said the final check amount is being calculated and is expected to be announced by Oct. 1. Dividends typically are paid in the early fall, but this year’s payout wasn’t finalized until the third special session of the year, which ended last week. Lawmakers earlier this year proposed a roughly $1,100 dividend, using money from various sources, but failed to win sufficient support for use of some of the funds. What was left at that time was a dividend estimated to be $525, which Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: This year’s wet monsoon is contributing to a record-high season for the West Nile virus, which is spread through mosquito bites, health officials said. Arizona had 123 cases and four deaths through late last week, the state Department of Health Services said Tuesday. Nearly all of the cases were reported in Maricopa County, where the virus has been detected in record numbers of mosquitos studied, the department said. While most people infected with West Nile don’t get symptoms, older people and those with weakened immune systems are more prone to diseases that be fatal. Health officials recommend wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants to help prevent mosquito bites on arms and legs and eliminating standing water where mosquitos lay their eggs.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two men have been convicted of conspiring to kill a federal witness in 2016. A federal jury deliberated for about 61/ 2 hours before delivering the verdicts Tuesday against Donald Smith, 37, of Malvern, and Samuel Sherman, 38, of Batesville, in the shooting death of 44-year-old Suzen Cooper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Prosecutors alleged Smith, Sherman and Suzen Cooper’s former sister-in-law, Racheal Cooper, conspired to sell methamphetamine and cocaine, and Cooper was a confidential informant who had purchased meth from Sherman. Racheal Cooper was originally charged with capital murder in Hot Spring County but later pleaded guilty to a charge of hindering apprehension, for which she served five years of a 25-year sentence. Smith and Sherman face up to life in prison after being convicted of federal charges of witness tampering resulting in death, conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and aiding and abetting the use, carry and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. A sentencing hearing has not yet been set. Porter led the police to the grave site, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Gardner said. “Suzen Cooper’s body was exactly where Jimmy Porter said it would be,” Gardner said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Residents failed to significantly cut back their water consumption in July, state officials announced Tuesday, foreshadowing some difficult decisions for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration as a historic drought lingers into the fall. Newsom had asked people in July to voluntarily cut back their water consumption by 15% to help address a severe drought that has left some of the state’s reservoirs at dangerously low levels. But in the three weeks after Newsom’s announcement, residents reduced their water consumption just 1.8%, according to new data released Tuesday and reported by the Sacramento Bee. “On conservation, we’re going to be needing to do more,” board chair Joaquin Esquivel said. Still, Esquivel was hopeful the state’s conservation numbers will improve. Newsom declared a drought emergency in the Russian River watershed along the state’s north coast in April. Data from that region shows people reduced their water consumption by 17% in July compared to 2020. “We see that it takes time for conservation to boot up,” Esquivel said, adding that the 17% figure “shows the responsiveness of communities” to appeals for conservation. Dave Eggerton, executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, said the numbers “represent a promising start in reducing water use.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Criminal charges have been dropped in connection with the death of a spiritual leader whose mummified body was found in what appeared to be a shrine in a southern Colorado home, according to court officials. The body of Amy Carlson, 45, leader of the Love Has Won group, was found decorated with Christmas lights and glitter in the tiny, rural town of Moffat in April, according to previously released arrest affidavits. Seven people were charged with tampering with or abusing her corpse as well as child abuse, presumably because there were two children living in the home. Charges against six people were dropped during court proceedings, the Saguache County court clerk’s office said in an email Tuesday. It said no case existed for a seventh person who was among those charged with the others in May, though the office did not explain what happened in that case. It’s not known why the charges were dropped. Assistant District Attorney Alex Raines asked a judge to dismiss all the charges during a Sept. 14 hearing, the Valley Courier reports. Defense lawyers also requested that records be sealed, which was approved, it said. A telephone message left for Raines was not returned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Hundreds of unionized group home workers are threatening to walk off the job next month if settlements aren’t reached on new labor contracts. The New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, SEIU, delivered strike notices Tuesday to two private agencies – Whole Life Inc. and Network Inc. – that have about 70 locations across the state that could be affected. The union’s deadline for an agreement is Oct. 5. The threat of a strike, which would involve over 500 workers at group homes and day programs for people with developmental disabilities, comes more than three months after state officials authorized $184 million to increase wages and benefits for group home workers. The union said these remaining two operators have failed to settle on new agreements, despite the added funding. In July, a threatened strike by over 2,100 group home workers at 200 homes was called off after a late-night agreement for higher wages and improved benefits was reached with the Lamont administration’s help. “The State of Connecticut stepped up and provided funding that was adequate,” Rob Baril, the union president, said in a statement. “Now it’s time for these agencies to do the same: to provide people with pensions, affordable health insurance and enough wages that people can take care of their families.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A new law is expected to make it simpler for residents to use solar energy to power their homes through a community-centered program scheduled to start next year. To participate, customers can get credit on their electric bills by subscribing to a centrally located local community solar project, which can be cheaper than paying to install solar panels on their own roofs. Community-owned solar generation facilities have been legal in Delaware since 2010 but included some legal barriers such as requiring the facility to identify all its customers before being built. The bill by Sen. Stephanie Hansen, D-Middletown, removed some of those barriers to make it easier for people to take advantage of the fast-growing industry. Delaware hasn’t had the facilities in the past because the laws weren’t set up to accommodate them, Hansen said. The bill specifically changes regulations for solar facilities that will connect through Delmarva Power, the most prominent energy company in the state. Once facility owners get the green light, Delaware can expect to see the solar panel facilities popping up in open lands like Brownfield sites, undeveloped fields, or on top of parking lots or landfills, according to Hansen.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Artifacts from the racial injustice protests that erupted last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death are being preserved, and their protectors are hoping to find new homes for some of the mementos, WUSA-TV reports. As pro-Trump demonstrators repeatedly targeted a makeshift memorial at the barrier that separated Black Lives Matter Plaza from the White House, “fence guardians” sought to protect artifacts of the movement that shone a spotlight on police brutality against Black people. The Biden administration dismantled the fence earlier this year, but not before Nadine Seiler saved more than 700 mementos. “We were lucky that the Library of Congress took some pieces, and Howard University took some pieces,” Seiler said. “But the vast majority of the collection remained with us.” Hundreds of signs, photographs and pieces of artwork remain in her D.C. storage space. Seiler and fellow “fence guardian Karen Irwin are now finding homes for each item, asking interested businesses, nonprofits and organizations to contact them via Facebook. “Ideally, the Black Lives Matter community would like the pieces to stay in the hands of Black organizations,” Seiler said. “But personally, any organization that would give these treasures a safe home and recognize their value, they should reach out as well.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis named a UCLA doctor and health policy researcher who shares his approach to managing the coronavirus pandemic to serve as the state’s surgeon general Tuesday. Like DeSantis, Dr. Joseph Ladapo said he doesn’t believe in school closures, lockdowns or vaccine mandates. “Florida will completely reject fear as a way of making policies in public health,” Ladapo said. DeSantis said there’s been misinformation spread about COVID-19 to control personal behavior and mentioned monoclonal antibody treatment, claiming that while he’s been advocating it for months, others haven’t been pushing it as vocally. Doctors agree with DeSantis that the treatment, when delivered soon after infection, is effective. Lapado said vaccines aren’t the only way to combat COVID-19. “There’s nothing special about them compared to any other preventive measure,” he said, adding that people should be encouraged to lose weight, exercise more and eat healthier. And Lapado spoke out against lockdowns, saying that “after lockdowns, overall mortality increased ... lots of reasons why they’re bad.” On Wednesday, Ladapo signed new protocols allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school if they are asymptomatic after being exposed to someone with COVID-19. His new guidelines also tweaked the state’s prohibition against school mask mandates, prompting an administrative law judge to dismiss a lawsuit against the old rule that had been filed by various school boards.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Some of the people living in a homeless camp known as Cooterville say they’re skeptical of a new, government-sanctioned homeless camp planned for the community. The Cooterville encampment under CSX railroad tracks is set to be cleared by Nov. 12, with city leaders trying to time the ejections with the opening of the new camp where homeless will be allowed to stay legally. City officials are looking for an organization to head the government-sanctioned encampment, which will determine what it eventually looks like. The Athens-Clarke County Commission this summer selected a site for it at the North Athens School. Opponents have said they’re concerned it will attract more homeless people to Athens. But supporters say the new camp will come with services aimed at helping homeless people make the transition to permanent housing. In the Cooterville camp, some have expressed feeling left in the dark about the process are are unsure whether they will be secured a spot in the new camp. Oscar Sutton, who’s lived in Cooterville a couple of months, said he has no plans to move to the government-sanctioned encampment and worries about placing so many random people from the homeless community together. “It’s going to be chaos,” he said. “If I have to stay out here, I’ll just find somewhere to stay.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man who helped organize a group that opposes COVID-19 vaccines and mandates says he contracted the disease and now has regrets. Chris Wikoff told Hawaii News Now he helped start the Aloha Freedom Coalition last October, believing government shutdowns and mandates were threatening liberties and harming businesses. “They were talking about vaccine passports and vaccine mandates, and it seemed like it was over-the top totalitarianism and control,” Wikoff said. But then he and his wife contracted COVID-19. “We were told the COVID virus was not that deadly. It was nothing more than a little flu. I can tell you it’s more than a little flu,” he said. Wikoff was sent to a hospital on the west side of Oahu but transferred to a facility in Honolulu because hospitals were at or near capacity. “I was in a bed. I can’t move; I can’t breathe,” he recalled. “I was afraid I was going to die.” Wikoff is now considering getting vaccinated because his family and doctors recommend it. “Probably getting COVID again would be more dangerous than getting the reaction from the vaccines,” he said. Wikoff said he asked the Aloha Freedom Coalition to remove his name as a member on state business registration and is warning people not to attend large protests like the ones the group staged in front of Lt. Gov. Josh Green’s home. “Before I thought Josh Green was exaggerating the situation, and after my experience he sounds very rational to me,” he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Health care workers are exhausted and angry. COVID-19 vaccines are expiring because they have sat unused for so long. And coronavirus case numbers and deaths continue to climb, putting the state among the worst in the nation for the rate of new diagnoses. Idaho’s public health leaders painted a grim picture – again – during a weekly briefing Tuesday. The state continues to set records with 686 hospitalized COVID-19 patients as of Saturday, 180 of them in intensive care beds and 112 on ventilators, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Dave Jeppesen said. At the moment, there is no end in sight to the surge. The entire state entered “crisis standards of care” last week, officially allowing hospitals to ration health care as needed so that scarce resources can be directed to the patients most in need and most likely to survive. Urgent surgeries have been placed on hold, some patients are being treated in lobbies or field hospitals, and hospital administrators and doctors are desperately trying to shuffle the sickest patients to any facility that has enough open beds or ventilators to treat them. Over the weekend, physicians at one hospital nearly had to face “de-allocation,” in which one patient is taken out of an ICU bed to give it to someone with a greater chance of survival, said Dr. Jim Souza with St. Luke’s Health System.\n\nIllinois\n\nBeecher: A fire destroyed a historic church in Chicago’s far southern suburbs that had appeared in the 2002 film “Road to Perdition.” Officials said nearly a dozen fire departments responded, but by the time the flames were doused, St. Paul’s Lutheran Church was in ruins. No one was injured, and the cause of the fire is under investigation. Flames swept the church Sunday afternoon as members of the congregation were enjoying an Oktoberfest celebration in the parking lot. The building dates to 1865. “Yeah, it is devastating: The 150 years of the weddings and the funerals and the baptisms and all of that are gone. But the church still stands, the people; we still have our folk and our faith,” said the Rev. Michael Stein. The closest fire hydrant was approximately a mile away, prompting an effort to shuttle roughly 91,000 gallons of water to the rural location to extinguish the flames, officials said. The church appeared in Tom Hanks’s 2002 film “Road to Perdition,” WGN-TV reports. “My grandparents are buried there. It’s really sad seeing the church like this,” Beecher resident Zachery Wehling told the station. Stein said it’s an opportunity to rebuild. “It is a dark chapter, and a sad one, and we mourn it, and we grieve it … but we still look to Christ, and we find that hope to go on,” he said.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University said it has nearly 50,000 students this fall, a record fueled by a freshman class of about 10,200. Purdue said it was surprised by an increase in out-of-state students accepted for admission. Families and students told Purdue they were impressed by the school’s response to COVID-19. “Our focuses have been encouraging everyone to be vaccinated,” said Jay Akridge, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity. “We’re up over 83% of the campus (vaccinated). And then if you’re not, get tested,” he said. “And then students have been great about masking inside. … Just as they did last year, students have been very good about following that protocol.” Purdue was expecting 8,450 freshmen but greatly exceeded that number. Total enrollment is pegged at 49,639.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Dodge: Experts say a cyberattack on a northwest Iowa grain cooperative could signal Russian-linked groups are beginning to target smaller farm businesses in rural America as bigger companies tighten their security. The cyberattack on New Cooperative, a farm services business with headquarters in Fort Dodge, comes on the heels of a ransomware attack on the giant meatpacking company JBS in late May. JBS closed at least one Iowa pork processing plant as well as all nine of its U.S. beef plants before paying hackers $11 million in ransom. Cybersecurity experts say Russian-backed ransomware group BlackMatter is demanding a $5.9 million ransom from New Cooperative. New Cooperative acknowledged Monday that it had experienced “a cybersecurity incident” affecting some of the company’s “devices and systems.” The member-owned business said it’s using “every available tool and resource to quickly restore our systems.” The cooperative said it had notified law enforcement and was working with data security experts to “investigate and remediate the situation.” New Cooperative declined to say more about the attack Tuesday. Chad Hart, an Iowa State University agriculture economist, said “size really doesn’t matter” to hackers, who “are looking for any target that they think could be valuable.”\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: An organization run by rapper Jay-Z has filed a petition seeking records from the city’s police department related to what it calls a history of officer misconduct within the agency. The request was filed Monday in Wyandotte County District Court by Team Roc, the criminal justice division of Jay-Z’s entertainment organization, Roc Nation. The filing said the department has failed for decades to hold officers accountable for misconduct, including planting evidence, fabricating witnesses, and soliciting sex from victims and witnesses, The Kansas City Star reports. “And, thanks to the blue veil of silence and apparent failure to investigate serious allegations, little of it has come to light,” according to the petition. It alleges department officials refused to provide Team Roc with complaints filed against the department’s investigative division, reports or internal investigations against an officer who has a history of abuse allegations and policies relating to supervising detectives. The department responded in a statement that it has given hundreds of pages of documents to Team Roc but that the Kansas Open Records Act does not require the release of personnel records and criminal investigation files.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A drive-by shooting at a school bus stop Wednesday morning left a 16-year-old student dead and another hospitalized, police said. A third child was injured by unknown means as the youths waited at the bus stop just west of downtown Louisville, authorities said. A person in a car drove by and shot at the waiting students, some of whom were not injured, Louisville Metro Police Maj. Shannon Lauder said during a news conference. No suspects were in custody Wednesday afternoon. Police put a photo of a dark gray Jeep SUV on social media and asked for the public’s help in finding it. The vehicle had Illinois license tags, with the plate number BD91644. Mayor Greg Fischer said the shooting – the city’s 145th homicide this year – violated a “sacred space.” Police were working with the FBI and other agencies in investigating the shooting, Chief Erika Shields said Wednesday morning. The chief suggested the shooting could be gang-related, but she said she did not believe the victim was involved with gangs. The bus stop near the city’s downtown was for students of Eastern High School. Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio called the incident “one of the most difficult mornings of my career.” He said support is being provided to students and teachers at the school.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Smoke and flames shot up the side of the Superdome’s roof Tuesday after a pressure washer being used to clean the roof of the sports and entertainment arena caught fire. The New Orleans Fire Department confirmed firefighters responded to flames on the building’s roof shortly after 12:30 p.m. The fire appeared under control a short time later. New Orleans Emergency Management Services said on Twitter that it was transporting one person to the hospital for “minor burns.” Emergency officials called on people to stay away from the area. Crews were power-washing the roof to prepare it to be painted, officials said. “The fire was contained to the exterior gutter system surrounding (the) Superdome, and only a small area of the roof suffered minimal damage,” said a statement from the Louisiana Stadium and Expedition District, a state board that governs the dome, and ASM Global, which manages the Superdome. “Initial assessments suggest that damage is superficial and there appears to be no structural damage or impact to the integrity of the roof’s exterior skin. The building’s outer skin and roof remain watertight.” A photo posted on the city’s emergency management Twitter feed showed firefighters in the trench that separates the Superdome roof from an outer wall as they sprayed down the fire-blackened walls.\n\nMaine\n\nLebanon: Residents will vote on whether to recall several town leaders in a flap that grew out of the select board chairman’s decision to take a farmer’s pot plants. Farmer Eric Kelley accused Select Board Chairman Charles Russell Jr. and board member Ernest “Butch” Lizotte Jr. of swiping $100,000 worth of plants, knowing that the farmer was in jail. In addition, local animal control officers took his livestock. District Attorney Kathryn Slattery confirmed there was an investigation that focused on possible theft. But there was not enough evidence to prove the charges “beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said. Anger over the marijuana episode apparently served as a tipping point for a recall effort targeting Russell, Lizotte and another person who went to the farm that night. The recall also targets a third selectman who’s accused of missing half of this year’s meetings. Russell, who grows medicinal marijuana for household use, consulted for a local pot business and helped draft town marijuana ordinances, acknowledged to the Boston Globe that he pilfered Kelley’s marijuana plants. But he said he did it because he didn’t want the plants getting “into the hands of the wrong people” while Kelley was in jail. He called it a “public safety” matter.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: National Public Radio can air audio recordings from the trial of the gunman who killed five Capital Gazette newspaper employees in 2018, a federal judge has ruled in a case challenging the state’s ban on broadcasting court proceedings. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Bennett on Tuesday permanently barred the state of Maryland from enforcing its “broadcast ban” against NPR, which intends to use audio from the trial of Capital Gazette newsroom shooter Jarrod Ramos in an upcoming episode of its “Embedded” podcast. Bennett ruled it would be unconstitutional for Maryland to ban NPR from broadcasting recordings of the jury trial for Ramos’ criminal case. NPR’s challenge to the broadcast ban was limited to its use of recordings of Ramos’ court proceedings. In July, a jury rejected defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments and found Ramos criminally responsible for killing five people at the newspaper’s office in Annapolis. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole when Ramos is sentenced. The judge already had ruled in NPR’s favor after a hearing Sept. 13, issuing a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked the law’s enforcement against the radio network. Tuesday’s ruling granted NPR’s request for a permanent injunction.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group of high school students had to ride on a party bus complete with a stripper pole and neon lights during a recent field trip – an experience their teacher said highlights problems with the education system. Jim Mayers, an 11th grade Advanced Placement language and composition teacher at the Brooke Charter School in Boston, said in a since-deleted tweet that the original charter bus had fallen through, Masslive.com reports. “It is a funny story, but there actually is a real bus shortage, and it speaks to major flaws in our education system,” he said, adding that the field trip was a success. He is now using the attention he’s getting because of the original tweet to urge people to better understand educational inequities and other problems facing the nation’s schools. “I’m worried that there is too much attention being paid to the tweet itself, or simply the fact that it went viral, instead of attending to the many systemic issues that are facing not just my students, but students all across the country,” he wrote in a follow-up tweet. For example, districts across the nation are struggling to hire enough drivers to shuttle kids to school, and some states have become creative, including Massachusetts, which is enlisting National Guard members to drive school transport vans.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: Plans are underway for the state to construct a first-in-the-nation segment of road that will charge electric vehicles while they’re driving, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday at the Motor Bella auto show in Pontiac. Michigan’s Department of Transportation and the Office of Future Mobility and Electrification are partnering to make a 1-mile stretch of state roadway in Wayne, Oakland or Macomb counties to allow public transportation and private vehicles to charge while traveling as a part of the Inductive Vehicle Charging Pilot, according to a news release. “Michigan was home to the first mile of paved road, and now we’re paving the way for the roads of tomorrow with innovative infrastructure that will support the economy and the environment, helping us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050,” Whitmer said in the release. As electric vehicles advance, charging infrastructure has become a priority for Michigan cities that want to draw residents. The city of Saginaw got its first charging stations in September in the hope that those traveling in the east side of the state toward tourist areas in northern Michigan will stop because there is little electric vehicle infrastructure available at most destinations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Joseph: A small crowd of local business owners and community members gathered around a gray house near downtown Tuesday morning to kick off a project that would give a house used by the Sisters of the Order of St. Benedict a new life. Armed with sledgehammers, Sisters Dorothy Manuel and Karen Streveler posed for photographs outside the house as Habitat for Humanity volunteers in blue hard hats walked around the inside, ready to begin renovating the home that the sisters donated to the organization in December. Next summer a local family will move into the house, addressing a need for affordable housing in the area. “As volunteers and family members begin the kicking out the old to make room for the new and improved, we pray for the safety of all who participate in the renovation project and that everything gets accomplished in a timely manner,” Manuel said as she led a prayer in front of the home. “May this house truly become a home for the family and a blessing for their lives.” The Genesis House was built in 1926 and purchased by the sisters in 1950. It was used to accommodate lay staff from the College of St. Benedict in the past and later to house chaplains, Streveler said. Most recently, some of the sisters lived there for the past seven years.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The authors of the state’s 1890 constitution had racist intent when they stripped voting rights from people convicted of some felonies because they chose crimes they thought were more likely to be committed by Black people, an attorney argued Wednesday in a federal appeals court. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should overturn most of Mississippi’s felon disenfranchisement plan, attorney Donald B. Verrilli Jr. argued on behalf of people with felony convictions. The case could affect thousands who have lost voting rights. “Because the 1890 provisions were unconstitutional, they were invalid from the moment that they’re enacted,” Verrilli said. Attorneys representing the state said Mississippi dropped burglary from the list of disenfranchising crimes in 1950 and added murder and rape to the list in 1968. They said in written arguments that those changes “cured any discriminatory taint on the original provision.” The Mississippi Constitution strips voting rights from people convicted of 10 felonies, including forgery, arson and bigamy. The state attorney general issued an opinion in 2009 that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny, carjacking, felony-level shoplifting and felony-level bad check writing.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city’s police used force against Black people more than three times as often as on white people, according to a newly released study. The California-based, nonprofit research group Center for Policing Equity examined police report data from 2012 to 2019 and also found that in 9 out of 10 instances in which police pulled out a gun, it was at a Black civilian, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Even as the overall use of force dropped by 18%, police still used it more often against Black people, the report said. “What we typically hear from police officers is that use of force happens predominantly in areas with high crime,” said Hans Menos, vice president of law enforcement initiatives at the center. “So we try to control using neighborhood-level demographics, and even after controlling for that, the number (of Black people who have force used against them) is still higher.” Mayor Tishaura Jones said eliminating racial disparities in policing is key to making St. Louis safer for all of its residents. Outgoing Police Chief John Hayden said this kind of research can bring about scrutiny and questions about policing practices. “However, we embrace the challenge to do better and consider all suggestions from professionals, community stakeholders, and citizens,” Hayden said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: National Guard soldiers will assist hospitals with their COVID-19 response as the state struggles with a surge in infections, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Tuesday. A total of 70 soldiers will assist six different hospitals in Helena, Billings, Butte, Missoula and Bozeman. They will begin helping the hospitals either this weekend or next weekend, according to an announcement from the governor’s office. The Guardsmen will support staffing with nonmedical intensive care assistance, environmental services, patient data entry and coronavirus testing. Gianforte has stopped short of issuing any statewide mask or vaccine requirements even as some communities face record-high COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. “While we will not mandate them, vaccines are safe, they work, and they can save your life,” Gianforte said in a statement. The decision to mobilize the National Guard comes after Gianforte announced last week that 10 Guardsmen would begin assisting Billings Clinic, and seven additional Guardsmen would assist in the state lab. The state anticipates additional requests for Guard resources from several other hospitals, according to the governor’s office.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lawmakers remained at a stalemate Wednesday over how to draw new congressional and legislative maps despite a looming deadline that could force them to postpone the decision until next year and delay the May primary election. Lawmakers have until Saturday to advance both measures, or else Speaker of the Legislature Mike Hilgers has promised to end their special session, forcing them to resume the debate during their next regular session in January. Delaying the new maps until next year would force state officials to reschedule the primary and create major hassles for county election officials and candidates. At issue with the maps are accusations that Republicans and Democrats are trying to draw political boundaries in ways that benefit their party. Republicans enjoy a majority in the officially nonpartisan, one-house Legislature, but they don’t have enough votes to overcome a filibuster led by Democrats and some moderate Republicans, preventing them from forcing through their preferred map. Hilgers said lawmakers have made good progress toward an agreement, and he hoped to pin down specific concerns about the maps to try to reach a compromise so that lawmakers aren’t “just talking past each other.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In their first public opportunity to voice concerns on a proposal to let tech companies that meet certain requirements create semi-autonomous jurisdictions called Innovation Zones, officials from Storey County dressed down the idea in a line-by-line fashion. They called into question the motives of the company that wants to break away from its control. “While I’m sure many would prefer to have no independent government oversight, we don’t make laws based on what is convenient for just one party,” Storey County Commissioner Clay Mitchell told lawmakers Tuesday. Mitchell and other county representatives oppose a proposal backed by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak that would allow companies that promise a $1.25 billion investment and possess at least 78 square miles of land to apply to form the Innovation Zones. The zones would be governed by three county commission-like board members – two of whom would at first be nominated by the company. They would operate outside the jurisdiction of preexisting local government and eventually could create court systems, impose taxes and make zoning decisions. The company’s proposal has been met with opposition from skeptics of overly powerful tech companies, environmentalists and local officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Fall visitors to the Granite State are being asked to keep their tempers in check and their trash off the ground during their leaf peeping trips this year. With interest in outdoor recreation on the rise amid the coronavirus pandemic, state tourism officials last year launched a “Leave No Trace” campaign to remind visitors not to sully the state’s natural resources. This year, they added a new message – “Don’t Take New Hampshire for Granite” – to encourage visitors to be understanding about rules and respectful of other people and property. With foliage season just beginning, officials are again reminding visitors to show courtesy to workers and the environment alike. Fall is New Hampshire’s second-busiest tourism season, and state officials expect 3.2 million visitors to spend $1.4 billion this year, nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. Businesses still are struggling with workforce shortages and supply chain delays, said Mike Somers, president of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association. That, in turn, has led to an increase in rude and abusive customer behavior. “We’re really asking folks to plan ahead and have a little bit of patience and understanding,” he said. “Just call ahead, find out what the hours of operation are, and please don’t get upset if we’re not open until 11 o’clock at night.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Liquor stores, bars and restaurants are all having trouble stocking their shelves with enough wines, beers and spirits, thanks to COVID-19’s impact on supplies, along with heat waves and frosts that damaged crops. “It’s not just one thing that’s causing the liquor shortage,” said Joe Ringwood, manager of Super Cellars, a fine wine and spirits shop in Ridgewood. It’s a shortage of truck drivers, a scarcity of aluminum, a shutdown of factories, a dearth of containers, extreme weather, tariffs or a lack thereof, and even the greater demand by consumers for premium liquor. “Some of it is directly related to the pandemic,” Ringwood said. “But not all of it.” And it’s not just one category of liquor that’s gone missing. What is in short supply seems to change from month to month, if not week to week. Last year, liquor store owners said, they had trouble getting canned beers, amid a shortage of aluminum. Today, bottled beers and top-shelf tequilas are in particularly short supply. “Every week it’s something else,” said Kathy Mahon, bar manager for Park West Tavern in Ridgewood. Paul Santelle, executive director of the New Jersey Liquor Store Alliance and owner of Garden State Discount Liquors in Perth Amboy, said he has begun to ration over a hundred items so more people will be able to enjoy them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A coalition of Native American communities has unveiled its proposal for redrawing the state’s political map to boost Indigenous voters’ influence in elections. The proposed changes from New Mexico’s 19 Native American pueblos and the Jicarilla Apache Nation, outlined Monday, would reshape a congressional swing district where Republicans regained control in 2020. They would also bolster Native American majorities among eligible voters in six state House and three Senate districts in northwestern New Mexico. The proposals were submitted to a committee that will provide recommendations to the Legislature at the end of October. The Democrat-led Legislature can draw its own lines. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham must approve the redistricting, and court challenges are possible. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, and the share of New Mexicans who identify themselves as Indigenous by race or by combined ancestry is 12.4%. Four Indigenous tribes have joined together for the first time to form a stronger voting bloc within one Senate district that might unite Acoma, Laguna, Isleta and Zuni pueblos. Other proposed changes would split the Mescalero Apache reservation between two congressional districts, in hopes of expanding that tribe’s voice in Congress.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Four members of Congress from New York demanded the release of inmates and closure of New York City’s troubled Rikers Island jail complex after another inmate was reported dead at the facility. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jerry Nadler, Jamaal Bowman and Nydia Velazquez called conditions at the jail “deplorable and nothing short of a humanitarian crisis,” in a letter Tuesday to Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Bill de Blasio. The demand followed the 11th death reported at Rikers Island this year. The city’s Department of Correction said an inmate died Sunday at the jail after reporting he did not feel well and was taken to the infirmary. His death came on the heels of both Hochul and de Blasio announcing plans to try to improve conditions at Rikers Island, where long-standing troubles were exacerbated amid the pandemic. The House members said the jail has failed to provide inmates with basic services and protection against the spread of COVID-19, and lawmakers on a recent visit to the facility found conditions that were “life-threatening and horrific.” They reported overflowing toilets and floors covered in dead cockroaches, feces and rotting food. State Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas said inmates told her they felt like they were being treated like slaves and animals.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: People attending the 2021 N.C. State Fair won’t be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but it’s strongly encouraged, officials said. Also, those going to the fair, which begins Oct. 14, will be required to use clear plastic bags upon entering, and officials say there will be no indoor concerts at this year’s event – a decision they said has nothing to do with the pandemic. A statement from fair officials said any size or type of clear bag is acceptable. Wristlets, diaper bags and medical equipment bags will be accepted at the fair even if they are not clear, but they will require additional inspection. In addition, officials said there will be no concerts inside Dorton Arena. That room will be reserved for vendors. “Moving the vendors, displays and cheesemakers into Dorton Arena will offer a larger space to include more vendors and provide more space for consumers to sample featured products and shop for their favorites,” state Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said in a statement.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The head of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is asking a federal agency overseeing the environmental review of the Dakota Access oil pipeline to cut ties with a contractor conducting the analysis, citing a conflict of interest. Chairman Mike Faith and other tribal leaders fighting the pipeline sent a letter Wednesday to a top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official, taking issue with Environmental Resources Management, the company doing the review, and its ties to the oil industry, the Bismarck Tribune reports. One of the tribes’ concerns is that the London-based company is a member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group that lobbies for the oil industry and has submitted court briefs supporting Dakota Access. Meanwhile, the company that operates the Dakota Access pipeline has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse an appellate ruling ordering additional environmental review, saying it puts the line at risk of being shut down. Texas-based Energy Transfer operates the $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile pipeline. Faith said in a statement that the request by the pipeline operator “is part of an ongoing attempt to “evade accountability.” The pipeline began operating in 2017, after being the subject of months of protests during its construction.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: The city plans to demolish the 129-year-old historic building that once was the site of the Wright brothers’ first bike shop because the building has deteriorated to a point where it can no longer be maintained and redeveloped. The shop was first built in 1892 to serve as the Wrights’ first bike shop. Soon thereafter, Gem City Ice Cream Co. bought the property and was housed there until it closed in 1975, when the building was sold to another company, the Dayton Daily News reports. Years after a wide array of owners, the city attempted to sell the rundown property to developers, but it failed inspection tests. The building was deemed structurally damaged and in danger of collapse. City officials also attempted to receive approval to bulldoze the property but did not move forward after hearing community concerns, Daytons Landmark Commission staff report said. But multiple inspections in 2019 concluded the building can’t be saved. City staff and nuisance abatement specialists said the building needs to be removed, the report said. This isn’t the first of the Wright brothers’ bike shops to be torn down in Ohio. Their second and third bike shops were torn down, but the fourth is a national historic site in the Wright Dunbar District, according to the newspaper.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to control feral swine eating their way across fields might seem as futile as trying to catch a greased pig – the hogs are known to destroy crops and land for farmers, who say the animals aren’t picky eaters and will consume just about anything they find growing. But an influx in federal dollars creating pilot eradication projects across broad areas of the state and a new pesticide introduced this month are making the fight just a little more fair for farmers, ranchers and regulators. The two feral swine control pilot projects, paid for by about $3.6 million in federal dollars allocated through the 2018 Farm Act, have combined tracking efforts with hunting and trapping activities across multiple counties in northern and southwestern Oklahoma to blunt swine activity in those areas. The manufacturer of the new pesticide, called HogStop, claims it can decrease the fertility of male swine and help cut rapid reproduction rates for the animal. It was approved for use by the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food & Forestry this month. Any and all tools to fight the infestation are welcome, as feral swine damage across the state has cost landowners hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A broken power-sharing deal, the lingering possibility of a Republican walkout and a COVID-19 case are adding greater uncertainty to whether legislators will successfully redraw the state’s political districts ahead of a tight deadline. Stakes are high as Oregon gained a new, sixth U.S. House seat following the latest census. Lawmakers were told the House would reconvene Wednesday following news Tuesday that someone in the building had tested positive for the coronavirus. But House Speaker Tina Kotek now says the chamber won’t convene until Saturday to give time for those potentially exposed to the virus to be tested and receive results. Democrats say their entire caucus in the House has been vaccinated. The number of vaccinated Republican lawmakers was not immediately available. When the House reconvenes Saturday, lawmakers will have just two days to vote on and pass new political boundaries. If congressional maps are not passed by Sept. 27, the task will fall to a panel of five retired judges appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court. House Republicans showed signs of a possible walkout this week after Kotek, a Democrat, rescinded a power-sharing deal to redraw political maps that she made with the House GOP as Republicans used delaying tactics to block bills during the 2021 legislative session.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Supreme Court is saying yes to canines in the courtroom, under certain conditions. A trial witness may be accompanied by a “comfort dog” if the animal will help yield reliable, complete and truthful testimony, the justices ruled Wednesday in a precedent-setting opinion that established a “balancing test” for Pennsylvania judges confronted with such a request. Ruling unanimously in a murder case, the Supreme Court pointed to other states that allow witnesses to testify with the help of emotional support dogs. The justices said it’s permissible, as long as steps are taken to minimize any potential harm to a defendant. “Trial courts have the discretion to permit a witness to testify with the assistance of a comfort dog,” Chief Justice Max Baer wrote for the court. “In exercising that discretion, courts should balance the degree to which the accommodation will assist the witness in testifying in a truthful manner against any possible prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” The defendant, Sheron Purnell, was convicted of third-degree murder and sentenced to up to 47 years in prison. Purnell’s lawyers argued a judge abused his discretion by allowing a comfort dog to accompany a teenage witness who testified against Purnell, with the defense saying that would “generate sympathy” among jurors for the girl.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Health officials are allowing a little leeway to a state mandate that requires health care workers to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by Oct. 1. State Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott announced Tuesday that unvaccinated workers will be allowed to continue working beyond that date if their absence would jeopardize quality of care at a facility. “If there is a risk to quality of care and an unvaccinated worker must continue to work beyond October 1 to mitigate that risk, the employer has 30 days to ensure that role is fulfilled by a fully vaccinated health care worker,” she said in a statement. The change was made to “safeguard patients, residents, and staff by holding health professionals and facilities accountable to the October 1 vaccination requirement, while also preventing disruptions to care in Rhode Island as health care facilities work toward full compliance,” she said. According to the latest state survey, 87% of health care workers in Rhode Island are vaccinated. Many of the state’s nursing homes had expressed concern about the Oct. 1 deadline, saying it would put additional strain on facilities already struggling with staffing shortages.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A tent has been pitched at Prisma Health’s Greer Memorial Hospital to provide additional triage and treatment space, according to a spokesperson for the health system. The 40-by-80-foot tent was erected over the weekend by the South Carolina State Guard but has not yet been activated to provide treatment, according to a statement from a representative of the health system. Prisma spokesperson Sandy Dees said the tent is part of efforts at Prisma emergency departments in the Upstate to “proactively ‘surge up’ and create additional space to treat patients as needed.” Prisma did not respond to a question about the occupancy of its hospital in Greer. “We’re here to take care of our communities and that means taking the necessary steps to ensure we’re ready when and if those additional resources are needed,” Dr. Matthew Bitner, chair of emergency medicine at Prisma Health in the Upstate, said in the statement. “From a traditional ‘all-hazards’ approach, we are preparing not only for COVID patients but also the everyday emergencies such as trauma, heart attack, strokes, illness and injuries.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization projects more children will go hungry in South Dakota this year and won’t know where their next meal is coming from. Feeding America said the state’s child food insecurity rate for 2021 will be 16.3%, up from 15.3% in 2019. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as reduced food intake, disruptive eating, and decreased quality and variety in diets. The USDA recently reported a national trend of increasing food insecurity, which rose to 14.8% in 2020. “I think it is really concerning,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign, a national initiative to end child hunger. “Children who face hunger generally have worse health impacts on their physical and brain development. … They don’t do well in school, they graduate at lower rates, and those consequences for kids literally last a lifetime.” Before the coronavirus pandemic, food insecurity was at its lowest rate since USDA started tracking it in the late 1990s. But the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on food access to households with young children, households of children headed by single women, and households of color, specifically Black and Hispanic, Davis said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials are asking the public to pick their favorite of four redesign options for new license plates that will be available starting in January. Gov. Bill Lee’s office said voting began Monday and runs through Sept. 27 at tn.gov/ratetheplates. The new design will replace the current plate that launched in 2006, with modifications in 2011, 2016 and 2017. State law includes a redesign every eight years if lawmakers approve funding for it. Tennessee law also requires the words “Tennessee,” “Volunteer State” and “TNvacation.com” to be on the plate, and it lets Tennesseans pick an “In God We Trust” option. The winning design of the primarily white and deep-blue options will be announced in the fall.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: After serving as interim police chief for the capital city since March, Joseph Chacon was named Wednesday as the permanent choice for the top spot. City Manager Spencer Cronk announced the appointment of Chacon, whose career with Austin police has spanned more than 20 years, after a nationwide search for a new chief. Chacon has been interim police chief since the retirement of former Chief Brian Manley amid a reckoning over racial injustice and use of force in law enforcement. Chacon, who served as assistant chief in Austin for almost five years before being named interim chief, said he was “extremely excited and humbled” by the opportunity. Chacon’s appointment must still be confirmed by the City Council, which is set to place an item on the appointment on next week’s agenda. Manley, chosen to lead the department in 2018, had been at the center of ongoing criticism following a fatal police shooting in April 2020 of a man driving away from officers and controversial uses of force by officers during protests over the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May 2020.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced Wednesday that masks will be required inside temples to limit the spread of COVID-19. Church leaders said in a statement that masks will be required temporarily in an effort to keep temples open. The message was the latest in a series of statements from church leaders encouraging masking and vaccination efforts against COVID-19. “As cases of COVID-19 increase in many areas, we want to do everything possible to allow temples to remain open,” the church said in a statement. “Therefore, effective immediately, all temple patrons and workers are asked to wear face masks at all times while in the temple.” In Utah, where the church is based, a summer surge of the coronavirus among unvaccinated residents has continued to grow, while vaccination rates have slightly increased. Data from the Utah Health Department showed that in the past 28 days, state residents who are unvaccinated have been 5.9 times more likely to die from COVID-19 and 7.2 times more likely to be hospitalized than those who are vaccinated. About 64% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, state data shows. Utah reported 25 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,829.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont State Police has its first director of mental health programs to help coordinate and oversee the delivery of mental health services to people who come into contact with state police, officials said. Mourning Fox, who was deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Mental Health for the past four years and has more than 25 years of experience in the field, was named to the position, the Department of Public Safety and state police announced. “This is a crucial position within the Department of Public Safety and for the Vermont public safety community as we pursue short-, medium- and long-term goals with respect to mental health response and reimagining policing and safety services,” DPS Commissioner Michael Schirling said in a statement. Fox, who joined the department Aug. 30, will work with the state police’s 10 barracks and the Department of Mental Health to complete hiring. He will also ensure that each field station has at least one embedded mental health crisis specialist and that training is consistent, officials said. In the long term, he’ll help the Public Safety Department reimagine how police provide services to people who may be experiencing a mental health or substance use disorder crisis or have other unmet social service needs, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A year and a half into the coronavirus pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission is still swamped with backlogged claims, its call centers are underperforming, and serious staffing problems persist, according to a scathing interim report the state’s legislative watchdog agency presented to lawmakers Monday. The agency’s staff undertook its review after the employment commission came under harsh scrutiny from lawmakers and the public for what by some measures is a worst-in-the-nation response to the surge in jobless claims. Thousands of Virginians have faced lengthy delays while waiting for benefits, and many have been unable to reach anyone for help or information about their case. “While operating in the extremely challenging public health environment created by COVID was understandably difficult … meaningful actions could have been taken sooner to respond to the public’s needs,” said Hal Greer, director of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s secretary of labor, Megan Healy, oversees the employment commission and defended its performance. Although she agreed the agency was not prepared for the pandemic, she argued to lawmakers that the root of the problem was a complicated federal funding formula that has long left the agency starved for resources.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Three new buildings with 165 studio apartments that were supposed to be rented at market rates will instead house people leaving homelessness and people at risk of becoming homeless. The nonprofit Low Income Housing Institute will buy the buildings on Capitol Hill for about $50 million, with city and state housing programs sharing the cost equally, The Seattle Times reports. Seattle is using federal COVID-19 relief funds for its part, Mayor Jenny Durkan said. Two of the buildings will be managed by LIHI for adults. The third will be managed by YouthCare for young adults. Each will have a live-in case worker, said Sharon Lee, LIHI’s executive director. The deals will house people quickly and cheaply, relative to the time and cost required to develop low-income projects from scratch, Durkan said. The three buildings should be occupied by the end of the year, according to the city. “This is the fastest we have ever brought housing online,” Lee said. Tent encampments in parks and greenbelts have grown in Seattle during the coronavirus pandemic partly because the city has lacked shelter and housing spots, Durkan said. LIHI will move people into the buildings from tiny house villages it manages for the city, which should open more of those houses for people living on the streets, Lee said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLewisburg: Gov. Jim Justice has withdrawn from consideration as the coach of a boys basketball team at a high school where he already is the girls coach and where he’d already faced rejection for the job. In a letter to the Greenbrier Board of Education on Tuesday, Justice asked that a boys coach be named soon at Greenbrier East High School, with practices for the 2021-22 season starting in a month. Last month the board rejected a motion to hire Justice as boys coach. The board is looking to replace former NBA player Bimbo Coles, who resigned in July. “We need to move forward,” Justice said. “Pick a coach. The kids deserve that, and I wish them all the success.” Justice served as the boys coach from 2010 to 2017, his first year as governor. He has coached the girls team since 2000, winning a state championship in 2012. Justice’s second term as governor runs through 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Workers reinstalled two statues Tuesday on the state Capitol grounds that protesters ripped down during a demonstration last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Workers reinstalled a 9-foot-6-inch statue of Wisconsin abolitionist Col. Hans Christian Heg as well as a 7-foot statue of a woman symbolizing the state’s “Forward” motto. The statues have no associated racist history, but protesters said they represented a false narrative that Wisconsin supports Black people and racial equity. Demonstrators toppled both statues in June 2020, breaking off Heg’s leg and head. The “Forward” statue was dented and one of its fingers broken off. The demonstration was among several that shook downtown Madison in the days after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Floyd, who was Black and handcuffed, died after white police Officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Heg, a Norwegian immigrant who became an outspoken abolitionist, served in the 15th Wisconsin Regiment during the Civil War. He was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863. His statue, funded by the Norwegian Society of America, had stood outside the Capitol since 1926. The “Forward” statue was a bronze replica of the one that represented Wisconsin at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Rescue crews recovered the body of a 67-year-old man and searched around a lake Tuesday for his half-brother after the pair failed to return from a backcountry canoe trip. A 10-person ground crew was walking the shoreline of Shoshone Lake looking for Kim Crumbo, a 74-year-old former Navy SEAL from Ogden, Utah, Yellowstone officials said. A helicopter from nearby Grand Teton National Park was helping in the effort. Rescuers found the body of Mark O’Neill of Chimacum, Washington, on Monday along the eastern shore, where a canoe, paddle, flotation device and other items were found Sunday. A vacant campsite was found on the south side of the lake. A family member reported the two experienced boaters and former National Park Service employees overdue from their four-night trip Sunday. Shoshone Lake covers 13 square miles and has an average temperature of about 48 degrees Fahrenheit, with survival time estimated to be only 20 to 30 minutes in such cold water, officials said. The lake also can be subject to high winds and sudden storms. Drowning is one of the top causes of death in Yellowstone, behind car and snowmobile accidents and illness, park historian Lee Whittlesey wrote in his book “Death in Yellowstone.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/22/replanting-cacti-muscogean-heritage-joe-exotic-news-around-states/50763453/", "title": "Replanting cacti, Muscogean heritage, Joe Exotic: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A corrections officers has been placed on leave after a video surfaced that appears to show him beating a distressed inmate who had climbed to the edge of a roof. The video, circulating on social media, shows a seemingly distressed inmate on the edge of a roof at a building at Elmore Correctional Facility, while a group of prison staff look at him from the ground. An officer walks across the roof and drags the inmate back from the edge, then appears to punch him several times. Officer Ell White has been placed on mandatory leave pending investigation, a spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in an email. The prison system said Jimmy K. Norman, a 44-year-old inmate, “had climbed on top of the facility chapel, prompting Officer White and other correctional officers to attempt to escort Norman off the roof.” The Law Enforcement Services Division of the Alabama Department of Corrections is investigating the incident and response by staff, the prison system said. The U.S. Department of Justice has an ongoing civil lawsuit against Alabama over conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from staff and other incarcerated men and calling the system one of the most understaffed and violent in the country, violating the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Nearly every single Alaskan got a financial windfall amounting to more than $3,000 Tuesday, the day the state began distributing payments from its investment fund that has been seeded with money from the state’s oil riches. The payments, officially called the Permanent Fund Dividend, amounted to $2,622 – the highest amount ever. Alaska lawmakers added $662 as a one-time benefit to help residents with high energy costs. A total of $1.6 billion in direct deposits began hitting bank accounts Tuesday, and physical checks will arrive later for those who opted for them. Residents use the money in various ways – buying big-screen TVs, vehicles or other goods; using it for vacations; or putting it in savings or college funds. In rural Alaska, the money can help offset the enormous costs of fuel and food, like $14 for a 12-pack of soda, $4 for a celery bunch and $3 for a small container of Greek yogurt. “We’re experiencing record high inflation that we haven’t seen since the first PFD was paid in 1982,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a video. The timing of the checks couldn’t have come at a better time for those living on the state’s vast western coast, which was devastated over the weekend by the remnants of Typhoon Merbok. Damage to homes and infrastructure was widespread along 1,000 miles of coastline.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Wildfires torching areas of the state are threatening the Sonoran Desert’s iconic saguaro cacti, in turn threatening the lives of the birds and other wildlife that depend on them. To help replace the many saguaros burned in wildfires, the Tucson Audubon Society is launching a three-year restoration and replanting project that will bring approximately 14,000 saguaros to southern Arizona. According to the Tucson Audubon, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats, 100 species of animals use saguaros, including bats, birds, mammals and insects, while 14 species of birds nest in saguaro cactus cavities, including elf owls, pygmy owls and desert purple martins, among others. Saguaros are like apartment buildings of wildlife activity. Bats feed on the nectar of the flowers sprouting at the top of the saguaro, while in other parts of the plant, bird species live inside cavities carved by other birds. Then, as food sources become scarce later in the summer, animals and insects will feed on the saguaro’s fruit, according to the National Park Service. The entire project will receive an initial investment of $300,000 that will be given to the organization over the next three years from the Wildlife Conservation Society. The project also will receive U.S. Forest Service grants for about $209,000 for post-burn fire recovery in areas torched during the Bighorn fire that occurred in the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Bush fire that occurred in the Tonto National Forest in 2020.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The owner of an alternative-meat purveyor is accused of biting a human nose after a Razorbacks football game. Beyond Meat Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey was arrested over the weekend after a physical altercation in a parking garage following a University of Arkansas football game. Ramsey, 53, was charged with terroristic threatening and third-degree battery Saturday, according to booking records at the Washington County Jail. He was released Sunday on $10,000 bond. According to the preliminary campus police report obtained by local Arkansas television station KNWA/Fox 24, a road rage altercation saw Ramsey punch through the back windshield of another man’s Subaru in the parking garage after the vehicle made contact with the front tire of Ramsey’s car. According to the preliminary report, once the Subaru owner got out of the vehicle, Ramsey punched him repeatedly and bit his nose, “ripping the flesh on the tip of the nose.” The man also claimed Ramsey threatened to kill him. A responding police officer found “two males with bloody faces” at the garage just outside Razorback Stadium after the game against Missouri State. Occupants of both vehicles got out to help separate the two men. Ramsey was named Beyond Meat’s COO in December after spending three decades at Tyson Foods.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Supervisors in the city voted Tuesday for a trial run allowing police to monitor in real time private surveillance cameras in certain circumstances, despite strong objections from civil liberties groups alarmed by the potential impact to privacy. San Francisco, like many places across the country, is struggling to balance public safety with constitutional protections. The ability to monitor in real time was requested by San Francisco Mayor London Breed and supported by merchants and residents who say police officers need more tools to combat drug dealing and retail theft that they say have marred the city’s quality of life. It is temporary and will sunset in 15 months. The vote was 7-4, with some supervisors astonished that the governing board of politically liberal San Francisco would consider granting more powers to law enforcement in a city that celebrates its activism. Others pushed back, saying they were tired of sophisticated criminal networks taking advantage of San Francisco’s lax attitude toward retail theft and other property crimes. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, a privacy advocate who successfully passed legislation in 2019 to ban the use of facial recognition software by San Francisco police and other city departments, said they worked hard to negotiate safeguards, including strict reporting requirements when live monitoring was used.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: An attorney for a state lawmaker has asked El Paso County prosecutors to dismiss a felony charge that he voted outside the district he lives in and represents in 2020, citing incorrect information presented to a grand jury before his indictment. Dan Kaplan, an attorney for Democratic state Sen. Pete Lee, filed a motion to dismiss Tuesday, saying the wrong residency information was provided to prosecutors by the state Office of Attorney Registration, The Colorado Sun reports. The office told prosecutors of the mistake last week, and the El Paso County District Attorney’s Office is reviewing the case, spokesman Howard Black said. Lee, whose website says he practiced law for 25 years, chairs the state Senate Judiciary Committee. He was indicted in August. “We believe that the erroneous information would have resulted in no indictment being issued,” said Lee, who previously denied any wrongdoing. The felony charge carries a possible penalty of one to three years in prison and a possible fine of up to $100,000. Lee’s next court hearing is set for Oct. 18. Lee is not seeking a second term in November’s election after being elected to represent his El Paso County district in 2018. He previously served in the House.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Two parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre and the daughter of the school’s slain principal testified Wednesday of the fear and pain they have suffered from being targeted with threats by those who believe the lie that the shooting was a hoax. David Wheeler, Jennifer Hensel and Erica Lafferty are among those suing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for promoting the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his media platforms, including his Infowars web show. The plaintiffs, who gave often emotional testimony, say Jones’ promotion of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his show led the them being threatened by deniers of the shooting, including some who claimed their loved ones never existed. They say they’ve endured death threats and in-person harassment, video recording by strangers and abusive comments on social media. Some families moved to avoid harassment. “There are days when grief is just so awful,” said Hensel, whose 6-year-old daughter, Avielle Richman, was among those slain. “Then you add on the idea that people think you made all this up for money or that your child didn’t exist. That compounds everything.” One of the jurors wept as Hensel testified and was comforted by another panel member.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A judge ruled Monday that the Port of Wilmington’s financially ailing operator must pay a ship loading company more than $28million – an amount that piles onto a string of hefty bills already weighing on a company with operations that generate thousands of jobs in the state. The ruling - a $21.5 million payment, plus interest - comes four years after Delaware privatized the port through a 50-year lease with Gulftainer, a shipping and logistics company based in the United Arab Emirates. As state officials negotiated the lease in early 2018, they also pressured Gulftainer and Murphy Marine Services – a local ship loading company already doing business at the port – to combine operations, according to court documents. The companies obliged but ultimately could not agree on a price that Gulftainer’s local subsidiary, GT USA Wilmington, should pay to take over the smaller operation. At the time, Murphy Marine wanted roughly $26 million. Gulftainer officials saw the company as far less valuable. The dispute quickly became hostile, and the next month Murphy Marine filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, claiming Gulftainer’s officials had carried out “bulldogged” efforts to strip it of millions of dollars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A 44-year-old man was arrested after allegedly using paint to vandalize the Washington Monument on Tuesday evening, WUSA-TV reports. According to a statement from the United States Park Police, the man defaced an area at the base of the monument. The National Mall landmark is temporarily closed. National Park Service conservators are working on restoring the monument but say that process could take several weeks. Locals and tourists came out to the monument to see the vandalism. Reactions to the painted message were mixed. “No matter what people think and feel, they have no right to destroy historical property like this,” one woman said. “I don’t know how someone could just walk up and completely vandalize the Washington Monument, of all things,” a man said. “Not that I support this, but I understand that sometimes you got to make a statement,” one woman said. Mike Litterist of the National Park Service said crews were on site Wednesday morning to begin the cleanup process. Park Police identified the man arrested as Shaun Ray Deaton, of Bloomington, Indiana. Deaton was charged with trespassing, tampering and vandalism. Police said it was an initial criminal charge, and as the investigation continues, there may be additional charges.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz refused to step down Monday, rejecting a motion by his attorneys who accused her of being biased against their client and prejudicing the jurors who will decide if he should die for murdering 17 people four years ago. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer denied the motion, saying only that it was legally insufficient. Scherer last week chewed out lead defense attorney Melisa McNeill and her team outside the jury’s presence, accusing them of being “unprofessional” when they unexpectedly rested their case after only about 25 of the 80 witnesses they had told her and prosecutors they intended to testify had been called. The defense said in court documents filed last week that those comments and ones the judge later made to the jury were “the zenith of the cumulative disdain” they allege Scherer has shown throughout the case toward Cruz and themselves. The defense had no obligation to call all its proposed witnesses or notify the judge or prosecution when they planned to rest, legal observers have said. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Scherer’s comments didn’t rise to the level of demonstrating bias against Cruz. They cited a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says a judge’s “expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance and even anger” against the defense are not grounds for stepping down.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: If approved by Congress after a three-year federal review wraps up this fall, mounds built by Muscogean people who were forcibly removed from their homeland 200 years ago would serve as the gateway to a new Ocmulgee National Park and Preserve, protecting 54 river-miles of floodplain where nearly 900 more sites of cultural or historic significance have been identified. Efforts to expand an existing historical park at the mounds site are in keeping with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s “Tribal Homelands Initiative,” which supports fundraising to buy land and requires federal managers to seek out Indigenous knowledge about resources. “This kind of land acquisition represents the best of what our conservation efforts should look like: collaborative, inclusive, locally led, and in support of the priorities of our country’s tribal nations,” Haaland said at last weekend’s 30th Annual Ocmulgee Indigenous Celebration. In an era when some culture warriors see government as the enemy, years of coalition-building have eliminated any significant opposition to federal management in the reliably Republican center of a long-red state. Hunting will still be allowed, even encouraged, to keep feral hogs from destroying the ecosystem. Georgia’s congressional delegation is on board, and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has been welcomed as an essential partner.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Maui County Council is pushing a resolution that would allow counties to set higher minimum wages than the state, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Maui leaders endorsed the idea from council member Gabe Johnson, who pointed to variances in the cost of living from one area to another in advocating for the move. Three other county councils would have to approve before the resolution could be considered in the Legislature next year, according to the news outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The University of Idaho’s plan to build the nation’s largest research dairy and experimental farm cleared a big hurdle Tuesday. Gov. Brad Little and two other statewide-elected officials on the Idaho Land Board approved the university’s plan to use $23 million to buy roughly 640 acres of farmland in south-central Idaho, the heart of the state’s dairy industry. That would be the main focus of the school’s proposed Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. The dairy industry – Idaho’s is the third largest in the nation – faces a range of challenges with greenhouse gas emissions from animals, land and water pollution, and waste systems from dairies that can have thousands of cows that produce tons of manure. University of Idaho President Scott Green said the school hasn’t been able to do the large-scale research the industry needs to find solutions for those and other complex problems. If CAFE succeeds as envisioned, the operation would include an experimental farm and 2,000-cow research dairy in Minidoka County. Classrooms, labs and faculty offices would be constructed in Jerome County near where Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 93 intersect. A food processing pilot plant with a workforce training and education facility would be located at the College of Southern Idaho campus in Twin Falls County.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A jury has awarded $363 million to a woman who alleged that a now-shuttered suburban Chicago plant that sterilized medical equipment exposed residents to a toxic industrial gas and gave her breast cancer. After a five-week trial, the Cook County jurors on Monday awarded Sue Kamuda $38 million in compensatory damages for the past and future loss of a normal life, emotional distress, disfigurement and shortened life expectancy, plus $325 million in punitive damages. Kamuda, 70, developed breast cancer in 2007 despite having no predisposition to it, her lawyers said. She is the first of more than 700 people seeking damages from Oak Brook-based Sterigenics to go to trial over health claims over the plant’s releases of ethylene oxide gas. Those lawsuits have been filed against Sterigenics since 2018, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published research showing people living near the plant in the DuPage County village of Willowbrook faced some of the nation’s highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution. Sterigenics, the former plant’s most recent owner, was ordered to pay Kamuda $220 million in punitive damages; parent company Sotera Health was directed to pay $100 million and Griffith Foods, the current name of the plant’s original owner, $5 million.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of fatal overdoses last year in the city soared, eclipsing the number of people who died in shootings and other methods to become the leading cause of death in cases examined by the coroner’s office, according to new data. In its annual report examining trends among the decedents it takes in, the Marion County Coroner’s Office recorded 799 people last year died from accidental drug intoxication. The alarming statistics surpassed the number of people examined by the office who died from heart disease - long at the top of the list - blunt force trauma and firearms for the second year in a row. When accounting for people who died by suicide from an overdose or with an undetermined manner of death, the number of people climbs to 826. While the coroner’s office does not examine every death in the county, meaning some “natural” deaths are not included in the report, officials say the skyrocketing number of overdoses illustrates the worsening drug crisis in the county. “It’s unfortunate that these deaths are rising at such a significant rate,” said Alfarena McGinty, chief deputy coroner. The majority of deaths are linked to the highly lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl, the report shows, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. Fentanyl has increasingly been cut in other street drugs in the past few years.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Concerns about air quality and workplace safety at a correctional facility have led a labor union to file a grievance and the facility to conduct air quality testing. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union Council 61, which represents workers in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging unsafe working conditions at the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex building. In the complaint, filed Aug. 29, the union alleges mold and asbestos in the building are adversely affecting the health of workers and residents. It poses an emergency health risk that officials are not taking seriously, union President Rick Eilander said. Pictures submitted to OSHA as part of the complaint show apparent mold growing on air vents and on floors and pipes. The images also show a pipe leaking a blue and yellow liquid. Eilander wrote in the complaint that the images were taken in the basement and first floor of building 65/66 of the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex. Jerry Evans, the director of the Fifth Judicial District Department of Correctional Services, said given the alleged mold is located in an unoccupied part of the building, it does not pose a direct health risk to employees or residents of the facility.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state law enforcement oversight board reprimanded a sheriff’s deputy who used his Taser on a 12-year-old boy with autism while the boy was handcuffed and hogtied in the deputy’s vehicle but chose not to revoke his law enforcement certification. Former Jackson County Deputy Matthew Honas was found to have used excessive force against the boy and terminated from the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department in March. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training said Feb. 23 that Honas tied up the boy, who had run away from foster care, in a way that threatened his ability to breathe properly. Honas was not wearing a body camera, but the encounter was captured on his in-car camera. Honas knew the boy, identified as L.H., was autistic and had struggled with him during a previous encounter, the commission said. Honas “struggled with, shoved, elbowed, applied pressure points, carried, pulled, ‘hog-tied’ and ultimately tased L.H.,” the commission said. The commission said Honas used the Taser on the boy without warning as he was sitting in the patrol vehicle with his feet outside the vehicle. At the time, L.H. was handcuffed behind his back, with the handcuffs connected to shackles on his ankles. Among other things, Honas also refused help from other available officers, did not call a transport van, used profanity and threatened to use his Taser on the boy again, the commission said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A new website highlights how archaeological sites across the state have contributed knowledge about Kentucky’s history, officials said. Discover Kentucky Archaeology, at archaeology.ky.gov, was launched by the Kentucky Heritage Council/State Historic Preservation Office in partnership with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, a statement from the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet said. It includes information on more than 100 prehistoric and historic archaeological sites across 64 counties. The site was launched in September, which is celebrated as Kentucky Archaeology Month. Prehistoric sites include a Native American rockshelter in the Daniel Boone National Forest, and historic sites include Saltpeter Cave, a frontier-era niter mine in Carter County, the statement said. Each archaeological site includes a summary, findings, a focus on “what’s cool” and links to related materials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Three small insect-eating raptors called Mississippi kites have been released by Louisiana State University’s wildlife hospital. The release Friday in Baton Rouge was timed so that the birds, which are known for their aerobatics as they chase and grab insects while flying, can migrate to South America, where they winter in Brazil and Argentina. Two flew into nearby trees, but one – brought to the Wildlife Hospital of Louisiana in 2020 as a nestling with a broken leg – excited veterinary students by soaring for a bit before landing, Dr. Mark Mitchell, the hospital’s director, said Friday. He said it almost seemed as if a bird that had taken wing only in a flight cage was saying, “Now I know what these things on my sides are for.” The three had been living in the same flight cage and were held close to each other, then released simultaneously in hopes they would stay together over a journey of 5,000 to 9,000 miles, Mitchell said. The bird brought in as a nestling apparently had fallen from its nest in July 2020, Mitchell said in an interview. He was named Burreaux after quarterback Joe Burrow, who won the Heisman Trophy while at LSU and now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state of Maine and a fishing group are appealing a federal judge’s decision that new rules intended to protect rare whales must stand. The judge earlier this month denied a request from fishermen to stop federal regulators from placing the new restrictions on lobster fishing. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340. Gov. Janet Mills and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association said this week that they’re appealing that decision. Lobstermen have long contended the new rules are based on flawed data and are too punitive to the fishing industry. The fishermen sued the National Marine Fisheries Service in the lawsuit. The fishing group is “escalating its fight to save Maine’s lobstering heritage from a plan that the agency itself admits is not needed for the species to survive,” said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the lobstermen’s association. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and have declined in population in recent years. The state and the fishermen have appealed their case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nPrincess Anne: A historic inn where President George Washington reportedly once stayed is on the market. The historic Washington Inn & Tavern, the centerpiece of the Eastern Shore town of Princess Anne, is said to have housed the late president, said Town Manager Clayton Anderson. Built in 1744, before America’s independence from Great Britain and during the reign of King George II, the structure is brimming with history. Now, the town of Princess Anne has put the famed Washington Inn & Tavern up for sale, with a current listing of $1.25 million. Situated in the the Somerset County seat, the two-story colonial structure is located in an area prioritized for economic and community development. Throughout the years, the inn has served as a catalyst for business growth in a district committed to historic preservation, community growth and economic expansion, according to Anderson. The inn was purchased by the town in 2013 after it was found to be in a state of disrepair. Through a public-private partnership among Princess Anne, the state of Maryland and investors, the building underwent significant renovations. Restored to its full glory, it later reopened in 2016. Established public-private agreements require the town to sell the property by 2023, according to a news release this August.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A man will be sentenced to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to vandalizing the “Bewitched” statue by dousing the tourist attraction with red paint over the summer. The 32-year-old resident was originally sentenced to a year in jail, but a Salem district court judge suspended the sentence on conditions the man repay the cost of repairing the damage inflicted on the bronze statue, The Salem News reports. The statue depicts actor Elizabeth Montgomery – as lead character Samantha Stephens in the 1960s sitcom – sitting on a broomstick in front of a crescent moon. In June, a prosecutor said the man was “going through a rough time and wanted to do something to get arrested” and was held on bail. His attorney said he had been living in a shelter for two weeks since his marriage ended and had been looking for a new job. He was also charged with disorderly conduct, which will be dismissed after 30 days. The statue was erected in the city famous for the 1692 witch trials in 2005, despite protests from some who said it trivializes the tragedy of the trials.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city sued the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday over population estimates from last year that show it lost an additional 7,100 residents, opening another front against the agency in a battle over how Detroit’s people have been counted in the past two years. Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters that the city wants the Census Bureau to reveal how it produced its population loss estimates for Detroit. Duggan claimed the bureau was going against its own policy by refusing to divulge to Detroit the way the estimates for the city were calculated and not allowing challenges this year. The lawsuit appears to be the first litigation to challenge population results since the release of 2020 census data, which traditionally has formed the foundation of the annual population estimates. The Census Bureau’s refusal this year to consider evidence that the 2021 population estimates were wrong perpetuates racial inequality and threatens the city’s reputation, Detroit said in its lawsuit. “The Bureau’s failure to consider evidence of its inaccurate 2021 estimate costs the City and its residents millions of dollars of funding to which they are entitled while threatening the City’s historic turnaround by advancing the narrative that Detroit is losing population,” the lawsuit said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A federal grand jury has indicted a man accused of threatening to kill a U.S. senator. Brendon Daugherty was being held in the Sherburne County Jail, in Elk River, on charges of threatening to murder a U.S. official and interstate transmission of a threat. Court records do not identify the senator other than to say it was not someone who represented Minnesota. According to the indictment, Daugherty left two threatening voicemail messages at the senator’s field office in June. Field office staff contacted U.S. Capitol Police. FBI agents spoke with Daugherty at his Coon Rapids home Sept. 2. He told the agents that he made the calls because the senator was “doing a bunch of stupid (expletive) with gun control” and that he wants politicians to “feel a little bit pressured,” the Star Tribune reports. According to court records, the 35-year-old Daugherty was convicted in October 2018 of two felony counts for threatening to burn down a Pearl Vision store in Maple Grove and harm the employees. Daugherty was angry that he owed $80 for replacement glasses, according to charges.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has been awarded a $5.8million grant for the construction of an Advanced Workforce Training Center. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced that the department’s Economic Development Administration is awarding the $5.8 million grant to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for the construction of the Advanced Workforce Training Center. The grant is funded by the American Rescue Plan’s Indigenous Communities Program, a press release said. “Workforce development is a primary focus for our Tribe,” Chief Cyrus Ben said in the press release. “We have undertaken many projects to help our community members prepare to face a challenging and ever-evolving job market. This Workforce Training Center is a key component of our strategy to increase the skills of our Tribal members, whether they choose a career on or outside of our Tribal lands.” Anna Denson, project manager of economic development, said the planning process took more than a year. “As of today, our National Center for construction education and research offers HVAC, electrical and industrial maintenance to tribal employees with very little room, but the goal is to expand with the new center,” Denson said.\n\nMissouri\n\nHartville: A small hamlet in the Ozarks has found itself in the middle of everything. Officials from the nation’s capital unveiled a marker Wednesday designating a spot in tiny Wright County as the center of population in the United States. Dignitaries from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau officially debuted the red granite marker in Hartville. With a population of 594 residents in 2020, the county seat is located 14.6 miles from the actual spot calculated following the 2020 census. Bypassed by interstate highways and railroads, Hartville doesn’t have a big tax base or large industry. The local school, a nursing home, the gas station and the Dollar General store are the largest employers. The nation’s population center is calculated every 10 years after the once-a-decade census shows where people are living. The heart of America has been located in Missouri since 1980. Previously located in Plato, in the neighboring county, it moved only 11.8 miles southwest from 2010 to 2020. It is the smallest distance shift in 100 years and second-smallest in U.S. history. To calculate the center of the U.S., the Census Bureau figures out which spot would be “the balance point” if the 50 states sat on an imaginary, flat surface with weights of identical size – each representing the location of one person – placed on it.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The state’s fishing economy has proven resilient amid the impacts of drought, but a new study suggests 35% of its cold water habitats could become unsuitable for trout by 2080, costing the state an estimated $192 million in annual revenue. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the University of Montana contributed to the new study titled “Socioeconomic resilience to climatic extremes in a freshwater fishery,” which ran in the journal Science Advances this month, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. “Trout fisheries have enormous cultural, economic and ecological importance in Montana and worldwide, yet even Montana’s resilient trout fisheries could be vulnerable to future climate change,” Timothy Cline, a USGS scientist and the paper’s lead author, said in a news release. The authors used Montana FWP’s recreation monitoring data to analyze how climate change affected 3,100 miles of the state’s rivers between 1983 and 2017. They found that the concentration of anglers doubled overall within that 34-year time period, and severe drought conditions, which drive stream flows down and water temperatures up, significantly affected how that fishing pressure was distributed across the landscape.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Regents at the University of Nebraska are poised to consider allowing beer sales permanently for Husker events at Pinnacle Bank Arena, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The NU Board of Regents plans to vote on the exemption next week.\n\nNevada\n\nTonopah: A sprawling southern Nevada county that embraced misinformation about electronic voting machines is set to conduct its midterm election this fall using hand-counted paper ballots, a county official confirmed Tuesday. “This is very locked in,” said newly appointed Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf, a 2020 election denier, of his plans to implement the old-fashioned process in a county with roughly 33,000 active registered voters. Nye, the largest county by area in Nevada and the third-largest in the United States, has been at the forefront of the Republican Party’s push to ditch electronic voting – an ongoing effort fueled by ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election. Now, less than 50 days before the midterm election, the rural county remains committed to that disinformation campaign despite warnings from experts who say counting ballots by hand could invite more error and fraud. All active registered voters will still receive a mail-in ballot for the general election, Kampf, the county’s top voting official, said in a presentation Tuesday to Nye’s five-member Board of Commissioners. But at the polls, according to Kampf, those casting their votes in person this fall will now fill out paper ballots instead of using a touch screen, although one voting machine will be available at every voting site for people with disabilities and “special needs.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is using $5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to support homeless shelters this winter. The funds, approved earlier this month by the Executive Council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, will provide one-time grants to support shelter providers, including short-term cold weather shelters, to address pandemic-related increased costs and anticipated demand as the winter months approach. In a request for the funds, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette wrote that the state contracts with 19 shelter providers for 791 emergency shelter beds, but the health department does not fund temporary cold weather shelters. She wrote that preliminary data for the 2022 Point-in-Time count for New Hampshire shows 1,605 people experiencing homelessness, an increase of 7.6% from 2021. The federal funds will provide $4 million in grants to the existing shelters under contract with the department and $1 million to each county, municipality, nonprofit or coalition to assist with cold weather shelters.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRidgewood: Will students make it to class more alert and on time if high school starts 45 minutes later? The school district’s parents and teachers were more skeptical than students about any positive outcomes of a later school day start in a 24-page report by K-12 Insights that was presented to the Ridgewood Board of Education on Monday. The report analyzed the results of a district survey distributed in May to parents, students, teachers and community members seeking input about a proposed move of the high school start time from 7:45 to 8:30 a.m. The later starting time is the subject of a nationwide educational debate. Multiple studies indicate it’s not video games, computers and cellphones that keep adolescents up late at night – it’s a temporary, puberty-induced shift in teen circadian rhythms that causes them to be “dazed and confused” in the mornings but dissipates in their early 20s. California has taken the lead and introduced a statewide mandate this fall to start high school classes no earlier than 8:30 a.m. and middle school no earlier than 8 a.m. New Jersey has introduced a similar bill. So far, only a few districts, including Tenafly, Princeton and South Orange/Maplewood, have adopted the later start time.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A politician and Trump supporter who was removed and barred from elected office for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot Jan. 6, 2021, is attempting to appeal that decision to the state Supreme Court. Cowboys for Trump co-founder and former county commissioner Couy Griffin on Tuesday notified the high court of his intent to appeal. The ruling against Griffin this month from a Santa Fe-based District Court was the first to remove or bar an elected official from office in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol building that disrupted Congress as it was trying to certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory. Griffin was previously convicted in federal court of a misdemeanor for entering the Capitol grounds Jan. 6, without going inside the building. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Griffin has invoked free speech guarantees in his defense and said his banishment from public office disenfranchises his political constituents in Otero County. He was barred from office under provisions of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that anyone who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution can be barred from office for engaging in insurrection or rebellion. The provisions were put in place shortly after the Civil War.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An inmate who jumped into the East River from a jail barge has died, the city Department of Correction announced Wednesday. Gregory Acevedo, 48, was pronounced dead about 11 p.m. Tuesday, 11 hours after he climbed a fence at the Vernon C. Bain Center and jumped into the water, officials said. “Mr. Acevedo’s tragic passing is an immense loss,” Correction Commissioner Louis A. Molina said in a statement. Acevedo had been in custody on a robbery charge since Feb. 27. Police officers pulled him from the water after his jump Tuesday and took him to a hospital, where efforts to revive him failed. He was the 15th person to die this year who was a New York City jail inmate or who had just been released. “Once again, their system failed,” Acevedo’s attorney, Warren Silverman, told the New York Post. “I mean, he shouldn’t have been able to get to any position where he could have harmed himself, and clearly they dropped the ball, as usual.” The state attorney general’s office and the city Department of Investigation conduct separate investigations. The city medical examiner’s office will determine the cause. The Bain Center is a 625-foot barge that was supposed to be temporary when it opened as a jail in 1992. It is docked in the East River near Rikers Island, the city’s main jail complex.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has made one more pitch to host the 2027 World University Games, as the committee evaluating North Carolina’s bid visited the region Tuesday. A panel of the International University Sports Federation visited the Executive Mansion, where Gov. Roy Cooper presented its members with an official bid book. The other finalist is Chungcheong province, South Korea. A final announcement is expected in November. North Carolina’s proposal would cover the “University Hub” region designated as including Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary and Greensboro. There are more than 130 colleges, universities and community college statewide. The summer World University Games attracts 7,000 athletes from ages 18 to 25 from more than 150 countries and 600 universities. The nearly two-week event features 15 required sports, including swimming, track and field and basketball, as well as optional sports proposed by the local host city. The state has set aside $25 million to support the games if North Carolina is named the host.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A driver charged with fatally striking a teenager allegedly told investigators he purposely hit the teen with his SUV after they had a political argument, according to court documents. Cayler Ellingson, 18, was struck and killed following a street dance in McHenry early Sunday. The driver accused of striking Ellingson in an alley, Shannon Brandt, 41, is charged in Foster County with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death. Jail records from Stutsman County, where Brandt was being held, show he posted $50,000 bond Tuesday and was released. His attorney did not immediately return a call for comment. Brandt told investigators he left the scene after striking Ellingson, returned briefly, called 911 and then left again, according to a probable cause affidavit. The court document said Brandt told investigators he had been drinking alcohol before striking Ellingson, thought the teen was calling people to do him harm after they argued, and felt threatened. Ellingson was rushed to a hospital in Carrington, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators arrested Brandt at his home in Glenfield later Sunday. Officials said he consented to a chemical breath test that showed his blood alcohol content was above 0.08%, the legal limit to drive.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A conservative podcaster who embraces ex-President Donald Trump’s discredited claims of a stolen 2020 election is eligible to run for Ohio secretary of state this fall, the state’s high court ruled Tuesday. Terpeshore “Tore” Maras, who calls President Joe Biden “resident not president” and embraces aspects of the QAnon conspiracy in her “Tore Says” podcast, will appear on ballots as an independent. She faces Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Democratic challenger Chelsea Clark. The Ohio Supreme Court split 4-2 in its ruling, with Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, a Republican, joining the court’s three Democrats, Justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer dissenting, and Justice Sharon Kennedy not participating. The decision marks the latest twist in Maras’ roller-coaster bid to seek the office overseeing Ohio elections. She previously met the deadline to run as a Republican candidate for the ballot back in February but fell short of the required valid signatures. LaRose’s office later cleared her to run as an independent, but a Republican official – acting in his capacity as an Ohio voter – filed a challenge, asserting a number of her signatures were invalid. A judge ruled in the official’s favor, and LaRose’s office upheld that decision and invalidated her candidacy.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWynnewood: Joe Exotic is suing a songwriter who revealed in media interviews that Exotic was lip-syncing the catchy tune “I Saw a Tiger” in a music video seen in the Netflix documentary about his life. He accuses songwriter Vince Johnson of copyright infringement for releasing an album in 2020 featuring that song and four others. The former zookeeper was convicted at trial in 2019 of hiring two men to kill his chief critic, Carole Baskin, and of crimes involving his animals. He became well-known worldwide a year later after Netflix released “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” He was ordered in January to serve 21 years in federal prison after an appeals court threw out his original sentence. He claims he is innocent and is seeking a new trial on newly discovered evidence and other grounds. His attorney, John M. Phillips, filed the lawsuit Monday seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and a permanent ban on further “unauthorized use” of his songs. In the lawsuit, he goes by the name Joseph Maldonado. In interviews, Johnson said he began writing songs for the zookeeper in 2013. He said a bandmate, Danny Clinton, who died in 2019, was the singer. “I had no idea he was going to Milli Vanilli the songs,” he told Vanity Fair for an article about his involvement.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Thousands of families who expected their children to start tuition-free, state-provided preschool this month remain in limbo because of staffing shortages that caused delays getting contracts to nearly 250 involved preschools. The Early Learning Division, which has overseen the Preschool Promise program since its 2016 inception, took over contracting duties from the Oregon Department of Education this year and has struggled to get contracts inked. It has yet to send paperwork to most of the 248 preschools in the program that serves families living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Many facilities new to the program or those expanding services are hesitant to accept children enrolled in Preschool Promise until they have a signed contract and payment for the care is assured, the newspaper reports. The agency now says the preschools chosen to serve an estimated 6,381 children must open no later than Oct. 30. It could not say when all contracts would be signed. The total number of children marks an expected increase of more than 2,000 slots from last year. “It’s super hard on families,” said Molly Day, director of Early Learning Multnomah, one of 16 regional hubs that helps coordinate Preschool Promise enrollment.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMiddletown: A prosecutor announced charges in juvenile court Tuesday against 10 students in connection with alleged hazing of high school football players that prompted cancellation of the team’s season. Dauphin County prosecutors said two Middletown players will face attempted sexual assault charges, and eight others face other counts in connection with hazing that authorities said targeted at least six players from ages 14 to 17. “This investigation did not involve just hazing or ‘boys will be boys’ conduct,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Jennifer Gettle said in a news release from the office of District Attorney Fran Chardo. “Rather, two of these individuals committed repeated sexual assaults and encouraged others to participate under the guise of hazing.” Superintendent Chelton Hunter earlier said that team members had been in the high school turf room used for heat acclimation practice sessions when an Aug. 11 cellphone video showed “a group of students restraining two of their teammates and using a muscle therapy gun and another piece of athletic equipment” to poke their buttock areas. The players remained fully clothed, and no penetration appeared to have occurred, he said, calling the video difficult to watch and the acts “completely unacceptable, offensive, and highly inappropriate.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nWoonsocket: Former Mayor Susan Menard, whose body was found Monday in her home, was “a strong leader” who was especially good to the city’s senior citizens, the current mayor recalled Wednesday. “She certainly had her own style, but the people of the city of Woonsocket certainly liked and enjoyed her leadership, electing her to seven terms,” Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt said in an interview. The Woonsocket police went to Menard’s residence Monday after a neighbor called and said he hadn’t seen Menard or the man who also lived in the house for “a couple of weeks,” police said. Officers forced their way in through a rear window and found two bodies in separate rooms, Woonsocket Police Chief Thomas F. Oates III said Tuesday, but they were decomposed, and the medical examiner needed to identify the remains. The state Medical Examiners office said Wednesday morning that it had identified one of them as Menard. The identity of the second person, described as a man in his 70s, has not yet been confirmed, and the causes of death for both are still being investigated, the office said. The police saw no evidence that a crime had been committed, Oates said. “She was and is the longest-serving mayor in the city’s history,” Baldelli-Hunt said, noting that Menard was also the city’s first woman to be elected mayor and first female City Council president.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Seven mothers have given up their babies in South Carolina so far in 2022, more than any year since the state passed its safe haven law more than two decades ago. The babies were all given up at hospitals, according to data from the Department of Social Services obtained by The State newspaper. Daniel’s Law allows babies younger than 2 months old to be turned over to the state at safe places like hospitals, fire stations, police departments or churches if someone is there. Before 2022, the most babies given up in a year was six, in 2016 and 2019. Four babies have been adopted, while the last three are currently in the Family Court system, DSS spokesperson Danielle Jones said. The agency isn’t guessing why 2022 has been the busiest year for Daniel’s Law. The babies turned over to the state have been twins in Anderson County, a boy in Greenville County, a girl in Spartanburg County, a boy in Dorchester County, a boy in Greenwood County and a girl in Lexington County. The General Assembly passed Daniel’s Law in 2001 after a newborn boy was found abandoned at an old dump in Allendale County, alive but covered in fire ant bites, by a mother who never told her parents she was pregnant or went to the doctor and who gave birth in her bathroom.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem is facing a lawsuit after her office refused to release expense records on five out-of-state trips this year to a liberal watchdog group. American Oversight, an organization that files open records requests and litigation against Republican officials, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Noem, who is in the midst of a reelection campaign and eyeing a bid for the GOP’s 2024 presidential ticket. It alleges that the governor’s office did not follow the state’s open records law by claiming that releasing the records would create a threat to the governor’s safety. In May, the organization had requested expense records, including lodging and travel, for 2022 trips Noem had taken to a Las Vegas hunting convention, a pair of Republican Party events in Wyoming and New York, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and a campaign event for Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee in Utah. American Oversight also said that South Dakota’s Department of Labor and Regulation has not responded to its records request for legal expenses associated with negotiating a $200,000 settlement agreement with a former state employee, Sherry Bren. She had filed an age discrimination complaint after she was pressured to retire by Marcia Hultman, Noem’s labor secretary. Hultman began asking for Bren’s retirement in the weeks after Noem’s daughter, Kassidy Peters, completed her real estate appraiser licensure – a process in which Noem took a hands-on role.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University will be the host campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University annual meeting in 2023, the Clinton Foundation said Tuesday. Chelsea Clinton, the foundation’s vice chair, made the announcement at the Clinton Global Initiative’s two-day meeting of international dignitaries in New York. The initiative aims to create partnerships among political, business and philanthropic leaders. According to a news release, next year’s gathering at Vanderbilt will allow students to collaborate with leaders, innovators and experts on solving “humanity’s most pressing problems,” ranging from social to economic to environmental challenges. “Our university and the Clinton Foundation share the beliefs that collaboration brings out the best in humanity and that diverse perspectives and open dialogue are needed to drive innovation and discovery,” Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, said in a statement. More than 11,000 students have participated in the Clinton Global Initiative University program, coming from 163 counties and all 50 states. Previous hosts include the University of Chicago, Howard University, and member schools of the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: Alarmed parents converged on a high school Tuesday after a classroom shooting report that ultimately proved to be false. The siege at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio began about 1 p.m. Tuesday after police received a call of a possible shooting in progress at the school, according to a police statement. The school was placed on lockdown as police entered and began clearing the campus but found no evidence of an active threat or shooting. “Our department and San Antonio Police Department established there was no shooting, but then we had to do a methodical search room by room with our strike teams,” said Chief Johnny Reyes of the San Antonio Independent School District police. “We went to the place where they said the shooting had occurred, and we were able to quickly establish that no shooting had happened.” Instead, some students were found to have had an altercation, but they denied having or displaying a weapon at any point, Reyes said. But frightened students already had made alarming telephone calls to their parents, who descended en masse on the school where 29 school district officers and 58 city police officers were on hand. One man shoved his fist through a window in an effort to gain entry to the school, lacerating his arm. Others were handcuffed and detained after physically struggling with officers.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A family has reached a $3 million settlement with the city in a lawsuit filed after officers shot a 13-year-old boy with autism, leaving him badly wounded after responding to his mother’s 911 call for help when he had a breakdown. The September 2020 shooting drew widespread scrutiny and was one of several around the U.S. in recent years that have fueled questions how police respond to calls involving people with mental illness. The boy, Linden Cameron, now 15, survived but suffered life-changing injuries and emotional trauma that still “haunt him and his family,” said family attorney Nathan Morris in a statement Tuesday announcing the settlement. Cameron’s family accepted the settlement to avoid more emotional trauma that would have come over years spent waiting for the lawsuit to reach trial, Morris said. A separate probe by prosecutors to determine if criminal charges will be filed against the officer is ongoing and could have delayed the family’s lawsuit even longer, he said. “There are mixed emotions by the family,” Morris said. “It is a huge relief to be done with this case, but at the same time we would liked to take this case forward to shine light on some of the issues.” After the shooting, Salt Lake City began providing training for police, fire and dispatch officers about how to best engage with people who have sensory needs like Cameron. That training will continue, said Salt Lake City spokesman Andrew Wittenberg.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Mandatory testing for lead in drinking water – and repairs to keep that water safe – has been completed at 98% of the state’s schools and child care centers, the Vermont Health Department said Wednesday. The state passed a law in 2019 requiring schools and child care facilities to test their drinking and cooking water for lead, a highly toxic metal. Roughly 1 in 5 taps had elevated lead levels out of the more than 15,000 taps tested between June 2019 and December 2021. Lead exposure can slow children’s growth, impair development and learning, and cause behavioral problems. Lead was more frequently found in water fixtures, rather than plumbing, which made fixes both easier and less expensive. The state provided funding to reimburse schools and child care centers for remediation costs, 90% of which cost less than $500. “We take very seriously our responsibility to protect and promote the health and safety of children in early care and education programs,” said Commissioner Sean Brown of the Agency of Human Services’ Child Development Division. “Collaborative efforts like this help ensure that children in Vermont have positive, safe learning environments in which they can grow and develop.”\n\nVirginia\n\nMartinsville: A marker has been dedicated in front of the old Henry County Courthouse recognizing the Martinsville Seven, a group of Black men executed in 1951 over an alleged rape. “Here in 1949, six all-white, all-male juries convicted seven Black men of the rape of a white woman. All seven men were sentenced to death. On appeal, NAACP attorneys submitted the first petition to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that capital punishment had been disproportionately applied against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment. Despite international attention and petitions for clemency, the Commonwealth of Virginia executed the men in Feb. 1951, the most executions for a rape in U.S. history,” the marker says. The old Henry County Courthouse is now the Martinsville-Henry County Heritage Center and Museum, inside which a display recounts the day in 1949 when Ruby Floyd told police she had been raped. Francis Grayson, Frank Hairston Jr., Howard Hairston, James Hairston, Joe Hampton, Booker Millner and John Taylor were arrested and confessed. The defense argued the encounter was consensual, and the confessions were coerced, but all seven men were found guilty and sentenced to death. The NAACP failed in its appeal, and over just four days, the seven were put to death by the electric chair in Richmond.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Next year voters will decide whether the city should set up a public developer to create affordable housing. The Seattle Times reports the City Council unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to allow King County Elections to put the proposed Initiative 135 on the ballot of a special election to be held Feb. 14, 2023. If I-135 passes, it would create a public development authority, called the Seattle Social Housing Developer, to construct homes and take over existing properties using government and philanthropic funding to create renter-governed housing. Those who favor the initiative say housing would be protected from rental market forces in one of the nation’s most expensive cities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Walmart and CVS Pharmacy have settled with the state of West Virginia for a combined total of $147 million in a lawsuit over the companies’ roles in contributing to the oversupply of prescription drugs that fueled the opioid epidemic in the country’s most impacted state, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday. Walmart and CVS were two lawsuits that were part of a larger trial that was pushed back to June of next year along with Kroger and Walgreens. Morrisey recently announced a settlement with Rite Aid for up to $30 million to resolve similar litigation. The lawsuits allege the pharmacies’ contributions to the oversupply of prescription opioids in the state have caused “significant losses through their past and ongoing medical treatment costs, including for minors born addicted to opioids, rehabilitation costs, naloxone costs, medical examiner expenses, self-funded state insurance costs and other forms of losses to address opioid-related afflictions and loss of lives.” It brings the total settlements by the state in opioid lawsuits to $875 million, including $296 million with manufacturers, $400 million with wholesalers and $177.5 million involving pharmacies.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels has called on Gov. Tony Evers to halt all paroles in the state, even though a governor can’t unilaterally order them to stop, and some paroles are mandated by law. Michels has been hitting Evers as being soft on crime, accusing the Democrat in a letter Monday of sympathizing with and coddling “brutal, convicted criminals.” Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said it would be illegal to do as Michels wants and called the request “an uninformed stunt to score political points by someone who has no regard or appreciation for the laws of our state.” Michels and Evers are knotted in a tight contest in the battleground state that polls show is about even. Michaels, who is endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump and is the co-owner of the state’s largest construction company, has been attacking Evers over his parole policies and his response to violent protests in Kenosha two years ago that followed the shooting of Black man Jacob Blake by a white police officer. Wisconsin’s parole commission, which operates independently of the governor, has granted about 460 discretionary paroles not required by law, something that both Republican and Democratic governors before Evers also routinely granted.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Rockslides have seemingly been ramping up in the Tetons, mountain guides say, and scientists are pointing to climate change as a likely culprit, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. The anecdotal increase in rockfall in the mountain range comes as warmer temperatures take their toll on glaciers, which long covered the Tetons. Simeon Caskey, head of the physical science branch at Grand Teton National Park, told the newspaper that so-called weathering is behind much of the rockfall, with shifting water and ice leading to changes in the geologic structure of the area. “We’ve seen from some studies in the Alps that rockfall is happening more frequently at higher elevations as a result of climate change and increased temperatures and increased extreme rainfall events,” he said, calling that European mountain range an “appropriate analogue for what’s happening in the Tetons.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/11/02/mikiztil-festival-exorcism-ranch-storms-underwater-impact-news-around-states/50894879/", "title": "Mikiztil festival, exorcism ranch: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: As early as next summer, Tuskegee University plans to move the needle in cancer genomics – the study of DNA sequence and gene expression differences between tumor cells and normal cells. With a $7.93 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, the university will build a new biomedical annex to its Carver Research Center to focus on cancer research and health disparities in underrepresented populations. “This award is recognition for the dedicated effort of the faculty, staff and students within the Center for Biomedical Research to eradicate health disparities, particularly in Alabama Black Belt,” Center for Biomedical Research director Dr. Clayton Yates said in a statement. “Students, particularly African-Americans and other underrepresented minorities, will receive training to become excellent biomedical research scientists, significantly benefitting from this state-of-the-art enhancement.” Booker T. Washington founded the historically Black university in 1881 with the purpose of educating Black teachers. Since then, the school has expanded its mission to include educating students for careers in the sciences, architecture, business and engineering. It also forged a path in bioethics for HBCUs. Tuskegee formed its National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care in response to the violations committed during the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawsuit filed in state court is challenging the eligibility of a legislative candidate to hold the seat. The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Democrat Jennifer “Jennie” Armstrong did not meet residency requirements on the date she filed to run for office. The complaint seeks an injunction barring state elections officials from certifying Armstrong as the winner of her Anchorage House race should she garner the most votes. Armstrong faces Republican Liz Vazquez in next week’s election. The case, brought by Chris Duke, Randy Eledge, Steve Strait and Kathryn Werdahl, names the state Division of Elections and its director as defendants. The plaintiffs are described as “public interest litigants.” Patty Sullivan, a spokesperson with the state Department of Law, said Tuesday morning that the department had not yet been served an official copy of the complaint and could not comment on the specific allegations. But she said that Armstrong has been certified for the ballot based on information she provided in her declaration of candidacy and that the time for any challenge to her eligibility under a state law and regulation has expired. “There is no process for the Division to find a candidate disqualified based on residency at this point in the process,” Sullivan said by email.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Crowds gathered at Steele Indian School Park on Sunday to honor the Indigenous roots of Día de los Muertos at the annual Mikiztil festival. “The Mikiztil is the painted decorated skull that you see, and it represents not death but transcendence,” said Zarco Guerrero, president, chair and co-founder of Cultural Coalition, the host organization of the event. Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, an ancient Mexican celebration with Indigenous Aztec roots, is typically observed Nov. 1-2 during the Catholic holidays of All Saints Day and All Souls Day. During this time, people honor their deceased relatives and invite their spirits back from beyond to join their families in the celebration. The Día de los Muertos celebration well-known today in the U.S. is a medley of Indigenous origins of the tradition mixed with forced Spanish and Catholic influence from the Europeans who conquered the lands of Indigenous people, according to Carmen Guerrero, executive director and co-founder of Cultural Coalition. The Mikiztli festival aims to revive and celebrate its Indigenous origins. “We’re trying to go back to the ancestral understanding of what this event really means. ... It was never about death. It was always about transcending to the next life,” Zarco Guerrero said. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego acknowledged the city’s support and welcomed the crowd to the event. Shortly after began the Danza Mexica, a form of ancestral worship to what the Aztecs described as the four sacred directions: north, south, east and west.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The FBI is investigating after several people in the city told police someone called and said their children had been kidnapped and then demanded a ransom. The calls’ claims have been fake but are being investigated by local and federal law officers. Since Thursday, police took reports of a series of calls from across the city about kidnappings. The caller used the same phone number to claim that the targets’ children had been kidnapped and that they would only give the children back if a ransom were paid, police said. “These calls have been investigated and are confirmed to be scams,” according to a Fort Smith news release. In one of the calls, the victim’s child was confirmed safe. In another, the victim did not even have any children. “When the caller is pressed, their knowledge of the victims and the area appears to be limited and superficial,” police said. Anyone who gets a kidnapping call or any other suspicious call can report it to Fort Smith police or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at fbi.gov/tips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Hoopa Valley Tribe alleged in a lawsuit Monday that the federal government is violating its sovereignty and failing to collect money from California farms that rely on federally supplied water to pay for damages to tribal fisheries. The tribe, which has a reservation in northwest California, says in its lawsuit against the Biden administration that the Trinity River that it relies on for food and cultural purposes has been decimated by decades of the federal government diverting water. The suit alleges the U.S. Department of the Interior has failed to follow laws that require the contractors who use that water to pay money for habitat restoration projects. It says those contractors owe $340 million for environmental restoration work along the Trinity River and other places damaged by water diversions. “The river has become a place that is no longer a healing place, but a place that is a sick place,” said Jill Sherman-Warne, a member of the Hoopa tribal council. The suit also alleges that the federal government has failed to appropriately consult with the tribe on matters related to the river. The Interior Department declined to comment through spokesman Tyler Cherry.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man has been sentenced to more than 23 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to shooting a ranger at Rocky Mountain National Park last year. The ranger was wearing a bulletproof vest and wasn’t seriously injured. Daron Ellis, 29, of Aurora, was sentenced Monday in federal court in Denver after pleading guilty to attempted murder of a federal officer and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, The Denver Post reports. The Dec. 8 shooting occurred after a Colorado State Patrol officer tried to stop Ellis outside the park for speeding. The trooper learned the car was stolen and ordered Ellis to leave the car, but Ellis sped off, authorities said. A National Park Service Law Enforcement ranger spotted the car at the Fall River entrance to the national park in Colorado and ordered Ellis to show his hands. Ellis shot the ranger in the chest with a semi-automatic handgun; the ranger returned fire, wounding Ellis, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado. The ranger’s identity hasn’t been released. Rocky Mountain National Park is about 50 miles northwest of Denver.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A former state representative pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with the theft of more than $1.2 million in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven, using some of the money for gambling at a casino, according to prosecutors. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat, appeared in federal court in Hartford and pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud conspiracy. DiMassa’s wife and his former business partner also pleaded guilty earlier this year, while a fourth person charged in the scheme awaits trial. At the time of the theft, DiMassa was both a state representative and an aide to the West Haven City Council. Prosecutors alleged he used his city position, which had authority to approve the reimbursement of COVID-19 expenditures, to steal the funds – some of which he used for gambling at the Mohegan Sun Casino in eastern Connecticut. DiMassa resigned from both positions after his arrest last year. No sentencing date was set for DiMassa. The sentencing guideline range for the charges to which he pleaded guilty is 41 to 51 months.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After years of hovering slightly under 1 million residents, the First State has surpassed that milestone − but just barely, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. The government estimated this summer that in July 2021, Delaware had 1,003,384 residents. Census Bureau data lags by about a year. While Delaware’s overall population growth has remained steady at an average of 1% per year since 2010, adults 65 and older have seen the fastest-growing numbers, with that population increasing 55% in the 11-year period. In contrast, the 35-to-49 age group declined the most, dropping 4.2% in the same time frame. Currently, the 50-to-64 age group makes up the largest share of Delaware’s population, at 20.5%. The 65-and-up age group comes in close second, however, making up 20.1% of the state’s population. Though adults ages 50 to 64 still account for the largest percentage of the state’s population, the rapid growth of the 65-plus age group comes as no surprise given the trend is also being seen nationally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living found.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After decades of planning and years of delays, the D.C. region’s Metrorail system will open a long-awaited extension to Dulles International Airport in about two weeks. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Monday that the second phase of its Silver Line extension into Loudoun County and the northern Virginia airport will open to passengers Nov. 15. The $3 billion extension adds more than 11 miles of track and six new stations. It has been plagued by cost overruns and criminal charges against contractors who falsified records to try to hide faulty concrete. It was originally scheduled to open in 2018 but faced numerous delays. The opening comes at a time where the Metrorail system continues to face a significant drop in ridership from its pre-pandemic levels, as well as an anticipated budget gap. In recent weeks, Metro officials had said they could not open the new line until safety regulators allowed the system’s 7000 series rail cars to return to use. They had been pulled from service after a derailment. Regulators approved a plan last week to return enough of the cars to service ahead of Thanksgiving to allow the Silver Line extension to open.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Hurricane Ian ravaged southwest Florida on land but was destructive underwater as well. It destroyed human-made reefs and brought along red tide, the harmful algae blooms that kill fish and birds, according to marine researchers who returned last week from a six-day cruise organized by the Florida Institute of Oceanography. Researchers who used the cruise to study marine life in the Gulf of Mexico following the hurricane say it left in its wake red tide and destroyed artificial reefs from as far away as 30 miles from the coast of southwest Florida. “The onetime vibrant reefs are now underwater disaster sites themselves,” said Calli Johnson, safety dive officer for the research cruise. “Where there used to be a complete ecosystem, there are now only fish that were able to return after swimming away.” Before the Category 4 storm made landfall a month ago, southwest Florida had a reputation for being one of the best saltwater fishing destinations in the U.S. Saltwater and freshwater fishing in Florida has an economic impact of about $13.8 billion, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Time will tell how this affects our greater economy because changes in the fishing industry and tourism will come from changes in our underwater world,” Johnson said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Monday declined to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani by two women who served as election workers in Georgia in November 2020. In the lawsuit filed last December, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss accused Giuliani of defaming them by falsely stating that the pair had engaged in election fraud while counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The lawsuit says Giuliani repeatedly pushed debunked claims that the mother-and-daughter pair pulled out suitcases of illegal ballots and committed other acts of fraud to try to alter the outcome of the presidential election in Georgia. In an opinion accompanying Monday’s order, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell in Washington described the situation that followed the November 2020 election, when the vote totals in several key states were so close that the results were not immediately clear. “As election workers across the state worked long hours carefully ensuring the accuracy of the election, the Trump Campaign and its allies, including Giuliani, engaged in a media offensive that at best questioned, and at worse condemned, their work,” Howell wrote. Moss had worked for the Fulton County elections department since 2012 and supervised the absentee ballot operation during the 2020 election. Freeman, her mother, was a temporary election worker, verifying signatures on absentee ballots and preparing them to be counted and processed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The pilot of a helicopter that crashed on a remote lava field during a sunset tour in June told investigators that the engine had been swapped out but three earlier flights that day were normal. The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday released various documents related to the crash that injured all six people on board, but the agency has yet to release a probable cause for why the helicopter suddenly made “violent and uncommanded yaw and pitch changes.” The morning of the crash, the pilot and a mechanic took the helicopter on a operation control flight after its engine had been changed and there were no issues with the flight, according to the pilot’s accident report. The documents did not specify exactly when the engine was changed. The pilot then took the helicopter on two tours, which were also normal and uneventful. The helicopter crashed during a third tour and was found lying on its left side with significant damage to the cockpit, and the tail boom was nearly 800 feet from the main wreckage, according to one of the reports. A large piece of lava rock penetrated about 13 inches into the cockpit area. In a passenger statement, a 48-year-old man on the tour with his two 18-year-old daughters told investigators the helicopter suddenly felt upside down about 30 minutes into the flight.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A former longshot Idaho gubernatorial candidate was convicted Monday of kidnapping and killing a 12-year-old Colorado girl who went missing nearly 40 years ago. Jurors found Steve Pankey, 71, guilty of felony murder, second-degree kidnapping and false reporting in the disappearance and death of Jonelle Matthews in 1984, the office of district attorney Michael Rourke said. A judge then sentenced him to life prison with the possibility of parole, the Greeley Tribune reports. It was Pankey’s second trial in the case. Last year, jurors were unable to reach verdicts on the kidnapping and murder charges, and prosecutors decided to put him on trial again. Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle and her family when she vanished after being dropped off at her empty home by a family friend after performing at a Christmas concert in Greeley, Colorado, a city about 50 miles north of Denver. He emerged as a person of interest in the case three decades later – shortly before Jonelle’s body was found in 2019 – after claiming to have information about what happened to her and asking for immunity from prosecution. Prosecutors said Pankey kept up to date on the case throughout the years even as he moved his family to several states before settling in Idaho, where he ran unsuccessfully as a Constitution Party candidate for Idaho governor in 2014 and in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2018, the year authorities said he was named as a person of interest in the girl’s death.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The owner of a North Side senior housing facility where three women earlier this year died amid a brief May heat wave that caused temperatures in the building to soar into the low 90s has been fined $1,500 by the city’s buildings department. Citing city records, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the fine was levied after an inspection by the buildings department found 11 code violations – two of which were the result of a rooftop air conditioning “chiller” that did not appear to be suitable for use on the exterior of the building. Records show, according to the newspaper, that the department determined that issues noted in the city’s first inspection had been addressed and that a second inspection determined there were “no dangerous and hazardous conditions.” By that time, the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation – a nonprofit organization that owns and manages the James Sneider Apartment – had, among other things, provided individual air conditioning units to every tenant. Mike Puccinelli, a buildings department spokesman, said the fine was levied before city officials had access to autopsy records that showed the deaths of the three women whose bodies were discovered May 14 were linked to the heat. He said the fine was based completely on the violations found during the inspection.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: After years of overcoming legal challenges and governmental hurdles, more than 200 people gathered excitedly Saturday to break ground on the Islamic Life Center in Carmel. “My heart is pounding so fast with no fear or sadness but truly with a feeling of joy and pleasure,” Nadeem Ikhlaque, Al Salam’s founding president, said from a podium at the site of the future center. “In my 54 years of life, I never had this feeling, but today I have – standing in front of you.” Carmel leaders, the Al Salam Foundation, Muslim members, and those from other faith communities and the public broke ground on the city’s first mosque. The center will be under the umbrella of the foundation, which is an Islamic nonprofit organization. “We are practicing our faith rituals – daily and weekly prayers, nightly prayers, fasting through the month of Ramadan,” Ashhar Madni, president of the Al Salam Foundation, told the crowd. “The other half of our faith is to do good deeds. ... While we worship our creator, we need to serve his creation as well.” The road to this point was not a straight line and showed the clash that can occur as cities become more diverse. While city, community and religious leaders largely supported the project, many Carmel residents of different cultural and religious backgrounds in nearby upscale neighborhoods protested against it, saying they were largely concerned with property values. Center members said Saturday that they looked forward to being a good and inviting neighbor.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Agriculture officials said Monday that another commercial egg farm in the state has been infected with bird flu – the first commercial farm case identified since April, when a turkey farm was infected. The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa, about 80 miles north of Des Moines, housing about 1.1 million chickens. Iowa has had 15 commercial farms infected this year, including turkeys, egg-laying hens and other chickens. In addition, five backyard flocks have been infected. Because the virus is highly contagious, all birds on an infected farm are killed and disposed of to avoid the spread of the disease. Iowa has been hardest hit with bird losses at more than 13.3 million this year before the latest farm was found infected. Nationally more than 47.7 million birds have been affected in 43 states that includes 251 commercial flocks and 328 backyard flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show. Most of the Iowa cases were during the spring migration of wild birds in March and April with one reported in early May. The virus hadn’t been detected again until a backyard flock was infected Oct. 20, and then the latest infection was confirmed Monday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s top elections official warned voters Monday that text messages from outside the state were giving them incorrect information about where to vote, but groups involved in the texting said they weren’t trying to confuse or mislead people. Several Democrats said they began hearing about the texts Sunday or had received them. Each message said it was from a representative of Voting Futures, Voto Latino or Black Voters Matter and provided the address of a voting site, with a picture of a building. In some cases, the person already had voted; in others, people couldn’t vote in advance at the listed site, and in some, people could vote in advance there, but not on Election Day, Nov. 8. Movement Labs, a vendor headquartered in Oakland, California, working for both Voto Latino and Black Voters Matter, tweeted that texts also went to voters in Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia. Kansas Democrats who learned of the texts worried that a disinformation campaign had targeted their voters in hopes of preventing their ballots from counting or discouraging them from voting. And Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican, said voters should be on “high alert” about potential election misinformation from such texts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Former U.S. Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., whose tenacity and personal integrity formed the foundation of a long career in politics and public service, died Tuesday at his home in Louisville. He was one day shy of his 90th birthday. Charlie Mattingly, his former chief of staff, said Mazzoli’s mental acuity never waned, although his health declined, particularly in recent months. Throughout his 24 years in the House, Mazzoli defied the usual stereotypical descriptions applied to political figures. His unpredictable voting patterns occasionally prompted the casual observer describe him as a maverick, a term Mazzoli disliked. “I don’t like labels,” he said in 1988. “I don’t consider myself anything but thoughtful.” Mazzoli’s nature frequently put him in conflict with his party on issues of substance and matters of conscience. Although he pledged in his first House speech to support the Equal Rights Amendment, he alienated women’s groups that were trying to keep the amendment alive in 1983 by voting to defeat an ERA resolution. He said Democratic leaders had not provided enough time to discuss its impact on abortion and women in the draft. A devout Catholic, Mazzoli strongly opposed abortion, putting him at odds with members of his party’s liberal Washington establishment. He frequently angered organized labor by refusing to support protectionist legislation and voted once to support the veto of a Democratic bill to raise the minimum wage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nFerriday: The family of legendary rock ’n’ roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis has announced details of memorial services planned this weekend for his birthplace. Lewis, known for hits such as “Great Balls of Fire” and many others, died Friday at age 87. The funeral service is set for 11 a.m. Central Daylight Time on Saturday at Young’s Funeral Home in Ferriday, family members said. There will be very limited public availability, but the ceremony will be livestreamed, with details to be announced later on Lewis’ Facebook page. A private burial will follow. A celebration of life is also planned for 1 p.m. that day at the Arcade Theater in Ferriday, Lewis’ representatives said. Lewis was the last survivor of a generation of artists that rewrote music history, a group that included Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nMaine\n\nEtna: A 74-year-old man who spent nearly 30 hours lost in the woods was hypothermic and unable to move when he was found by a game warden using a tracking dog, officials said. Joseph Nolin knew his ordeal was over when he heard a bell attached to the Labrador retriever’s collar, and then the dog bounded up and started licking him Monday afternoon, his son told wardens. Nolin walked until he couldn’t move and told wardens he wouldn’t have survived another night in the woods. He was found a mile from his house deep in the woods at the edge of the Etna Bog, officials said. A Maine Forest Service helicopter was used to retrieve Nolin, and he was released after being hydrated and warmed up, officials said. Nolen had been last seen Sunday morning, when he departed to check on game cameras in the woods. He son reported him missing Sunday evening.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: A representative for the company staging a Halloween magic performance at Six Flags America says an emergency call that medics described as a serious injury caused by sword swallowing was caused by an “unrelated medical condition,” WUSA-TV reports. The call for help came from Six Flags in Bowie between 9:30 and 10 p.m. Saturday evening. “It was not for an accident during the show but rather for other unrelated health conditions,” said Josh Bowren, production manager for Aaron Radatz Productionz, which staged the show, according to Six Flags officials. Bowren did not name the actor, whom he described as “our sword swallower,” and authorities have not released the name of the injured person. The performer was a 59-year-old man who was in serious but not life-threatening condition when he was transported to Capital Region Health Hospital in Largo on Saturday night, rescuers said. Rescuers described the weapon to medical workers as “a haunted house sword” and said it occurred during a “Halloween show.” A spokesperson for Six Flags said the company’s “thoughts and prayers are with the performer and his family.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A retired state trooper who was killed in what authorities described as a shooting motivated by racism and an officer who drowned while trying to save the life of a teenager were honored Tuesday with awards for exemplary acts of bravery. A total of 32 Massachusetts law enforcement personnel were named recipients of the annual George L. Hanna Memorial Award for Bravery by Gov. Charlie Baker during a ceremony at Mechanics Hall in Worcester. Hanna was a state trooper shot and killed during a traffic stop in Auburn in 1983. Two of his children participated in Tuesday’s ceremony. “Like Trooper George Hanna, the dedicated women and men in law enforcement perform exceptional work guided by their deeply rooted commitment to helping others, no matter the risk to themselves,” Baker said in a statement. Retired state Trooper David L. Green, 68, left his Winthrop home in June 2021 to investigate a truck crash and was shot multiple times by a white man who authorities say had expressed antisemitic and anti-Black views. Green and Ramona Cooper, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran, were killed. Both were Black.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The family of Porter Burks, a Black man fatally shot during an early morning confrontation with Detroit police, is suing the city for $50 million, their lawyer announced Tuesday. Five unnamed officers also are named in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Tuesday by attorney Geoffrey Fieger. It claims gross negligence and assault and battery, among other things. Burks’ Oct. 2 death was recorded by police body cameras as officers pleaded with him to drop a knife he was carrying. They initially were called to a home on the west side about a knife-wielding man who was having a mental health crisis and spoke to a man who identified himself as Burks’ brother. The man said Burks had slashed the tires on his car. “Drop the knife for me, man. Come here real quick. You’re OK,” a member of the Detroit Police Department’s crisis intervention team can be heard telling Burks. “You’re not in any trouble. Can you just talk to me and drop the knife?” “You’re not in any trouble, OK?” the officer continued. “I just want to help you. I just want to help you, man. OK? Can you just drop the knife for me please? Please? Whatever you’re going through, I can help you.” Burks – who police say had schizophrenia – was shot as he sprinted toward officers from the middle of the street.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: A man is accused of fatally shooting his daughter’s boyfriend who he suspected was abusing her. The 45-year-old Brainerd father is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Bryce Brogle, who was reported missing after going to the man’s storage unit Oct. 26. According to a criminal complaint, the father shot Brogle in the back of the head from a distance and then buried his body in Crow Wing County. The defendant’s daughter reported her boyfriend missing Oct. 28, telling police he hadn’t been seen since he went to the storage unit with her father. Investigators executed a search warrant Oct. 29 at the storage unit and said they found the presence of blood and bleach on the concrete floor and signs something had been dragged across the floor. The following day, law enforcement officers searched land in Crow Wing County on foot and found a grave site. The complaint said that after it was excavated, they found a body with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. An autopsy confirmed it was Brogle. According to the charges, the landlord for Brogle and his girlfriend called the sheriff’s office, saying the father has asked if Brogle had hurt his daughter. The landlord said his daughter had been seen with two black eyes. The complaint said the father then told the landlord he was going to kill Brogle, and he’d already dug a hole.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Monday that the city’s water is safe to drink, after months of sampling at a treatment plant overwhelmed by August flooding that caused wide supply disruptions. The beleaguered O.B. Curtis water treatment plant fell into crisis after the late summer flooding left 150,000 people without running water for several days. People waited in lines for water to drink, bathe, cook and flush toilets. The crisis also added to the rising costs for business owners already saddled with a labor shortage and high inflation. The city had already been under a boil-water notice since late July because the state health department found cloudy water that could make people ill. But current water samples pass muster for safe consumption, the EPA said. “Current sampling confirms water delivered from J.H. Fewell Water and O.B. Curtis Water Treatment is safe to drink,” said Maria Michalos, a spokesperson for the EPA, referring to the city’s two water treatment plants. The agency encouraged Jackson residents to stay vigilant about updates and follow all future boil water advisories, as “localized issues” may resurface. It is not yet certain whether Jackson has too much lead and copper in its water. Sampling has been completed, and results are expected in mid-November.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state’s health department is investigating whether a hospital violated federal health care rules in denying a woman an emergency abortion, an agency spokeswoman confirmed Monday. Missouri Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox in a statement said the agency launched an investigation into southern Missouri’s Freeman Health System’s treatment of Mylissa Farmer. Farmer, who is from Joplin, told the Associated Press she went to the system’s local emergency room when her water broke months early Aug. 2. She said tests showed she had lost all of her amniotic fluid because of a pregnancy complication, and doctors told her the fetus was not expected to survive. Doctors also told Farmer that “awaiting a medical emergency may put her at further risk for maternal mortality” or the removal of her uterus, medical records show. But because her fetus still had a heartbeat, and her condition wasn’t considered a life-threatening medical emergency at that moment, they couldn’t terminate the pregnancy in Missouri, they told her. She eventually got an abortion in Illinois. Records from that visit say doctors told Farmer that the law supersedes their medical judgment, and “contrary to the most appropriate management based (on) my medical opinion, due to the legal language of MO law, we are unable to offer induction of labor at this time.” “They were telling me to basically get out of the state to get the care that I needed,” the 41-year-old told AP.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A woman was cited for animal cruelty Thursday for shooting and skinning a 6-month-old husky and posting pictures of herself with the animal online bragging that she had shot a young wolf, officials said. The husky was among a group of 18 dogs and puppies, including German shepherd mixes, that had been abandoned on national forest land in northwestern Montana in mid-September, the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office has said. The investigation led the woman to be cited with a misdemeanor and not charged with a felony because officers believe they can prove negligence but not intent, the Sheriff’s Office told NBC Montana. The citation gives the woman two weeks to appear in Justice Court, Officer Paul Charbonneau said. The Flathead County Animal Shelter cared for the dogs, some of which had parvo, a viral infection that causes vomiting and diarrhea. Charbonneau said he believed all the dogs had been adopted.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Halloween celebration turned frantic after a man drove through a barricaded area and was shot by a police officer Monday night, police said. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the shooting occurred during the popular annual “Halloween on the Boulevard” block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood in Omaha. Children and adults were out in the neighborhood trick-or-treating when a car drove recklessly through a blocked-off area shortly after 7 p.m., Omaha Police Lt. Neal Bonacci said. The driver of the vehicle was shot by an Omaha police officer and taken to Nebraska Medical Center with serious injuries. The name of the driver has not yet been released. Police say no one else was injured. Chrissy Lopez, a resident of the neighborhood, told the Omaha World-Herald that the vehicle initially drove slowly through the crowd as people yelled at the driver to stop. “He would stop and then drive a little more,” she said. “I heard his engine rev, and people started screaming, and I thought, ‘Oh no.’ And then I heard the gunshots, and everybody just started screaming and running and crying.” Police and firefighters were already on the scene for the block party, which is put on by the Miller Park Minne Lusa Neighborhood Association and draws thousands of people to the area each year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Republican National Committee is asking a judge to order election officials in Las Vegas to hire more GOP poll workers to correct what a legal filing calls a disproportionate imbalance favoring Democrats. A Clark County District Court judge is scheduled Wednesday to consider accusations that county elections chief Joe Gloria “stacked” a key ballot signature verification board with 23 Democrats, 33 nonpartisans and “a mere” eight Republicans. Dan Kulin, spokesman for Gloria, declined Monday to comment on a matter pending before a judge. “The registrar’s lopsided staffing of the signature verification board is not remotely ‘as equal as possible’ ” under state law, attorneys representing the RNC alleged in a document filed Friday. “He created a signature verification board with a partisan makeup that tilts sharply against Republicans.” Judge Timothy Williams had signed off Oct. 5 on a pact between the two sides after the county agreed to provide to the RNC a roster showing job titles and political party affiliations of poll workers. The RNC dropped a demand to obtain workers’ names. Voter registration leans Democratic in Clark County, the most populous area of Nevada and home to nearly 1.3 million, or more than 71%, of the state’s 1.8 million active registered voters.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A U.S. House candidate on the ballot in next week’s election would be the youngest woman ever in Congress if she wins. Karoline Leavitt recalls being in her college dining hall in 2018, filling out an application for a White House intern job while her friends were tailgating at a football game. “I remember thinking, ‘If I made this opportunity, it’s worth missing any football game in the world,’ ” she told the Associated Press in an interview She got the job. That eventually led to a position in President Donald Trump’s White House press office, then another as communications director for Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. Inspired by Stefanik, the youngest woman elected to Congress when she won in 2014 at age 30, Leavitt is now running for a House seat of her own. At age 25, she could make history on Election Day: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., won at 29 in 2018. Leavitt, an unabashed pro-Trump Republican, would also be the youngest person in the next session of Congress if she were to defeat two-term Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in one of the most competitive races this year. Leavitt is seven months younger then fellow Gen Z candidate Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat favored in his race. Leavitt won her 10-way Republican primary in September in part by going to the right of the other candidates. “I consistently continue to be the only candidate in this race who says that I believe the 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump,” she said during a debate.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: While COVID-19 has been at the forefront of health concerns for more than two years, another group of infections has continued to spread among New Jersey residents. Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis have become more prevalent among adults and teens over the past decade, according to data from the New Jersey Health Department. Incidences of the three infections rose 40% between 2012 and 2019, according to state data. While it caused a small drop-off in disease rates, the COVID-19 pandemic failed to significantly slow down the spread of sexually transmitted infections across the state, said Dr. Edward Liu, the infectious disease section chief at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. “Even during the pandemic … their behaviors didn’t change that much,” he said. “Or maybe they were so cooped up that they had to have some type of outlet.” While rates of infection for chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis did drop during 2020, the rate still exceeded the rate for 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Although all three infections are treatable with certain antibiotics, experts worry that they may soon run out of medications capable of treating gonorrhea. Greta Anschuetz, the assistant acting commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Health who leads the division of HIV, STD and TB Services, said her office is concerned about the infection. “Gonorrhea has figured out how to be resistant to every drug, and we’re on the last of the (known, effective) drugs,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A sheriff’s department has submitted its investigative findings to prosecutors in the death of a cinematographer shot and killed by Alec Baldwin on a film set in New Mexico in October 2021. Santa Fe Sheriff’s Office spokesman Juan Ríos said Thursday that two binders of information were turned over to the Santa Fe-based district attorney’s office, without setting forth any recommendations about possible criminal charges. He said the case file outlines all the evidence collected, including investigative interviews and forensic analysis of physical evidence by the FBI. District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said through a spokeswoman that investigators and prosecutors will now begin a thorough review to make a timely decision about whether to bring charges, without mention of specific deadlines. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded by a gunshot during setup for a scene in the western movie “Rust” at a filmset ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The debut of a giant “Bluey” balloon, Lea Michele and the Broadway cast of “Funny Girl,” and the legendary Dionne Warwick are some of the highlights slated for this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year’s parade – the 96th annual – will feature 16 giant character balloons, 28 floats, 40 novelty and heritage inflatables, 12 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups and, of course, Santa Claus. New balloon giants joining the line-up Nov. 24 include Stuart the one-eyed Minion from “Despicable Me 2”; a new green dinosaur, an Apatosaurus; the debut of the animated sensation “Bluey”; and a new “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” balloon. Other celebrities slated to be on hand include Paula Abdul, making her parade debut; Fitz and the Tantrums; Big Time Rush; “Blue’s Clues & You!” host Josh Dela Cruz; Gloria Estefan along with her daughter, Emily, and grandson, Sasha; Kirk Franklin; Mario Lopez; Ziggy Marley; and Miss America 2022 Emma Broyles. The singers Joss Stone, Jordin Sparks and Betty Who will all be part of the festivities, as will the stars of Peacock’s “Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin” – Adam Devine, Sarah Hyland and Flula Borg. Jimmy Fallon & The Roots will be on a float celebrating Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday announced a new commission tasked with making recommendations on changing how the boards guiding the University of North Carolina system and its 17 member schools are chosen, bidding to broaden their membership by political leanings, race and gender. The Democratic governor essentially blamed the Republican-controlled Legislature for contributing to problems within the governing structure of one of the country’s leading public university systems – with 240,000 students and UNC-Chapel Hill and N.C. State University as its flagship campuses. “The UNC system is the envy of the nation for what we have built here,” Cooper said at an Executive Mansion news conference. “But there are signs of trouble that come when all of the appointed leaders are chosen by too few … we have an appointed university leadership that doesn’t come close to reflecting our diversity.” As a reminder of partisanship he blames for the system’s stumbling, Cooper stood beside commission co-chairs Tom Ross and Margaret Spellings, two recent UNC system presidents. Both got pushed out in different ways by previous editions of the UNC Board of Governors that were controlled by GOP-approved members.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A judge ruled Monday that he will keep the state’s ban on abortion from taking effect, saying there’s a “substantial probability” that a constitutional challenge to the law will succeed. Judge Bruce Romanick’s ruling means abortion is still legal in North Dakota, though the state’s only clinic – the Red River Women’s Clinic of Fargo – shut down as it challenged the ban and has moved across the border to neighboring Minnesota. Romanick last month rejected a request from North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley to let the law take effect while the Red River clinic’s lawsuit went forward. Romanick based his earlier decision on several factors, but Wrigley argued he had not sufficiently considered the clinic’s chances of prevailing in court. The North Dakota Supreme Court agreed and told Romanick to take another look. In his earlier ruling, Romanick noted the clinic’s uphill battle. But in his ruling Monday, he said the clinic has a “substantial probability” of succeeding, though he noted that the question of whether abortion is a constitutional right in North Dakota has been contentious and has not been decided by the state’s highest court.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A man was arrested Saturday at the Hamilton County Board of Elections after officials say he yelled through a megaphone on the premises and refused to leave. Stephan Pryor, 43, of Over-the-Rhine, is charged with criminal trespassing after the weekend incident at the Norwood facility. Officers engaged with Pryor about 1:30 p.m., while early in-person voting was underway for the day. According to board of elections director Sherry Poland, the board implemented a policy in March banning the use of bullhorns on the premises because they can be heard inside. Ohio law prohibits campaigning inside a polling location. Pryor was reportedly asked to stop using the bullhorn and to leave the property. He refused, Poland said, and Norwood police responded to ask him to leave. He was arrested after refusing again, an incident report says. In an interview Monday evening, Pryor said after he cast a ballot, he went to advertise candidates as he often does for elections. It is not the first time he’s used a megaphone at the facility, he said. He said he was standing the proper distance from the building and didn’t break laws regarding polling place advertisements. He cited that the board’s recent rule regarding megaphones is not protected directly by Ohio Revised Code. “They did me wrong. They arrested me in front of everybody – that was wrong,” Pryor said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nRamona: A ranch with a history of exorcisms is being revamped into a resort. When Amber Stewart found out that Tri County Technology Center was selling a 114-acre property just off Highway 75, she leapt at the opportunity to own the land despite its history. “My husband (David) and I had wanted to buy it for years and years and years,” Amber Stewart said. “It was something that we had talked about, dreamed about and didn’t really think would come to fruition. But when we found out the property was for sale, we were feeling like this is the Lord’s will for us.” Jarrett Farm Resort, 24 miles north of Tulsa, has a history as a commercial property tracing back to the 1940s. It’s been a commercial farm, a conference and retreat center and, for a few years, home to an order of Catholic priests known for performing exorcisms. The Stewarts hope to restore its reputation as a vacation getaway, but it has been an immense challenge. “There were dead mice and large spiders ... there was a raccoon living in the attic,” Amber Stewart said. The Stewarts actually spent the first night of their honeymoon 20 years ago during its previous iteration as a resort. The Catholic Diocese of Tulsa then purchased Jarrett Farm and used it from 2014 to 2018 as a home for an order of priests known for performing exorcisms, according to county records and reports from the diocese. The Stewarts have faced a mix of curiosity and resistance from some residents in Ramona’s small community, but they intend to “honor the story” of Jarrett Farm.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s pioneering motor voter program, in which residents who interact with the motor vehicle division are automatically registered to vote, hit a minor software speed bump, but Oregon’s secretary of state said Monday that it’s being resolved. Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said the Oregon Elections Division on Friday discovered the software error, which for the past six years has failed to preregister some 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. “As a result, 7,767 eligible voters in Oregon … were not given the opportunity to become automatically registered voters for the 2022 election. The issue has impacted voters during the last three election cycles,” Fagan’s office said in a statement. Fagan will direct Oregon’s 36 county clerks to issue ballots to affected voters – those who will be 18 or older Nov. 8. “Eligible voters not receiving their ballots in Oregon is unacceptable,” Fagan’s statement said. “As long as I am Oregon’s Secretary of State, I will do everything in my power to ensure that no eligible voters are disenfranchised.” The Oregon Elections Division was alerted to the issue by a voter who didn’t receive a ballot. Fagan said her technical staff worked through the weekend to resolve the software error.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nStroudsburg: Prosecutors say they have found no evidence of criminal negligence in a gas main rupture under an eastern Pennsylvania roadway and a subsequent fatal single-vehicle crash early on Christmas Day almost two years ago. The Monroe County district attorney’s office said Monday that all parties involved were cooperative in the investigation into the Pocono Township rupture and crash on Route 314 that killed 33-year-old Ana Abreu, of New York City. Township police said Abreu, her husband, their 2-month-old child and another family member were in a sport utility vehicle heading north toward the intersection with Route 611 about 1:30 a.m. on Christmas morning in 2020. Police said a natural gas main beneath the roadway ruptured, flipping the SUV over onto its roof and killing Abreu. The rupture left a large hole in the road, exposing the gas main underneath and a fracture in the pipeline, prosecutors said. A UGI Utilities spokesperson told LehighValleyLive.com that the company was “encouraged” by the decision but declined additional comment.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Bus drivers have reached a tentative settlement with their employer, First Student, avoiding a strike that was scheduled to begin Wednesday. The bus drivers, monitors and aides are members of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union. The strike would have affected bus drivers in Lincoln, West Warwick and the state bus yard in Cranston, who transport students with special needs, among others. The settlement includes a four-year contract that provides a fair wage increase and an increase in guaranteed hours, the union said. The 275 members of the union are expected to ratify the contract, at which time more details will be provided. “I’ve been a school bus driver for 13 years, and many of the kids I transport have special physical and behavioral needs that require special accommodations and increased attention,” said Mike McDermott, a bus driver at the metro yard in Cranston. “We are happy that First Student was finally willing to come to the table with proposals that will help us better take care of our families and do our jobs. Even before the pandemic, First Student could not recruit bus drivers, monitors to do this work, and we are hopeful that better hours and pay will go a long way in attracting more workers to the field. At the end of the day, it’s our students who benefit most.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGrenville: Voters in Greenville County will be allowed to wear “Black Lives Matter” and “Make America Great Again” paraphernalia to the polls this Election Day, according to a notice sent to poll workers by county Elections Director Conway Belangia. He said the county’s decision is the result of a court ruling in Minnesota allowing the same practice. He said the American Civil Liberties Union alerted the county to the ruling. The county attorney was brought in to review the situation, and he determined the Minnesota court ruling, which found BLM and MAGA gear should not be considered prohibited campaign materials, applied to Greenville County. Belangia said the change of interpretation applies only to voters in Greenville County, but the state election commission had previously ruled in a similar manner. The county was a “Johnny-come-lately” in its determination to allow BLM and MAGA gear, Belangia said. Voters are still prohibited from wearing gear for any specific candidate inside polling places.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a lower court’s decision to block parts of a South Dakota law that would have required ballot petition workers to publicly disclose their personal identification information. The Republican-controlled Legislature in 2020 passed a law that would have required paid ballot measure circulators to list their personal information, including phone number, residential address, email address and driver’s license information, in a directory. The law was just one attempt by lawmakers in recent years to add barriers to ballot measures, which have given progressive causes a chance at enactment in the politically red state. Circuit Judge Steven Grasz wrote in an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that being forced to disclose the information would be “chilling in today’s world” and the law would violate the First Amendment. United States District Judge Lawrence Piersol issued a temporary injunction against the law last year. Dakotans for Health, an organization that was formed around a ballot measure to expand Medicaid eligibility, sued to have the law overturned. The organization is now focused on placing a proposed constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot to codify abortion rights.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A man accused of intentionally setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic and of firing shots later at a federal courthouse died months ago, officials announced Monday in disclosing both the man’s death and the allegations. Federal court documents indicate that the man, Mark Thomas Reno, 64, died Aug. 15. Yet many of the documents in his case were sealed until this week, including records showing he had been arrested in connection with the Planned Parenthood arson fire. “The government’s investigation has revealed that (Reno) engaged in a series of violent acts of property destruction in Knoxville since early 2021,” a newly unsealed complaint said. The complaint said Reno fired a shotgun at the clinic’s doors in early 2021, shattering glass and leaving holes in the reception area. Reno then set the clinic ablaze in December 2021, the document said. The building was unoccupied during the fire but had to be closed for months to undergo an $2.2 million renovation. Other court documents show that the FBI began surveillance of Reno in April of this year after he told an undercover agent he belonged to a group with a mission to resist actions opposed to Catholic orthodoxy. The agent was secretly recording Reno, who said that his group had “plenty of targets,” according to the documents.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The leaders of a group that promotes election conspiracy theories were jailed Monday for not complying with a court order to provide information in a defamation lawsuit over some of their claims. Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, who run True the Vote, were ordered detained by U.S. marshals, according to an order signed by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston. They will be held for at least one day or “until they fully comply with the Court’s Order,” Hoyt wrote. Houston-based True the Vote provided research for a debunked documentary that alleged widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Engelbrecht, Phillips and their nonprofit organization are being sued by Michigan-based election software provider Konnech Inc. over True the Vote’s claims of a Chinese-related conspiracy involving U.S. poll workers’ information. Alfredo Perez, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Houston, said Monday that Engelbrecht and Phillips were in the law enforcement agency’s custody. True the Vote said in a statement read during a video livestream Monday that its attorneys would appeal Hoyt’s ruling.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: For years, water conservation advocates have urged the state to offer money to residents to incentivize them to remove their lawns. For some, at least, that proposal came closer to reality Friday, with water officials set to start taking applications for a pilot program that could pay up to $1 per square foot to Utahns who want to replace their water-guzzling grass with drought-resistant landscaping. The Legislature earlier this year approved a $5 million expenditure to fund a statewide grass removal rebate program. State water officials plan a full launch of the program next spring via a new website, UtahWaterSavers.com, but in the meantime, residents can apply for the pilot program on the Utah Division of Water Resources website, conservewater.utah.gov/grass-removal-rebates, with a limited number of spaces available. Applicants who are approved get a year to complete their landscaping project as long as they meet the criteria, which include requirements for the type of replacement landscaping allowed in each part of the state. Turf removal programs have proven successful in desert cities like Las Vegas, dropping per-capita use, but have been slow to develop in Utah, with water managers often citing a lack of funding.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: In a national assessment of learning, Vermont student performance in math and reading was about average compared to the nation but continued a downward trend the state has seen on national standardized tests since before COVID-19. Vermont students predictably performed below 2019 levels – the last time the test was administered – in math and reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress test and in most cases aligned with the average U.S. score. The test was administered to fourth and eighth graders in math and reading. The test is usually given every two years as a way to measure national and statewide progress over time but was postponed in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Vermont, 202 schools participated in 2022. For the second time in a row, Vermont’s fourth grade math scores dipped below the national average, albeit by one point. Vermont fourth graders’ math scores fell five points overall compared to 2019. This year’s score was 234 on a scale of 500. Math proficiency for both fourth and eighth graders in Vermont had been increasing from the mid-1990s until about 2013, when the scores turned the other direction, and have been in a gradual decline ever since. In 2022, about 35% of fourth grade students were proficient in math.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: In the past four years, the state has seen opioid overdose deaths among Black residents more than triple – the highest death rate, by far, of any demographic. The numbers underscore the lethality of a fentanyl-polluted drug supply, as well as structural barriers to entering recovery, a critical first step in preventing fatal overdose, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The numbers – made publicly available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention death certificate database – tell the story of a striking rise, particularly in the Richmond metropolitan area. Chesterfield County had 34 deaths in 2021, up from 11 in 2018. Henrico County spiked similarly, up to 44 deaths from 14, and Richmond accounted for 135 deaths, up from 41 deaths in 2018. The spike was more acute in Richmond than in any other county in the state. “It desensitizes you to death,” said Darryl Cousins, whocounts three friends who have died of an overdose in the past two months. Cousins, a Black man, works for Starfish Recovery and Wellness, a Richmond-based recovery residence for people with addiction. He’s been sober for 15 years, he said, and shares a long view on how the city has changed in that time. Most frightening is the drug that seems to be everywhere these days. “All of a sudden it’s in every drug being sold,” Cousins said. “Fentanyl has taken over the drug world.”\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: A flatbed truck carrying 500 gallons of liquid detergent hit the median on Highway 3 on Monday evening near Gorst, spilling the fluid onto the road and then into the Puget Sound. The crash near milepost 35 was reported at 5:40 p.m. and cleared about 7 p.m., blocking traffic in each direction for the duration, according to Washington State Patrol Trooper Katherine Weatherwax. The driver told investigators he fell asleep, Weatherwax said. The state Department of Ecology was notified. The detergent that spilled is designed to clean trucks.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State transportation officials say construction has begun on a full-service Division of Motor Vehicles regional office in Morgan County. The new office being built in Berkeley Springs will bring additional driver’s licensing and vehicle services to the citizens of the Eastern Panhandle, officials said in a news release Thursday. It is expected to open in the spring of 2023. “We know how busy our Martinsburg and Charles Town Regional Offices are on a daily basis,” said Everett Frazier, commissioner of the state’s Division Of Motor Vehicles. “Population continues to grow in that location, and opening an office in Morgan County will help us to provide accessible, more efficient and convenient customer service to that area.” A staff of a dozen people or more could be employed at the Morgan County office, and hiring will begin soon, Frazier said. Full-service DMV regional offices offer driver’s license skills testing, written knowledge tests, vehicle registration renewals, title work and other services. A motorcycle course will also be built at the new office.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Monday scheduled a two-day sentencing hearing for a man who killed six people when he drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee last year. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow set Darrell Brooks’ sentencing for Nov. 15-16 to accommodate dozens of people who want to speak at the proceeding. Prosecutors told the judge they expect at least 36 people will speak. Brooks said he anticipates about 20 people will speak on his behalf. A jury last Wednesday convicted Brooks of 76 counts in connection with the Nov. 21, 2021, incident in Waukesha. The charges include six counts of first-degree intentional homicide and 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety. Each homicide count carries a mandatory life sentence, although Dorow can decide whether Brooks could be released on extended supervision at some point. Each endangerment count carries a maximum sentence of 171/ 2 years.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A contentious “glamping” development is in question again, with Teton County officials saying they might force a pause to construction underway near Teton Village, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. County commissioners warned the companies involved might be told to obtain county permits in the wake of opposition from neighbors and advocates worried about the effects on the land and water supplies, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}]}

Cottrell claimed that Christianity continues to play a major role in secular society, especially during the current cost-of-living crisis, when “people right across the country, some in desperate need, will be turning to their local church, not only for spiritual hope but practical help”.\n\nThis is ultimately a functionalist view of religion, “that a shared faith serves the needs of a society”, said Sumit Paul-Choudhury for BBC Future.\n\n“Under this argument, any religion that does endure has to offer its adherents tangible benefits,” he said. The alternative “we take for granted” but are “also oddly blind to”, he added, is that “religions are born, grow and die”.\n\nIn the 1960s, when asked whether he thought the church would survive, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey replied: “Well, you know, that is not certain. Not certain, not certain at all. It might easily, quite easily, just fall away.”\n\n“All Christian denominations are in long-term decline, but the established church particularly so,” concluded the New European. “On current projections, Ramsey’s prediction may even come true within 40 years.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/uk/royal-racism-row-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Another scandal has engulfed Buckingham Palace. Does the British ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritain’s royal hierarchy has changed dramatically in the past several weeks, after King Charles III became the country’s first new monarch for seven decades and several of his relatives stepped into new roles.\n\nBut there is a troubling familiarity to the first major crisis to grip the newly reorganized institution.\n\nThe royals are once again battling serious allegations of racism inside palace walls, after an honorary aide resigned and apologized following complaints that she repeatedly asked a Black British charity boss where she was “really from.”\n\n“It was like an interrogation,” Ngozi Fulani, who runs the domestic violence charity Sistah Space, told BBC Radio 4. “Although it’s not physical violence – it is an abuse.”\n\nThe aide, identified as Lady Susan Hussey in British media, served as the late Queen Elizabeth II’s lady in waiting for more than 60 years and is a godmother to the Prince of Wales.\n\nFulani was attending an event hosted by Camilla, Queen Consort, intended to highlight what she called a “global pandemic” of violence against women, and to celebrate the work of campaigners and charities who tackle the issue.\n\nBut the experience Fulani endured has overshadowed that message. “I have to really question how this can happen in a space that’s supposed to protect women against all kinds of violence,” she told the BBC.\n\nThe timing of the controversy couldn’t have been worse, erupting as it did on the first day of Prince William and Catherine’s visit to the United States for the Earthshot Awards ceremony, their first overseas trip in their new positions. Keen to draw a line under the situation playing out at home, Kensington Palace condemned the remarks of William’s godmother as “unacceptable,” adding that it was “right that the individual concerned has stepped aside with immediate effect.”\n\nNow, the royal institution is facing a fresh round of uncomfortable questions.\n\n“I was shocked. It’s 2022, and somebody can speak like that and think like that,” Diane Abbott, a Labour MP who represents Fulani and the first Black woman elected to the House of Commons in 1987, told CNN. Abbott said the suggestion that a Black person is not truly British is less prevalent today then decades ago, but still exists generationally.\n\n“King Charles III and a lot of people around him are very committed now to modernizing the monarchy. They want to modernize it, they want to keep it relevant,” Abbott said. “But this sort of incident takes them back.”\n\n“Meghan Markle talked about this, and she got roundly abused – and she’s still the target of negativity in the British press,” Abbott added, referring to the Duchess of Sussex. “I think this incident shows that what Meghan Markle was trying to indicate is true.”\n\nNgozi Fulani said the exchange was \"like an interrogation.\" Ken McKay/ITV/Shutterstock\n\nAn increasingly familiar debate\n\nA swell of goodwill surrounded the royals following the Queen’s death, but that sentiment was not limitless and the simple truth remains that the late monarch outshone all of her descendants, including King Charles, in terms of popularity among the public.\n\nIn the wake of his mother’s death, King Charles told religious leaders he felt he had a personal duty to “protect the diversity of our country.” But without the Queen’s unifying presence at the top of “The Firm,” the royals must now respond to serious questions about whether their institution adequately represents a multicultural Britain.\n\nThis was, after all, an aide previously at the heart of the royals’ inner circle. Hussey frequently accompanied Queen Elizabeth II to official engagements, riding alongside her to the funeral service for Prince Philip in 2021. She welcomed prime ministers and dignitaries to Buckingham Palace, stood by the throne at State Openings of Parliament, and was often pictured laughing alongside the matriarch, Charles and other royals at horse-racing events.\n\nBut now, Hussey’s comments have dragged the royal family back into a debate it has sought to dissociate itself from.\n\nQuestions of how robustly the palace confronts racism have swirled since Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, told Oprah Winfrey last year that someone in the family questioned her on the skin tone of her unborn baby.\n\nCNN was told last year that the Queen dispatched Hussey, along with her Dresser Angela Kelly, to offer advice, guidance and tutelage to Meghan after her entry into the royal family – an institution that the duchess has since said ignored her pleas over her mental health and made her feel unwelcome and isolated.\n\nAnd later last year, Britain’s Guardian newspaper unearthed documents, buried in the UK national archives, which revealed that the Queen’s courtiers had banned ethnic minority immigrants and foreigners from holding clerical positions at Buckingham Palace until at least the late 1960s.\n\nLady Susan Hussey was at the very center of the royals' inner circle. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nWhen this emerged, the palace didn’t confirm when this practice had ended but told CNN: “The Royal Household and the Sovereign comply with the provisions of the Equality Act, in principle and in practise. This is reflected in the diversity, inclusion and dignity at work policies, procedures and practises within the Royal Household.”\n\nSuch stories have forced royals to go on the defensive. Prince William told reporters in the aftermath of the Winfrey interview that the royals are “very much not” a racist family; months later, a senior royal representative later said Queen Elizabeth II supported the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAnd royals have since tentatively approached the thorny issue of the monarchy’s historic links to slavery, with then-Prince Charles saying in June that the “time has come” to confront the legacy of the practice. Many activists want more, such as a formal apology from the institution.\n\nIncidents like these recall a number of previous controversies and threaten to undo the efforts of the senior royals to present themselves as in-touch and relevant ambassadors for Britain – a particularly dangerous proposition in the early months of Charles’ reign.\n\nThere is progress – but it’s ‘not fast enough’\n\nHussey’s swift departure, and Kensington Palace’s immediate response, has been noted by some onlookers as a sign that the monarchy is learning from past mistakes.\n\n“A few years ago this incident would have been dismissed and Ngozi would have been regarded as too sensitive,” Abbott told CNN.\n\n“The speed of response this time, and the fact there was an apology and [William’s spokesperson] made a statement, does show that there is some progress on race issues in the royal family,” she said.\n\n“It’s not fast enough,” Abbott added. “I would like to see them have more Black people in the royal household, I would like to see them genuinely open their arms to Meghan Markle, and I would like to see them use their role to try and encourage a genuinely multiracial society.”\n\nOthers have also called for the monarchy to look inward. “There are clues here that this is a pattern; that it’s institutional,” Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality Party who was present at the event and said she witnessed the conversion, told the BBC on Wednesday.\n\n“It really left its mark on me. It left its mark on Ngozi,” she said of the exchange, urging the royal family not to frame the incident as a one-off. “Don’t minimize, don’t deflect,” she said.\n\nAnd however much change is happening inside palace walls, the country is changing faster. On the same day of the Palace reception, results from last year’s national census revealed that people who described themselves as Christian in England and Wales fell from 59% to 46%, the first time it has dipped below half of the population. There was a huge surge in those who said they had no religion, while the number of Muslims rose to 6.5%.\n\nThe Christian faith has legal status in England, with the Church of England as the established church and the monarch as its titular head, the “Defender of the Faith.” The figures provide another example of how cultural attitudes in Britain are shifting away from those in which the monarchy is steeped.\n\nThe palace will hope that public anger over Hussey’s comments will subside following her resignation, but there are more roadbumps ahead. An immaculately timed trailer for the much-hyped Netlix documentary about Harry and Meghan was released on Thursday, with Meghan telling viewers they will “hear our story from us.”\n\nAnd, more significantly, the incident has hinted towards a question that may reappear during Charles’ reign, just as it did at times during his mother’s tenure: Can the royals adapt, or is the institution simply too archaic to represent Britain today?\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the year of Prince Philip’s funeral.

According to the ARK Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 33% of people, in 2019, considered themselves Unionists, 23% identified as nationalists, while 39% regarded themselves as neither.\n\n“Surveys will show you that there is a developing sense of a Northern Irish national identity, but there is no song that encapsulates that or can be seen to encapsulate [it],” Paul Rouse – who wrote Sport and Ireland: A History – tells CNN Sport.\n\nNorthern Ireland's captain Marissa Callaghan challenges Marina Georgieva of Austria during Euro 2022. Graham Hunt/DPPI/Reuters\n\nNorthern Ireland has several national anthems in use across different sports, as well as different configurations of its teams – a relic of how each sport navigated this divide.\n\nEach of these songs occupies a slightly different position in Northern Ireland’s political landscape.\n\nIn rugby, where the team plays as a united Ireland, the Republic of Ireland’s national anthem “Amhrán na bhFiann” (“The Soldier’s Song”) plays at home matches, alongside the specifically commissioned, more inclusive “Ireland’s Call,” which plays at both home and away matches.\n\nAt the Commonwealth Games, the Northern Irish anthem is “Londonderry Air,” while for football, the anthem “God Save the Queen” – with its associations to the British Royal Family – is tied up with the unionist tradition.\n\n“You know, it’s quite sad. Northern Ireland don’t really have their own identity,” Northern Ireland’s captain Marissa Callaghan said in a documentary last year.\n\n“As a Catholic player, unfortunately, I don’t get that experience of standing tall and singing the anthem as loud as you can.\n\n“But it doesn’t take away the pride and the passion and what it means to put on the green shirt. It will take someone to think outside the box, won’t it? And be brave enough to move it forward.”\n\n‘What would happen to international sport in Ireland?’\n\nHistorically, each major sport has found a slightly different place within the Northern Irish landscape.\n\n“The creation of the modern sporting world happened in the 19th century … And when that was happening, Ireland was not partitioned,” says Rouse.\n\nWhen Northern Ireland was officially created on May 3, 1921, following the Irish War of Independence, teams in athletics, rugby and football represented the entire island.\n\n“The question immediately rose up what would happen to international sport in Ireland,” Rouse says. “And it varies from sport to sport.”\n\nThe Irish Football Association (IFA) was, and still is, based in Belfast – the game’s historic heartland where it first entered Ireland.\n\nThe history of Northern Ireland's football team is complex.

Euro 2022 has already set attendance records – around 450,000 tickets were sold before the tournament – while more than 91,000 fans twice piled into the Camp Nou to watch Barcelona Femení earlier this year.\n\nAn official song – “Girl Got Game” by Jessica Hammond – has also been released to support the team and highlight women’s football.\n\nJulie Nelson scored Northern Ireland's first ever goal during the UEFA Women's Euro 2022.

This means that approximately one million children attend Church of England schools and around 15 million people alive today went to a Church of England school.\n\nMany church schools are state-funded and this has caused tension because exemptions to the Equality Act allow state faith schools to “use religion to discriminate over which pupils they admit, who they employ and what they teach”, wrote Andrew Penman in the Mirror.\n\nHe added that he “had to pretend to be Anglican for several years” so his children could get into the local primary school, “where the Church of England monopolised half the places”.\n\nSome have pointed to a wider influence the church has on education. The Observer’s Harriet Sherwood noted the legal requirement for every state school to hold an act of daily worship that is “broadly Christian in character”.\n\nHow does the Church influence politics?\n\nUnder current rules, 26 bishops are guaranteed seats in the House of Lords. The archbishops of Canterbury and York, the bishops of London, Durham and Winchester and 21 other bishops in order of seniority together form the “Lords Spiritual”, explained the UK Parliament website.\n\nThis clerical influence on law-making has provoked criticism. There are “only two countries in the world that automatically give places in their parliaments to clerics”, wrote Penman: “Iran, that bastion of religious brutality”, and the United Kingdom.

She had shot herself in the heart with their father’s hunting rifle weeks after their church excommunicated her for getting engaged to a man who was not a Jehovah’s Witness.\n\nFor Sawyer — who sat on the bedroom floor near her sister's body for hours that day, waiting for her mother to come home from her door-to-door missionary work — it was the beginning of a long, painful journey that would one day tear her family apart.\n\nYears later, Sawyer got excommunicated, too, after seeking a divorce from an abusive husband. She ended up leaving the husband — and the faith.\n\n► March 12:Kaylee Muthart explains what made her pull out her eyes\n\n► March 12:Oregon couple’s final days captured in intimate aid-in-dying video\n\n► Feb. 20:Did shunning from Jehovah's Witnesses drive mom to murder-suicide?\n\nHer family cut all ties.\n\n“Jehovah’s Witness kids grow up knowing that if they ever mess up, their parents will leave them — and that’s scary,” Sawyer, now 38, said in a recent interview from her home in Pascagoula, Miss. “The shunning is supposed to make us miss them so much that we’ll come back. … It didn’t work.”\n\nSawyer and many others like her now are denouncing the church's shunning practices in wake of a recent murder-suicide in Keego Harbor, Mich., that killed a family of four former Jehovah’s Witnesses who were ostracized after leaving the faith.\n\n► Feb. 11:As details of Burning Man suicide emerge, family grieves anew\n\n► Dec. 13: Lawmaker dies of suicide days after being accused of sexual abuse\n\nThe deaths sparked outrage among scores of ex-practitioners of the faith nationwide who took to Facebook, online forums, blogs and YouTube, arguing that the tragedy highlights a pervasive yet rarely publicized problem within the church: Shunning is pushing the most vulnerable people over the edge and tearing families apart, they say.\n\nIn the Michigan case, a distraught mother shot and killed her husband, her two grown children and herself in their home about 25 miles northwest of Detroit, shocking the small and quiet community.\n\nThey chose to leave\n\nThe shooter was Lauren Stuart, a part-time model and personal trainer who struggled with depression and spent much of her time working on her house, her friends said. She and her husband, Daniel Stuart, 47, left the Jehovah's Witnesses faith more than a decade ago over doctrinal and social issues.\n\nAmong them was their desire to send their kids to college, which many former Jehovah's Witnesses say the church frowns and views as spiritually dangerous.\n\n“University and college campuses are notorious for bad behavior​ — drug and alcohol abuse, immorality, cheating, hazing, and the list goes on,” read an Oct. 1, 2005, article in Watchtower, the church's official publication that is not available online until 2008 editions.\n\n► Nov. 20:How other countries can help us understand U.S. mass shooting crisis\n\n► Oct. 14:Mom kills 2 sons, herself. But why did she do it?\n\nThe Stuarts sent both their kids to college: Steven Stuart, 27, excelled in computers, just like his father, who was a data solutions architect for the University of Michigan Medical School. Bethany Stuart, 24, thrived in art and graphic design.\n\nAfter the parents left the faith, the Stuarts were ostracized by the members of the Kingdom Hall — the churches where Jehovah's Witnesses worship — in nearby Union Lake, Mich., and their families, friends said.\n\nLauren Stuart, whose mother died of cancer when she was 12, struggled with mental illness that went untreated, isolation and fears that the end was near, friends and officials familiar with the case said. One friend who requested anonymity said she believes the killing was the result of depression, not religion.\n\nLongtime family friend Joyce Taylor, 58, of White Lake, Mich., believes depression, shunning and religion-based doomsday fears all played a role. She said that about six weeks before the killings, Lauren Stuart started getting religiously preoccupied and telling her, \"It's the end times. I know it is.\"\n\nWeeks later, Taylor saw her friend again. Lauren Stuart had a vacant look in her eyes.\n\nShe was emotionally distressed.\n\nA week later, with her home decorated for Valentine's Day, Lauren Stuart killed her family. She left behind a suicide note.\n\n\"She said in the suicide note that she felt that by killing them it was the only way to save them,\" recalled Taylor, who said police let her read the letter. \"She said she's sorry that she has to do this, but it was the only way to save them all.\"\n\nTaylor, a former Jehovah's Witness herself who left the faith in 1986, explained: \"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that if you die on this side of Armageddon, you'll be resurrected in paradise.\"\n\n► June 1:Persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia intensifies\n\n► April 20:Russian court bans Jehovah's Witnesses as extremist group\n\nIn Lauren Stuart's case, Taylor believes her friend never deprogrammed after leaving the church — a state she describes as \"physically out, but mentally in.\" She believes that Lauren Stuart's indoctrinated doomsday fears never left her and that the shunning helped push her over the edge.\n\nIf her tight-knit community that once was her entire support system had not excommunicated her — and left her with no one to share her fears with — Lauren Stuart may not have done what she did, Taylor believes.\n\n\"People do things when they are desperate,\" Taylor said. \"And that was an extreme, desperate act.\"\n\nShunning \"can lead to great trauma among people because the Jehovah's Witnesses are a very tight-knit community,\" said Mathew Schmalz, a religious studies associate professor at the College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.\n\n\"If you're separated out, you're really left to your own devices in ways that are very challenging and very painful,\" Schmalz said. \"Once you leave a group that's been your whole life, letting that go is a kind of death.\"\n\nPolice have not yet disclosed details about the death of the Stuart family except for calling it a murder-suicide.\n\nThe tragedy has emboldened many once-quiet ex-Jehovah's Witnesses to speak up. Many say they suffered quietly on their own for years until they discovered an online community full of isolated, ostracized people like themselves — people who had lost someone to suicide or attempted suicide themselves because their families, friends and church community had written them off for making mistakes, for being human.\n\nThe church calls it being \"disfellowshipped.\" Members can return if they repent, change the behavior and prove themselves worthy of being reinstated. But unless or until that happens, members are encouraged to avoid the sinners, especially those who leave the faith.\n\nMothers go years, even decades, without talking to their children.\n\nSiblings write off siblings.\n\nFriends shun friends.\n\nAn estimated 70,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses are disfellowshipped every year — roughly 1% of the church’s total population, according to data published by the Watchtower.\n\n► April 12:Body of judge on New York's highest court found in Hudson River\n\n► January 2017:Michigan officers stop suicide just in time\n\nTheir names are published at local Kingdom Halls. Of those, two-thirds never return.\n\nHowever, within a faith representing 8.4 million people worldwide, many members believe the religion is pure, good and loving. Those who are speaking against it are disgruntled and angry people who have an ax to grind because they were disfellowshipped, current members argue.\n\nOr, they are lost souls who have misinterpreted the meaning and love behind the faith. Members say they believe that the shunning accusations are exaggerated and the suicides are often more about mental illness than ostracism.\n\n► June 2016:Mom who stabbed self killed her three sons first, police say\n\n► June 2016:Is there a psychology of hate we need to understand better?\n\nMany of those who have left the religion disagree.\n\nIn the world of ex-Jehovah’s Witnesses, they maintain that the shunned are considered dead to their families, just like the suicide victims.\n\nThese are their stories.\n\n‘A dangerous cult’\n\nThe conversation was difficult to wrap her 8-year-old brain around.\n\n“You know your sister was being bad, right?“ Sawyer recalled her mother telling her after her sister's suicide.\n\n“And what she did was stupid, right?’ … To take your own life is very wrong,\" her mother continued.\n\n“I didn’t understand what was going on … and I said, ‘Oh. OK,’ “ Sawyer recalled. “In my 8-year-old brain, I was thinking, ‘When I mess up, my mom’s going to hate me.’ \"\n\nAnd so began her painful journey with the Jehovah’s Witnesses faith, the religion she was born into and grew up in in Pascagoula, Miss., where her fears of abandonment took hold at age 8.\n\n► March 2016:Former Army Reservist kills family, self\n\n► March 2016:Cannabis church founder says he was defamed\n\nSawyer believes that the shunning drove her sister to suicide. After the church disfellowshipped her for getting engaged to a non-Jehovah's Witness, the fiancé left, and her sister was thrown into depression.\n\nHer sister tried turning to her mother for consolation. But her mom would read scripture and tell her, \"Until you start acting right, you’re going to have these bad things happen to you.“\n\nBad things happened to Sawyer, too.\n\nAt 30, she sought a divorce from her husband because he was abusive and cheating on her, she said. But church elders and family pressured her to save her marriage.\n\n“I showed them the holes in my walls,” Sawyer said, referring to the damage her ex-husband did to the home during fights. “They told me to pray more … and sent me back home to him.”\n\nSawyer took up smoking to handle the stress, which got her disfellowshipped because smoking is not allowed.\n\nShe also went through with the divorce. She ended up losing her home to foreclosure and turned to her mother for help because she had two children to raise.\n\nHer mother took her in temporarily, but when church elders found out, they threatened to shun Sawyer’s mother. Her mother let the grandkids stay but not her daughter.\n\nSawyer ended up homeless for six months, living out of her car in a community college parking lot.\n\nShe landed on her feet with the help of a student loan. She got an apartment, a job as a hospice nurse and her children — now 10 and 18 — back.\n\nShe found herself but lost her family along the way.\n\n► January 2016:Dad likely torched home with gasoline\n\n► December 2015:Minister stripping away church knowledge gap on mental health\n\nHer mother doesn’t speak to her. Sawyer said she can’t recall the last time they spoke.\n\nHer sister in Alabama hasn’t spoken to her since Sawyer got divorced in 2010.\n\n“She was on my porch with my parents,\" Sawyer said. \"My sister looked at me and said, ‘You’re abandoning me just like Donna did’ and left. And that's the last thing she ever said to me.\"\n\nSawyer has kept silent about her pain for decades.\n\n“This is a dangerous cult,” she said of her former religion. “It’s important for people to realize. This is serious.”\n\nHe lost his daughter\n\nOn Feb. 3, 2011, the Utah church of Dave Gracey disfellowshipped him at age 61.\n\nBy then, he had been an elder three times — a job that troubled him as he often found himself judging and sanctioning people who had sinned in the eyes of the church: Smokers. Drug users. Adulterers. Homosexuals.\n\n“I had a terrible time with that,” Gracey said. “All we were doing was chasing people around and catching them in their sins and kicking them out.”\n\nBut then came the day the church judged his own children. That's when Gracey said he started rebelling.\n\nIn 2010, Gracey’s 38-year-old daughter, Laura, committed suicide after a fallout with church elders.\n\n► September 2015:Town comes together for funeral of family shot by dad\n\n► February 2015:Missouri candidate dies of self-inflicted gunshot wound\n\n“It put me in an absolute rage,” he recalled.\n\nGracey's daughter was rebellious growing up and suffered from mental illness, he said. She got into drugs and became homeless at one point but tried to get her life in order.\n\nAt 33, she was baptized as a Jehovah's Witness and over the next four years she was disfellowshipped twice and reinstated twice.\n\nBut in January 2010, following a meeting with church elders, Gracey's daughter fatally overdosed on prescription medication. She had been living in an apartment complex with other Jehovah's Witnesses in California and had a medical marijuana card for anxiety and stress.\n\nGracey suspects his daughter told the elders about the card.\n\n“The elders won’t tell me why they met with her,” Gracey said. “Obviously, she was distressed that night, and they left her alone. They knew how fragile my daughter was. … It’s my guess that they excommunicated her that night, but they won’t tell me. They failed to protect her in her most vulnerable state.”\n\nThat same year, Gracey would suffer more heartache at the hands of his church. His 14-year-old stepdaughter had been raped, but the elders didn’t believe her, he said.\n\nAn investigation followed and an administrative judge and child protective services made a finding that the Jehovah's Witnesses were guilty of child maltreatment.\n\nThe church mounted a campaign to oust the Graceys of Layton, Utah, who appealed to the Jehovah’s Witnesses' headquarters in Warwick, N.Y., in the New York City metro area, claiming the church had harmed their daughter.\n\nOn Feb. 3, 2011, the Graceys were excommunicated.\n\n“We were so indoctrinated. We had difficulty with it,” Gracey said, noting he and his wife officially left the faith in March 2013 after getting shunned repeatedly.\n\n► January 2015:Parents killed selves, kids fearing apocalypse\n\n► July 2013:Rick Warren returns to pulpit after son's suicide\n\n“I walked out and never came back,” Gracey said. “I started kind of waking up.”\n\nGracey, who considers himself agnostic now, is focused on helping all of his family escape the Jehovah's Witnesses organization.\n\n“I want to expose this religion for what they really are. It is a cult that splits up families and separates people from life. … They seem nice on Saturday morning when they are peddling their Watchtower, but they are insidious.”\n\n‘I’ve been sick over this'\n\nFor Californian Kerry Kaye, the Keego Harbor killings triggered a host of emotions: anger, pain, frustration.\n\nShe, too, is a former member of the Jehovah's Witnesses community and lost a very good friend to suicide more than 20 years ago.\n\n“I’ve just been sick over this. It brings back a lot of memories,” Kaye said of the Michigan killings in a recent telephone interview.\n\nKaye was in her early 20s when her friend committed suicide after being disfellowshipped for getting pregnant out of wedlock. The woman was 20 years old and seven months pregnant at the time.\n\nKaye said her friend tried to get back into the church, but the elders told her, “No, you need more time. You’re not qualified to come back.“\n\n► July 2013:Indiana mom, 2 kids' drowning deaths called accident\n\n► May 2013:Man commits suicide inside Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral\n\nThat day, the friend went home and shot herself in the heart, Kaye said.\n\n“If you’re in the organization, you understand the depression and despair,” said Kaye, who explained that when someone gets disfellowshipped, word spreads fast in the church. She admits that she once shunned her own father at the direction of the church.\n\n“The moment they make an announcement, you’re not allowed to have contact with them whatsoever. You have to pretend they’re dead,” Kaye said. “That’s how they control the people. It’s a fear tactic. It’s to keep them in the cult, under their control.”\n\nKaye was 24 when she left the church. Her father had left the faith a few years earlier after the church pressured him to leave his government job, telling him he had to choose the faith or his work.\n\nHe picked the job and disassociated himself.\n\nKaye was forced to shun her father or face consequences, she said.\n\n“I didn’t talk to my father for almost two years, and then I finally had enough,” Kaye said. “I started to try to make an escape.”\n\nIt wasn’t easy. After she left, she said she became suicidal.\n\nDoctors intervened and saved her life, she said. Eventually, she moved away from her hometown to the Los Angeles area to raise her three children on her own, outside the organization.\n\nThey are all college educated now and thriving, she said. And she has found peace as she has dedicated herself to helping others who feel trapped in the denomination.\n\n“I’m wonderful since I left,” Kaye said. “My mission is to help other people. When entire families are destroyed, it makes all of us who have been involved in this cult very angry. We want people to know what is really going on.”\n\n‘We love everyone’\n\nAlmost 8.5 million people are Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide, including 1.2 million in the United States, according to the JW.org website.\n\nWe come from hundreds of ethnic and language backgrounds, yet we are united by common goals. Above all, we want to honor Jehovah, the God of the Bible and the Creator of all things. We do our best to imitate Jesus Christ and are proud to be called Christians. Each of us regularly spends time helping people learn about the Bible and God’s Kingdom. Because we witness, or talk, about Jehovah God and his Kingdom, we are known as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nThe Jehovah’s Witnesses national organization did not return calls and e-mails from the Free Press for comment on the subject of disfellowshipping. Multiple members and elders were contacted, but all declined to speak on the record, many saying they were not authorized to publicly comment on scripture and church teachings.\n\nHowever, following the Keego Harbor killings, numerous current Jehovah’s Witnesses contacted the Free Press to defend their religion, stressing it is about unconditional love, peace, helping people and having an unwavering commitment to God and Jesus Christ.\n\nBut like many religions, Jehovah's Witnesses have rules to follow — such as no stealing, killing, committing adultery, smoking or getting intoxicated on alcohol or drugs. If one commits any of these acts, they can be disfellowshipped, but they can get back in if they truly repent and change their behavior.\n\nThey, too, did not want to have their names published.\n\nMisunderstood denomination\n\nSchmalz, the religious studies professor, said mainstream Christians often misunderstand the Jehovah's Witnesses' faith. Their beliefs may seem \"unorthodox\" to other religious groups and their rules too strict or extreme.\n\nBut Jehovah's Witnesses, a Protestant denomination that began in the 1870s as a Bible study group in Pittsburgh, have rational reasons for much of what they believe and do, he said.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe in a \"great cataclysm,\" that \" 'the end is near' is continually imminent,\" he said. When you are brought up with that belief within a strong and tightly knit religious setting, it is hard to shake.\n\n► April 2013:Churches shed light on suicide, depression\n\n► April 2013:Pastor Rick Warren blames son's death on depression\n\n\"This belief in Armageddon, which is central to the Jehovah's Witness worldview, is something that still retains its power — even for people who have left,\" said Schmalz, who teaches a course in modern religious movements with discussions about Jehovah's Witnesses and Scientology. Author L. Ron Hubbard founded Scientology in the early 1950s in Los Angeles.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses aren't alone in the practice of shunning, Schmalz said. The Amish and other Mennonite groups ostracize those who leave the faith, too.\n\nHe said Jehovah's Witnesses have two goals in mind when they disfellowship someone:\n\n1. They need a mechanism to discipline people who don't abide by their tenets.\n\n2. They are trying to create a pure community whose members adhere to the group's beliefs and tenets.\n\nThis practice can be harmful, he said. But members have a rationale for the behavior.\n\n\"How is disfellowshipping really that different from tough love, where you hold people accountable for their actions? It's a complicated question,\" said Schmalz, who is opposed to using the word \"cult\" to describe the Jehovah's Witness church.\n\n\"We should look at the Jehovah's Witnesses not as a bizarre religious group but as a religion that has its own internal means of discipline,\" he said. \"They can be very harsh and have very unintended and tragic consequences.\"\n\nFollow Tresa Baldas on Twitter: @Tbaldas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/profile-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's new prime minister: Rishi Sunak, rich ex-banker who will be ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nJust seven short weeks ago, it looked as if it might be all over for Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe former chancellor of the exchequer – the UK’s title for its chief finance minister – made a high-stakes gamble. He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities. He is known for his expensive taste in fashion and has worked for banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.

He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/opinion/957350/opinion-analysis-weekly-digest", "title": "'Tories will spin Brown plan as new platform for Scottish separatism ...", "text": "Every morning at his state primary school in 1960s North London, David Aaronovitch would say the Lord’s Prayer and sing a couple of hymns. “I was from a family of atheists but I was nevertheless a junior conscript into Christ’s army,” he writes.

Two other monks sat alongside him in the traditional lotus position in front of a sacred Buddha statue. Four monks were meditating on the other side of the altar. Throughout my hour inside the temple, local people came inside and knelt on the floor, hands clasped in prayer in front of the monks.\n\nOut of respect for Buddhist custom, I left my shoes and socks outside the temple and approached the elderly monk in my bare feet. I wanted to take a good look at him. From his weathered skin, his tired eyes, the liver spots on his hands and his calloused feet, I could tell he had lived a hard life.\n\nI put a 20 Thai baht bill (about 56 cents) in the donation box in front of him and looked at him again, hoping for at least a slight glimpse of a smile. I got a blank look of indifference.\n\nI wondered how much would it cost to get some sort of positive response. I put another 20 baht bill in the box, waving the cash in his line of sight.\n\nAgain, nothing.\n\nPerhaps he was in a deep meditative trance? Maybe he wasn't even aware of my presence?\n\nThen, another thought occurred to me. Perhaps the grim-faced monk wasn’t a he but an it. Could he be a statue? I honestly couldn’t tell.\n\nRemember the 1970s commercial with Ella Fitzgerald: “Is it live, or is it Memorex?” That slogan kept popping into my head the rest of the afternoon.\n\nTesting the retirement potential of Chiang Mai, Thailand\n\nSo I asked a couple of fellow tourists. A French man gave me a look as if I had just asked the most ridiculous question in the world. “Of course, they are real,” he said, referring to the group of four monks.\n\nAs he walked away, I’m guessing he was muttering to himself: “Américain stupide!”\n\nBut an American woman disagreed. “No, they are statues,” she said, with a look that screamed “duh.” Both people seemed equally positive of their assessments.\n\nAs I thought about it on the 45-minute walk back to my hotel, I still wasn’t sure. There, I showed Bee, the owner of the hotel, my photos of the monks. She smiled and in the typically polite and non-judgmental Thai way, confirmed that the monks were indeed statues.\n\nJust to be absolutely certain, I returned to Wat Phra Singh a couple of weeks later. The monks were in exactly the same places as before, with the exact same expressions on their faces and their hands in the exact same positions.\n\nYes. They are statues.\n\nI don't know how they were made to look so lifelike, but Madame Tussauds and Disneyland could learn a thing or two from Wat Phra Singh.\n\nOn my most recent visit to the temple, I once again walked by the donation box in front of the grim-faced monk. This time, I kept my wallet in my pocket.\n\nHe could scowl all he wanted, but he wasn’t going to get the better of me twice.\n\nDan Fellner of Chandler is a faculty associate at Arizona State University and freelance travel writer who is spending the winter in Chiang Mai.

But friends who worked and lived beside Alexis say they don't recognize the man who went on a shooting rampage Monday at a military complex in Washington, D.C., and eventually was shot dead in a gunfight.\n\nAlexis' life ended in Washington, where he lived in a Residence Inn in the southwest part of the city and worked as civilian contractor for the military. But much of his story is centered in Fort Worth, where he seemed to be an easygoing guy who practiced Buddhism, meditated for hours and hung out with friends who spoke Thai, as he did.\n\n\"He was a good guy to me,\" said Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, who met Alexis three years ago at Wat Busayadhammavanaram, a Fort Worth Buddhist temple. The two became good friends.\n\n\"I still can't believe he would do that,\" he said.\n\nBy some accounts, Alexis led a somewhat reverent life during his early years in Fort Worth, working at the nearby Naval Air Station, meditating and studying Thai. Somsak Srisan, 57, a friend and landlord, met Alexis at the temple and became endeared to him. Alexis told Srisan he hoped to become a Buddhist monk someday. \"Keep studying,\" Srisan told him.\n\nWhen Alexis needed a place to live, Srisan rented him the two-bedroom brick home he owned in a wooded lot behind the temple. Alexis lived there for about eight months, from 2010 to 2011. He paid the $600 monthly rent on time each month and adhered to Srisan's strict rules of no drinking, no smoking, no partying, he said. Alexis also attended temple two to three times a week, meditating with other congregants for an hour at a time, Srisan said. Sometimes, he would flirt with the female congregants, he said.\n\n\"He was a good boy,\" Srisan said.\n\nBut in early 2011, Alexis lost his job at the naval station. Unable to make rent, he moved out of the house behind the temple and came to meditation groups less frequently, Srisan said. Srisan told Alexis he was sorry to see him leave the job, which offered good benefits and a steady paycheck.\n\n\"He said he didn't like the system,\" Srisan said. \"He said, 'I don't need to get too involved with that.' \"\n\nAlexis moved in with Suthamtewakul, who owns the Happy Bowl restaurant. Late-night drinking sessions ensued as the pair would go through one six-pack of Heineken after another, Suthamtewakul said.\n\nThey lived in White Settlement, a Fort Worth suburb about 11 miles west of downtown. Known as one of Texas' most authentic cowboy cities, Fort Worth boasts historic stockyards, where cattle are still run down city streets twice daily. Dallas, Fort Worth's larger sister city, lies about 30 miles east with more people, a bigger skyline — and more nightlife.\n\nSometimes after work, Suthamtewakul and Alexis would drive to Dallas for private parties at friends' Thai restaurants.\n\n\"He wanted to speak Thai,\" Suthamtewakul said. \"He was very focused on practicing the Thai language.\"\n\nAlexis told Suthamtewakul how the military paid for him to attend nearby Tarrant County College. He liked studying computers. A Tarrant County College spokeswoman confirmed Alexis attended one semester at the college's Northwest Campus, from January to May 2011.\n\nBut Alexis left the Navy because he didn't like waking up early, Suthamtewakul said. The classes stopped, as well.\n\nAs Suthamtewakul moved four times over the next three years, Alexis moved with him, struggling to keep a job.\n\nAlexis didn't contribute to the rent but would come to Suthamtewakul's restaurant and help with deliveries for free, including to some of Fort Worth's roughest neighborhoods, Suthamtewakul said. Often, Alexis would have his .45-caliber pistol tucked in his belt.\n\nSuthamtewakul had to advise him to hide the weapon sticking out of his belt so customers wouldn't see it. Alexis would talk often about the need to protect himself and how to use guns. He occasionally practiced firing the weapon at a local firing range, Suthamtewakul said.\n\nFrom the first days they met, Alexis would talk about people coming to get him.\n\n\"He always thought someone was trying to hurt him,\" he said. \"He was afraid of people.\"\n\nAlexis briefly had an Asian girlfriend in the Navy who stayed with them for a week about two years ago. He was, by all accounts, happy, Suthamtewakul said.\n\nSuthamtewakul trusted and liked Alexis enough to ask him to be his best man at his wedding in December. In July, with Suthamtewakul's new wife now living with the pair, Alexis moved out.\n\nKristi Suthamtewakul, Nutpisit's wife, described Alexis as charming and a good conversationalist. \"It's hard to believe he would go and shoot those people,\" she said.\n\nKevin McDonald, owner of Kevin's Hometown Furniture, next to the Happy Bowl restaurant, said he would often chat with Alexis outside the Happy Bowl. Alexis would be taking a cigarette break and McDonald would chastise him, telling him he should quit.\n\nMcDonald knew Alexis had been in the Navy Reserve and the two would talk politics and current events, ranging from the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi to the latest news out of the White House, he said. Alexis didn't have heated opinions on any of the topics.\n\n\"Nothing out of the ordinary,\" McDonald said. \"I probably made more negative comments on President Obama than he did.\"\n\nMichael Ritrovato, 50, said he and Alexis became friends about four years ago at a Buddhism festival in nearby Keller, Texas. He would see him often at the Happy Bowl. Fellow New Yorkers, Ritrovato and Alexis talked about jobs and girls and got together at Ritrovato's house to watch the New York Giants play in the Super Bowl.\n\n\"He loved to have fun,\" Ritrovato said. \"We would have a few beers together.\"\n\nBut last year, Alexis' fun-loving attitude soured, he said. After landing a job with a computer company that took him to Japan, Alexis called Ritrovato to complain that the company hadn't paid him in weeks. Earlier this year, Alexis called again to say his car had broken down and he didn't have enough money to fix it, Ritrovato said.\n\nRitrovato said he tried to get him a government job several times, but Alexis would foul up the application process. Four months ago, Alexis called again with more car and money problems.\n\n\"We talked about car problems. We talked about him needing money,\" Ritrovato said. \"He was upset.\"\n\nKasem Pundisto, head monk at the Wat Busayadhammavanaram temple, said he also noticed a change in Alexis.\n\nHe was sociable and talked in Thai regularly with the other monks. But he also brooded at times.\n\nAlexis was in good spirits when he lived in the house behind the temple and meditated regularly, Pundisto said. But his mood seemed to change after he moved out. He attended meditation less regularly.\n\nAbout six months ago, Alexis asked Pundisto for a ride to the auto mechanic to pick up his car. On the drive over, Alexis confessed that he was not happy with his life and that he yearned to return to the monks.\n\n\"It looked like he had something heavy on his mind, like he was trying to keep it all in his head,\" Pundisto said through a translator. \"I told him, 'Relax, come back to meditation.' \"\n\nSoon after, Alexis left town.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/21/buddhist-temple-killings-media-ban/3662661/", "title": "Both sides seek to bar media in temple-slaying retrial", "text": "Jim Walsh\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nJodi Arias trial is cited as one reason to be mindful of cameras in the newsroom\n\nA mistrial was declared in the second trial of Johnathan Doody for the 1991 slayings\n\nMotion was filed partly in response to media requests to allow filming of retrial\n\nPHOENIX -- In an unprecedented legal move, the attorneys in the murder trial over nine slayings at a Thai Buddhist temple in Arizona are asking the judge to ban media coverage by closing the courtroom to reporters.\n\nProsecutor Jason Kalish and defense attorney Maria Schaffer argue in a joint motion that coverage of Johnathan Doody's retrial, which ended in a mistrial last month, has \"severely damaged the ability of the defendant to have a fair and impartial trial.\"\n\nLegal experts were stunned by the motion, saying that state and federal law strongly favors open courtrooms to maintain public confidence in the legal system and that less-restrictive precautions could be used to protect Doody's rights.\n\n\"It's really designed to be protection for the public, as well. The public has a bigger right to know the courts are operated in a fair and impartial manner,\" said Kurt Altman, a Phoenix defense attorney with extensive experience as a prosecutor in Maricopa County Superior Court and U.S. District Court.\n\nArguments are scheduled Thursday on the motion, which was filed partly in response to media requests to allow filming of the retrial.\n\nMaricopa County Superior Court Judge Joseph Kreamer is attempting to empanel a jury for Doody's third trial, after Doody's retrial ended in a hung jury Oct. 24.\n\nThe 1991 slayings of six Thai monks, a nun and two acolytes in the Wat Promkunaram temple in Waddell, Ariz., shocked the Phoenix area and sent reverberations halfway around the world to Thailand, where monks and nuns are revered.\n\nThe case had been controversial from the outset. Detectives with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office obtained confessions from four Tucson, Ariz., men, but the \"Tucson Four\" later were found to have no connection to the murders.\n\nUnusual request\n\nThree attorneys with defense and prosecution experience all said they do not recall the media being banned from covering a trial in their lifetimes.\n\nThey said Arizona law allows judges to strike a balance between the rights of defendants and the public's right to know by asking television crews and photographers to not photograph certain witnesses.\n\nCourt rules bar jurors from being filmed or photographed.\n\n\"I think it is an impossible standard to reach,\" Altman said about closing a courtroom. \"There are a lot of steps from a complete ban to the free flow\" of information.\n\nDan Barr, an attorney who has practiced media law in the area for nearly three decades, said, \"They are not going to be able to show there's any prejudice that denies Johnathan Doody his fair-trial rights. The chances of this being granted are slim and none.\"\n\nFormer Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley said that he has always believed in open courts and that any attempt at sealing the courtroom during Doody's first trial — when he was fielding calls from the U.S. State Department and meeting with the Thai ambassador in Washington, D.C. — would have been disastrous.\n\n\"The transparency of the court, having it out in the open, was critical in restoring confidence to the public that the right individuals had been apprehended,\" said Romley.\n\nHe said the \"reality TV show\" otherwise known as the Jodi Arias trial convinced him there may be times when cameras should be turned off in the courtroom, but it still doesn't justify private trials.\n\n\"By and large, it should be an open courtroom,\" he said.\n\nMotion on media\n\nIn his motion, Kalish singles out a television station for mistakenly showing jurors during Doody's retrial and a headline on azcentral.com, which alluded to an appeals-court ruling and element of a previous trial that a jury should not be aware of.\n\n\"While the parties do not disagree with the general right to be in a courtroom, there are limits,\" the motion said. \"Those limits have been reached in this case. Their continued presence, in any form, threatens the rights of the Defendant, the state, the jury and at least one witness. Not only should their motion be denied, but the media should be banned from the courtroom during the trial.\"\n\nThe motion argues that articles in The Arizona Republic on courtroom impropriety by prosecutors could affect potential jurors' views of the prosecutors.\n\n\"The motion reflects the impact of extensive coverage to date on the previous trial and efforts to seat a jury in the pending matter,\" County Attorney Bill Montgomery said in a statement.\n\nChris Moeser, an attorney for The Arizona Republic and five Phoenix-area television stations, had filed a motion asking Kreamer to allow video coverage to resume in Doody's third trial.\n\nHe said Kreamer barred video coverage after jurors were inadvertently filmed during the retrial, but there will be a new jury for the third trial and conditions have changed.\n\nKalish filed his motion to ban all coverage in response to Moeser's motion to restore video coverage.\n\n\"In the 30 years or so of court coverage, there have been very few violations by the media,\" Moeser said. \"In view of what's gone on with this case, it is of paramount importance\" to allow print and television coverage.\n\nHe said video coverage is vital to the public's understanding of courts because \"it's sort of an unfiltered view of the judicial system.\"\n\nBut Schaffer, Doody's defense attorney, said a stronger filter needs to be considered after the circus atmosphere surrounding the Arias trial and an incident early in Doody's retrial, where streaming video of jurors sitting in a jury box and leaving for lunch made it onto YouTube, where it went viral. She also said jurors were filmed in another Superior Court case.\n\n\"It needs to not happen again,\" Schaffer said. \"I don't want to take that risk.\"\n\nAlthough she signed Kalish's motion asking to ban coverage of the third Doody trial, Schaffer said her objection is to video cameras in the courtroom and to streaming video specifically.\n\nShe said she does not believe other coverage would damage Doody's rights.\n\n\"We need to find a balance between the rights of the defendant and the public's right to know,\" Schaffer said. \"I think the Arias trial taught us that we need to look at it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/11/12/strong-earthquake-strikes-burma/1698907/", "title": "Strong earthquake strikes Burma", "text": "Aye Aye Win, AP\n\nA strong quake collapsed a bridge and damaged ancient Buddhist pagodas\n\nBurma is known to have a poor official disaster response system\n\nEarthquake comes just a week ahead of a scheduled visit to Burma by Obama\n\nYANGON, Burma (AP) — A strong earthquake collapsed a bridge and damaged ancient Buddhist pagodas in northern Burma, and piecemeal reports from the underdeveloped mining region said mines collapsed and as many as 12 people were feared dead.\n\nBurma's Vice President Sai Mauk Hkam visited the damaged sites Monday, while authorities resumed their search for four missing workers near the collapsed bridge over the Irrawaddy River in Kyaukmyaung.\n\nA slow release of official information left the actual extent of the damage unclear after Sunday morning's magnitude-6.8 quake. Burma has a poor official disaster response system and lost upward of 140,000 people to a devastating cyclone in 2008.\n\n\"We have been told by the director of Relief and Resettlement Department that there were seven dead and 45 injured as of late Sunday evening. The figure could fluctuate,\" said Ashok Nigam, the U.N. development program's resident representative. He told The Associated Press that U.N. agencies had offered aid but \"no formal request has been made yet.\"\n\nBurma's second-biggest city of Mandalay is the nearest population center to the main quake but reported no casualties or major damage. Mandalay lies about 117 kilometers (72 miles) south of the epicenter near the town of Shwebo, and the smaller towns in the area that is a center for mining of minerals and gemstones were worse hit.\n\nState media's Sunday evening news said damage included 102 homes, 21 religious buildings, 48 government offices and four schools in the town of Thabeikyin. The gold-mining town is near the epicenter and had three dead and 35 injured.\n\nThe official tally overall is six killed and 64 injured, while independently compiled tallies say about a dozen people died.\n\nAn official from Burma's Meteorological Department said the magnitude-6.8 quake struck at 7:42 a.m. local time.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Society reported a 5.8-magnitude aftershock later Sunday, but no further damage or casualties were reported.\n\nState television warned residents that aftershocks usually follow a major earthquake and told people to stay away from high walls, old buildings and structures with cracks in them.\n\nThe biggest single death toll was reported by a local administrative officer in Sintku township — on the Irrawaddy River near the quake's epicenter — who told The Associated Press that six people had died there and another 11 were injured.\n\nHe said some of the dead were miners who were killed when a gold mine collapsed. He spoke on condition of anonymity because local officials are normally not allowed to release information to the media.\n\nRumors circulated in Yangon of other mine collapses trapping workers, but none of the reports could be confirmed.\n\nAccording to news reports, several people died when a bridge under construction across the Irrawaddy River collapsed east of Shwebo. The bridge linked the town of Sintku, 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Mandalay on the east bank of the Irrawaddy, with Kyaukmyaung on the west bank.\n\nThe website of Weekly Eleven magazine said four people were killed and 25 injured when the bridge, which was 80% finished, fell. The local government announced a toll of two dead and 16 injured. All of the victims appeared to be workers.\n\nHowever, a Shwebo police officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said just one person was confirmed dead from the bridge's collapse, while five were still unaccounted for.\n\nWeekly Eleven also said two monasteries in Kyaukmyaung collapsed, killing two people.\n\n\"This is the worst earthquake I felt in my entire life,\" Soe Soe, a 52-year-old Shwebo resident, told the Associated Press by phone.\n\nShe said that the huge concrete gate of a local monastery collapsed and that several sculptures from another pagoda in the town were damaged.\n\nOther damage was reported in Mogok, a major gem-mining area just east of the quake's epicenter. Temples were damaged there, as were some abandoned mines.\n\n\"Landslides occurred at some old ruby mines, but there were no casualties because these are old mines,\" Sein Win, a Mogok resident, said by phone.\n\nState television reported that more than a dozen pagodas and stupas in five townships were damaged, and many of them had their so-called \"umbrellas\" atop the dome-shaped structures crash down.\n\nThe uppermost parts of the domes usually contain encased relics of the Buddha and small Buddha images, and sometimes jewels. Damage to them is taken as an especially bad omen.\n\nSein Win said police were guarding a damaged stupa in Mogok and its exposed relics.\n\nMany people in Burma are superstitious, and it is likely that soothsayers will point out that the quake occurred on the 11th day of the 11th month.\n\nState television also reported that the tremors shifted the Mingun Bell, which people in Burma claim is the world's largest functioning bell, off its base. The nearly 4-meter-high (12-foot-high) bell, which weighs in at 90 metric tons (200,000 pounds), was installed in 1810 and is a popular tourist attraction at a pagoda outside Mandalay.\n\nA resident of Naypyitaw, which is 365 kilometers (225 miles) south of the quake's epicenter, said several windowpanes of the parliament building had broken.\n\nThe epicenter is in a region frequently hit by small temblors that usually cause little damage. Burma suffered a quake of similar size in March last year near the northeastern border town of Tachileik. Last year's 6.8 magnitude quake killed 74 people and injured 111.\n\nResidents of Mandalay contacted by phone said they were fearful of more aftershocks because the city has modern high-rise buildings that could trap people, unlike the mostly small structures in the areas worst hit on Sunday.\n\n\"We are afraid that another earthquake might shake at night,\" said Thet Su, a journalist in Mandalay. \"I told my parents to run out of the house if another earthquake shook.\"\n\nThe quake was felt in Bangkok, the capital of neighboring Thailand.\n\nIt comes just a week ahead of a scheduled visit to Burma by President Obama. He will be the first U.S. president to visit the one-time pariah nation, which is emerging from decades of military rule.\n\nThe disaster is the second to strike Burma's north in three days. On Friday, a tanker train derailed about 128 kilometers (80 miles) north of Shwebo, and at least 25 people were killed when overturned carriages burst into flames as they were trying to skim fuel from them.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/14/sentencing-in-arizona-buddhist-temple-killings/6426479/", "title": "Arizona mass murderer gets 9 life sentences", "text": "Michael Kiefer\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX — A man who killed nine people at a Thai Buddhist monastery about 20 miles from here will spend the rest of his life in prison for his part in a 1991 massacre that remains the worst mass murder in Arizona history.\n\nJohnathan Doody, 39, was convicted in 1993, but that conviction and subsequent 281-year sentence were thrown out in federal court because his confession was improperly obtained.\n\nHe went back to trial in the fall and started again in December after a mistrial. Doody was reconvicted in January of all nine murders, plus counts of armed robbery, burglary and conspiracy.\n\nJudge Joseph Kreamer of Maricopa County Superior Court imposed a sentence of life in prison without chance of parole for 25 years for each of the murders. Doody was given credit for 22 years on the first count; the rest must be served back to back.\n\nKreamer also sentenced Doody to 12 years in prison for each of nine counts of armed robbery, 12 years for burglary and nine years for conspiracy. All of those sentences will run at the same time but after the life sentences are completed. Although Arizona no longer has any mechanism to grant parole, technically, the earliest Doody could be eligible for it would be in 175 years.\n\nThe sentence of life without parole did not exist at the time of the murders. Although Doody could have been sentenced to death in the first trial, he was not eligible in this trial because a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision banned the death penalty for persons who committed murders before age 18.\n\nDoody was 17 at the time the crimes were committed.\n\nOn Aug. 10, 1991, nine bodies were found face down and shot to death at the Wat Promkunaram Buddhist temple in Waddell, Ariz. The victims were all Thais or of Thai descent, as is Doody: the temple's abbot, Pairuch Kanthong; the five monks, Surichai Anuttaro, Boochuay Chaiyarach, Chalerm Chantapim, Siang Ginggaeo and Somsak Sopha; a nun, Foy Sripanpasert; her nephew, Matthew Miller, who was a novice monk; and a temple employee, Chirasak Chirapong.\n\nActing on a tip, Maricopa County Sheriff's deputies arrested five men from Tucson and extracted false confessions from four of them. Investigators stumbled on Doody, then 17, and his best friend, Alex Garcia, who was 16, almost by accident, and at first tried to make them confess that they acted in concert with the Tucson suspects.\n\nBoth teens did confess. The Tucson men eventually were exonerated. Garcia pleaded guilty in exchange for his testimony to avoid the death penalty, which still could be imposed on minors in 1991. Doody was convicted in 1993 and susbsequently sentenced to 281 years in prison.\n\nThe U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Doody's conviction in 2008 and again in 2011, and for five years at least, Doody thought he had a chance of returning to life on the outside. A second jury last year could not reach agreement on whether he was guilty or innocent.\n\nHe was reconvicted on all counts in January.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/world/gallery/photos-this-week-february-10-february-17/index.html", "title": "Photos this week: February 10-17, 2022 | CNN", "text": "Children play on old Soviet tanks in front of the Motherland Monument in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday, February 16.\n\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine remain at their highest in years, with a Russian military buildup spurring fears that Moscow could soon launch an attack on Ukraine.\n\nThe United States says evidence at Ukraine's border shows that Russia is \"moving towards an imminent invasion\" and is not withdrawing troops, despite Moscow's claims.\n\nRussia on Thursday once again dismissed the notion it was preparing to attack Ukraine as \"baseless accusations.\" It has argued that NATO support for Ukraine — including military training and weapons supplies — constitutes a growing threat on its western flank.\n\nHere are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/08/18/thailand-tourism-bangkok-bombings-grand-palace-wat-pho-bridge-river-kwai-phuket/31914985/", "title": "Bangkok bombings threaten Thailand's growing tourism industry", "text": "Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBombings in Bangkok threaten Thailand's tourism, which has nearly doubled in recent years, as other countries warn against traveling there in the near future.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Bangkok urged travelers to maintain a high level of vigilance and monitor news for updates after bombs exploded Tuesday near the city's main ferry terminal and Monday near a popular shrine. The bombing near Erawan Shrine killed 20 and injured more than 100 people.\n\n\"We didn't think anything like this could happen in Bangkok,\" said Holger Siegle, a German traveler. He and his newlywed wife had chosen Thailand because it seemed safe. \"Our honeymoon and our vacation will go on but with a very unsafe feeling.\"\n\nOther travel warnings included:\n\nHong Kong's security bureau urging citizens Tuesday to adjust travel plans and avoid non-essential trips such as leisure travel to Bangkok, which represented a \"significant threat.\"\n\nChina telling citizens to remain alert when traveling to Thailand after four Chinese tourists were killed in Monday's bombing.\n\nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade notifying citizens to \"exercise a high degree of caution\" in Thailand, steering clear of demonstrations or political rallies and avoiding southern provinces entirely. \"The security situation remains volatile,\" the department said.\n\nThailand depends heavily on tourism, which totals 9% of its economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. Tourism accounts for just 2.6% of China's economy, 2.7% of Australia's economy and for 3.6% of jobs in the USA, according to the council.\n\nThe bombings could hurt rebuilding efforts after a coup in 2014, according to an analysis by BMI Research.\n\n\"The explosion that struck a major tourism hot spot in the heart of Bangkok on Aug. 17 could undermine the recovery of the tourism industry, deepening the country's economic woes,\" according to the report.\n\nInternational tourist spending in Thailand almost doubled to $46 billion in 2013 from $23.8 billion in 2010, according to the World Bank.\n\nFour million Chinese visitors arrived during the first half of 2015, doubling the number from the same period a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports.

About 427,000 U.S. citizens visited during that period, an increase of 12% from a year earlier.\n\nThe fatal bomb exploded at Erawan Shrine, dedicated to Phra Phrom, the Thai version of the Hindu god Brahma, which is extremely popular among Buddhists as well as Chinese tourists.\n\nThai authorities set up extra security around Bangkok, and the Royal Thai Police urged tourists to exercise caution when out and about. Tourism groups mobilized to provide interpreters and change travel arrangements.\n\n\"These are direct attacks on the livelihood of the Thai people and their economy, which is strongly linked with tourism,\" said Taleb Rifai, secretary general for the United Nations World Tourism Organization. \"Terrorism is a global threat impacting our societies, taking the lives of innocent people around the world and aiming to destroy our economies and our way of life.\"\n\nThe United States considers Thailand a key ally in Asia, but the country's democracy has been interrupted by military coups and political unrest, according to the State Department.\n\nThailand has seen political violence during a decade-long insurgence by Muslim separatists that left 5,000 dead in southern provinces. In 2010, 90 people were killed in Bangkok over two months in violence centered at the same intersection as the latest deadly blast.\n\nThailand has a constitutional monarchy headed by an interim government after a military coup in May 2014 that deposed the civilian government.\n\nOn April 1, the government lifted martial law imposed since the coup. Besides the latest bombings, the Hong Kong security bureau listed unrest such as a car bomb at a shopping mall in Koh Samui in April, two small bombs exploded outside a Bangkok shopping mall in February, two British tourists killed on Koh Tao island in September 2014 and a car bomb outside a Betong hotel in July 2014.\n\nDespite the violence, Thailand is a popular tourist destination.

And though Arpaio is not a large man, he fills the room, from the oversized desk at one end to the oversized conference table at the other.\n\nHe speaks of himself in the third person; he pounds his fists on the table as he speaks.\n\n“This sheriff has been elected six times,” he said in an interview. “He must be doing something right. So the people must like this sheriff.”\n\nThe word comes off his tongue sounding like “SHIR-uff.”\n\nArpaio has been the sheriff of Maricopa County for more than 22 years, the longest-serving sheriff in county history.\n\n“Why am I doing this?” he continued. “I ask myself this question. I’m going to give you the old political thing: People want me to do this.”\n\nIt’s true: Arpaio is incredibly likable.\n\nAnd he is a conundrum, an unlikely idol, unsophisticated, gruff, decidedly blue collar. His face appears frozen in a half sneer. He is of average height, maybe an inch shorter. He is not a fashion icon, from the over-long sleeves of his sports jackets to the old-fashioned tie tack in the shape of a pistol.\n\nHe has been married to the same woman for 58 years. He is a doting grandfather.\n\nAnd he is a right-wing rock star.\n\nHis friend, the political consultant Jason Rose, calls him, “A PR genius and a freak of political nature.”\n\nHe speaks in bumper-sticker slogans.\n\nHe reduces reality to good and evil — and he is the good guy who goes after the bad guys.\n\n“He says it like it is to the average people,” said Bruce Merrill, a pollster and former professor at Arizona State University. “Older folks see crime on TV, they see immigration. A guy like Joe symbolically saves them. It’s kind of like he’s a superhero.”\n\nHe has garnered national attention, national admiration, national loathing.\n\nHe has embarked on quixotic crusades that have endeared him or villainized him to Maricopa County residents and national pundits alike. He tilts at windmills, whether questioning if President Barack Obama was born abroad, filing suit in federal court over Obama’s immigration policies, or waging war on illegal immigrants — which has landed him and the county in legal hot water.\n\n“He spends millions of dollars on things that are not his job,” former Maricopa County Manager David Smith said.\n\nAnd indeed Arpaio has expanded the scope of the office beyond its principal job description of jail keeper. During his tenure, the sheriff became an immigration officer, a crusader against county corruption and an investigator of presidents.\n\nAs a result, Joe Arpaio may also be “America’s Most Expensive Sheriff.”\n\nLegal battles have cost Maricopa County taxpayers $142 million\n\nSince Arpaio first took office in 1993, cases involving him or his office have cost taxpayers $142 million in legal expenses, settlements and court awards, and yet he has been repeatedly re-elected.\n\n“I know I’ve been sued a few times,” he said with a shrug.\n\nIn fact, he has been sued more than a few times.\n\nThere were enormous court awards for deaths in the jails, some of which were so large they were paid by insurance companies, instead of the county.\n\nHis deputies arrested journalists for writing about him, and taxpayers paid for it.\n\nHe arrested and a former county attorney filed charges against sitting judges, supervisors and county employees in 2008 and 2009. All of the cases fell apart. All of the targets sued and settled.\n\nHe is currently facing contempt of court in the wake of a racial-profiling and civil-rights lawsuit brought in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union. And because Arpaio failed to follow the judge’s orders in that case — and may have had the judge investigated — the major question remaining is whether he will be found in civil or criminal contempt.\n\nThose hearings resume Sept. 24 in front of that judge, U.S. Dictrict Court Judge G. Murray Snow.\n\nAn overlapping federal lawsuit lodged by the U.S. Department of Justice against Arpaio has already cost millions to defend. But taxpayers got a break there, since Arpaio and the county supervisors settled most of its issues out of court.\n\nNonetheless, Arpaio plans to run for re-election in 2016.\n\nHe does what he wants.\n\nArpaio likes the job of sheriff because he is his own boss.\n\n“I don’t have to report to any city manager, mayor, governor,” he said. “I have the right to make decisions.”\n\nHe frequently says, “No one tells the sheriff what to do.”\n\nHis old flip phone goes off incessantly; its ring tone is Frank Sinatra singing “My Way” at a decibel level an 83-year-old man can hear from across that spacious office.\n\n“I don’t have any iPad, uPad,” he said as he pointed way across the room to his desk. “That’s my computer: a Smith Corona typewriter.”\n\nIronically, according to two of the county supervisors, much of the $40 million that the county will have to pay to bring the office into compliance with a court order from the federal racial-profiling case is for technology updates that should have been made years ago.\n\nHe brags that he gives money back from his budget every year, though he has averaged more than $6 million in lawsuits and legal expenses for every year he has been in office.\n\nBut no matter how much trouble he gets into, newspaper readers keep sending letters to The Arizona Republic saying that Sheriff Joe is the only person doing anything about immigration and crime.\n\nAs Merrill, the pollster, said, “It’s not what’s true or not, it’s the perception of things.”\n\nAnd Arpaio’s chief deputy, Jerry Sheridan, summed it up: “The sheriff is the face of law enforcement for a lot of people in this county.”\n\nMany in Arpaio’s own party think it’s time for him to retire\n\nHe was once the most popular politician in the state, with an approval rate above 70 percent. That has slipped recently to 38 percent. He squeaked through his last election, in 2012, with 50.7 percent of the vote, leaving political watchers to wonder if this is the end of his run.\n\nThere are plenty of politicians from his own party who think it is time for him to leave. They complain about his disregard for the law, his lack of understanding of investigation procedure, of probable cause, his office’s history of putting opponents under surveillance.\n\nRumors that his deputies were following perceived enemies first surfaced in 1999, when a law-enforcement union told federal investigators the Sheriff’s Office was tailing a county attorney, an attorney who had sued him and a federal judge. In 2010, he even had an investigator for the State Bar followed. Arpaio staged an immigration raid on Mesa City Hall that embarrassed that city’s police chief.\n\nSome former prosecutors, all Republicans like Arpaio, would rather see him retire.\n\n“He’s a malicious influence in law enforcement,” said former U.S. Attorney for Arizona Paul Charlton. “It is time for this guy to step down and leave, and it’s certainly time for the voters to ask him to leave.”\n\n“It’s way past time for Arpaio to go,” said former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, a Republican. “It’s amazing to me that so-called conservatives will look the other way when someone has abused the power of government in the most extreme fashion.”\n\nAnd former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley, another Republican, said, “I’m not sure he came into office with the primary interest of the public good. That was secondary to what he wanted to do, which was promote Joe Arpaio.”\n\nArpaio denies that he craves publicity, but his friends and enemies say otherwise.\n\nHis office has been the set and subject of countless TV shows. He let the action-movie star Steven Seagal stage a reality show with one of his posses. The big coffee table in the waiting area outside of Arpaio’s office is covered with magazines bearing his face, most of them captioned “America’s Toughest Sheriff,” which Arpaio claims was coined by the TV show “60 Minutes.”\n\nArpaio’s two books extol his exploits as a cop in Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas and his swashbuckling days as a federal drug agent in Turkey and Latin America. He arrests the bad guys because he is a two-fisted individual who follows his own rules.\n\nAnd by living up to that reputation, he is now facing contempt of court — or worse.\n\nInside Sheriff’s Office headquarters, people seem alternately cocksure and anxious about whether Arpaio and his top deputies will be found in criminal contempt, whether there will be another Department of Justice criminal investigation into the office, like the one started in 2008, during the George W. Bush presidential administration, and dropped in 2012.\n\nThe contempt allegations, in part, were raised because Arpaio and his chiefs ignored the initial court order to stop racially profiling Latinos, essentially seeking out illegal immigrants under the guise of legitimate traffic stops.\n\nHis attorneys so far have failed in their bid to get the federal judge to recuse himself from the case because the judge questioned a pair of apparent investigations involving the judge and his wife. Arpaio is appealing the ruling.\n\nThose attorneys in the racial-profiling suit would like him to lie low on immigration matters. He cannot.\n\nSheriff defends Donald Trump at Phoenix campaign rally\n\nThough he claims not to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy, Arpaio defended remarks by the billionaire real-estate mogul that Mexicans are rapists and criminals, flowing through the border like water.\n\nTrump expanded on his anti-illegal-immigrant rant at his July Phoenix rally in front of nearly 5,000 angry “patriots” who cheered at every claim he made.\n\nArpaio took the podium before Trump, introduced in circus-barker terms as “The Greatest Lawman on Earth.”\n\n“We got a couple things in common,” he began. “The (Obama) birth certificate: He investigated it; I did. We both want to do something about the illegal immigrants.”\n\nThe crowd cheered. Then without irony, Arpaio said, “Isn’t this great in America, where anyone can run for president?”\n\nEven billionaires, one supposes. The crowd cheered again.\n\n“And second: freedom of speech,” he said, laying the words out like a bullet point.\n\nNever mind that a half-hour later, a group of young protesters would be swarmed by rally attendees when they tried to unfurl an anti-Trump banner. They were then escorted out of the conference hall by security guards, again to cheers.\n\nJoe Arpaio: ‘I won’t surrender and I won’t quit’\n\nDespite the ongoing contempt hearings relating to racial profiling, Arpaio’s publicity machine still sends out solicitations for campaign money in exchange for Arpaio’s continued vigilance on the immigration front.\n\n“Meanwhile, I’ve become the target of defeat because of my support for enforcing illegal immigration laws! This is nothing but pure politics,” said one recent pitch. “But I won’t surrender. And I won’t quit.\n\n“I don’t care if it’s the ACLU, liberal attorneys or these extreme open-border groups that want to see me gone. I’ve been the Sheriff for over 22 years and I took an oath to protect and defend both the Constitutions of the state of Arizona and the United States — and I will do that for as long as I am in office.”\n\nThe reward for contributing $100 to his campaign, the e-mail goes on to say, is a personally autographed photo.\n\nBut during the interview in his office, Arpaio’s attorney was sitting at his side to make sure he didn’t speak too freely. And when the subject of the pending contempt-of-court hearings came up, Arpaio suddenly went quiet.\n\n“I would love to talk to you,” he said. “Do you really think I don’t want to tell you? It frustrates me.”\n\nHe stopped pounding the table. His hands dropped to his lap and fidgeted nervously.\n\nHe seemed to ponder the legal fight ahead, if only for a moment.\n\nBut he soon returned to defiance; weeks later, U.S. marshals raided Arpaio’s headquarters because he still had not turned over evidence as ordered by the judge in the racial-profiling case.\n\nCue the music: “I did it my way.”\n\nJoseph Michael Arpaio has been a loner all his life.\n\n“The day I was born, my mother died in childbirth,” he has said more than once.\n\nHis parents were immigrants from Naples, Italy. His father ran a grocery store in Springfield, Mass. Since Arpaio was motherless and his father was busy at work, he was shuttled around the neighborhood from one Italian family to another.\n\n“There was a lot of discipline,” the Maricopa County sheriff told The Arizona Republic in 2002. “I don’t remember what I did to get whacked. I can’t actually tell you why.”\n\nA childhood friend told The Republic that Arpaio was withdrawn as a kid. Arpaio himself claims he was a mediocre student.\n\nPerhaps he has always been fearless as well.\n\nWhen he graduated from high school, he joined the Army and was sent to France. After three years in the service, he mustered out as a sergeant and landed a job walking a police beat in Washington, D.C.\n\nThere he met his wife, Ava Lamb, to whom he has been married for almost 58 years. They have two children, a son and a daughter. (As a matter of full disclosure, the daughter is married to the editor of the editorial pages for The Arizona Republic.)\n\nMost of what we know about Arpaio’s career as a cop and a federal agent is of his own telling in his two books, “Sheriff Joe Arpaio: America’s Toughest Sheriff,” published in 1996, and “Joe’s Law,” published in 2008.\n\nActually, Arpaio didn’t write either of them, and he has said he hasn’t even read them. As recently as this year, he denied he said some of the things in the books when they came up in a court of law.\n\nInstead, they were written by an author named Len Sherman, who works in Arpaio’s office. Sherman captures the grandiosity of Arpaio’s voice and the bravado of his tales. Some critics have postulated that the stories are embellished.\n\n“He has press clippings from everything he ever did,” Sherman said, except perhaps a claim that when Arpaio was a police officer in Las Vegas, he once made Elvis Presley pull over on his motorcycle and then, instead of issuing a citation, took him back to the station to sign autographs for the boys.\n\nDuring interviews, Arpaio opened file drawers in his office to show commendations, newspaper stories, even reports he typed up while he worked overseas for the federal Bureau of Narcotics. Arpaio remembers the names of perpetrators he arrested 60 years ago.\n\nWalking a beat in a tough D.C. neighborhood, the Arpaio voice of the books said, Arpaio knew the good guys and the bad guys, “the lone lawman striding down main street at high noon, taking on all comers.”\n\n“Not that everybody was glad to see me,” he wrote. “Given my gung-ho disposition, I didn’t wait for somebody else to let me know a crime was being committed. I did my own footwork, my own investigating, and I took matters into my own hands.\n\n“Not for nothing did I ‘win’ the title of ‘Most Assaulted Cop in D.C.’ in 1957, with a grand total of 18 serious encounters — not a little pushing and shoving, not a couple of taps and it was over, but full-out battles.”\n\nHe used his blackjack and nightstick 'without hesitation'\n\nIt was a time before “modern sensibility,” when it was OK to break heads, and Arpaio (as channeled by Sherman) extolled the bone-crushing properties of his police-issued blackjack and the reliability of his nightstick, “... and I used both without hesitation and whenever necessary, which was often.”\n\nArpaio spent three years on the D.C. police force, then six months in Las Vegas, before he was drawn to Chicago to work for the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, a precursor to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThat agency threw him onto the street without wasting any time sending him to “special Treasury school to get indoctrinated into the ways and means of my new job.”\n\nHe spent four years in Chicago, using his wits to bust drug dealers, playing “a hundred roles, with a thousand stories to accompany them,” and earning the nickname “Nickel-Bag Joe,” because there was no bust too small.\n\nThen in the early 1960s, he was shipped out to Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nArpaio’s stories from Turkey are glorious, as he travels to “the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing but trouble and danger. ... One day I’m meeting with the president of Turkey, the next day I’m shooting it out with bandits in the hinterlands.”\n\nHe repeatedly extols his disregard for the rules. He single-handedly takes 30-some Turkish opium farmers into custody, “which I mention quite incidentally, I had no authority to do.” After a shootout in which two drug dealers were killed, he angered the local governor, who “had not been properly forewarned and advised of my investigation,” and was accused of murder until the American embassy stepped in.\n\nThe typed reports he keeps in his office from those days document the gun battles and describe hauls of opium and morphine base in quantities up to a ton that he confiscated while working with Turkish law enforcement.\n\nHe ran out of bullets but still got the bad guy\n\nAfter three years in Turkey, the agency transferred Arpaio to Washington, D.C.\n\nSeveral newspaper articles in his files tell of a 1968 bust in Virginia when he shot it out with drug dealers while his partner was hiding in a car trunk.\n\nThe drug dealers had a gun to Arpaio’s head; Arpaio lunged for the weapon, and a melee began. Then, Arpaio, who describes himself as a lousy shot, ran out of bullets, but he managed to talk the drug dealers into surrendering to him anyway.\n\nBy 1970, he was abroad again, this time based in Mexico as director for regional operations, sending other agents to bust the bad guys in Latin America, dealing with corrupt leaders, he claims, and tracking a French drug mastermind to Paraguay.\n\nHe consulted with the U.S. ambassador in Paraguay, “and the ambassador told me I couldn’t work operationally on the ground or with the local police.”\n\nArpaio’s response: “Of course I can operate.”\n\nHe sent a covert crew on an unmarked government jet.\n\n“The son of a bitch might have been smart, but he was easy pickings,” Arpaio/Sherman wrote, referring to the French drug impresario. Working with local officers, his agents snagged the Frenchman, and he was “hustled aboard the jet, which flew directly to Dallas, allowing us to forgo extradition problems between the two nations.”\n\nSo much for laws. The bad guy went to prison, according to the book.\n\nArpaio came back to the U.S. in 1973 and worked at the highest levels of the newly renamed Drug Enforcement Administration. He did stints in Washington, Boston, and finished out his career in Phoenix as special agent in charge of Arizona.\n\nAfter he retired in 1982, he went to work in Ava’s travel agency, where he arranged flights for extradited criminals for the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office and offered potential orbital flights into outer space at $52,000 a pop.\n\nThen, in 1992, when he was already 60 years old, Joe Arpaio decided to run for sheriff.\n\nIn August 1991, Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies were called to the Wat Promkunaram Buddhist temple in Waddell, which served a mostly Thai community near Luke Air Force Base.\n\nThere they found nine bodies, face down in a circle, with their heads toward the center. They had been shot execution-style.\n\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office was then under the leadership of Sheriff Tom Agnos, who had been in office for one four-year term. Detectives hustled to solve the crime, and they rushed to judgment, arresting four Tucson men on a tip provided by a mentally ill man.\n\n“The Tucson Four,” as they became known, were driven to Phoenix and cloistered in hotel rooms where MCSO detectives browbeat them until they confessed to murders they did not commit.\n\nOnly by coincidence did MCSO detectives stumble upon the real killers, Alex Garcia and Johnathan Doody, a pair of teenagers who met in a high-school ROTC club, and they forced confessions out of them, too, trying to tie them to the Tucson Four. Eventually, when it became obvious that the Tucson men were innocent, then-County Attorney Rick Romley dropped the charges.\n\nOne of the teens confessed and was sentenced to life in prison. The other was found guilty of first-degree murder by a jury, though a federal appeals court later threw out the conviction because of the forced confession. He was re-convicted in 2014. Maricopa County paid out more than $2 million for the false arrests. And Agnos was tarnished and vulnerable.\n\nJoe Arpaio came into the race touting his drug-fighting experience and promising to carry on that fight as sheriff. He swore he would serve only one term, a promise he now says was a mistake, and one that he obviously did not keep.\n\nBut voters were distressed by the Temple Murders and the ensuing scandal and lawsuits. Arpaio squeaked by Agnos in the Republican primary, winning by 6,000 votes, then won decisively in the general election.\n\nAlmost immediately, Arpaio burst into the public eye, and his legacy has been a litany of gimmicks.\n\nOne of his earliest publicity coups came after Arpaio realized inmates were stealing underwear and taking it home when they were released. Arpaio ordered that it be dyed pink. It created an uproar that appealed to Arpaio, and he began selling the pink underwear in shopping malls, where he would personally autograph it for adoring fans.\n\nThere were some unintended consequences: An Irish court refused to extradite a pedophile priest who had fled the U.S. after being charged with sex crimes in Phoenix; the court ruled that the pink underwear was demeaning and proof of Arpaio’s abuse.\n\nArpaio also wrangled Army surplus tents, which he erected at his Durango Jail to house DUI arrestees and other low-security offenders. It was dubbed “Tent City,” and if it got warm or was deemed harsh, Arpaio was routinely quoted as saying, “Jail is not a country club.”\n\nSheriff Joe holds a press conference for every new idea\n\nArpaio’s other get-tough measures were similarly touted.\n\nHe changed the jail uniforms to old-fashioned, black-and-white horizontal stripes, like something out of a cartoon. He sent prisoners, including women, out on the streets to work in chain gangs. He served up green bologna sandwiches to the inmates, banned Playboy and other men’s magazines from the jails, denied access to coffee or cigarettes and chose the music and TV shows for the inmates.\n\nHe held a press conference for each and every new idea.\n\nThe public loved the tough-guy stance — and also when Arpaio showed his soft side by housing homeless dogs in an air-conditioned section of an outdated jail.\n\nIt played well to national media. Arpaio installed webcams in the jails and invited every media outlet to tour them. There were reality shows about female deputies, documentaries about Arpaio himself.\n\nOn the other hand, the public largely ignored lurid deaths of prisoners at the hands of detention officers or other inmates, even though they ended in spectacular jury awards.\n\nIn 1996, a man named Scott Norberg died after being beaten and tied into a restraint chair in one of the jails; in 2001, a mentally disabled man named Charles Agster met a similar fate in a restraint chair. Their families were awarded more than $17 million combined.\n\nThe Department of Justice took notice, investigating jail conditions multiple times since 1995. Sometimes the investigations would be dropped, other times federal judges would take the side of prisoners. But Arpaio always claimed victory.\n\nAmong the sheriff’s statutory duties is the ability to stage a posse, and Arpaio created them for every occasion: cold cases, animal abuse, aerial search and rescue.\n\nMany of them were established as non-profit organizations that amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations. The cold-case posse, for example, was the main player — and payor — in Arpaio’s investigation into President Barack Obama’s birthplace.\n\nNot all of his ideas passed muster with the law. When he announced early in his tenure that he would set up roadblocks around the county to stop drug smugglers, he came up against Romley, who told him the plan was not constitutional.\n\n“When he initially came to me, I told him ‘no’ on a number of questions,” Romley said. “He quit asking questions.”\n\nArpaio tangled with Romley again and again over the next 12 years, to the point where Arpaio tried to get Romley removed as his official lawyer under the statutes.\n\nNotable among the disagreements was a 2004 fight over a prostitution sting at massage parlors. Romley dropped 60 cases when it came to light that some of the deputies had gone nude and engaged in sex acts with the prostitutes they arrested.\n\nDo the duties of a sheriff include investigating the president?\n\nAccording to Arizona state statutes, the law-enforcement responsibilities of a county sheriff are vaguely defined as preserving the peace, arresting criminals and stopping riots.\n\nA sheriff’s main duties, as detailed in the statutes, are to attend the courts; keep the county jail operating and get the prisoners to court; do process serving; coordinate search and rescue missions; and take possession of the homes of deceased persons.\n\nArpaio expanded his duties to go off on political tangents, like investigating Obama’s birthplace and caring for abused pets. And he made himself the enforcer of state immigration law.\n\nPolicing illegal immigrants brought Arpaio to the nation’s attention — and to federal contempt-of-court hearings. Arizona was ground zero in a short-lived trend to write state laws to make up for a perceived lack of enforcement from the feds.\n\nBut immigration enforcement went from being the greatest asset to the biggest liability in Arpaio’s portfolio.\n\nHis second biggest liability was going after perceived enemies among elected officials and judges.\n\nThe third was a misunderstanding, perhaps disregard, of how public monies are spent and managed.\n\nAll three played out simultaneously between 2006 and 2010, and together, for better or for worse, they brought him to where he is today.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio once saw himself as a defender of immigrants. He had spent part of his career in Latin America, after all, and he claimed an affinity with Hispanics.\n\nIn April 2005, an Army reservist named Patrick Haab pulled a gun on five men he thought were illegal immigrants at a rest stop on Interstate 8. He made them lie down on the ground, and he called police.\n\nArpaio had Haab arrested.\n\n“Even law enforcement has to have probable cause before taking people out of their cars and telling them to lie on the ground. ... He threatened to kill them,” Arpaio told the media at the time. “He did not have the right to do what he did. How did he know they were illegal aliens?”\n\nBut County Attorney Andrew Thomas refused to press charges against Haab, saying that the immigrants and their smuggler had committed felonies by entering the country illegally. Haab, he said, had every right to make a citizen’s arrest.\n\nThe incident frosted relations between Arpaio and Thomas. Attorney Dennis Wilenchik, who would later work for both, claims that he brokered a truce between the two elected officials. That truce led to a disastrous collaboration.\n\n“We created a double-headed monster,” Wilenchik said.\n\nThomas had run for office with the brash promise that he could stop illegal immigration. Thomas helped pass the first state immigration laws in the country, working with Senate President Russell Pearce, who had once been Arpaio’s chief deputy.\n\nTo this day, Pearce remains a faithful Arpaio supporter. Soon, states across the union were passing their own immigration laws.\n\nArpaio takes center stage during anti-immigration fervor\n\nAnti-immigration fervor raged in Arizona. Arpaio, ever conscious of the public center of attention, signed on to the fight against immigration, and made it his own.\n\nIn 2006, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office investigated the first case to go to trial on Thomas’ theory that people sneaking into the state from Mexico could be prosecuted for conspiracy to commit human smuggling.\n\nThe case was dismissed after prosecutors rested because sheriff’s deputies had based their investigation entirely on the immigrants’ confessions, which is not enough to establish probable cause.\n\nNo other conspiracy to commit human-smuggling cases ever went to trial again, though many immigrants charged with the crime pleaded to lesser offenses and were deported.\n\nThe next year, 2007, Thomas and Arpaio helped the state Legislature push through the Employer Sanctions Law, creating consequences for businesses that hired illegal immigrants. The raids on businesses, ranging from furniture manufacturers to water parks, followed.\n\nDeputies arrested immigrants on felony charges of identity theft and forgery, ostensibly so that they could then build a civil case against the business (which rarely happened).\n\nArpaio or his chiefs would field complaints from citizens about Hispanic day workers gathering near businesses or about people speaking in Spanish in restaurants. Deputies and posse members were sent in saturation patrols to predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, pulling over drivers for cracked windshields, failure to use turn signals and other minor offenses and asking them for proof of citizenship.\n\nThen Arpaio held press conferences to publicize the raids and issued press releases to announce the arrests.\n\nUnder other laws pushed through by Thomas during that period, the illegal immigrants could be held without bond. The jails filled up.\n\nThe percentage of illegal immigrants arrested was exactly proportional to their presence in the general population, but their percentage in the jails swelled because they couldn’t be released like native citizens or legal immigrants who were charged with the same crimes. Arpaio touted the numbers as proof of the criminality of immigrants.\n\nBy 2007, immigration had become Arpaio’s main priority. That year, his office aligned with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in a program called 287(g), which allowed local law-enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law and gave them access to the federal database used to track and verify citizens and legal and illegal immigrants.\n\nAt the press conference to announce the new agreement, Arpaio took the microphone and mischaracterized what the program allowed his office to do.\n\n“Actually,” he said, “ours is an operation, whether it’s the state law or the federal, to go after illegals, not the crime first. ... My program, my philosophy is a pure program. You go after illegals. I’m not afraid to say that. And you go after them and you lock them up.”\n\nThose words would come back to haunt him in court.\n\nReporter rides along with deputies determined to arrest immigrants\n\nOther law-enforcement agencies balked at arresting immigrants, which brought Arpaio and Thomas closer together.\n\nIn 2007, when they signed their agreement to implement the new law that imposed sanctions on employers who hired illegal immigrants, Thomas publicly praised his partner’s “track record of enforcing our immigration laws and not caving in to political correctness.”\n\nThomas issued legal opinions averring that MCSO’s crime-suppression sweeps did not constitute racial profiling and that they were being carried out according to protocol.\n\nDespite what he and Arpaio would claim at press conferences, at times the profiling seemed blatant.\n\nOn a hot April afternoon in 2008, I rode in an MCSO cruiser during a crime-suppression operation in Guadalupe, accompanying a male and a female deputy who had been yanked off the animal-abuse unit to look for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe deputies were looking every which way, trying to figure out whom they should pull over. They were following instructions to pull over cars only in Guadalupe, regretting that they had to ignore likely prospects across the street in Tempe and noting that when it got dark, they could pull over people on bicycles if they didn’t have lights on their handlebars.\n\nFinally, they started following a couple of teenagers in an old beater, tailing the car until the driver made a turn without signaling and they had a reason to pull him over. The driver looked Mexican. He didn’t have a driver’s license or a green card. They thought they had an arrest.\n\nThen the teenager took out his cellphone and called his mom, who drove to the scene of the traffic stop from her house a few blocks away. She was angry.\n\nShe showed the teen’s driver’s license to the deputies. The boy wasn’t Mexican, he was Yaqui, and he had been born in Arizona. He had simply left his license at home. The deputies got back in their car and drove on.\n\nArpaio showed up in Guadalupe that evening for his photo opportunity. He was caught completely off guard when Rebecca Jimenez, the town mayor, got in his face and complained about the harassment of her townspeople.\n\nHe was so annoyed at Jimenez that he withdrew his office’s police coverage of the town, which did not have its own police force.\n\nIt was not the first nor last time he tangled with a public official.\n\nOn Jan. 25, 2006, Maricopa County Superintendent of Schools Sandra Dowling and her husband, Dennis, were coming home from a meeting with her attorney.\n\nThe meeting was related to her battle with the County Board of Supervisors over her pet project, the Thomas J. Pappas Schools for the Homeless, which were seen by the supervisors as an expensive budget drain.\n\nDowling had won the initial court battles proving that the elected officials on the Board of Supervisors could not tell another elected official how to run his or her office.\n\nMaricopa County officials called Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s office to say they thought deficits in Dowling’s budget came from misuse of funds, and MCSO served search warrants on Dowling’s office and her home.\n\nThe Dowlings’ daughter called to tell them someone had broken into the house.\n\nDowling told her, “Call the police.”\n\nThe daughter answered, “It is the police.”\n\nWhen Dowling and her husband arrived, she recalls, there were three helicopters and at least 35 Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies wearing SWAT team gear.\n\n“Every time I see Joe, he tells me there was only one helicopter, because they only had one,” Dowling said. She assumed the others were media helicopters.\n\nIt was cold, and Dowling was wearing a short-sleeved blouse, but when she tried to enter her house to get a sweater, she said, a deputy stiff-armed her and knocked her to the ground.\n\nShe called her lawyer, who told her to leave before she was arrested. She and Dennis went to a neighbor’s house and watched the raid on television.\n\n“You would have thought it was a murder scene from the media coverage,” she said.\n\nThey didn’t get back to their ransacked house until after 3 in the morning.\n\nEleven months later, Dowling was indicted on 25 criminal counts related to the operation of the Pappas Schools, including what investigators and prosecutors said was the theft of $1.9 million in public money.\n\nThe case was being prosecuted by the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, but it passed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office when Arpaio began investigating Attorney General Terry Goddard on unrelated matters that never came to fruition.\n\nThe Dowling case fell apart, the charges were thrown out, and Dowling ultimately pleaded guilty to a Class 2 misdemeanor for giving a summer job to her daughter. She was sentenced to probation that expired when her term of office ended. She sued, alleging malicious prosecution, and was eventually granted a settlement of $250,000.\n\nIt was the first of the assaults on supposedly corrupt elected county officials.\n\nSheriff’s Office takes on Phoenix New Times owners\n\nNext Arpaio took on the media.\n\nIn 2007, Arpaio’s chief deputy, David Hendershott, ordered the arrest of the owners of Phoenix New Times, Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.\n\nThree years earlier, the alternative news weekly had published an article that revealed the addresses of several properties owned by Arpaio. The story violated an obscure state law that makes it illegal to publish a law-enforcement officer’s address online; strangely, it is not illegal to publish such addresses in print.\n\nArpaio pushed County Attorney Andrew Thomas to press charges. Thomas appointed Dennis Wilenchik as special prosecutor. Wilenchik then issued a subpoena demanding documents related to the story and a list of the newspaper’s online readers.\n\nLacey and Larkin responded by defying grand-jury secrecy and revealing the contents of the subpoena\n\nDeputies showed up at their houses in the dead of night and threw them into dark SUVs with tinted windows and Mexican license plates. Although the two publishers were detained briefly, no charges were filed. They were ultimately awarded a $3.75 million settlement.\n\nThe immigration push also cost money, perhaps more money than the Sheriff’s Office had to spend.\n\nIn November 2007, just four months into its fiscal year, MCSO was already more than $1 million over its overtime budget for the year because of its practice of moving personnel around.\n\nOne of the solutions reached was to stop taking some jail inmates to their Superior Court hearings — which immediately angered the court’s presiding criminal judge.\n\nMaking sure that prisoners get to court is one of the sheriff’s main jobs; defendants are put in jail to make sure they get to court. Not allowing them to go to hearings raises constitutional issues and denies them due process.\n\nBut MCSO chiefs claimed they didn’t have enough detention officers to handle the court traffic, until they were reminded by the county supervisors that they had been given money to staff more officers than they had working. Sheriff’s chiefs and officers were dragged into contempt-of-court hearings.\n\nArpaio also began limiting jail visits by lawyers who were working with clients in custody, triggering another court battle.\n\nOther duties went untended.\n\nIt also came to light in 2007 that the office had failed to investigate hundreds of sex crimes, 60 percent of which were against minors.\n\nAn Arizona Republic series later found that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in some cases did not meet basic investigative standards like promptly following up with victims, doing early background checks on suspects, coordinating with other agencies and promptly presenting cases to prosecutors. Then the agency lost track of $600,000 to hire child-abuse investigators, and the money was never found.\n\nLater, Maricopa County finance staff would realize that over eight years, MCSO had misallocated $99.5 million by paying employees out of the wrong accounts and moving money around.\n\nThe failure to recognize basic accounting standards — in other words, that accounts are dedicated to specific purposes — launched the biggest political assault of Arpaio’s career.\n\nIn 2008, facing a slumping economy, the Board of Supervisors cut the sheriff’s budget.\n\nThe sheriff and Thomas responded with the newly formed “Maricopa County’s Anti-Corruption Effort,” also known as MACE.\n\nSuddenly, they were seeing corruption everywhere.\n\nSupervisor Stapley indicted on 118 counts, convicted of none\n\nIn December 2008, Maricopa County Supervisor Don Stapley was indicted on 118 felony and misdemeanor counts arising from omissions on annual financial statements he filed as an elected official.\n\nStapley did not think the financial statements were the real motive for the charges.\n\n“It was flat-out the budget,” Stapley said, and the charges were payback for the budget cuts, he thought, mostly at the request of Thomas and Hendershott, Arpaio’s chief deputy.\n\nHendershott took issue with $340 million in cash that had been set aside to build a new Superior Court building, averring that some of that money could be diverted to MCSO.\n\nWorking with Thomas, the Sheriff’s Office launched an investigation into the court, but Superior Court Presiding Criminal Judge Gary Donahoe declared a conflict and ordered Thomas off the case.\n\nThe animus heated up, with Thomas and MCSO on one side and the county management and Superior Court judges on the other.\n\nIn August 2009, sheriff’s deputies seized a county computer system, claiming that the county should not have access to certain law-enforcement data. Both sides sued.\n\nThe county yanked funding from Thomas and created its own civil-litigation unit because officials claimed that Thomas could no longer represent the county in court because of the ongoing litigation.\n\nBy September 2009, the charges against Stapley had been dismissed after it was discovered that the county had never actually instituted a requirement that supervisors file financial statements. Hendershott had Stapley arrested the next day in a county parking garage, referring him for charges on more than 95 new counts, including allegations of fraud related to campaign funds.\n\nThomas declined to prosecute, saying the case wasn’t ready.\n\nBut three months later, in December 2009, the hammer fell. Stapley was indicted on 22 charges. Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, a longtime critic of Arpaio, also was indicted on 36 charges alleging impropriety in taking loans from an agency the board had provided with funding. And Judge Donahoe was charged with bribery related to his rulings on the court tower.\n\nThen Arpaio and Thomas filed a civil-racketeering lawsuit in federal court against the Board of Supervisors and several Superior Court judges, including Donahoe, claiming they had conspired against them.\n\nBy March 2010, all of the charges and the lawsuits had been dismissed or dropped, triggering a tsunami of litigation.\n\nStapley’s case was also withdrawn, but Thomas did not give up on it.\n\nHe referred it to Gila County Attorney Daisy Flores, who concluded that Stapley may have committed fiscal transgressions, some of which might have been minor felonies, but that most of the charges were not crimes.\n\nFurthermore, Flores said that the investigation was so flawed and politically motivated that it could not be pursued.\n\n“The way in which the investigation and prosecution of Stapley progressed was fundamentally wrong, and to pursue further criminal actions against Stapley would be a miscarriage of justice,” Flores wrote.\n\n“The vast record is littered with behavior so egregious that a reasonable person’s sense of fairness, honesty and integrity would be offended. The (Gila County Attorney’s Office) is left with no choice but to decline this matter.”\n\nCounty officials win settlements of more than $8 million\n\nSupervisors Stapley, Wilcox and Andy Kunasek and Judge Donahoe sued; so did three other judges who had been targeted, several county employees and a business associate of Stapley.\n\nBy the time the dust cleared, taxpayers had paid more than $8 million in settlements, and more than $5 million in legal bills, plus another $6 million for other litigation in the cross-fighting.\n\nThomas and two of his deputy county attorneys were charged with ethics complaints by the State Bar of Arizona for their role in the attacks on judges and elected officials and were called before the Arizona Supreme Court’s disciplinary judge.\n\nBefore those hearings, it came out that sheriff’s deputies were tailing the Colorado attorneys who had been retained by the state Bar to investigate and prosecute, and the deputies in turn were tailed by FBI agents.\n\nThomas and one of his deputies were disbarred; the other was suspended from practicing law for six months.\n\nHendershott was fired.\n\nBut Arpaio came out unscathed.\n\nPeople in the Sheriff’s and County Attorney’s Offices were subjects of a federal investigation into abuse of power initiated during President George W. Bush’s administration.\n\nThe investigation was discontinued in September 2012 by U.S. Attorney for Arizona John Leonardo, who coincidentally had been the Pima County Superior Court judge who dismissed the criminal charges against Wilcox.\n\nIn a recent Republic interview with Arpaio, he cited that dismissed investigation as proof that the feds had nothing on him.\n\nBut civil-rights lawsuits had already been lodged by the American Civil Liberties Union and by the U.S. Department of Justice over an alleged pattern and practice of racial profiling against Latinos.\n\nTaxpayers would pay the cost.\n\nIn the thick of controversy, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio maintains a sense of humor and enjoys bantering with the press — even with reporters who have written unfavorable stories about him. Bad press is better than no press, and even negative stories make Arpaio’s supporters rally around him.\n\nHe is impulsive, which is, at once, his charm and his liability. He seems to have no filter, no self-censor, whether speaking to a convention or a reporter, a TV camera or a person on the street. He swears readily. He is always defiant.\n\nArpaio is facing contempt of court for defying a federal judge’s order to stop his immigration enforcement polices; hearings resume Sept. 24. The judge appointed a monitor to keep the office in compliance with orders in a federal racial profiling case.\n\nYet one afternoon, when the subject of his patented pink jail underwear came up, Arpaio turned to me and said, “I even gave a pair to the court monitor.”\n\n“Obviously, it hasn’t helped me any,” he said with a wink and a stagey smile.\n\nEncounters with the sheriff sometimes seem like surreal one-act plays.\n\nI first met him more than 20 years ago, at a north Phoenix department store where he was being fitted for a suit. I introduced myself and asked some long-forgotten reporter’s question.\n\nHe looked me in the eyes, scrunched up his face, and out of nowhere, said, “You’re too good-looking to be a reporter.”\n\nIt was as if someone had set off flashbulbs in my face. I was stunned and didn’t know how to respond. The conversation ended quickly.\n\nFast-forward at least 15 years. I was walking under the covered walkway between the two Wells Fargo buildings in downtown Phoenix, where Arpaio used to have his offices.\n\n“Hey Mike, hey Mike,” he called out. “How come you write all those nice stories about Andy Thomas?” referring to the former Maricopa County attorney who was disbarred for his role in prosecuting judges and county officials.\n\nHe had told me more than once that he would give me an office in his building if I would write about him.\n\n“They aren’t nice, Sheriff,” I answered.\n\n“I’m Italian,” he said. “You know what nice is for me? I stick the knife in, but I don’t twist it.”\n\nJust then, Chief Deputy David Hendershott lumbered by, looking like he was trying to get through the door without having to talk to Arpaio.\n\n“Dave, you don’t return my calls,” Arpaio said. He walked over to him. Hendershott stood speechless and stared at him. Arpaio started pulling aside the lapels of Hendershott’s sport coat.\n\n“You got your new gun with you?” Arpaio asked Hendershott. “Show Mike your gun.”\n\n“Don’t make him shoot me, Sheriff,” I joked.\n\nArpaio chuckled.\n\n“Aw, it would do more damage if I told him to Tase you,” he said.\n\nHe has maintained that sense of humor and human engagement over the two decades I have known him and reported about him and his office. It is why he maintains a following despite his many trials.\n\nI was once contacted during the height of the immigration sweeps by a Mexican journalist who wanted to know more about Arpaio before she interviewed him. She intended to write a damning critique of his policies.\n\nShe got angry when I told her that regardless of her reporting and her outlook, if she interviewed him, she would end up liking him, at least on an interpersonal level.\n\nArpaio begins his day early, stays at the office late\n\nArpaio also has a strong work ethic. He begins his day early and stays in the office late. As a concession to his age, he said, he only gives a speech a day now instead of two. Insiders say he spends the last hours of his workday in his office on his couch thinking or strategizing with his brain trust, cooking up the next defense, the next diversionary tactic, the next press release.\n\n“I’m not planning, I’m doing paperwork,” he counters.\n\nAge does not slow him down.\n\n“If you’re talking about his energy and his mental capacity, I haven’t seen any changes,” said Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan. “He is on the ball about things that are important to him. He can remember things like nobody I have ever met in my life.”\n\nExcept perhaps when he is on the witness stand. During the current contempt-of-court proceedings, as in the disciplinary hearings that led to former County Attorney Thomas’ disbarment, Arpaio was suddenly forgetful and couldn’t recall details.\n\nAttorney Michael Manning, who has become a wealthy man representing wrongful-death and civil-rights cases against the Sheriff’s Office, laughs when he recalls the explanation for memory lapses when Arpaio is on the witness stand.\n\n“In all of the cases I’ve had with him in front of a jury,” Manning related, “he said, ‘I’m sorry, I’ve got the flu.’ ”\n\nOn the stand, Arpaio says that he delegates day-to-day management to others. But as Sheridan said, he is on the ball about “things that are important to him” — which have become more eccentric.\n\nHis office brushed aside death threats made against attorneys in the Jodi Arias case, but when someone threatened CNN trial maven Nancy Grace, he sent investigators to make an arrest and got a conviction — even though the threat maker was in New York state and the person threatened was in Atlanta.\n\nIn his book, “Arpaio: De Facto Lawman,” former MCSO Deputy Chief Brian Sands wrote that Arpaio does not understand basic concepts like probable cause.\n\n“In reality, Arpaio wasn’t really running anything,” Sands wrote. “He just wasn’t paying attention. Instead he concentrated on running a full-time political campaign throughout his tenure in office,” Sands wrote.\n\nThe office was “constant managed chaos and damage control,” he wrote. “If it created controversy, Arpaio enjoyed the media attention.”\n\nAllegation that he doesn’t really like animals stings\n\nSands claims Arpaio is obsessed with death threats and once made deputies seize a pay phone from which a threat was made and run fingerprint tests on all the coins in the coin box, even though detectives told him it would serve no purpose.\n\nAnd he likes conspiracies, real or imagined: an improbable plot to kill him, involving the Mexican Zetas, the Minutemen vigilantes on the border, and a Phoenix Hispanic activist, for example, which Arpaio describes in one of his own books. Or conspiracies involving President Barack Obama and the federal government.\n\nIn his book, Sands recalls the day when a “tea party” group begged Arpaio to investigate whether Obama was born outside the United States, something Sands thought had already been settled. Arpaio referred to that investigation at the Donald Trump rally in July as if it were still ongoing.\n\nSands also said that despite Arpaio’s animal posse and well-publicized care of homeless dogs, Arpaio does not really like animals. It is the allegation that seemed to most upset Arpaio during an interview, and he said he did not have dogs because he did not feel it was safe for his wife to walk them because of security risks.\n\n“I have security issues I don’t want to get into,” he said.\n\nBut Arpaio has had many lesser leaps of logic over the years that I witnessed.\n\nIn 2007, at the time when MCSO stopped bringing jail prisoners to court, ostensibly to save money, Arpaio got called for jury duty, and his publicity people sent out press releases about how the sheriff was going to do his civic duty, just like any other citizen.\n\nArpaio’s panel was canceled, but he showed up anyway. And his office invited reporters to take advantage of the photo op, ignorant of two facts: You can’t shoot photos in the court hallways, and you can’t photograph jurors.\n\nI walked into the hallway on the seventh floor of the old East Courthouse; I had an office a floor above. I touched Arpaio’s arm as I walked past, and he jumped and didn’t recognize me.\n\nMinutes later, he suddenly noticed me.\n\n“Hey, Mike, hey Mike,” he called to me, and then he chatted about his impending jury service.\n\nI brought up the prisoners who weren’t making it to court, and how that amounted to denying their constitutional right to due process under the law, and Arpaio said it was the first he had heard of it. The next day, the policy seemed corrected, at least for a while.\n\nArpaio: Respect for those who come here legally\n\nDecisions can seem illogical, though it is difficult to tell if they come from Arpaio or from elsewhere in his office.\n\nIn 2007, a court interpreter named Ramon Delgadillo called to tell me that MCSO had instituted a new policy at the jail, requiring naturalized citizens to prove they were citizens.\n\nDelgadillo, a well-respected, 25-year employee of the county, was just going to the jail to do his job, but he was not allowed onto the premises because he did not have his naturalization papers. Naturalized citizens are not required to carry them.\n\nI called Arpaio. He said he was not aware of the policy, though he had ordered that no illegal immigrants would be allowed in the jails to visit anyone. But he bluffed anyway, and said that no one had a constitutional right to go into the jail.\n\nI asked him what papers he had in his wallet that proved that he was a citizen. He thought about it. Then, as we were speaking, he acknowledged that his own parents were naturalized citizens.\n\nThe next morning, I got a phone call from Arpaio’s public-information officer, who told me that Arpaio had rescinded the policy. I called him again.\n\n“I do have a deep respect for those who come here legally, like my mother and father who came from Italy, went through the system and became naturalized,” Arpaio said. “I have a deep respect for them. That’s one reason I’m going to change this policy.”\n\nBy 2010, the federal government and the federal courts would start changing the rest of his immigration policies.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s crusade against illegal immigration launched him from a late-show punchline to a national figure.\n\nStarting in 2005, Arizona was in the vanguard of states looking for local solutions to a national immigration problem. Arpaio was Arizona’s most visible enforcer.\n\nBut then, one by one, the state’s immigration laws that had propelled Arpaio into the national spotlight were disassembled by the federal courts.\n\nMost of the provisions in the multilayered and controversial Arizona immigration legislation called Senate Bill 1070, were blocked by a U.S. District Court judge in Phoenix in July 2010, before they could go into effect.\n\nTwo years later, the only part that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed back into the law books was a statute allowing police to inquire about the citizenship of people after they were stopped for other reasons.\n\nLater, the concept of charging immigrants as conspirators for smuggling themselves into the country was knocked down, and then the entire “coyote,” or human-smuggling, law was thrown out. So was the law requiring that illegal immigrants arrested on felony charges be held without bond.\n\n“Don’t blame me for that,” Arpaio said. “It was a federal decision.”\n\nAlso in 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice yanked the 287(g) certification for the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office— the program that allowed MCSO to enforce federal immigration law.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union’s racial-profiling lawsuit was filed in 2007, on behalf of Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres, a Mexican tourist who was in the country legally, but was detained for nine hours as if he were an illegal immigrant.\n\nOther Hispanics who had been arrested during immigration-control operations joined in and it became a class action.\n\nArpaio meets his match: Judge G. Murray Snow\n\nIn 2011, U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray Snow ordered Arpaio to stop enforcing federal immigration law.\n\nThe case went to trial in 2012, and in May 2013, Snow issued his findings: Arpaio and his staff had reacted to complaints about Mexicans gathering, especially day laborers, and staged their saturation patrols and raids accordingly, Snow found.\n\nThe deputies, Snow determined, used race as a major factor in deciding whom to pull over and whom to question. And even after MCSO’s 287(g) authority was revoked, Arpaio still told deputies they could enforce federal immigration law and that being in the country illegally was a crime, instead of what Snow called “an administrative violation of federal immigration law.”\n\nIn October 2013, Snow ordered the Sheriff’s Office to cease its immigration-control operations, submit to oversight by a “court monitor,” and update its technology to include cameras and data collection.\n\nThen, a year after the order, Snow brought Arpaio and his chiefs back into court.\n\nArpaio admitted that he and his deputies had continued to enforce federal immigration law for 18 months after being ordered not to, and that they had failed to turn over video and audio evidence.\n\nThe contempt-of-court hearings continued into the spring of this year, when the bombshell dropped.\n\nOn April 23, Arpaio was on the witness stand, when Snow suddenly asked him about two stories from Phoenix New Times.\n\nOne story claimed that Arpaio had sent a private investigator to look into whether Snow’s wife had told an acquaintance that Snow didn’t like Arpaio and wanted him out of office.\n\nThe other story alleged that Arpaio had an investigator in Seattle researching supposed CIA data showing connections and communications between the judge, then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and others. Arpaio acknowledged both investigations, but claimed that the information obtained was “junk.”\n\nArpaio’s lawyers subsequently asked Snow to remove himself from the case; the contempt hearings ground to a halt pending Snow’s decision. The investigations revealed conflicts of interest, they now claimed. And Snow asking about them raised even more conflict, they wrote in their motion.\n\nThen, on July 10, Snow denied the motion and refused to step down. For one thing, he wrote in his order, MCSO and Arpaio had been aware of the supposed conflicts of interest for more than a year and had deemed them unreliable. To bring them up again at this point in the contempt hearings, Snow wrote, was a deliberate delay and an “attempted manipulation.”\n\nArpaio appealed the ruling.\n\nSources inside MCSO say that those investigations never really took place, and that things are not what they seem.\n\nThe tip that Snow’s wife was bad-mouthing Arpaio at a Tempe restaurant was checked out by a private investigator, and then MCSO lawyers advised the office to just forget about it. It was put aside.\n\nA return of the birther investigator\n\nThe bigger stink that Arpaio was investigating links between Snow and the Department of Justice came out of another whimsical undertaking.\n\nDennis Montgomery, a Seattle-based computer expert who had worked on the birther investigation — that is, Arpaio’s probe into President Barack Obama’s birthplace — told MCSO that he had proof that the federal government was illegally gathering information about American citizens, including many from Maricopa County.\n\nJust as in the birther investigation or the unsuccessful federal lawsuit against Obama’s immigration policies, Arpaio had another chance to defy the president on behalf of the little guy.\n\nBut MCSO brass sent deputies to keep Montgomery on task. Myriad e-mails among Montgomery, his lawyer and MCSO supervisors chide Montgomery for dumping data and videos he had gathered from multiple sources, including Al-Jazeera, the Arabic news network. And when the office reached the point that they were going to cut Montgomery loose, he upped the ante and produced a “flowchart” alleging communication among Snow, Holder, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona, and others.\n\nBy then, more than $120,000 had been paid to Montgomery, and MCSO’s attorneys and top brass wanted to pull the plug. But the document got out into the light and was unsealed in the court record.\n\nSnow was not convinced. In his ruling, he noted that based on e-mails provided by MCSO, the Montgomery investigation continued up until the “eve” of the contempt hearings.\n\nAnd he noted that even after denouncing both investigations as “junk,” Arpaio’s lawyers still tried to use them to remove Snow from the case.\n\nNor does history help the sheriff’s case.\n\nArpaio clearly has a record of investigating and suing judges who made rulings he did not like.\n\nAnd it is noteworthy that former MCSO Deputy Chief Brian Sands, in his book, claims that Arpaio believed that his investigation of Obama’s birthplace would create a conflict with federal authorities that would protect him from legal action.\n\nAccording to Sands, after launching that apparently ongoing investigation, Arpaio said, “Now let them go after me with this abuse-of-power thing.”\n\nArpaio denied making the statement.\n\n“I knew it would make it worse for me,” he said.\n\nCounty officials detail Sheriff’s Office’s legal costs\n\nAccording to county officials and other sources, Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office have been the reason for more than $142 million in payouts for settlements, court awards and attorneys’ fees since Arpaio took office.\n\nThe county’s Risk Management Department, which is its self-insurance program, has paid more than $78 million in settlements, awards and litigation since Arpaio took office in 1993. Less than half of that, $30 million, is actually for jail claims, and another nearly $20 million was paid out for traffic accidents, boating accidents and other small claims.\n\nThe rest of the risk-management figure, more than $28 million, was paid for legal matters listed as civil-rights violations, false arrest, conspiracy and malicious prosecution, which would include the Dowling, Phoenix New Times and county-wars settlements.\n\nBut there’s more.\n\nThe county Office of Management and Budget has paid out another $6.2 million for other legal costs of the county wars.\n\nThe Department of Justice lawsuit has already cost nearly $5 million. Like the Melendres racial-profiling case, it alleged civil-rights violations and discrimination against Latinos in traffic stops, and the judge on that case accepted the Melendres conclusions to rule that racial profiling indeed took place. That suit also alleged discrimination in the jails and raids on work sites as well. And it addressed Arpaio’s retaliation against the other elected and appointed county officials.\n\nBut the county and the Department of Justice settled most of the rest of the case out of court, because Arpaio had already changed the office’s immigration policies (if not his personal opinions), sidestepping more costly litigation.\n\nBy next year, the cost of the Melendres case will reach $52.5 million, plus attorney costs to be determined. And Snow is talking about holding another trial to determine compensation for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit.\n\nThe county’s running total as of Aug. 31: $142,040,779, of which $91,934,494, nearly two-thirds, is because of Arpaio’s court and political battles.\n\nBut those figures only show how much money was paid out by the county. The total legal expenses are actually higher. At times, there were co-defendants in the lawsuits who had to pay a share of a jury award of settlement. And awards over $5 million, like the two wrongful-death cases involving restraint chairs in the jails, were paid by insurance, with the county only paying a deductible of $1 million or $2 million.\n\nOnly two of the Maricopa County supervisors criticized Arpaio for the financial cost.\n\n“I personally get the feeling that enough’s enough,” said Supervisor Steve Gallardo, the board’s lone Democrat, who is in the first year of his first term. “The board is tired of shelling out millions of dollars for things that are not his job. He’s not even doing his job.”\n\n“We have a laundry list of projects and we can’t do them because of the sheriff,” Gallardo said.\n\nSupervisor Andy Kunasek, the only supervisor still in office who was targeted by Arpaio and former County Attorney Andrew Thomas during the county wars, said, “If, God forbid, I was sheriff, I’d exit now with as much grace as possible, because it’s not going to get any better.”\n\nThe other three sitting supervisors were more careful in their remarks.\n\n“As a fiscal conservative, I don’t like having the county spending money on things that we shouldn’t have to pay for,” said County Board Chairman Steve Chucri, before pointing out that Arpaio is an elected official.\n\nThe board has no power to remove him, and the county battles of 2008-10 came largely out of the board’s attempt to control Arpaio and Thomas through their budgets. Yet at the same time, the county is responsible for paying Arpaio’s legal expenses, even if it cannot stop the actions that led to lawsuits.\n\nSupervisor Denny Barney raised the same point.\n\n“In my mind, we’ve got the Melendres issue and the DOJ issue, but we’ve got a unique constitutional constraint in this county in that we have an elected sheriff whose budget is set by a board,” Barney said.\n\nTo wit: Sheriffs are appointed in many parts of the country. In recent years, sheriffs in Denver and Philadelphia were removed or resigned after high-money legal settlements.\n\nSupervisor Clint Hickman dodged the question.\n\n“I am going to continue to help a relationship that my district has with (Arpaio’s) command staff and his patrol officers.”\n\nArpaio sees the cost as part of the job.\n\n“When you run a big organization, whether you’re the president of the United States, you will have personnel problems,” he said. “When you run a jail system all these years, and also we run enforcement, when you nail it down, I don’t know if you can say it’s out of line.”\n\nOn June 9, a few days before his 83rd birthday, Joe Arpaio held a party at his headquarters on Jackson Street to celebrate being the longest-serving sheriff in Maricopa County history after 221/2 years.\n\n“It’s really emotional to have survived all these years,” he told the adoring audience.\n\nHe was presented a giant Stetson cowboy hat with the words “Longest Serving Sheriff in Maricopa County History” on the side, and when they sat it on his head, it came down over his ears.\n\nThen he was handed a Smith & Wesson pistol engraved with the words “America’s Toughest Sheriff” and an image of his sheriff’s badge.\n\nState historian Marshall Trimble, who was making the presentations, then said, “He’s got to have a caballo.”\n\n“Do I have to ride it?” Arpaio asked. “Let’s go and say hello.”\n\nOutside, a brown horse with a white face was waiting. Arpaio held the reins and stroked the horse’s face as the cameras whirred and snapped. Then the fans and admirers gathered to take selfies with America’s Toughest Sheriff. (The horse, incidentally, went home with its real owner that night, not Arpaio. It had been another prop for a photo op.)\n\nA reporter stuck a tape recorder in Arpaio’s face and asked, “What do you think your legacy will be?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m not dead yet,” he snapped back, before heading back inside to eat cake.\n\nAnother day, another protest, another demand for his resignation\n\nA month later, there was a different sort of gathering over Arpaio’s legacy.\n\nIn mid-July, a Hispanic activist group called Puente staged a protest asking for Arpaio to resign, marching the eight blocks from the downtown Phoenix Convention Center to the Fourth Avenue Jail.\n\nArpaio locked the jail down hours before the march even began. Defense attorneys gathered a few blocks away, outside the Office of the Legal Defender and the Office of the Legal Advocate, two of the county’s public-defender agencies, wondering why they could not get into the jail to see their clients. They mostly shook their heads as if this were just another day in Maricopa County.\n\nThe march was more than just the usual suspects. Puente organizers took advantage of a gathering of a politically progressive organization called Netroots Nation, which was meeting for its annual conference.\n\nA group of 500 to 600 mostly Anglo and mostly young people stretched for blocks as it marched down Jefferson Street, chanting, “Arrest Arpaio, not the people,” wearing T-shirts that said, “Arpaio-free AZ” or “Adelante (Forward) AFL-CIO.” They carried signs that said, “I have a concentration camp and it’s called Tent City,” and “ICE out of 4th Ave Jail.”\n\nThey were flanked by Phoenix police officers in squad cars, on motorcycles and bicycles, and on foot.\n\nWhen they reached Fourth Avenue, the protesters turned south, where they were met at the jail by fewer than a dozen Arpaio supporters, mostly senior citizens, carrying American flags and holding “We support Arpaio” signs. The marchers circled the block around the jail and then marched on to Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office headquarters a few blocks away.\n\n“Once again, it’s to tell Arpaio to resign,” said Carlos Garcia, from Puente. “We’re here to ask Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get out of there and to shut down Tent City and get justice for Arpaio victims.”\n\nMCSO deputies stood quietly in front of Arpaio’s fortress watching the protesters.\n\nSome soul-searching from inside the Sheriff’s Office\n\nSome protest comes from within the Sheriff’s Office.\n\nAt a routine morning meeting in March, Arpaio surprised his deputy chiefs by asking them if they thought he should stay in office.\n\n“Should I run for sheriff — for the seventh time?” he asked them.\n\nIt was more a declaration than a moment of soul-searching as they sat around the giant oblong conference table in Arpaio’s vast office.\n\nThe four deputy chiefs in the room on that March morning agreed that he should stay. Deputy Chief Jack MacIntyre recalls answering, “That’s a decision for you and your wife.”\n\nThe only person in the room with second thoughts was Public Information Officer Lisa Allen, who thought that the strain would be great on Arpaio and his family, especially because of the media.\n\nArpaio’s mind was already made up. “Not that it matters what they answer,” he told me.\n\nBut a month later, another deputy chief, Brian Lee, began circulating a letter asking Arpaio to either resign or stand down for re-election. No one would sign, and Lee was determined to talk to the sheriff himself to tell him it was time to go.\n\n“He spoke with a number of other chiefs, writing things down. ‘You should think about not running again,’ ” Allen claimed he said. “He did say to the sheriff that he felt it was not in his best interests to run again.”\n\nLee went to Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan for advice before talking to Arpaio. Sheridan didn’t want to see the letter Lee had prepared, and he told him to temper his remarks.\n\nArpaio doesn’t remember the conversation going that way.\n\n“He came in when there was a rumor going around,” Arpaio recalls. “He came in to say his opinion.”\n\nThe sheriff paused a moment.\n\n“Maybe some people think I should leave, and I understand that,” he said.\n\nBut his mind is made up.\n\n“Well, I’m running again,” he told The Arizona Republic a week after his longevity party. “It will be my seventh term.”\n\nHe didn’t say that it will be his final term.\n\n“I’m proud of the fact that I’m the longest-serving sheriff in the history of Maricopa County.”\n\n“What would be grounds for stepping down?” I asked, and the question befuddled him.\n\n“If I get shot or something. That would be the only thing that might make me not run. I’m running,” he said. “I’m not going to desert this organization.”\n\nHe did not think he would be forced to resign if found in contempt of federal court for defying a judge’s order to stop enforcing his immigration policies. His contempt hearing before U.S. district Court G. Murray Snow is scheduled to resume Thursday.\n\nRussell Pearce: ‘He’s doing the job we hired him to do’\n\nArpaio still has his supporters.\n\n“If a man is competent and is doing what he promised to do and what he’s supposed to do, then that man should stay in office,” said Russell Pearce, a former state senator and long-time Arpaio ally. “Arpaio is not a young man, but he’s competent, and he’s doing the job we hired him to do, so he should run.”He still has supporters.\n\nBut his popularity is fading. According to a Rocky Mountain Poll this March, the share of people polled who believe Arpaio is doing a good job had fallen to 38 percent. He won the 2012 general election with just 50.7 percent of the vote.\n\n“I think (Arpaio) is vulnerable,” pollster Earl DeBerge said.\n\nAnd the number of naysayers is growing.\n\nHis former self-proclaimed “attack dog,” attorney Dennis Wilenchik, who defended the Sheriff’s Office in the early days of the county battles, said he thinks Arpaio has overstayed his welcome.\n\n“He’s old. He’s not a bad guy personally, but it’s time to go. He’s an embarrassment to the state,” Wilenchik said.\n\n“His ego has gotten so big that even at his toughest time in his career, I don’t think he knows how to back down, how to see he’s wrong. I think we’re seeing the beginning of the end,” Supervisor Steve Gallardo said.\n\nArpaio’s friend, the public-relations guru Jason Rose, agrees with Gallardo to an extent.\n\n“It’s the exception not the rule that elected officials go out on their own terms. There’s a statute of limitations on electability,” Rose said. “Knowing the sheriff like I do, saying ‘I’m sorry’ and admitting things might be the toughest professional thing he’ll ever do.”\n\nRose points out that Arpaio’s enormous campaign war chest may once again save him at the polls. But his advice is to apologize for past mistakes.\n\n“Stare right into the camera and speak directly to the people,” Rose said. “Show a little more humility and a little less hubris, and it might go a long way for him.”\n\nEven Arpaio’s biographer, Len Sherman, wonders if reckoning day is coming for Arpaio.\n\n“You reap what you sow,” Sherman said. “If you’re going to do things the way you want, you might pay the consequences.”\n\nSherman didn’t think that would happen when he wrote the preface of Arpaio’s second book, Joe’s Law.\n\n“We quickly tire of our heroes, probably because they’re not really heroes at all. They appear, they glitter, they are everywhere, and then we learn the truth that they are nothing but false fronts ... (T)hey’re all part of the same media world we inhabit — and they’ve all disappointed us so many times that poll after poll demonstrates that we no longer trust any of our leading institutions.\n\n“And so to Joe Arpaio.”\n\nArizona Republic justice reporter Michael Kiefer did more than three dozen interviews over the past six months and read three books about Arpaio to report on this series.\n\nSince 2003, Kiefer has written more than 320 articles that included Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He has known Arpaio for more than 20 years.\n\nSome of this story is based on Kiefer’s interactions with the sheriff.\n\nKiefer is a senior reporter who has covered courts, justice and Maricopa County government issues for The Republic since 2003. He was part of a team that won The Sidney Hillman Award and Best in the West for coverage of the surge of immigrant children and mothers from Central America.

Richard Shelby. In Georgia, former Vice President Mike Pence is rallying support for Gov. Brian Kemp as the Republican incumbent seeks to fend off a May 24 primary challenge from Trump-backed former Sen. David Perdue. The decision by Pence to campaign for one of Trump’s top GOP targets marks yet another break with his former boss. A special primary election is also set to occur to succeed former Minnesota Rep.

As experts struggle to figure out what's causing the outbreak and how the virus is spreading, answers remain elusive.\n\n\"We are really struggling with this unprecedented event,\" said Dr. Carol Cardona, avian health expert at the University of Minnesota. \"We're in a situation that ... we answer one question and come up with 16 more.\"\n\nStory continues below.\n\nMinnesota has been bracing for the possibility of an avian flu outbreak for decades. The first case of the virus in the Mississippi flyway was confirmed March 5.\n\nSince then, new Minnesota cases have been in the headlines nearly every day. It's affected farms in 15 counties, including Stearns, Meeker, Kandiyohi, Otter Tail, Wadena and Pope.\n\nExperts believe the virus is spread by migratory waterfowl such as ducks and geese, which don't typically get sick but spread the virus through their feathers or feces. From there, it can be spread to domestic poultry flocks, where it's very deadly.\n\nIt's clear that the virus isn't spreading from farm to farm because of the random way the cases are popping up, Cardona said. In some cases, it's not even spreading from barn to barn on the same farm.\n\nBecause the virus has been found in waterfowl in other states, it's unlikely that rodents are to blame, Cardona said. And when it's been detected in turkeys, the molecular signature of the virus is similar to that found in wild birds.\n\nStearns and Kandiyohi counties have high concentrations of both turkey and waterfowl populations, making them more vulnerable to an outbreak of the avian flu, said Bethany Hahn, spokeswoman for the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.\n\nState animal health experts have kicked into high gear to tackle the outbreak. About 50 full-time employees at the Board of Animal Health are working on the response effort, along with staff from the federal and state agriculture departments and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\n\n\"We do have folks working on this seven days a week,\" Hahn said. \"We're taking this very seriously.\"\n\nOnce the virus is detected in a turkey flock, officials move quickly to contain it. A 10-kilometer quarantine is drawn around the infected farm. Because the farms are relatively close together, the control areas have started to overlap, Hahn said. In Stearns County, it's become one larger area instead of several smaller ones.\n\nState officials won't confirm the locations of the infected farms. \"Keep Out Disease Control\" signs are posted at the entrances of several turkey farms in the Melrose area, just down the road from the Sauk River.\n\nEvidence indicates that the virus is being introduced into farms through what experts call a point source introduction rather than spreading from farm to farm, Hahn said.\n\n\"There seems to be no apparent connection between all of the farms that have been affected so far,\" she said.\n\nThe costs of the response effort are starting to mount. The House and Senate both passed bills that would provide funding to the state agencies for the costs not covered by federal funding.\n\nBut the bills don't cover the financial costs to turkey producers facing the loss of thousands of their birds to the disease, which isn't covered by insurance.\n\nFarmers are compensated by the federal government for healthy birds destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading. But for birds that die before the disease is detected, there is no reimbursement, said Rep. David Bly, DFL-Northfield, the House bill's chief author. Bly said the ongoing costs to producers are a \"huge concern.\"\n\n\"It will be very problematic for our turkey-growing industry,\" he said.\n\nThere's also concern that a lengthy outbreak could have long-term impacts on the poultry industry. Minnesota is the leading turkey producer in the nation, and Stearns County is one of the top-producing turkey counties in the state.\n\nHealth officials are cautioning that avian flu could be around for the next several years. Although the virus can't survive in temperatures above 80 degrees, it's likely to return in the fall when cool weather returns, Cardona said.\n\nThe Minnesota DNR has joined the effort to track the source of the disease. DNR staff have been out collecting fresh waterfowl feces that will be tested for signs of the virus. For Fred Bengton's staff in the DNR's Sauk Rapids office, that meant collecting more than 300 samples in Stearns County, primarily near the Sauk River.\n\nThe samples are sent to a federal lab in Fort Collins, Colorado, for testing. So far, there hasn't been a positive.\n\n\"It's still a question mark where these birds are getting it from,\" Bengston said. \"We're kind of scratching our heads on how that's happening.\"\n\nState and national experts stress that the virus does not pose a food safety risk. No human infections of this strain of the virus have been detected in the United States, and there's no evidence that people can acquire avian flu by eating poultry products.\n\nTurkey producers are taking the outbreak seriously and stepping up biosecurity efforts, said Steve Olson, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association.\n\n\"The focus for growers is stopping everything at the barn door,\" Olson said.\n\nPoultry farmers have always taken precautionary measures such as wearing coveralls and using disinfectant foot baths, Olson said. They've increased those efforts, including keeping out unnecessary traffic and washing the tires and wheel wells of trucks that do come in, he said.\n\nWorkers now tuck their pant legs inside their boots to keep them from dragging on the ground and put on fresh coveralls and boots when they come in from outside, Olson said.\n\n\"The focus has been on increasing the awareness of where their feet have been,\" he said.\n\nNo human infections of the virus have been detected. The Minnesota Department of Health has been interviewing workers at affected farms to find out what contact they had with infected flocks and what protective equipment and clothing they were using, said Joni Scheftel, state public health veterinarian.\n\nThe health department contacts the workers every day for 10 days, asking if they have developed an eye infection, cough, sore throat, runny nose or fever. Some have been advised to take an anti-viral medication, but none have developed any real symptoms, she said.\n\nBut even though the virus hasn't caused physical illness in humans, it's taken a emotional toll.\n\n\"Watching birds die and not being able to do anything about it and having to euthanize healthy birds is pretty tough,\" Olson said.\n\nAnd for those producers whose flocks haven't been infected, the apprehension is difficult to bear, he said.\n\n\"They're kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop,\" he said.\n\nFollow Kirsti Marohn on Twitter @kirstimarohn or reach her by phone at 255-8746.\n\nBird influenza Q&A\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa – Scientists believe 70-degree temperatures will kill the deadly bird flu virus and the change in weather can't come fast enough for producers in some Midwestern states struggling to contain a virulent strain that has doomed nearly 6.7 million turkeys and chickens since March. Here are some questions and answers about the outbreak:\n\nWHAT'S THE LATEST?\n\nThe number of hens that'll have to be killed at a northwest Iowa farm was revised downward Tuesday, from 5.3 million to 3.8 million. That's still the largest number of poultry in one spot to be affected.\n\nThe smaller yet still large figure is the actual number of chickens at Sunrise Farms instead of the capacity of the farm, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Iowa agriculture officials gave Monday.\n\nA total of eight Midwestern states, Iowa included, have been affected by the H5N2 virus. On Tuesday, four more farms, three in Minnesota and one in South Dakota, confirmed outbreaks.\n\nWHAT'S THE OUTLOOK?\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years. USDA Chief Veterinary Officer Dr. John Clifford said Tuesday that once temperatures reach the 70s, new cases should drop off as the virus doesn't survive well in warmer weather. In Minnesota, where many turkey farms have been affected, temperatures barely reached 40 in some spots Tuesday.\n\nFederal and state agriculture officials are confident that current quarantines, surveillance and biosecurity measures will limit the spread, though any significant spreading of the virus would be cause for concern. Resurgence is expected this fall when wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter.\n\nWHAT KIND OF FLU IS THIS, EXACTLY?\n\nH5N2 is a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. The risk to the public is considered low, and infected birds and eggs are kept out of the food supply.\n\nWHERE IS THIS TURNING UP, AND IN WHAT KINDS OF BIRDS?\n\nOnly two egg operations have been affected — one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all of the other cases have been at commercial turkey farms. Twenty-eight turkey farms in Minnesota, the nation's top turkey-producing state, have been affected — more than anywhere else. Experts say that's due to its thousands of lakes and ponds, which are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl.\n\nARE TURKEYS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN CHICKENS?\n\nIt appears turkeys pass this strain of virus on to others more easily than chickens; the fatality rate in turkey flocks is often 100 percent vs. about 60 percent in chickens. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia.\n\nAREN'T MOST COMMERCIAL POULTRY BARNS TIGHTLY CONTROLLED TO KEEP DISEASES OUT?\n\nThey are enclosed, but not airtight. Poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who and what is allowed in: Workers often have to shower, wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant, while equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized. But the system doesn't always work, and rodents and wild birds can bring in the virus. Clifford said it's even possible wind-blown feathers and dust exposed to wild bird droppings could spread it.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN BIRD FLU ARRIVES?\n\nAffected birds die, and quickly. And once an infection is confirmed at a farm, all surviving birds are typically killed to prevent it from spreading. Turkeys and chickens being raised for meat are killed by pumping a water-based foam into the barn floor. In egg-laying facilities, where multiple levels of cages are off the floor, birds will likely be euthanized with carbon dioxide, rendering them unconscious in seconds.\n\nWHAT DO THEY DO WITH THE CARCASSES?\n\nThey compost them — usually in the same barn where they died. The heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry, such as salmonella. The compost then can be safely spread as fertilizer.\n\nHOW ARE FARMS AFFECTED FINANCIALLY?\n\nAn outbreak certainly can cost a farm dearly. The government doesn't compensate producers for birds that die of the virus itself, but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution. That gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks.\n\nDOES THIS MEAN I'LL BE PAYING MORE FOR TURKEY, EGGS AND CHICKEN?\n\nThough roughly one in five eggs nationwide come from Iowa, consumers are unlikely to see price spikes in the near future. The toll nationwide represents just a small part of U.S. turkey and egg production.\n\nBy The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/22"}]}

Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

It was \"the only Chicago baseball championship at Wrigley Field,\" observed author Sam Pathy. \"Ironically, the euphoric day marked the last game in Federal League history.\"\n\nApril 20, 1916\n\nThe Chicago Cubs played for the first time at the ballpark, beating the Cincinnati Reds 7-6 in 11 innings. Whales owner Charles Weeghman had purchased the Cubs and moved them into his ballpark.\n\nMay 2, 1917\n\nThe only time in major league history two pitchers (the Cubs' Hippo Vaughn and Cincinnati's Jim Toney) hurled no-hitters through nine innings. The Reds scored on an unearned run off Vaughn in the 10th, and Toney retired the side in the bottom of the inning.\n\nAug. 25, 1922\n\nThe Cubs (26) and Phillies (23) set the still-standing major league record for total runs in a game.\n\nSept. 28, 1930\n\nThe Cubs' Hack Wilson knocked in his 191st run of the season, setting a major league record that still stands. At the time, it was thought to be his 190th, but research after Wilson's death uncovered an RBI wrongly attributed to a teammate. The closest anyone has come to the record is Lou Gehrig, who had 185 the following year.\n\nOct. 1, 1932\n\nBabe Ruth's \"called shot\" in Game3 of the World Series. Many doubt \"The Bambino\" actually was pointing at Wrigley's bleachers seconds before launching a home run there, but there's no dispute the blast helped propel the New York Yankees to a sweep of the Cubs.\n\nSept. 28, 1938\n\n\"The Homer in the Gloamin',\" as Cubs player-manager Gabby Hartnett hit a game-winning blast as the game was about to be called because of darkness. The name is a reference to a 1911 love song called Roamin' in the Gloamin.' The win against the Pittsburgh Pirates completed a monumental comeback in the standings for the Cubs, who finished a sweep the next day and clinched the National League pennant days later. \"The story has a little bit of everything,\" Cubs historian Ed Hartig told USA TODAY Sports. \"It's got late-innings suspense, late in the season, a great comeback and a legendary ballplayer.\"\n\nOct. 10, 1945\n\nThe Tigers knocked off the Cubs in Game 7 of the World Series 9-3. Wrigley hasn't seen a Fall Classic since. The Cubs lost three of the four games played at Wrigley.\n\nMay 18, 1947\n\nJackie Robinson became the first African-American player in a major league game in Chicago, as the Dodgers beat the Cubs 4-2. The \"46,572 paying customers … were luckier than the 20,000 or so fans who milled around outside Wrigley Field, unable to get in,\" wrote George Will. \"It was probably the largest concentration of African Americans in the history of the North Side up to that point.\"\n\nOct. 1, 1969\n\nIn the 162nd game of the season, the Cubs fell to the New York Mets 6-5. It was their 18th loss in 30 days, as their 91/2-game lead over the Mets on Aug.19 turned into an eight-game deficit. History views it as one of the most significant collapses in pro sports.\n\nAug. 8, 1988\n\nThe \"8/8/88 game\" was to be the first night game at Wrigley. It was postponed because of rain in the fourth inning, but the lights had arrived.\n\nMay 6, 1998\n\nIn what Hartig calls one of the top two games in Wrigley's history, 20-year-old Kerry Wood allows only a single while striking out 20 Houston Astros in a 2-0 victory. Pathy points out that Bill James' \"Game Score\" system \"ranked this as the greatest pitching performance in big-league history.\"\n\nOct. 14, 2003\n\nWith the Cubs leading 3-0 and five outs from their first World Series in 58 years, Moises Alou fails to catch a ball hit just into the stands down the left-field line. Among the spectators attempting to snag the souvenir is loyal Cubs fan Steve Bartman. The team seemingly comes apart for the rest of the game, allowing the Florida Marlins to score eight unanswered runs. No pennant for the Cubs that year.

Hard to believe Twitter got something wrong.\n\n6. “Manning throws three interceptions.” And Peyton didn’t even play.\n\nNFL playoff picture post-Week 12: Who's in good shape?\n\n7. The most surprising thing was no college coaches were fired in the time between those two scores.\n\n8. Replay review II: Catch the clip of referee Walt Coleman announcing the decision after being in the replay booth: The ruling on the field is confirmed of a completed catch … no, incomplete. Pass is incomplete.”\n\n9. Yep, it’s been that kind of year for the referees (see item No. 22).\n\n10. And those Seahawks just won’t go away.\n\n11. Not sure if Chip Kelly has them on his fantasy team, but Jeremy Maclin, DeSean Jackson and LeSean McCoy all scored touchdowns.\n\n12. Who we kidding? With the way Kelly’s season is going, he started Nick Foles on his fantasy team this week.\n\n13. Jameis Winston was 4 years old when Matt Hasselbeck was drafted. So there’s that.\n\n14. Giants QB Eli Manning has now thrown an interception on the opening drive in two of his last three games. The Redskins, in fact, picked off two of his passes in the first quarter. And turned them into zro points. Ah, the NFC East.\n\n15. Coming off emotional wins over Seahawks and Bengals, it was safe to assume the Cardinals would have a letdown. A classic win-and-move-on game for them and an important division victory against 49ers.\n\n16. We were critical of J.J. Watt earlier in the season, so it’s only fair we point out he has 9.5 sacks in his last five games. (You don’t want to have J.J. Watt angry at you, know what we mean?)\n\n17. The Texans had not scored on their opening drive all season. Then they played the Saints. Touchdown! We blame Rob Ryan.\n\n18. The Titans missed an extra point for the first time since 2006.\n\n19. Replay review III: The “touch” on the Tyrod Taylor TD pass to Sammy Watkins in the second quarter. Sweet.\n\n20. The Giants are so banged up they used Montori Hughes, at 350 pounds, on the kickoff team.\n\n21. Thursday flashback I: Hall of Fame QB Bart Starr won the day. Sorry Panthers, Lions and Bears.\n\n22. Tom Brady and the Patriots were red-hot about several late calls that went against them in their first loss of the season. Get ready for a week of officiating talk, even if Bill Belichick was his usual stoic self in his postgame press conference.\n\n23. Not as stoic about officiating: 49ers center Alex Boone. \"I thought those refs sucked,\" Boone said after San Francisco's loss to Arizona. League office on line one.\n\n24. A half-filled stadium in Kansas City? Wow. We know it rained, but that can’t sit well with the NFL folks who worry about things like that.\n\n25. A half-filled stadium in San Francisco? Well, yeah. That’s what happens when you aren’t good.\n\nBell: Steelers may be dogged by Mike Tomlin's failed gamble all season\n\n26. Thursday flashback II: The question isn’t whether Tony Romo came back too soon, it is why the team allowed him to come back and play twice in five days. Remember that the next time the league boasts of its concern for “players’ health.”\n\n27. The Ravens' Will Hill reminded us Monday night why we tune in to games between terrible teams rather than watch basketball.\n\n28. Dolphins running backs Jay Ajayi and Lamar Miller combined for 8 yards on 8 carries.\n\n29. Replay review IV: Tavon Austin 60-yard end-around and just marvel at his speed.\n\n30. Bengals TE Tyler Eifert now has 12 touchdowns. Yeah, we all saw that coming in the preseason.\n\n31. Our favorite tweet came from our very own Tom Pelissero, who was at Giants-Redskins game:\n\n32. Chiefs allowed as many points (16) in the first half against Bills as they did in any game during the four-game win streak.\n\n33. Matt Ryan: What the hell happened to him?\n\n34. Is it just us or does Jaguars QB Blake Bortles throw more passes after he crosses the line of scrimmage than he does from behind it?\n\n35. Thursday flashback III: Luke Kuechly. Just wow.\n\n36. Odell Beckham Jr. wore Charlie Brown and Snoopy cleats in warmups. And, for the most part, that just about sums up the game the Giants turned in against the Redskins.\n\n37. So has it really come to this: Kirk Cousins is one of the most consistent QBs in the league right now?\n\nRedskins emerge from fringes for confidence-fueled run\n\n38. If we’re the Panthers and we are watching these games on Sunday - and even the Packers game on Thursday night - we’re saying, ‘damn, shame on us if we can’t beat these teams to win the NFC.’\n\n39. It’s games like these why we aren’t ready to say Ryan Tannehill is ready to be a franchise QB. Simply can’t avoid the poor decision and the inevitable turnover.\n\n40. We don’t pretend to have all the answers, but one thing we’re sure of: The Rams need to give Todd Gurley more than nine carries.\n\n41. On the other hand, The Rams had a Wildcat look with Todd Gurley and Tavon Austin in the same backfield. It’s about time St. Louis got creative with the pieces it has.\n\n42. Now if the Rams could only find a quarterback. Probably wish they hadn't let Austin Davis escape to Cleveland.\n\nJeff Fisher: Critics of Rams' effort 'can kiss my ass'\n\n43. We bet the NFL was pleased to see LeSean McCoy’s “make it rain” TD celebration first used by former Patriots TE and current convicted murderer Aaron Hernandez.\n\n44. We love when coaches smell a weakness and exploit it. Giants lost CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Redskins went right after his backup Jayron Hosley - the result was the 63-yard TD catch by DeSean Jackson.\n\n45. The Titans have lost 11 straight at home. That is all.\n\n46. It’s time we give Alex Smith some credit for his role in turning Kansas City’s season around. Consider this: Last time he threw a pick was in Week 3 and now K.C. is suddenly in the AFC wild-card race.\n\n47. Adrian Peterson with his sixth 100-yard rushing game of the season. Yeah, he’s back.\n\n48. Al Davis would be proud: Raiders are 4-0 when being flagged for 10 or more penalties.\n\n49. Replay review V: Jimmy Graham’s juggling catch that gave Seahawks a first-and-goal in the third quarter and led to the TD that pulled Seattle within one of Pittsburgh at the time.\n\n50. Carson Palmer got his first rushing TD since 2012. Needs a lot of work on that spike, though.

That’s more than twice the drop of competitor Mattel’s (MAT) stock and far worse than the S&P 500’s 16% decline in the same period.\n\nThen there’s the worry that inflation could cut into consumers’ budgets. One major retailer — Target (TGT) — has already noted a slowdown in overall toy sales.\n\nThat presents a challenge for Chris Cocks, who took over as CEO in February after long-time chief executive Brian Goldner passed away in October 2021. He is optimistic that Americans will still open their wallets this season.\n\n“Consumers definitely feel inflation,” Cocks said in an interview with CNN Business earlier this month. But he also noted that the job market is healthy, wage growth is strong and many people are still sitting on pandemic stimulus payment savings from 2020 and 2021.\n\nWith that in mind, he thinks parents will do all they can to create “a great holiday experience for kids.”\n\nCocks also said that supply chain problems related to the pandemic that kept some toys stuck on container ships overseas or at ports in California have largely receded. This shouldn’t be like 2020 or last year, when some parents were unable to get hot toys under the trees or in stocking in time for late December.\n\n“I think we’re going to see a more normal kind of holiday cadence where, you know, November, December, it’s really going to ramp up and there’s going to be lots of product and lots of choice for consumers on the shelf,” he said.\n\nInvesting in digital toys\n\nCocks was previously head of Hasbro’s digital gaming division, which is home to the popular “Dungeons & Dragons” game, as well as head of the toymaker’s “Wizards of the Coast” role-playing game.\n\nBefore joining Hasbro, Cocks was an executive at Microsoft (MSFT) from 1999 through 2006 and 2008 through 2016. He left Microsoft (MSFT) briefly for a two-year stint at interactive educational toymaker LeapFrog.\n\nSo Cocks understands the importance of tech for the toy industry in this increasingly digital world, especially for kids more inclined to pick up a phone or tablet instead of an action figure, doll or board game.\n\nCocks said Hasbro is investing “significantly” in digital toys, particularly digital versions of classic Hasbro board games like “Monopoly” and “Scrabble” as well as D&D and the company’s “Magic: The Gathering” game.\n\n“We have digital experiences that help to augment that core gameplay experience, help you be able to find new players, help you be able to bring the experience to life on the screen. And that’s been a fantastic addition to our portfolio,” Cocks said, adding that mobile gaming and desktop gaming can only serve to enhance the popularity of these brands.\n\nHasbro's Monopoly board game remains a popular holiday gift as families still want to pass Go and try to buy Boardwalk. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nCocks said that the digital effort isn’t just about the types of toys either. It’s also about selling more products online via Hasbro’s own sites so the company is not relying exclusively on retail partners like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT). Cocks said Hasbro is branching out in particular with digital sales of exclusive toys to adult collectors, a rapidly growing segment of the market.\n\nAnd more is to come on the digital front, he said.\n\n“We’ve been starting over a half dozen new studios to build blockbuster video game experiences that extend those brands and help us as a company be able to grow into what I think is a sweet spot of the future of entertainment,” Cocks said.\n\nBut the company isn’t shying away from classic toys either. Hasbro has a lucrative franchise of toys for babies and toddlers thanks to its Playskool brand. It also owns Play-Doh, Mr. Potato Head, Nerf, My Little Pony, GI Joe and Transformers.\n\nBenefiting from Disney…and Peppa Pig’s popularity\n\nHasbro has close ties with Disney (DIS), selling toys tied to the lucrative Star Wars, Marvel and Disney (DIS) Princess and Frozen brands. (Hasbro is losing the Princess and Frozen lines to Mattel next year.)\n\nAnd Hasbro added more popular characters to its arsenal in 2019 with the acquisition of eOne, which brought cartoon franchises Peppa Pig and PJ Masks into the fold.\n\nHasbro has since announced plans put some of the non-core parts of eOne up for sale, including the movie and TV film studio that produced the historical action film The Woman King with Viola Davis and Showtime TV show Yellowjackets.\n\nHasbro previously sold the Death Row music label that eOne also owned to private equity firm Blackstone, which subsequently turned around and sold Death Row to rap star Snoop Dogg earlier this year.\n\nAt the end of the day, Cocks wants Hasbro to be a toy-focused company that has some entertainment assets that feature its top brands, and not stretch itself too thin.\n\nWith that in mind, Cocks is optimistic that Peppa Pig toys, new products tied to the hit “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” Marvel movie and the perennial winner that it is Play-Doh will be big sellers this holiday season.\n\nSome experts more worried about holiday sales\n\nStill, others in the industry are a little more cautious.\n\nIsaac Larian, CEO of MGA Entertainment, the privately-held owner of the Bratz and LOL Surprise toys, said in an interview with CNN Business that he understands “inflation has had an effect” on consumers and that many parents may delay toy shopping until December in order to wait for deals and promotions.\n\nLarian is still confident that toy sales will hold up this holiday season, but he conceded that toys are a discretionary item and that his company can’t aggressively raise prices because of inflation without the risk lowering sales.\n\n“Families are struggling with high gas prices. If we passed big increases in costs to consumers, we don’t think that would be workable,” he said.\n\nCocks agrees. He told CNN Business that Hasbro was doing its best to keep costs stable and offer toys at a variety of price points\n\nStill, Wall Street is worried, and that shows in Hasbro’s dismal stock performance this year.\n\nBank of America Global Research analyst Jason Haas recently cut his rating on Hasbro to “underperform,” citing concerns “that Hasbro has been overproducing Magic cards, which has propped up Hasbro’s recent results but is destroying the long-term value of the brand.”\n\nHaas estimates that Magic: The Gathering accounts for about 15% of overall sales.\n\nCocks didn’t share those concerns, and pointed out that demand for Magic and other role-playing card games continues to grow, particularly among female players.\n\nHe also noted that Hasbro has gotten a big boost in its Dungeons & Dragons role-playing business thanks to prominent exposure for the game on the most recent season of Nettflix’s (NFLX) “Stranger Things.”\n\n“We love our partnership with Netflix and Stranger Things. It’s definitely been a boon for the game,” Cocks said. “Nearly 50 years since the launch of the brand, it’s bigger than ever and it’s in more places than ever.”\n\nBut BofA’s Haas said he’s also growing “increasingly cautious” about sales for Hasbro’s other consumer products “given negative read-through from retailers.”\n\nTarget has already warned that toy sales so far haven’t been as strong as hoped.\n\n“We saw a meaningful deceleration in toys this quarter, most notably in October. This is a trend we will continue to monitor closely as we move throughout the holiday season,” said Target chief growth officer Christina Hennington on an earnings call.\n\nCocks remains confident, though, that Hasbro can avoid having a Blue Christmas.\n\n“Toys are traditionally a very economically resilient category,” he said. “If there’s a couple of truisms in life, there’s death, there’s taxes, and there’s parents wanting to have a great holiday for their kids.”", "authors": ["Paul R.

The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause Covid-19.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the new bivalent boosters and who can get them.\n\nHow are these new bivalent vaccines different?\n\nThe new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, where there’s an average of 91,000 new infections each day.\n\n“These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “In a sense, you’ve just changed the blueprints.”\n\nHaving twice the blueprints doesn’t mean you’re getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though.\n\n“The total mRNA content – the business part of the vaccine – that leads to the immune response is the same amount,” said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines.\n\nPfizer’s booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12.\n\nModerna’s bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It’s authorized for people 18 and older.\n\nThe earlier mRNA shots are still the first two shots a person will get, but they’re no longer authorized for use as boosters in people age 12 and older.\n\nWhere can I get an updated Covid-19 booster?\n\nMillions of vaccines are now shipping to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies.\n\nCVS and Walgreens have started offering the shots. Both chains are scheduling appointments online, and say more slots will be added as they get shipments of the vaccines.\n\nThe Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at Vaccines.gov.\n\n“You’ll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you’re going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN.\n\nAs with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it’s going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall.\n\nWho should get an updated booster?\n\nAmericans ages 12 and older are recommended get the new boosters as long as they’ve already had their primary series of vaccines.\n\nExperts say everyone needs one as protection from both vaccination and infection wanes considerably over time and in all age groups.\n\n“I do believe there will be benefit, essentially for everyone, with clearly more benefit for the elderly and those who have underlying conditions,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN on Friday.\n\nAdults age 18 and older can get either a Pfizer or Moderna shot. Adolescents ages 12 and older can get an updated Pfizer shot.\n\nWhen should I get an updated booster?\n\nYou should wait two months after your last vaccine dose to get an updated booster.\n\nFor those who have recently recovered from a Covid-19 infection, the CDC recommends waiting at least until the illness has passed and a person is no longer contagious. For best results, it may be better to delay a booster for at least three months after symptoms started. Infection itself probably already acted like a booster; studies have shown that people have a relatively low risk of getting sick again for about three months after they recover.\n\nYou may not want to wait as long as three months if Covid-19 levels are already high in your community or if you are reduced immune function.\n\n“Myself as an example, I was vaccinated, doubly boosted and infected, and I will be getting the updated BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine within three months of my having gotten infected, exactly the way the FDA has authorized and the CDC has recommended,” Fauci said.\n\nCan people get other vaccines at the same time as the updated booster?\n\nUS health officials have recommended that providers offer the seasonal flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccines at the same visit if a patient is eligible for the vaccinations. This upcoming fall and winter could host a high spread of flu and Covid-19, and administering both vaccinations at the same time has been found to be safe.\n\nThe government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nOne vaccine for which there are no data on administering it at the same time as others is the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, according to the CDC’s guidance. The agency recommends that people, particularly adolescent or young adult men, might consider waiting four weeks after receiving monkeypox vaccination before receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, “because of the observed risk” for myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.\n\nThe CDC adds that monkeypox vaccination “should not be delayed” due to recently receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nWhen can younger children get an updated booster?\n\nChildren ages 5 through 11 can still be boosted with the older, single-strain vaccines.\n\nVaccine manufacturers are updating boosters for younger children now. Pfizer said it’s retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It’s working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\nUntil those are ready, the best way to protect babies, toddlers and gradeschoolers is to get eligible family and friends an updated shot.\n\nCan immunocompromised people get an updated booster?\n\nYes, but that’s not all. If a health condition or a medication has lowered your immune function, the CDC recommends a two-pronged approach to boost your protection against Covid-19 – vaccination and preventive treatment with a type of passive immunity called Evusheld. Passive immunity is when antibodies are made in a lab and then given by injection or infusion to help people who can’t make enough of this protection on their own.\n\nEvusheld can be taken every six months and is available for immunocompromised people ages 12 and up. It requires a doctors prescription, but the treatment itself is free. The CDC estimates 7 million people may be eligible to take Evusheld, but most haven’t gotten it because they don’t know about it.\n\nIf you need Evusheld, you should wait at least two weeks after getting a Covid-19 vaccine to take it. But after a person has taken Evusheld, there’s no waiting period for getting an updated booster.\n\nAre the updated Covid-19 boosters safe?\n\nA recent review of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, commonly reported side effects after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches.\n\nVery rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men.\n\nThe highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men – ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about 11 cases of myocarditis for every million doses.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose.\n\n“It seems to be associated when they’re given closer to one another,” he said.\n\nHow do we know the updated Covid-19 vaccines work?\n\nThe evidence for these updated vaccines is a bit different than what was behind earlier versions. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice, following much the same process used each year when annual flu shots are updated.\n\nThe FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway. FDA’s Marks said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available.\n\nOfficials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don’t provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic.\n\n“You’re asking people to get a new product for which there’s no data,” Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. “Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.”\n\nOffit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we’ve used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nIt’s not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine.\n\n“So if you say to me, ‘can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?’ I’d say ‘no, I can’t.’ We’re extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,” Poland said.\n\nFDA officials point out that animal studies weren’t the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence.\n\nThe first is the vaccines’ track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low.\n\nThe second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe and Canada.\n\nEarlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. Other countries have authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US.\n\nThe BA.1 strain isn’t circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he’s confident that these vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n“It’s fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. … It’s just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there’s a free treatment that would prevent their death,” he said.\n\n“I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,” said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. “I’m very confident about this.”\n\nIn the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It’s hard to know how effective these bivalent vaccines could be.\n\nIn a recent preprint study, published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work.\n\nThey found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person’s protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%.\n\nVariant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn’t dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase.\n\nWhy were the shots updated?\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update.\n\nAs the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it has gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections.\n\nThe hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death.\n\nThere is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus – and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza.\n\nAmong the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months.\n\nSo there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we’ll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2016/10/11/nhls-50-most-important-people-2016-2017/91822036/", "title": "The NHL's 50 most important people", "text": "Kevin Allen\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\n1. Gary Bettman, NHL commissioner: The NHL has been around for 99 years, and Bettman has been commissioner for 24 of them. He’s the dean of commissioners in the four major pro sports. While fans boo him because he is associated with lockouts and a lost season, he has the full support of owners after shepherding in financial stability and growth, competitive balance, a salary cap, a network television package, innovations such as the Winter Classic, the environmental friendly “NHL Green” initiative and centralized video review.\n\n2. Sidney Crosby, Pittsburgh Penguins captain: Crosby is the face of the NHL, and he’s still the world’s best player. He recently joined Wayne Gretzky and Bobby Orr as the only players to be named MVP in the NHL regular season and postseason, plus the World Cup/Canada Cup.\n\n3. Donald Fehr, NHLPA executive director: Fehr, the former long-team executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, is remembered in the baseball world for his battles with owners and leading one of the nation’s strongest unions, but he’s proven to be a noteworthy peacetime general in the hockey world. He was able to reach a World Cup deal with the NHL that was profitable for the league and the players. And he negotiated a “bye week” for players to be introduced this season in exchange for players’ cooperation in altering the NHL All-Star format.\n\n4. Bill Daly, NHL deputy commissioner: Daly, 52, has a hand in every major issue in the league. He’s the NHL’s chief legal officer and has been the point man in labor negotiations. Bettman has complete trust in him. The presumption is that when Bettman retires — and that isn’t going to happen any time soon — Daly will make a seamless transition to the commissioner’s chair.\n\n5. Alex Ovechkin, Washington Capitals captain: If Crosby is the face of the NHL, Ovechkin is the face of hockey in Eastern Europe. One of the greatest Russian players in history, he plays with passion and enthusiasm, as well as an incredible scoring touch that has led to 525 goals in 839 regular season games. He has said he plans to go the Olympics in 2018 even if the NHL doesn’t send players, which would create quite a stir.\n\nFollow every game: Live NHL Scores\n\nNHL 2016-17 season predictions\n\n6. Connor McDavid, Edmonton Oilers captain: McDavid, 19, may be the most widely talked about teenage superstar in NHL history, as well as its youngest captain. He’s probably the highest-profile Canadian star playing for a Canadian team since Wayne Gretzky with the Oilers.\n\n7. Stephane Quintal, NHL senior vice president of player safety:The former NHL defenseman became the new sheriff in town after Brendan Shanahan left for Toronto in 2014. Handing out suspensions and fines is a thankless endeavor, and the scrutiny has never been more intense as the game gets faster, players bigger and concerns grow about concussions. Quintal is on the front lines of making the game safe.\n\n9. Jeremy Jacobs, Boston Bruins owner: Jacobs, 76, is chairman of the NHL’s Board of Governors, giving him considerable influence on league decisions. He is viewed as a hardliner when it comes negotiations with the NHLPA. He has owned the Bruins since 1975.\n\n9. Bill Foley, Las Vegas NHL expansion team owner: The personable Foley, a West Point graduate, is drawing plenty of attention throughout pro sports as everybody looks to see how the first major league team in Las Vegas fares when it debuts next season.\n\n10. Mike Babcock, Toronto Maple Leafs coach: Babcock commanded a $50 million contract in 2015 because the Maple Leafs believe he is the best coach in the game. The deal also dramatically altered the salary structure for coaches.\n\n11. Colin Campbell, NHL senior vice President and director of hockey operations: He’s the gatekeeper for all rule changes and oversees centralized instant replay review in Toronto. A former player and coach, Campbell, 63, is old school in his approach but has proven to be open to change, embracing video review, shootouts and 3-on-3 overtime.\n\n12. Wayne Gretzky, NHL’s all-time leading scorer: “The Great One” is front and center again as the NHL ambassador for its 100th anniversary season celebration. His return in an official capacity was overdue. Throughout his career, Gretzky has always served the game on and off ice.\n\n13. Steve Yzerman, Tampa Bay Lightning general manager: Although Yzerman has not won a Stanley Cup as a GM with the Lightning, he has built one of the league’s model organizations. He manages the way he played — with a calculating, determined, intelligent approach. Everyone in the sport pays attention to what Yzerman does.\n\nNHL point projections: How we see 2016-17 season unfolding\n\n14. Rocky Wirtz, Chicago Blackhawks owner: After succeeding his late father Bill as the Blackhawks chairman, Rocky transformed a floundering team into a model franchise. The Wirtz family purchased the Blackhawks in 1954, but they are probably more important to the league today than they have been at any point in their ownership.\n\n15. Sam Flood, NBC executive producer: Give NBC Sports chairman Mark Lazarus credit for having the vision to partner with the NHL, but Flood now has more impact because he controls how the game is presented. The result is the league is getting more national TV exposure than ever before. And the contract between the NHL and NBC, which is worth about $200 million a year, runs through the 2020-21 season.\n\n16. John Chayka, Arizona Coyotes general manager: When he was promoted in May at age 26, he became the youngest GM in the history of the four major sports. Chayka is a leader among the game’s new thinkers who emphasize analytics. You can be sure other owners are watching how he does.\n\n17. Mike Emrick, NBC broadcaster: His call of NHL games is poetic and informational, the perfect blend of entertainment and storytelling. He’s the perfect national broadcaster for a sport that is still doing missionary work to convert fans. He’s 70 now, and NBC and the NHL officials are just happy he’s not talking about retirement.\n\n\n\n18. Joel Quenneville, Chicago Blackhawks coach: As three Stanley Cup rings would attest, Quenneville has mastered the art of being a demanding coach without alienating his players. He’s picky about who he plays on defense, but he is neither an offensive nor defensive coach. He’s a winning coach.\n\n19. Bob Bowman, Major League Baseball Advanced Media CEO: Bowman has overseen MLBAM’s rise to become the gold standard for pro sports digital offerings. A year ago it partnered with the NHL, and has already improved the product and the league’s reach.\n\n20. Ken Holland, Detroit Red Wings general manager: In addition to commanding professional sports’ longest active playoff streak of 25 years, Holland is one of the league’s most respected voices when it comes to rule changes. He initiated and lobbied aggressively for the change to 3-on-3 overtime.\n\n21. Jim Rutherford, Pittsburgh Penguins general manager: At 67, Rutherford has never been more appreciated. Ownership gave him a three-year contract this summer as a reward for the redesign that transformed the Penguins into champions. General managers always say it’s hard to make trades, but he proved last season that there is still room for a wheeler-dealer in the modern NHL.\n\n22. Rene Fasel, International Ice Hockey Federation president: Fasel and Bettman don’t always see eye to eye on the NHL’s role in international hockey. But Fasel is an important ally for the NHL, especially when it comes to participation in the Olympics. Fasel wants to see NHL players in the Games, and he’s among those trying to cut a deal with the International Olympic Committee for the 2018 Olympics in South Korea. The NHL’s participation is in doubt because of the IOC’s unwillingness to fully participate in the funding of that venture.\n\nOne reason your NHL team will win it all this season (Western Conference)\n\n23. Stan Bowman, Chicago Blackhawks general manager: Bowman came into the league with an impressive pedigree as the son of Scotty, the winningest coach in NHL history. But now Bowman owns an impressive resume with three Stanley Cup championships, and a knack for knowing how to stay on top in a salary cap era. General managers have learned from watching him retool his roster twice to get back on top.\n\n24. Dan Marr, NHL director of central scouting: He’s the boss of the 29-scout department that evaluates and rates every draft-eligible player. In recent years, the NHL has put a greater emphasis on promoting the younger stars entering the league. The personable Marr has been an added help in that regard.\n\n25. Patrick Kane, Chicago Blackhawks right wing: As the reigning MVP and scoring champion, Kane, 27, is the best American in the game today.\n\n26. Jonathan Toews, Chicago Blackhawks captain: He is the yardstick by which all other NHL captains are judged. In addition to being one of the league’s top all-around centers, Toews is a flawless leader. You can market a team around Toews, and the Blackhawks have done that.\n\n27. Stephen Walkom, NHL director of officials: It is NHL tradition to complain about officiating, but the truth is that players, coaches and general managers believe the officiating staff does a credible job. Walkom was a respected referee, and now he’s still respected for the job he does of trying to maintain a level of consistency in how the game is called on the ice.\n\n28. Brendan Shanahan, Toronto Maple Leafs president: When Shanahan was a player, it was often said that he was destined to end up in either television or team management. He had the personality for the former and the competitive nature for the latter. Now he’s trying to bring the first Stanley Cup since 1967 to one of the league’s iconic franchises.\n\n10 NHL season story lines: Sharks stay dangerous; P.K. Subban a Nashville star?\n\n29. Murray Edwards, Calgary Flames owner:Forbes Magazine has listed Edwards in the past as among the top-15 richest Canadians. He is the Canadian team owner with the most influence on the Board of Governors. He’s a member of the executive committee. And Bettman likes to have Murray’s support on his decisions.\n\n30. Ted Leonsis, Washington Capitals owner: He’s among the NHL’s most-well known owners because he interacts with fans through social media and his blog writing. He’s a member of the Board of Governors’ executive committee.\n\n31. Pat Brisson, player agent: His expansive client list is led by Crosby and Kane. He’s a charismatic personality whose name has surfaced several times in connection with open general manager jobs. It would take “can’t-refuse” offer and opportunity to convince him to leave his current job. Brisson works for Creative Artists Agency, which also boasts J.P. Barry, another top agent.\n\n32. Dan Craig, NHL ice guru: He’s the man in charge of ice-making. His ability to magically transform a baseball diamond, or a football field, plus 20,000 gallons of water, into an outdoor rink is one reason the Winter Classic has been overwhelming success. Craig, 60, has been maintaining ice rinks since he was a 15-year-old working for a junior team in Jasper, Alberta.\n\nNHL reality check: One reason your team will fail this season (Western Conference)\n\n33. Don Meehan, player agent: He founded Newport Sports Management in 1981, and he is arguably the most well-known agent in the game. In his 35 years, he’s had a reputation for being tough but fair. Steven Stamkos and Drew Doughty are among his clients. His partner, Pat Morris, is another heavyweight agent.\n\n34. Jaromir Jagr, Florida Panthers forward:Jagr will turn 45 this season, and he’s the symbol of everything fun about hockey. The Czech star is known to train at all hours of the night. Loves to be at the rink. Loves to practice. Loves to play. Still an effective player. Might play beyond 50.\n\n35. Dave Ogrean, executive director of USA Hockey: He’s been at forefront of the growth of American hockey for the past three decades. He’s a glib, colorful speaker who has a strong relationship with the NHL. Under Ogrean’s command, USA Hockey and the NHL have worked on projects that have been mutually beneficial such as the All-American Prospects Game, which showcases the top American-born talent for the NHL draft.\n\n36. Mario Lemieux, former Pittsburgh Penguins star: When Lemieux was a player, he led the way as a dazzling offensive force. No one was better on a breakaway. Today, he leads the way as the managing partner of the Penguins ownership group. The Penguins are a model franchise when it comes to attendance, TV ratings and marketing. They are a league heavyweight in social media presence.\n\n37. Tom Renney, president and CEO of Hockey Canada: Canada remains the No. 1 feeder system for NHL talent. The importance of Canada’s development program is never overlooked by the NHL. Renney is a former New York Rangers coach with considerable ties to NHL teams.\n\nNHL reality check: One reason your team will fail this season (Eastern Conference)\n\n38. Dean Lombardi, Los Angeles Kings general manager: Anyone who knows Lombardi has a story or two about Lombardi being in his office at all hours of the night watching video. He leaves no stone unturned. He's also helped turn the major-market Kings into two-time Stanley Cup champs.\n\n39. Brian Burke, Calgary Flames president: Bombastic Burke might be the most quotable man in hockey. As a former league executive and general manager, he’s well versed in all league issues. He’s a traditionalist when it comes to how the game is coached and played, but he’s progressive on some issues, such as the You Can Play Project, which was founded to ensure safety and inclusion for all who participate in sports, including LGBT athletes, coaches and fans.\n\n40. David Poile, Nashville Predators general manager: Poile, 66, was working in the NHL when Gordie Howe was still playing. He started with the Atlanta Flames in 1972. This is his 35th season as an NHL GM, tying him with both Jack Adams and Glen Sather for most seasons in NHL history. Poile was previously general manager in Washington.\n\n41. Steve Hatze Petros, NHL senior vice president for scheduling: For roughly three decades, Hatze Petros has had to juggle general manager’s desires, television’s demands and entertainers’ schedules to produce an NHL schedule for the regular season and the playoffs.\n\n42. Kay Whitmore, NHL goaltending supervisor: The former NHL goaltender has been in charge of creating rules that will downsize goalie equipment without compromising safety. The NHL would like to stem the tide of goalies using oversized equipment to gain a competitive advantage. He has worked with New Jersey Devils goalie Cory Schneider, who represents the NHLPA’s interests in the competition committee.\n\n43. David Andrews, American Hockey League CEO: Andrews, 68, has been CEO since 1994 and the league’s relationship with the NHL has never been stronger. Not only do AHL teams develop NHL talent, but the AHL also has been willing to test rules for the NHL, like it did recently with 3-on-3 overtime.\n\nDream big: One reason your NHL team will win it all this season (Eastern Conference)\n\n44. Allan Walsh, player agent: In addition to being an agent with a large stable of players, Walsh is vocal on social media. He is a former Los Angeles prosecutor who isn’t shy about expressing his opinions. He’s been outspoken on his belief that the NHL community needs to be more proactive in protecting players from concussions. Walsh works for Octagon Hockey, where former NHL player and agent Mike Liut is the managing director.\n\n45. Dale Hunter, London Knights owner: A 20-year NHL veteran, Hunter has developed one of the model franchises in junior hockey. He gave up coaching the Washington Capitals in 2012 to devote more attention to the junior team he owns. The London Knights have had eight NHL first rounders over the past five years.\n\n46. Bobby Orr, eight-time Norris Trophy winner and agent: He is, without question, the greatest defenseman who ever lived and today his player agency business is among top five in the NHL.\n\n47. Bob McKenzie, TSN (Canada) reporter: More than 1.4 million people follow him on Twitter because he is so wired into the behind-the-scenes maneuvering. The running joke used to be that NHL GMs were required to notify the league and McKenzie when they made a trade.\n\n48: David Le, EA Sports senior marketing director: The decision to let fans decide who should be on the cover of the NHL video game was clearly an ingenious marketing decision. The amount of attention that campaign receives on social media and elsewhere is impressive.\n\n49. David Quinn, Boston University coach: He could become the next college coach to jump into a head coaching job in the NHL.When the Flyers hired Dave Hakstol as their coach out of North Dakota in 2015, he was the first to go from college coach to NHL coach in 28 years. Quinn is 50, and he’s already been an assistant with the Colorado Avalanche and a head coach in the AHL.\n\n50. Sean McKenna, Sher-Wood Hockey, Inc. vice president: The NHL has been buying its pucks from this company for more than 20 years. It must be doing a good job; when is the last time you heard anyone complain about the quality of an NHL puck?\n\nNext five: Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price, Minnesota Wild owner Craig Leipold, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Lou Lamoriello, Anaheim Ducks owner Henry Samueli and Washington Capitals coach Barry Trotz.\n\nContributing: Mike Brehm, USA TODAY Sports; Sarah McLellan, Dave Isaac, Andrew Gross, USA TODAY Network.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2022/01/19/tour-notebook-david-duval-expects-success-pga-tour-champions/6514564001/", "title": "Tour notebook: David Duval expects success on PGA Tour Champions", "text": "David Duval has never minced words and on the eve of starting a new chapter in his professional life, he's not about to change.\n\n“I expect to succeed,” he said of his first foray into the PGA Tour Champions at this week’s Mitsubishi Electric Championship, at the Hualalai Golf Club in Ka'upulehu-Kona, Hawaii.\n\nThe Jacksonville native and Episcopal graduate who won 13 times on the PGA Tour and for most of the 1999 season, supplanted Tiger Woods at No. 1 in the world, turned 50 years old last Nov. 9.\n\nMore:Welcome home: David Duval returns to his golf roots to play in Furyk & Friends charity event\n\nMore:Players Championship continues to promote golf in the Urban core with grant for putting green at Clanzel Brown Community Center\n\nWhile he hasn’t made a cut on the PGA Tour since the 2015 Open Championship at St. Andrews, Duval pointed out that he certainly has enough tread left on the tires.\n\n“I haven’t played 50 golf tournaments in the last decade and so I’m patient and giving myself time to get my feet under myself again,” he said in a video posted on the PGA Tour Champions Twitter site. “My wife Susie and I are so excited about the opportunity and so looking forward to it.”\n\nDuval won all of his Tour events between 1997 and 2001, including the 1999 Players, the 1997 Tour Championship and the 2001 Open. He won four times in 1998 and captured the Tour’s scoring and money titles.\n\nHe became the first player to shoot 59 in the final round of a tournament to win, at the 1999 American Express.\n\nDuval was the runner-up in the Masters twice and had 11 top-10s in majors. But he went into a prolonged slump beginning in 2002, brought on by a series of injuries from neck to knee.\n\nDuval’s main problem used to be his strength: the best combination of long and accurate off the tee. There were a few times when it appeared he might have regained his old touch, such as a tie for second in the 2009 U.S. Open and a tie for second at Pebble Beach in 2010.\n\nBut since his last made cut, Duval hasn’t played on the weekend in 22 starts in six years, counting two appearances in a Korn Ferry Tour event near his Denver home.\n\nDuval has always seemed at peace. He took on three stepchildren when he married his wife, and they had two more children. He also combined family with his last big moment on the golf course, winning the 2016 PNC Father-Son with his stepson Nick Karavites.\n\nDuval has been an analyst for Golf Channel, drawing good reviews for his insight and preparedness.\n\nBut he’s also been working on his game, but not putting any pressure on himself.\n\n“I’ve been practicing and playing and working at it,” he said in the PGA Tour Champions interview. “Getting over some little injury problems I’ve had over the past couple of years. That’s all behind me now. But I’m sure there were will be some nerves and anxiety and rust.”\n\nLongtime Tour board member\n\nFerris dies\n\nDick Ferris, who served as the PGA Tour’s first Policy Board independent director and later as the board’s chairman, died on Jan. 16 of ALS at the age of 85 at his home in Orlando.\n\n“What I’ve heard from [former Tour commissioner] Tim [Finchem] and many others about Dick Ferris during his time as chairman was how tenacious he was,” current Tour commissioner Jay Monahan told pgatour.com. “When he believed in something, he put his full energy and thoughtfulness behind it, and the Tour was certainly the beneficiary of that tenacity. Looking back, the growth and acceleration of our business, thanks to his leadership, is simply staggering. Dick was a great friend and mentor to so many, and we will all miss his passion for how he attacked life.”\n\nFerris worked his entire life in the hospitality and travel industry, first at Western International Hotels (now Westin) and then as an executive at United Airlines when it purchased Westin.\n\nFerris became United’s CEO in 1976, became chairman of its board in 1985 and remaining there until 1987. He became a member of the PGA Tour Champions’ Policy Board in 1985 and joined the PGA Tour Policy Board seven years later, and served until 2007.\n\nFerris was part of an ownership group that included World Golf Hall of Fame member Arnold Palmer, former Major League Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth and actor and director Clint Eastwood that purchased Pebble Beach from Japan’s Taiheiyo Company.\n\nFerris and Uebberoth will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award from the World Golf Hall of Fame on March 9.\n\nFerris spent much of his adult life living in Chicago, but upon retirement he moved to Orlando. He is survived by his wife, Kelsey, and three children.

The Jack Morris-John Smoltz 10-inning duel in 1991? Craig Counsell’s walk-off 1997 single for the wild card Marlins? The end of the Yankee dynasty on Luis Gonzalez’s bloop single off Mariano Rivera in 2001? All on Sunday evening.\n\nYet this is a different era, where all sports and entertainment franchises must fight significant headwinds due to streaming services and a proliferation of diversions. And no entity casts a larger shadow than the NFL, which in a less audacious time used to cede Sunday night to the Fall Classic.\n\n“You have to assess the realities of the situation and choose your battles,” says Dennis Deninger, a sports and media communications professor at Syracuse and a production executive at ESPN for more than 25 years. “And if you have a chance of winning people over on Tuesday and Wednesday nights instead of Sunday? You don’t want every game to finish second or third to what the NFL has going on.\n\n“It’s like playing baseball on the town green – and now the town green is crowded with media platforms. It’s a forest and you have to move out of town. It’s the reality of the situation.”\n\nTo be certain, this is an unusual year for baseball. The 99-day lockout forced a compressed regular season schedule, and expanded playoffs and a late-ending season meant squeezing the postseason in with fewer off days.\n\nA person familiar with MLB’s plans told USA TODAY Sports the league is not certain it will keep the Friday World Series opener in coming seasons. However, the 2023 schedule will once again conclude on a Sunday, and the three-game wild card series that follows would again align the World Series to begin on Friday, Oct. 27.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity to freely discuss logistics still in the planning phase, said the league remains agreeable to a Friday opener and maintaining a Saturday window for fans.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that the Sunday evening window was wide open for the World Series. But the delicate, zero-sum entertainment ecosystem has changed dramatically since then – particularly the programming habits of the ultimate sporting behemoth.\n\nA prime-time beast\n\nComparing TV ratings across eras is often futile, as the landscape can be as different as having three over-the-air channels and an antenna, 150 cable channels and premium options, or today’s virtual forest that includes all of the above plus nine major streaming services, from ESPN+'s 23 million subscribers to Netflix’s more than 220 million global devotees. (Also, video games).\n\nYet there’s one high-water mark that is undisputed: World Series viewership peaked in 1978, when the New York Yankees, led by “Mr. October,” Reggie Jackson, defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. It drew a record 32.8 rating, which was duplicated two years later by Phillies-Royals, but the 44.2 million average number of viewers per game remains unmatched.\n\nThe downward slope was steady from there, as ratings points dropped roughly five points in five-year increments leading into 1994, when a work stoppage compelled MLB to cancel the World Series. The average series rating slipped into single digits for the first time in 2008 (8.1 for Phillies over Rays in five games) before a Yankees-Phillies six-game combo pushed it back to 11.7 in 2009.\n\nA year later, though, the Sunday stage suddenly got very crowded.\n\nIn 1990, when TNT and ESPN began broadcasting Sunday night football games over the full 17-week schedule, they went dark the Sunday of the World Series broadcast, often moving that week’s game to Thursday. ESPN continued the practice through 2005, spanning an era when baseball had more audience muscle and the NFL wasn’t yet an everyday entertainment force.\n\nBut the rules of engagement quickly changed. The NFL Network was born in 2003 and by 2006 was broadcasting eight regular season games in prime time on Thursdays. That same year, Sunday Night Football on NBC came along, and soon was not only supplanting Monday Night Football as the de facto “game of the week” but also asserting itself as the No. 1 show on television, period.\n\nFor four seasons, NBC adhered to ESPN’s World Series blackout, and Phillies-Yankees Game 4 in 2009 drew a very respectable 13.5 rating on Fox, highest since 2004 and boosting the overall series rating to 11.7.\n\nThat ended a year later, when Saints-Steelers on a Halloween Sunday night butted heads with Rangers-Giants Game 4. And an NFL game beat the World Series for the first time.\n\nWhile the less appealing matchup didn’t help, the Sunday World Series game experienced a 33% ratings drop, and the overall Series rating fell 28%, to 8.4. The World Series has not cracked double digits again without the aid of a seven-game series, and even in 2014 (Giants-Royals, 8.2) and 2019 (Nationals-Astros, 8.1) going the distance did little to goose the numbers.\n\nAs for SNF on NBC? It is going on its unprecedented 12th consecutive season as the No. 1 primetime show on television, more than doubling the viewership of the highest-rated scripted shows in 2021.\n\n‘It’s just a different day’\n\nOf course, major network ratings aren’t the only measure of success these days. MLB remains a power thanks to its tonnage, and more than half of its franchises experienced ratings growth on its regional sports networks, according to the league.\n\nAnd MLB.TV, despite blackout restrictions that agitate a significant portion of its audience, once again set a record for minutes streamed, surpassing 11 billion for the first time.\n\nAll are measures of relative health for a sport in which its average fan is nearing 60 years old, and boisterous crowds in San Diego, Seattle and Philadelphia this month show that on-field success can activate a city across all demographics.\n\nThe World Series, though, creates a conundrum that grows more acute with time: How to nationalize a sport that increasingly seems limited to regional appeal?\n\n“Our production team does a phenomenal job of getting to know the players so when they are on the national stage, [fans] learn to care about them, whether it’s Bryce Harper or any of the other players,” says Fox’s Wanger. “You’re interviewing them moments after they’ve hit the potential game-tying or game-winning home run. I think we interviewed Bryce Harper two minutes after his go-ahead home run, after he just mouthed, ‘I can’t believe I just did that.’\n\n“The ratings have been very steady over the last several years. If you look at it in the context of top-performing shows, the World Series is right up there. It’s just a different day than it was in 1985 or 1980, when there just weren’t that many options out there for people to watch.”\n\nTheoretically, this Series should have significant appeal. For the first time in his 11-year career, and more than 13 years after he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated as a 16-year-old, the Phillies’ Harper will grace the Fall Classic.\n\nHe’s a name casual viewers should know: Brash and extremely talented, Harper essentially called his shot as a teenager and backed it up, reaching the big leagues and the playoffs at 19, winning the NL MVP award at 23 and producing numerous buzzworthy news clips, be it his clown question quip or a dugout standoff with former teammate Jonathan Papelbon.\n\nYet Harper’s career arc – from 2012 to now – almost exactly mirrors the period of time in which cord-cutting became prevalent, further stratifying entertainment options and diminishing the impact of stars hailing from traditional mediums.\n\nFrom 2014 through 2022, the number of broadband-only households skyrocketed, from 2.5% to 33.2%. In that same stretch, social media use ballooned, with Instagram’s 9% growth in 2014 asserting it as the currency for celebrities. The app has been a particular hit with NBA fans, LeBron James (135 million Instagram followers and 52 million more on Twitter) and Kevin Durant (13.1 million, 20.5 million) eager to feed the league’s drama machine.\n\nHarper is active on the apps and shares team and family moments, yet boasts just 1.7 million Instagram followers, just half of the talented but less accomplished NBA star Donovan Mitchell.\n\nAnd in a previous era, when his accomplishments might be blasted on a national TV broadcast or shouted out on a well-watched SportsCenter, the audience his predecessors enjoyed simply does not exist.\n\n“They’re fine fellows and are great at what they do,” says Syracuse’s Deninger of Harper, Mike Trout and Co., “but they’re not national celebrities. When people talk about the halcyon days when the World Series was getting 50 million viewers and a huge rating, you’re talking the Yankees playing the Dodgers and Reggie Jackson.\n\n“You can probably say ‘Reggie Jackson’ in 50 states and people know what you’re talking about. You go to a state and say, ‘Bryce Harper,’ and you might get a blank stare.”\n\nMLB hopes those stares become less common come next week, with Harper and his red-hot Phillies club taking on what amounts to today’s modern dynasty – the four-time AL champion Astros. And don’t weep for Harper – massive local TV contracts and Fox’s $5.1 billion pact to broadcast the All-Star Game, World Series and other playoff games easily funds his $330 million contract, whether he’s recognized beyond his local Wawa or not.\n\nFox’s Wanger says the TV industry still considers live sports “the last great campfire,” and says the Friday-Saturday World Series start is augmented by Nielsen’s recently developed out-of-home metric, which has significantly buttressed weekend ratings on nights once seen as undesirable. There’s still billions of dollars to be had with what the NFL leaves on the table.\n\nIt just takes a little more flexibility – and leaving behind a traditional night of baseball – to grab it.\n\n“NFL executives were once worried people wouldn’t follow the league in the offseason,” says Deninger. “That’s inconceivable now.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}]}

Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/955210/next-tory-leader-odds-the-favourites-to-replace-liz-truss/sajid-javid-the-rags-to-riches-to-politics-tory-leader-contender", "title": "Who is Sajid Javid? The 'rags to riches to politics' Tory leader ...", "text": "Javid has been described by Politico’s Jack Blanchard as having “fought his way up from the toughest streets in England to earn £3-million-a-year at Deutsche Bank”. After graduating, he moved to America and by 25-years-old, he had become vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank.\n\nJavid was the first person in his family to go to university. He studied economics and politics at Exeter University, and met his future wife, Laura, at 18-years-old, while the pair were both working summer jobs at Commercial Union. They now have four children together.\n\nJavid attended a comprehensive school in Bristol, and told the Evening Standard in 2012 that “some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations”. Undeterred, Javid rejected the suggestion that he become a “TV repair man” and instead pursued his goal to work in the City, said the BBC . His interest in financial markets was “sparked by the Thatcher government’s privatisations”, and he reportedly became a “regular reader” of the Financial Times as a teenager.\n\nThe future politician and his four brothers were raised in a two-bed flat on Bristol's Stapleton Road, which Javid would later describe as Britain’s “most dangerous road”. It was there that his mother, Zubaida, ran a market stall selling handmade clothes before opening up her own shop.\n\nJavid has spoken about how his father Abdul came to the UK from Pakistan at 17-years-old with a “£1 note in his pocket”. Abdul gained employment in Rochdale, where Javid was born, as a cotton mill worker and then a bus conductor, before the family moved to Bristol.\n\nJavid’s story is one of “rags to riches to political power”, said lecturer in political science Parveen Akhtar at The Conversation .\n\nThe former health secretary Sajid Javid was the first of Johnson's top cabinet ministers to resign this week, handing his letter to Johnson on Tuesday evening. In doing so, he may have earned himself \"early start\" in the leadership race, said the i news site.\n\nBefore Boris Johnson made his resignation speech today, speculation over who might take his place as leader of the Conservative Party was already rife.\n\nHe later moved to Singapore while working with Deutsche Bank, where he became managing director before he left finance for politics in 2010 – “a move which reportedly saw him take a 98% pay cut”, said Akhtar.\n\nJavid’s parliamentary career\n\nThe politician was a supporter of the Conservative Party from the early 1980s. “Despite being diehard fans of Margaret Thatcher”, he and fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon “got in a bit of trouble” at the 1990 party conference when they distributed leaflets opposing the then prime minister’s decision to join Exchange Rate Mechanism, said the BBC.\n\nTwenty years later, he was first elected to parliament. He became MP for Bromsgrove in 2010, and began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury. He became culture secretary in 2014, and was the first person of colour to hold “one of the ‘Great Offices of State’”, said Politics.co.uk.\n\n“It was a surprise to many” that Javid called for the UK to remain in the European Union in 2016. He was “on the losing side” of the referendum, and “there was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron” on a “joint ticket” with Stephen Crabb, said the BBC.\n\nTwo years later, Javid “put his head above the parapet during the Windrush scandal to say ‘it could have been me’”, reported the Evening Standard at the time. He succeeded Amber Rudd as home secretary following the scandal, appointed by then prime minister Theresa May, before running for the Tory party leadership in 2019. Javid came in fourth behind runners-up Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove, and was promoted to chancellor by the contest’s victor, Boris Johnson.\n\n“His appointment is set to herald a significant fiscal loosening”, said the Financial Times at the time. He is “the ideal chancellor for creating the magic money trees we were told we were told didn’t exist”, said James Moore in The Independent. But he would hold the position for just six months. Javid resigned in February 2020 following tensions between himself and Johnson’s then-adviser Dominic Cummings. He returned to the backbenches, and took up a role at financial giant JPMorgan.\n\nJavid was appointed health secretary in June last year following the resignaton of Matt Hancock over a breach of Covid restrictions, giving up his financial pursuits in doing so. He resigned from the cabinet on Tuesday evening, and delivered a personal statement at Prime Minister’s Questions the following day in which he made apparent that he believed other ministers should follow his example.\n\nLeadership chances\n\nJavid and Rishi Sunak are among “the favourites” in the “leadership jostling”, said The Guardian. Javid “bolstered his credentials as a candidate” on Tuesday by resigning minutes before the chancellor, who could be his fiercest competition.\n\nThe MP for Bromsgrove “made an early start” in the contest when he “set out his stall to Conservative MPs” in his resignation speech in the House of Commons the following day, said the i news site. He described himself as a “team player” and said he would “never risk losing my integrity” during his parliamentary career.\n\nThe Guardian reported that MPs believe Javid is “the most organised in terms of having a team and an offering”. And though he falls slightly behind Sunak in public popularity, according to YouGov data, his constituents believe he could “do the right thing for the country”, as one Bromsgrove local told the BBC yesterday.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2019/07/25"}]}

Prices have shot up across Europe since last fall, driven by a spike in demand as countries lifted pandemic lockdowns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, and the subsequent drop in Moscow’s oil and natural gas exports to Europe, have pushed prices even higher.\n\nBut UK energy prices are now higher than in comparable economies like France and Italy, analysts told CNN Business. And Brits have suffered much bigger price increases than in most European countries, including Germany, where decades of energy policy has been turned on its head by the Ukraine war.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said this week that UK natural gas prices rose nearly 96% in the year to July, while electricity prices are up 54%.\n\nAnnual consumer price inflation for gas and electricity in the United Kingdom is forecast to soar to an average of around 80% this year, compared to an average of 40% across the 19 countries that use the euro, analysis from Deutsche Bank shows.\n\nThe worst is yet to come. Average annual energy bills could exceed £4,000 ($4,820) from January, and £5,000 ($6,000) later in the spring, up from about £2,000 ($2,400) currently. Millions could be forced into poverty as a consequence. Leaders of the UK National Health Service warned Friday of a “humanitarian crisis.” Many people could fall sick this winter as they “face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions,” they said.\n\nOverall UK inflation exceeded 10% in July, compared with 8.9% in the eurozone. Unlike other problems in the UK economy, Brexit doesn’t appear to be a major factor. So why are British energy bills rising so much faster than across much of Europe?\n\nA broken market\n\nAs wholesale costs ballooned last year, 31 smaller UK energy companies — who traditionally offered competitive prices — went bust, forcing millions of customers onto the books of bigger suppliers, and to pay higher bills.\n\nThe way the British government designed the energy market made this more likely, Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group, told CNN Business. Smaller companies were acting like brokers rather than providers of an essential utility.\n\n“Many UK retail energy providers weren’t real energy producers. Instead, they bought electricity and gas in the wholesale market and then sold it on to retail customers like households,” Gloystein said.\n\nThat meant that as soon as wholesale costs increased far above what suppliers could legally charge, they went bankrupt.\n\nEurope operates in a different way. Most countries have tighter regulations on suppliers, Gloystein said, including rules designed to shield them from sudden price spikes.\n\nThe prices UK households pay are subject to a cap, but it is adjusted every six months — a period about to be cut to three — meaning bills rise more quickly in line with wholesale costs.\n\n“There’s a transitional arrangement between now and when we move to that full quarterly model that’s pushing up prices a little bit more,” Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, told CNN Business. “Suppliers are able to pass on the increases in wholesale gas prices a lot more quickly than they were in the past,” he added.\n\nLack of storage\n\nThe United Kingdom has faced a “perfect storm” of events which have bumped up energy bills, according to Raja.\n\nMost homes are supplied with natural gas, he said, whereas electricity, nuclear energy and renewable sources make up a bigger share of the energy mix across the European Union.\n\nThe country also relies on gas to generate 40% of its electricity, compared to less than one fifth for the bloc as a whole, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\n“It’s a double whammy effect and the UK’s overdependence on gas is a big reason why gas prices I think in the UK are a little bit more elevated than elsewhere,” he said.\n\nHigh voltage power lines and cooling towers at the Dampierre-en-Burly nuclear power plant, operated by Electricite de France SA (EDF), in Dampierre-en-Burly, France, on Tuesday, May 3, 2022. EDF's falling nuclear production, combined with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is exacerbating Europe's energy crisis as France is traditionally a net exporter of electricity. Anita Pouchard Serra/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhile the United Kingdom produces about half of its gas, North Sea output last year fell to its lowest level on record due to maintenance work, according to the government’s business department.\n\nA lack of storage has exacerbated the situation. Centrica (CPYYF), a UK energy company, closed the largest gas storage facility in the country in 2017, though it is in discussions with the government to reopen the site this winter. Europe has more storage capacity, and has been rapidly filling it ahead of winter — and a feared total cut off of Russian gas.\n\nUK natural gas contracts for next year’s first quarter are nearly 7% more expensive than European benchmark contract prices, according to analysis by Auxilione. That’s because Europe has now built a buffer for the winter months.\n\nThe lack of storage forces the the United Kingdom to rely on “real-time flows” of gas from the North Sea, Norway, Belgium, as well as liquefied natural gas imports, Tony Jordan, director at Auxilione, told CNN Business.\n\n“We’re much more reliant on the here and now when it gets to winter,” he said.\n\nEurope’s gas is still eye-wateringly expensive. It was trading at €242 ($244) per megawatt hour on Friday, an all-time high, according to Auxilione. That’s much higher than the spot price for UK gas, which is trading at an equivalent of €160 ($161) per megawatt hour, but the differential is driven mostly by greater demand in Europe as it fills up its tanks for winter.\n\nGermany declared a gas crisis in June after Russia cut flows through the vital Nord Stream 1 pipeline by two-thirds, bringing the country one step closer to rationing gas to industry.\n\nMinimal government support\n\nFaced with soaring bills, governments across Europe have stepped in to help ease the financial pressure on households.\n\nBut the “elephant in the room,” said Raja, is that none of the support offered by the UK government so far has directly subsidized consumer energy prices. Earlier this year, the government announced a £150 rebate on a local tax for millions of households to help ease the pain.\n\nMore help is coming soon, but it won’t be anywhere near enough, according to anti-poverty campaigners.\n\nAn electricity transmission tower near residential houses in Upminster, UK, on Monday, July 4, 2022.

The package is the product of painstaking negotiations, and its final passage would give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House, which is expected to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, must approve the bill before Biden can sign it into law.\n\nThe sweeping bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect.\n\nIt would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nSenate Democrats, with a narrow 50-seat majority, stayed unified to pass the legislation, using a special, filibuster-proof process to approve the measure without Republican votes. Final passage came after a marathon series of contentious amendment votes known as a “vote-a-rama” that stretched nearly 16 hours from late Saturday night until Sunday afternoon.\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin told CNN that the legislation he helped write is “a good balanced bill.”\n\n“I think we’ll all benefit from it; the country will,” Manchin told CNN. “We have energy security, that’s what we were looking for. And we have the ability to invest in the energy of the future.”\n\nBiden praised the Senate for passing the bill in a statement Sunday, thanking Democrats in the chamber and touting the legislation’s climate investments and health care provisions.\n\n“Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,” Biden said.\n\nHow Senate Democrats passed the bill on a party-line vote\n\nSenate Democrats have long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus.\n\nManchin played a key role in shaping the legislation – which only moved forward after the West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal at the end of July, a major breakthrough for Democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out.\n\nArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Thursday night offered critical support after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals, indicating she would “move forward” on the sweeping economic package.\n\nBut Sinema, Manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making crucial alterations on the bill.\n\nTo avoid a last-minute collapse of the bill on Sunday, Democrats created a plan to win over Sinema, who was concerned over the 15% corporate minimum tax’s impact on subsidiaries owned by private equity. Senate Democrats accepted a narrower tax proposal, but instead of paying for it through a change to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, as Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota suggested, they instead extended the limitation on the amount of losses that businesses can deduct for another two years.\n\nThe change was intended to prevent House Democrats primarily from coastal districts, who have campaigned on repealing limits on the SALT deduction, from breaking from the bill, when they vote on it later this week.\n\nAfter the bill’s passage in the Senate, Sinema said in a statement it would “help Arizonans build better lives for themselves and their families by lowering prices, making health care more affordable and accessible, and securing Arizona’s water and energy future,” while also “boosting innovation and spurring job creation.”\n\nIn a good sign for the bill becoming law, key House Democrats signaled later Sunday that they’ll vote for it despite previous demands over SALT.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey had been part of the “No SALT, no deal” caucus. But he said the bill passes his test because it doesn’t raise individual income tax rates.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, another member of that caucus, echoed his sentiment: “I will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing SALT. Because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district, but in fact significantly lowers their costs, I will be voting for it.”\n\nRepublicans used the weekend “vote-a-rama” to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes. They were also successful in removing a key insulin provision to cap the price of insulin to $35 per month on the private insurance market, which the Senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the Senate’s reconciliation rules. The $35 insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries remains in place.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the bill included “giant job-killing tax hikes” and amounted to “a war on American fossil fuel.” The Kentucky Republican said Democrats “do not care about middle-class families’ priorities.”\n\n“And their response to the runaway inflation they’ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,” said McConnell. “The American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border.”\n\nHow the bill addresses the climate crisis\n\nWhile economists disagree over whether the package would, in fact, live up to its name and reduce inflation, particularly in the short term, the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions.\n\nThe nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet.\n\nAnalysis from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office – as well as multiple independent analyses – suggests the measure would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to President Joe Biden’s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030.\n\nThe bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles.\n\nLawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what’s needed to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“This isn’t about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. “We all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.”\n\nKey health care and tax policy in the bill\n\nThe bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors’ offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond.\n\nThis controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs.\n\nDemocrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way, they wouldn’t expire just after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTo boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion.\n\nConcerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats’ plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear.\n\nHowever, Sinema nixed her party’s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%.\n\nThe provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers’ profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats.\n\nIn its place, a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Clare Foran Ali Zaslav Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Clare Foran", "Ali Zaslav", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business/britain-cost-of-living/index.html", "title": "Britain's cost of living crisis is pushing millions to the brink | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nNazmin Begum has a problem: she’s having to pay much more to keep her two children warm and fed as the United Kingdom endures its worst cost of living crisis in three decades.\n\n“Everything’s increasing,” she told CNN Business during a visit to The Boiler House, which provides discounted food, footwear and fuel vouchers from a red brick building on a public housing estate in east London.\n\nBegum’s energy bills for her one-bedroom apartment have shot up by about £70 ($92) in the past three months, even though she’s using similar amounts of fuel. She works at Tesco (TSCDF), a supermarket chain, where she has seen “every single product” rise in price.\n\n“Milk was 80p ($1.05). The smallest one, that’s gone to £1 ($1.31),” she said. “The bread — the cheapest bread that we used to do for £1 — has gone to £1.20 ($1.57).”\n\nAnnual consumer price inflation hit 5.5% in January in the United Kingdom — its highest level since 1992 — fueled by product shortages and a sharp spike in demand as pandemic lockdowns were lifted. Wages aren’t keeping pace.\n\nAverage worker pay suffered its biggest drop in more than seven years in the three months to January, falling by 1% over the same period a year ago once inflation is taken into account, the UK Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. And the war in Ukraine has driven energy costs even higher — gasoline and diesel prices have soared to new record highs in recent days.\n\nThe Boiler House has multiple sites, including the Northwold Youth & Community Hub in east London. Keisha Hollands\n\nThe Boiler House Youth and Community Space started its food pantry during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike a traditional food bank, guests browse and shop for their own items, paying a £6.50 ($8.50) fee to receive about £35 ($46) worth of food and toiletries.\n\nBut the charity’s services have expanded to provide members with shoes and help paying their energy bills as many struggle with the most severe knock to their purchasing power in years.\n\nDavina Mathurin, project officer for The Boiler House, summarized the dilemma many are facing.\n\n“Do you either keep the house warm so [your] children don’t get ill?” she said. “Or do [you] buy food so they can eat and they’re not hungry?”\n\nMillions of people’s fuel bills rose in October when Britain’s energy regulator increased its consumer price cap — the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy — by 12% after a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels.\n\nA shopper carries his purchases in Walthamstow, east London, on February 13. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn the day CNN Business visited in February, Mathurin had started referring some members to fuel voucher programs organized by charities that offer up to £49 ($64) to help with bills. Demand was high, she said.\n\nMonique John, another regular visitor to the Boiler House, told CNN Business that she owns a smart meter. The device helps her conserve energy, but her money does not stretch nearly as far as it used to.\n\n“You just literally watch [the meter] go down and down and down and down and down,” she said.\n\n‘There’s just nothing left to give’\n\nThe worst is yet to come.\n\nIn April, the energy price cap will soar by 54% — its largest ever rise — burdening 22 million people with an annual bill of roughly £2,000 ($2,618). Inflation is also expected to peak above 7% and a new payroll tax to help fund health and social care will take effect.\n\nSteam and smoke is seen rising from the chimneys and central heating vents of houses in January in London. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe higher costs could push the number of “destitute” households — defined as those unable to afford basic necessities — up by a third to hit 1 million, according to analysis by The National Institute of Economic and Social Research.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine last month pushed wholesale gas prices up even further as global markets panicked over whether sanctions would hit Russian exports. Analysts at investment bank Investec said Britons’ annual energy bills after October — the next time the price cap is adjusted — could rocket past £3,000 ($3,927) as a result.\n\n“Now there’s just nothing left to give from people’s budgets. There’s no way the numbers add up now,” Lucy Bannister, policy campaigns manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, told CNN Business.\n\n“Children are feeling too scared to ask for the heating to be put on,” she added. “They’re really kind of taking on that stress that they’re seeing their parents go through. Feeling hungry and not asking for a snack.”\n\nThe government will try to ease the pain by cutting local taxes and allowing millions of Britons to spread the cost of their energy bills over the next few years.\n\nA government spokesperson told CNN Business that it was “providing support worth around £12 billion ($16 billion) this financial year and next, to help households with the cost of living.”\n\nThe spokesperson added that the government would raise the minimum wage by more than £1,000 ($1,309) a year and hike a benefit claimed by people on low incomes by the same amount. Both will start in April.\n\nCritics say the government’s response is inadequate and fails to target those who need it most.\n\nIan Allinson, a member of the executive committee at Manchester Trades Union Council, which organized a protest against higher costs in February, said the situation is “alarming.” He said the government’s plan to delay energy payments won’t help vulnerable people.\n\n“We’re appalled when the main measure the government has announced [to bring down energy bills] is that we have to give ourselves a loan,” he told CNN Business.\n\n“A lot of people are struggling with debt already. The idea that there’s then enforced further debt rather than any genuine help is just shocking.”\n\nPeople march through Manchester on February 12, as protests were held nationally against rising energy bills and the cost of living. Ryan Jenkinson/Story Picture Agency/Shutterstock\n\nAngry Britons are taking to the streets. Protesters, and the opposition Labour Party, have called for a windfall tax on energy companies like BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA), which made billions in profit last year.\n\n“It’s just scandalous that the government is choosing to not do something effective to support ordinary people but is happy to leave those mega profits for the companies that are inflicting this on us,” Allinson said.\n\nPaychecks can’t keep up\n\nAt a north London church, piles of groceries are laid out in a grid on the floor of a small side building. Volunteers are packing the donated items into bags before driving them to people’s doors.\n\nCooking Champions, an organization which caters for charitable groups and local businesses, started its delivery service in April 2020 after the pandemic hit.\n\nAnnalisa Moseley is one of the first to receive her shopping. The mother-of-two said that without Cooking Champions, some weeks she would have no food. Thinking about what will happen after April is stressful, she said.\n\nVolunteers at Cooking Champions in London create food parcels using donated and redistributed food. Clare Donovan\n\n“It’s all on my shoulders sort of thing to make sure the kids are warm and fed and everything,” Moseley said. “It has been getting me down a little bit, but just got to carry on. Keep trying.”\n\nMoseley receives Universal Credit — a benefit for people who are out of work or on low incomes. The government hiked payments by £20 ($26) a week during the pandemic, but that ended in October 2021. The benefit will increase by 3.1% in April, but that’s less than half the expected rate of inflation.\n\nRising wages can’t keep up either.\n\nThe Spring Community Hub, a food and clothes bank 15 miles to the south across London, runs another door-to-door delivery service. Lately, volunteers have helped increasing numbers of younger and more affluent people.\n\n“We’re seeing more working people and people on those precarious hours particularly,” CEO Felicia Boshorin told CNN Business.\n\n“When the actual money comes, it’s not enough,” she added.\n\nParents are ‘dreading’ September\n\nSeptember looms large for parents worried about the cost of school uniforms. Shirts, sweaters and jackets emblazoned with school logos — mandatory in the United Kingdom — can run into the hundreds of pounds for a single child.\n\nOne in 10 British families have fallen into debt buying items needed for school, according to a 2020 survey by The Children’s Society, a charity. That figure could grow in 2022 — clothes and footwear were the biggest contributors to inflation in the month to January, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nCaroline Rice, who lives in Northern Ireland, is “dreading” the new school year. She is a member of Covid Realities, a research project documenting the experiences of low income families during the pandemic.\n\n“I can’t afford £100 ($131) for oil, so why would I pay £50 ($65), £60 ($79) for a school blazer?” she said.\n\nBack at The Boiler House, parents are turning up with their children to browse shelves of colorful sneakers, donations provided by charity Sal’s Shoes. Begum’s daughter rushes over to a pair of white and pink sparkly Converse and tries them on.\n\n“With poverty there is that loss of dignity if you’re just effectively being handed handouts,” said CJ Bowry, the founder of Sal’s Shoes.\n\nSal's Shoes' St Paul's Centre in Crewe, on February 16. Courtesy Sal's Shoes St Paul's Centre\n\nIts three pop-up stores around the country aim to give “families a shopping experience,” she said. “So they can visit these shops and try on shoes and choose shoes and see a selection of shoes — but they don’t have to pay.”\n\nSal’s Shoes has sent nearly 3 million pairs to 54 countries in its eight years, though more and more are being sent closer to home. The charity distributed 48,000 pairs around the United Kingdom in 2021, its highest number ever.\n\nBowry said she receives calls every day from school principals asking for support.\n\n“We have headteachers who’ve done playground duty and then ring us because they’ve literally noticed children in their playground with the soles flapping off their shoes,” she said.\n\n‘Hardship is harder’\n\nThe Bank of England expects inflation to cool after peaking in April, but high prices will stick around.\n\nFor people who have taken on new debts and fallen behind on their bills, there will be a scarring effect that could last for years.\n\nResearch by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that 4.4 million low income households began borrowing or added to existing debts during the pandemic. Of that number, more than two thirds are behind on their repayments.\n\nJoseph De-Ville, another member of Covid Realities, lives in Cornwall with his wife and three children. He got into debt a couple of years ago to pay for his mother’s funeral, and told CNN Business about the constant struggle to provide for his family.\n\n“This is the parts of life that people aren’t seeing,” he said. “We’re locking it up into credit cards so we can cope, and then we’re struggling to pay the debts because [of] the interest rates — because we’re having to take high interest rate credit cards just so we can get by.”\n\nFor over a decade, real incomes and living standards for millions of Britons have dropped. For De-Ville, the rising cost of living is just the latest chapter of an extended crisis.\n\n“Hardship is harder,” he said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/world/boris-johnson-electoral-test-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson faces his first serious electoral test since his ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nEver since the “Partygate” scandal rocked Boris Johnson’s premiership at the end of last year, the British Prime Minister has repeatedly dodged questions about his future by asserting that what the public wants is for politicians to get on with running the country, not obsess over events that took place nearly two years ago.\n\nLater this week, Johnson will have some indication of whether or not that claim is right. On Thursday, people across England, Scotland and Wales will vote in local elections, the closest thing to a mid-term that Johnson has faced since taking office in 2019.\n\nThe vote takes place as Johnson and his governing Conservatives are surrounded by scandals and crises so bad that members of his own party have publicly called for his resignation. Indeed, the most pressing of these scandals, which saw Johnson fined by police for breaching his own Covid rules during the 2020 lockdown, might have led to his ousting from office under normal circumstances.\n\nAnd yet, Johnson has time and again proved himself to be unique among politicians and able to roll with every punch thrown at him. What’s unknown right now is if any of those punches, while failing to knock the PM out, have caused sufficient damage that Johnson is still ultimately doomed.\n\nA short look at the wreckage currently surrounding Johnson would be enough to make most chuck the towel in.\n\nThe numerous incidents involved in the Partygate scandal, for which Johnson has already been found guilty of breaking the law, are still being investigated by the police. More fines have been issued to people who worked with the PM inside Downing Street and it’s entirely possible that Johnson could be fined again.\n\nOnce the police have finished, Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, will publish her full report into the scandal, which is likely to be highly critical of Johnson, if the parts already published are anything to go by.\n\nAlso haunting Johnson is the prospect that he will be found to have deliberately misled parliament when, in response to allegations of lockdown-breaching gatherings in Downing Street, he told lawmakers that rules were followed at all times. According to the ministerial code, such an eventuality would normally lead to a resignation.\n\nThe sense of crisis surrounding Johnson’s premiership goes well beyond Partygate.\n\nLast week, his party was accused of having a serious misogyny problem, after one of his backbenchers anonymously claimed to the Mail on Sunday newspaper that Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, attempted to distract Johnson in the House of Commons by crossing and uncrossing her legs, similar to Sharon Stone’s character in the movie “Basic Instinct.”\n\nRayner described the claims as “vile lies” and tweeted that “Boris Johnson’s cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin.” Johnson himself criticized the Mail’s story as “appalling, misogynist tripe” and said he would unleash the “terrors of the earth” on the source if they were found.\n\nAnd on Saturday, another lawmaker from Johnson’s party, Neil Parish, said he would resign after admitting to watching pornography multiple times in the House of Commons.\n\nMeanwhile, 56 members of parliament are currently under investigation for sexual misconduct, with members of Johnson’s cabinet believed by government insiders to be on that list.\n\nAdd to all of this a cost-of-living crisis linked to Brexit and Johnson’s fate going into these elections looks bleak. Inflation in the UK is at a 30-year high, and the Prime Minister’s critics have accused him of having no serious answers to the crisis.\n\nWhen asked in an interview Tuesday to give advice to an elderly widow whose energy bills had risen so much that she had been forced to ride the bus around all day to stay warm, Johnson began his response by taking credit for introducing free bus passes when he was the mayor of London.\n\nWhile the precariousness of his situation might not be obvious day-to-day, it was underscored brutally earlier this month when he had to pull an amendment to a motion that would permit a parliamentary investigation into Partygate because, despite its parliamentary majority of 75, the government was not sufficiently confident that enough MPs would back the PM.\n\n“Put simply, the whips didn’t know they didn’t have the votes to support the PM,” says one senior Conservative MP. “If MPs are not talking to the whips, then you are in serious trouble.”\n\nDespite all this, it’s still uncertain that Johnson will have to resign or be sacked – and some think it’s entirely possible that he will fight the next general election in 2024.\n\nHow can this be the case with so much immediate peril?\n\nFirst, the local elections might not be as catastrophic as many around Johnson fear. “Local elections ask voters a different set of questions to national elections,” explains Chris Curtis, head of political polling at Opinium Research.\n\n“People might vote for a local councillor who they know, like and see as being a million miles from Westminster. That is harder for MPs who have to defend the Prime Minister in parliament,” he adds.\n\nEssentially, the results of these elections might not reflect the broad voter dissatisfaction with Johnson, which is present in national polling virtually every week. In other words, they might not be the smoking gun that MPs who want to get rid of Johnson need to finally make their move.\n\n“Lots of us are very angry, but we know getting rid of another PM is not a great look. We need a very good reason to justify it to the public and I just don’t think these election results will be it,” says one former Conservative cabinet minister.\n\nThere is also a growing sense among Conservative MPs that even the Gray report into Partygate might not be enough to force Johnson from office, as the longer the story rumbles on, the less MPs think the public cares.\n\nFor Johnson’s fiercest critics, this leaves them in a worst-of-all-worlds scenario: a chaotic government they cannot dislodge just as the cost-of-living crisis hits millions of British people.\n\nAnd while the cost of living crisis is driven by multiple factors, including pandemic recovery and the war in Ukraine, there is an element to it that is unique to the UK: Brexit.\n\nA report last week by UK in a Changing Europe, an independent research organization, estimated that since the UK left the European Union’s single market and customs union in January 2021, food prices have risen 6%. If this trend continues, it is could be particularly damaging for Johnson, the man who led the campaign to leave the EU.\n\n“People who say cost of living has nothing to do with Brexit are in denial,” says Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and King’s College London. “In the long run, it’s reducing imports and exports and that is likely to make us somewhat poorer than we otherwise would have been.”\n\nThere is little doubt that the next general election will be determined by how the incumbent government, led by Johnson or not, handles this cost-of-living crisis.\n\nFor many Conservative MPs, that is causing sleepless nights. Many simply don’t think Johnson is capable of handling the challenges currently facing the UK and privately hope the Gray report has something bad enough that they can finally get rid of him, ideally by September.\n\nUntil that happens, Johnson remains in power but with his authority severely damaged. The public, surveys say, largely believes he is untrustworthy, while his own backbenchers cannot be relied upon to support him.\n\nThose who want him gone hope that he will resign, although, to date, Johnson has ruled this out. All of which means that the Conservative party finds itself in the unenviable position of not being strong enough to sack its leader, who is in turn not strong enough to command loyalty from his MPs.\n\nJohnson could still turn it all around, but the longer this goes on, the more the stench of inevitable death around him and his government will fester, making the prospect of fighting the next election unenviable even for those with the strongest of stomachs.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/economy/uk-economy-and-leadership-race/index.html", "title": "Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss vie to replace Boris Johnson. Neither has ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe two candidates jostling to become the next prime minister of the United Kingdom are making big promises about rescuing the country’s economy. It won’t be an easy task.\n\nRishi Sunak and Liz Truss, two politicians for the country’s Conservative Party, are in the final running to replace Boris Johnson after his resignation earlier this month — and face an uphill struggle to revive an economy battling record inflation, anemic growth and labor shortages.\n\nStarting last year, soaring energy prices and supply chain snarls have fueled global inflation as the world’s economies emerged from their pandemic lockdowns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe country’s economic woes, though, run much deeper than the crises of the past two years. The UK economy is expected to stagnate next year, with zero growth in 2023 — the worst-expected performance in the G7, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nTruss and Sunak have promised to tackle inflation to help households burdened by the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. They both have said they will cut taxes — though on very different timescales — and reevaluate the UK’s relationship with its biggest trading partner, the European Union.\n\nBut Ethan Ilzetzki, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics, thinks the leadership debate remains “disconnected” from the nature and scale of the economic challenges: A decade-long stagnation in productivity levels won’t be easily solved.\n\n“None of them have a true plan except for cutting taxes,” he told CNN Business.\n\n“It is all about the level of taxes, the size of government. These are important questions… [but] there is no easy fix in terms of slashing taxes to the deep problems we have here,” he said.\n\nWhile some of the difficulties ailing the world’s fifth largest economy will largely be beyond either Sunak or Truss’ control, they have made bold promises to Britons. Can they deliver on them?\n\nGlobal energy prices\n\nSunak, the government’s former finance minister, has said tackling inflation is his biggest priority — annual consumer price inflation in the UK hit another 40-year high last month to reach 9.4%. That’s the fastest increase among the G7 nations.\n\nBut Sunak’s options are limited, if not nonexistent, given how exposed the UK, as a major importer of fuel, is to global energy prices.\n\n“We are importing that inflation,” Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, told CNN Business.\n\nThe Bank of England has hiked interest rates five times since December in a bid to tame spiraling prices. It expects inflation to top 11% later this year. But its powers are limited, says Raja.\n\n“The UK, as a small, open economy, can’t do very much, [it] can’t supply and make up these goods to limit the increase in prices to offset that inflation,” Raja said.\n\nThe country is spending more importing goods than it makes from its exports. Rocketing fuel costs have helped the UK rack up a trade deficit of 8.3%, the largest since the government’s statistics office started keeping records in 1955.\n\nAdd to that a weakened currency — the pound has lost nearly 12% of its value against the US dollar since the start of this year — and the country can expect the costs of its imports to increase, while its exports could become more competitive on the global market.\n\n“There’s a lot more money going out than coming in,” Maria Demertzis, interim director at Bruegel, an economics think tank, told CNN Business.\n\nThe UK has effectively dipped into its savings, Demertzis said, to help it absorb the shocks of the past few months. This is only a problem if it continues for much longer.\n\nBut global energy prices show little sign of cooling in the near term. Eye-watering wholesale natural gas costs have pushed up the annual energy bill for millions of UK households by 54% this year. Bills are expected to climb again in the fall to top £3,000 ($3,572), according to energy research firm Cornwall Insight.\n\nA shopper walks along the Shambles in York, UK, on Monday, June 20, 2022.

But increased spending could exacerbate inflation and undermine the Bank of England’s efforts to slow down the economy to tame runaway price increases.\n\nSunak has also promised to cut taxes but only once inflation is brought under control.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has estimated that Truss’ total tax cuts would amount to £30 billion ($36 billion). She has not laid out any plans to rein in public spending to compensate for a drop in tax receipts.\n\nIt’s an appealing message for the millions struggling to make ends meet, but her critics say the moves would further fuel inflation and increase public debt, which is on track to hit £100 billion this year.\n\nIn June, inflation pushed up public debt interest payments to the highest level since the government started keeping records 25 years ago.\n\n“Certainly [cutting income tax] would strengthen incentives to enter work and to earn more, though these effects would not be nearly sufficient to make the reform pay for itself,” the IFS said in a Thursday note.\n\nIf Truss wins and fails to cut spending, the IFS said, reality would ultimately bite. “But in the end lower taxes do mean lower [public] spending,” it added.\n\nProductivity slump\n\nDespite a small lift to the UK’s GDP in May, the last month for which there is data, fears that the country will tip into a recession have not gone away.\n\nYet one of the biggest drivers of growth — productivity — has stagnated since the financial crisis in 2008.\n\n“The heart of economic growth lies in productivity growth,” Dean Turner, European and UK economist at UBS bank, told CNN Business. Productivity measures the output per unit of capital, labor or other inputs.\n\nAccording to the the Office for National Statistics, in the decade to 2007, the UK’s output per hour of work grew by 1.9% on average each year, but fell to 0.7% in the decade after the financial crisis. That’s the second-slowest growth in the G7 after Italy.\n\nTurner said that the UK would need to “rethink [its] whole economic model” to boost productivity.\n\n“The fact of the matter is we just don’t do enough investment, we don’t do enough R&D in the UK, and that is something that’s hampering our productivity growth,” said Turner.\n\nHigher productivity would be a boon for workers. Companies could produce more for the same number of staff, and afford to pay them higher wages.\n\nDespite high inflation, average wages are no higher today that they were before 2008, the Resolution Foundation said in a report this month.\n\nIlzetzki said more investment in innovation, research and development, and providing job training to the labor force would go some way to boosting productivity, as well as encouraging immigration.\n\nYet not one of Truss and Sunak’s proposals would “put even a minor dent into the deep structural challenges that the UK faces,” he said.\n\nBrexit still unresolved\n\nAccording to Ilzetzki, a major priority for the next prime minister should be to clarify “once and for all, the UK’s relationship with its larger trading partner,” the European Union.\n\nTruss, who voted to remain in the EU in 2016, has since become a staunch advocate for Brexit. She is pushing to rip up the Northern Ireland protocol — a piece of legislation central to the EU withdrawal agreement the UK signed in 2020 — which enables the free flow of goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe protocol keeps Northern Ireland subject to EU rules on internal trade, and means that goods traveling between the country and the rest of the UK must be checked.\n\nCritics argue that the arrangement effectively creates a sea border within the UK, and involves burdensome costs and paperwork for businesses.\n\nTruss, while serving as the UK’s foreign minister earlier this year, put forward legislation that promised to “end the untenable situation where people in Northern Ireland are treated differently to the rest of the United Kingdom,” and protect the country’s “territorial integrity.”\n\nBut overriding the protocol could lead to retaliation from the EU, with tariffs imposed on UK exports. The resulting trade war would be very bad for UK business.\n\nSunak has been less forthcoming on how he would handle the issue, but has previously said he would prefer to have a negotiated settlement with Europe.\n\nThe uncertainty is discouraging investment in the UK, Ilzetzki said.\n\n“Nobody is going to invest in the UK for a few lower points of taxation when they aren’t certain whether UK exporters will be in a trade war with the EU within a year,” he added.\n\nThe twin impact of Brexit and the pandemic has also made it much harder for UK employers to tap a huge source of workers to help fill a grinding labor shortage.\n\nSince January 2021, all EU nationals seeking work must pass through the same points-based immigration process as other nationalities. About 211,000 fewer EU nationals were working in the UK in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020, while the number of non-EU workers rose by 182,000, according to official statistics.\n\nTo make matters worse, one million workers have exited the labor force, and many are unlikely to return. About half cited chronic ill health as the reason for leaving work, according to the Learning and Work Institute.\n\n“We’ve seen an exodus of workers unlike anywhere else that we’ve seen in the advanced world,” Raja said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/30/energy/eu-russian-oil/index.html", "title": "EU agrees on partial ban of Russian oil imports | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe European Union has agreed on a partial ban on Russian oil imports, according to European Council chief Charles Michel.\n\n“Agreement to ban export of Russian oil to the EU. This immediately covers more than 2/3 of oil imports from Russia, cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine,” Michel announced in a tweet on Monday evening.\n\nMichel’s announcement followed an extraordinary European Council summit attended by EU leaders in Brussels on Monday to discuss a sixth package of sanctions against Russia.\n\n“This sanctions package includes other hard-hitting measures: de-Swifting the largest Russian bank Sberbank, banning 3 more Russian state-owned broadcasters, and sanctioning individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine,” Michel added.\n\nThe EU agreed to ban 90 percent of Russian oil imports by the end of the year, the leaders of the European Council said.\n\nRussian oil delivered by tankers would be banned, while an exemption will be made for the southern segment of the Druzhba pipeline, said Ursula von der Leyen — president of the European Commission — in a press conference. The northern segment of the pipeline serves Poland and Germany — who have agreed to the embargo. The southern part goes to Hungary, Slovakia and Czech republic.\n\nVon der Leyen said an exemption will be made for the southern segment, which accounts for 10% of imports on Russian oil.\n\n“As we have a clear political statement by Poland and Germany that they will, as the others, wind down Russian oil, until the end of the year. We have covered overall 90 percent of Russian oil being wind down during this time frame. Leftover is the roundabout 10 or 11 percent that is covered by the southern Druzhba. We have agreed for the moment being for an exemption,” von der Leyen said.\n\nEU leaders will meet again in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss the bloc’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOfficials first proposed joining the US and others in banning Russia’s oil a month ago as part of a sixth package of EU sanctions over the country’s invasion of Ukraine. But an agreement has been held up by some countries, like Hungary, that are particularly reliant on Russian crude delivered via pipeline.\n\nAn EU official told CNN earlier that banning all seaborne oil would cover more than two-thirds of imports from Russia.\n\nEurope is the biggest buyer of Russian energy. Russian crude accounted for 27% of the bloc’s imports in 2021, according to Eurostat. That’s around 2.4 million barrels per day, data from the International Energy Agency shows. About 35% of that was delivered via pipelines to the bloc, according to the IEA.\n\nBut pipeline deliveries made up a much bigger share of Russian oil shipments to Hungary (86%), the Czech Republic (97%) and Slovakia (100%).\n\nThe price of Brent crude futures, the European benchmark, soared past $124 a barrel on Tuesday morning, its highest level since early March after Russia invaded Ukraine. Prices have since fallen back slightly.\n\nEurope now needs to find alternate sources for its crude to help bring down surging fuel prices, which helped push eurozone inflation to another record high of 8.1% on Tuesday.\n\nRussia also needs to find new customers. India is expected to import 3.36 million metric tonnes in May, according to estimates from Refinitiv — almost 9 times higher than the 2021 monthly average.\n\nEurope can’t prevent Russia from selling oil to non-European countries said Josep Borrell, the bloc’s top diplomat, on Tuesday.\n\n“We’re not so powerful, but we are the most important client for Russia,” he added.\n\n- CNN’s Diksha Madhok, Anna Cooban, James Frater, Mitchell McCluskey, Sharon Braithwaite and Hira Humayun contributed to this report", "authors": ["Niamh Kennedy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/economy/uk-gdp-economy-g7/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson's go-to boast on UK GDP obscures the painful truth ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is fond of saying the United Kingdom has the fastest growing economy in the G7.\n\nThe prime minister can back up his claim with data published by Britain’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday, which showed the United Kingdom had the fastest growing economy of the Group of Seven nations over last year as a whole.\n\nUK gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — grew by 7.5% as activity bounced back with the lifting of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nBut those figures don’t tell the whole story. The growth numbers are pumped up because the United Kingdom endured the deepest recession of any major developed economy in 2020 and its worst performance since 1921, providing a lower base for subsequent comparison.\n\nJohnson’s boast also doesn’t reflect what happened in the final three months of last year. UK GDP expanded 1% in the fourth quarter, according to ONS data published Friday. That trailed the United States (1.7%) and Canada (1.6%), which are both in the G7.\n\nEven those statistics obscure a larger truth: the United Kingdom is hurtling toward its worst cost of living crisis in 30 years, the Bank of England expects unemployment to rise next year and growth to be “subdued,” taxes are going up and new post-Brexit import controls could slam foreign trade.\n\nShort-term economic indicators have also been exceptionally volatile, reflecting the stop-start nature of business as coronavirus restrictions have come and gone. A better way to measure performance is to compare current economic output with levels before the pandemic arrived. Here, the United Kingdom is languishing near the middle of the G7 ranking.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the UK economy was still 0.4% smaller than it was before the pandemic struck, according to the ONS. By the same measure, the US economy has expanded 3.1%, while France and Canada have grown by 0.9% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\nThe German and Italian economies have not yet achieved their pre-pandemic size, and comparable data for Japan is not yet available.\n\nJohnson may be able to repeat his G7 claim without being slapped down by fact checkers. But it’s less likely to land well with the British people, whose average disposable incomes after tax are forecast to decline by 2% this year.\n\nUK inflation hit 5.4% in December, its highest rate since 1992, according to official statistics released last month. Wages advanced at an annual rate of just 3.8% in December, leaving households with less purchasing power.\n\nA volunteer collects donated items from shelving racks at a food bank in Colchester, England, on January 20. Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBrits are already feeling rising costs. Some 85% of people have noticed an increase in the costs of groceries, according to a January survey conducted by YouGov. Roughly 35% say their housing costs, including rent and mortgages, have risen. Nearly 75% have noticed higher fuel prices.\n\nThe cost of living crisis is about to get much worse.\n\nThe Bank of the England expects inflation to surge higher over the coming months and peak at 7.25% in April. In early February, the central bank hiked interest rates for a second time in three months in an effort to rein in rising prices, increasing pressure on homeowners with variable rate mortgages. More interest rate hikes are expected later this year.\n\n“We are facing a squeeze on real incomes this year,” central bank boss Andrew Bailey told reporters last week. “It is necessary for us to … raise interest rates because if we don’t do that, we think that the effects will be worse.”\n\nEnergy bills will go even higher in April, when regulators increase a cap on how much consumers can be charged to heat and light their homes by 54%.\n\nThe change means that the typical consumer will see their energy bills increase by £693 ($939) to £1,971 ($2,670) per year. Some of that will be offset by a cut in local taxes, and a discount that will have to be repaid over 5 years.\n\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation said some families on low incomes would face annual bills as high as £2,326 ($3,152) from April, while the Resolution Foundation warned that the number of households in “fuel stress” — those spending more than 10% of the family budget on energy — would double to 5 million.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street on February 9. Matt Dunham/AP\n\nOther government policies are adding to the burden on households.\n\nJohnson is pushing ahead with plans to hike the National Insurance payroll tax in April in order to fund health and social care. The hike should help the elderly, but the tax is regressive, meaning higher earners pay a lower marginal rate than the poor.\n\nAnd in early October, the government cut Universal Credit — a benefit claimed by those out-of-work or earning low incomes — back to its pre-pandemic level. More than 5.8 million people lost £20 ($28) a week, although the government later boosted the income of some people who work and receive the benefit.\n\nOne more big economic risk looms. The government has yet to implement fully the border checks that are needed as a result of Brexit, and there is considerable doubt over whether preparations are on track despite three previous delays.\n\nThe UK Parliament’s influential Public Accounts Committee said this week that “there remains much to be done to introduce import controls.” The trade group Logistics UK echoed that assessment, warning that delays at the border could cause a backup of trucks that would stretch for 29 miles.\n\nTaken together, the combination of spiraling costs, taxes and risks to trade leave the prime minister with little reason to boast about the state of the UK economy.", "authors": ["Charles Riley"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/04/business/uk-prime-minister-economy?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google", "title": "UK prime minister: Boris Johnson is handing his successor an ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nAcross the United Kingdom, businesses and households are warning that they won’t make it through the winter without help from the government. That sets up enormous challenges for Liz Truss, the incoming prime minister.\n\nFor months, the United Kingdom has endured a leadership vacuum while the country has skidded toward a recession and a humanitarian crisis triggered by soaring energy bills.\n\nSince Boris Johnson announced he would leave office in July, the outlook for growth has weakened. Annual inflation is running above 10% as food and fuel prices leap. Frustration over the rising cost of living has compelled hundreds of thousands of workers who staff ports, trains and mailrooms to go on strike. The British pound just logged its worst month since the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum, hitting its lowest level against the US dollar in more than two years.\n\n“It’s just one blow after the other,” said Martin McTague, who heads up the UK’s Federation of Small Businesses. “I’m afraid I can’t find any good news.”\n\nThe situation could get much worse before it gets better. The Bank of England anticipates that inflation will jump to 13% as the energy crisis intensifies. Citigroup estimates inflation in the United Kingdom could peak at 18% in early 2023, while Goldman Sachs warns it could reach 22% if natural gas prices “remain elevated at current levels.”\n\nA man with a trade union flag awaits the start of the sold-out campaign event \"Enough Is Enough.\" Faith leaders and unions came together to raise support to tackle the cost of living crisis by demanding real pay rises, slashing energy bills and taxing the rich. Andy Barton/SOPA Images/Sipa/AP\n\nTruss, who had been serving as foreign secretary, now faces calls to announce a swift intervention as she becomes the fourth Conservative leader of the country in a decade.\n\nThe most urgent problem she must address is the skyrocketing cost of energy, which could unleash a wave of business closures and force millions of people to choose between putting food on the table and heating their homes this winter. Experts have warned that people will become destitute and cold-weather deaths will rise unless something is done fast.\n\nTruss told the BBC on Sunday that she would make an announcement on the “serious issue of energy” within one week. A broader economic package would follow within a month, she added.\n\n“Everybody is assuming that there will be a swift and decisive announcement that puts this issue to bed, or at least provides people with reassurance,” said Jonathan Neame, who runs Shepherd Neame, Britain’s oldest brewer. “If there’s not, that person will come under very considerable pressure.”\n\nAn energy ‘catastrophe’\n\nEnergy bills for households will rise 80% to an average of £3,549 ($4,106) a year from October. Analysts say the household price cap could rise to more than £5,000 ($5,785) in January and jump above £6,000 in April ($6,942).\n\nAs people are forced to reevaluate their budgets, the boom in consumption that followed the Covid-19 lockdowns is dissipating fast. The Bank of England has warned the UK economy will fall into a recession in the coming months.\n\n“The key challenge that the energy price surge poses is that households that use lots of energy — and in particular poorer households — are going to really struggle to make ends meet,” said Ben Zaranko, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “It’s going to mean really big cutbacks in other areas of spending.”\n\nMeanwhile, Neame, whose portfolio includes about 300 pubs across southern England, said business owners are panicking. They’re getting quoted insane numbers for year-ahead utility bills, if they can find suppliers at all. Nick Mackenzie, the head of the Greene King pub chain, said that one location it works with reported its energy costs had jumped by £33,000 ($38,167) a year.\n\n“It’s really daunting for a lot of businesses, especially the ones who came through Covid in a weakened state,” McTague said. “They’re now struggling to deal with another once-in-a-lifetime catastrophe.”\n\nThe crumbling British pound could exacerbate problems, making it more expensive to import energy and other goods, pushing inflation even higher.\n\nOverlapping crises\n\nIt’s not the only reason business owners and investors are increasingly anxious. While job vacancies fell between May and July, they remain 60% above their pre-pandemic level. Finding workers to fill open roles has been a particular challenge in the United Kingdom since the country voted to leave the European Union. About 317,000 fewer EU nationals were living in the United Kingdom in 2021 than in 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nAn information sheet displayed outside Victoria Underground Station in London on Aug. 19, advising the public on planned strike actions. Hollie Adams/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBrexit is also scrambling trade, particularly with the European Union, the UK’s largest trading partner. Exports and imports will be about 15% lower in the long run than they would have been if the United Kingdom stayed in the EU, the Office for Budget Responsibility has projected.\n\nDean Turner, UK economist at UBS, said it’s up to the new prime minister to try to make the most of the country’s position without creating further disruption. Yet hardline British lawmakers are still pushing to cast aside a key part of the Brexit agreement Johnson signed with the European Union, which could ultimately trigger a trade war with the UK’s biggest export market.\n\n“Brexit’s happened. It is what it is, we’ve all got our own opinions on it,” Turner said. “But we’ve got to work with it to make it better for us, and I just struggle to see if there’s any momentum to do that.”\n\nNo easy solutions\n\nTruss, who starts on the job this week, has vowed to jumpstart the economy by slashing taxes. But many economists fear this approach could fan inflation and hurt fragile public finances, while failing to put money in the pockets of those who need it most.\n\n“The benefits of cutting [taxes] would largely flow to the people who pay more tax, which are generally people with more money,” said Jonathan Marshall, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation.\n\nThere’s no way for the state to avoid paying huge sums to deal with the energy situation this winter, but targeted measures will be necessary to avoid waste. Freezing gas and electricity prices over the next two winters could cost the government over £100 billion ($116 billion), according to researchers at the Institute for Government.\n\n“Energy is expensive, gas is expensive,” Marshall said. “To avoid people freezing in their houses, that needs to be paid for. But the state doesn’t need to pay for it for people who can afford it.”\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss, the incoming prime minister, speaks on stage on Aug. 23 in Birmingham, England. Anthony Devlin/Getty Images\n\nThere are also questions about how the Truss government will afford a large-scale economic intervention, especially if slashing taxes — and therefore government revenue — remains the priority.\n\nThe UK government borrowed heavily to provide support during coronavirus lockdowns. The country’s debts are now almost 100% of its gross domestic product. When interest rates were at rock bottom, and access to cash was cheap, this wasn’t a major issue.\n\nBut that’s no longer the case. The Bank of England has been aggressively hiking rates as it tries to put a lid on inflation. That will make it increasingly expensive for the government to service its debt. The United Kingdom also has issued a large number of inflation-linked bonds, adding to its vulnerability.\n\n“It’s almost a perfect cocktail of challenges that make public finances look at risk in a way they haven’t in recent times,” Zaranko of the IFS said.\n\nKwasi Kwarteng, who is expected to become finance minister, wrote in the Financial Times on Sunday that the Truss government would act in a “fiscally responsible way.”", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/economy/mortgage-rates-june-23/index.html", "title": "Mortgage rates rise again, pricing more buyers out of the housing ...", "text": "Mortgage rates continue to climb as the Federal Reserve seeks to tame unwieldy inflation.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.81% in the week ending June 23, edging up from 5.78% the week before, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nThis time last year, rates averaged 3.02%, and the last time rates were this high was in the winter of 2008.\n\n“Fixed mortgage rates have increased by more than two full percentage points since the beginning of the year,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, in a statement. “The combination of rising rates and high home prices is the likely driver of recent declines in existing home sales. However, in reality, many potential homebuyers are still interested in purchasing a home, keeping the market competitive but leveling off the last two years of red-hot activity.”\n\nDespite the jumps, mortgage rates remain well below historical highs notched during the past 40 years – notably the record 18.63% average rate in October 1981.\n\nStill, the sharpness of current mortgage rate increases combined with the spike in borrowing costs will ultimately make consumers more cautious, said Abbey Omodunbi, assistant vice president and senior economist for The PNC Financial Services Group.\n\n“I think we’re likely to see further increases in mortgage rates through the rest of the year,” Omodunbi said in an interview with CNN Business. “The Fed wants to see softening housing activity.”\n\nThe Federal Reserve does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, but its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track 10-year US Treasury bonds. But rates are indirectly impacted by the Fed’s actions on inflation. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they often sell government bonds, which sends yields higher and with it, mortgage rates.\n\nDuring its policymaking meeting last week, the fed raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points, the largest such increase in three decades. In public comments made since, including in testimony before Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank’s actions should help dampen demand in the nation’s housing market, which has been running white-hot.\n\nHome prices surged during the past two years in part due to record-low mortgage rates, pandemic-related migration patterns, the influence of investment firms buying residential properties, and the Fed’s purchase of mortgage bonds.\n\nRents and home prices continue to rise at double-digit rates in many areas.\n\n“Housing prices should stop going up at such remarkably rapid rates,” Powell said Wednesday in a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve had a very, very hot … housing market all across the country. As demand for housing moderates…you should see prices stop going up.”\n\nStill, the flip side of higher mortgage rates in a high-inflation environment and record home costs could ultimately price out millions more Americans from owning a home, according to Harvard University’s annual State of the Nation’s Housing Report released Wednesday.\n\nA year ago, a buyer who put 20% down on a median-priced $390,000 home and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average interest rate of 3.02% had a monthly mortgage payment of $1,673, according to numbers from Freddie Mac.\n\nAt today’s rate of 5.81%, the monthly mortgage payment on that same house would be $2,187, a difference of $514.\n\nHousing already appears to be transitioning to a “post-pandemic new normal,” said George Ratiu, Realtor.com’s manager of economic research. Rents hit a record high for the 15th consecutive month, but the pace of growth is slowing, he said, adding that home price gains are also declining.\n\n“Market prices will continue adjusting to a smaller pool of qualified buyers and higher financing costs,” he said in a statement. “The move from an overheated real estate market toward a more sustainable one will take some time. The upside is that eventually we should see a healthier environment with more options and better value for many buyers.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}]}

The jury returned no verdict on three of the charges concerning defrauding investors, and Judge Edward Davila, who is presiding over the case, is expected to declare a mistrial on those charges.\n\nThe charges Holmes was found guilty of include one count of conspiracy to defraud investors, as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.\n\nElizabeth Holmes leaves federal court after the verdict in San Jose, California, on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022.

Over the course of its 11-week case, the government called just three patient witnesses to the stand, two of whom were individually tied to wire fraud counts.\n\nThe jury deliberated for over 50 hours before returning a verdict on eight of the 11 charges.

In response, Judge Davila issued what is known as an Allen charge, instructing them to continue deliberating to try to reach a verdict.\n\nHowever, hours later, the jury returned another note that indicated it remained unable to reach a verdict on those counts. The counts pertained to three of the investor wire fraud charges.\n\nThe verdict comes after a trial that spanned over three months at a federal courthouse in San Jose. More than 30 witnesses testified during the trial, culminating with Holmes, who took the stand for seven days in her own defense.\n\nHolmes’ case marked a rare criminal fraud trial of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Jurors were tasked with determining whether Holmes was a well-meaning founder who made mistakes as she built her startup, as her defense posited, or whether she intentionally deceived investors and patients in order to help herself and her company succeed, as federal prosecutors alleged.\n\nElizabeth Holmes is kissed on her head by her father in federal court in San Jose, California, on January 3, 2022. Sketch by Vicki Behringer\n\nWhile Holmes was the one on trial, the outcome of her case could serve as a cautionary tale for others in Silicon Valley.\n\n“This is a verdict that should matter not just to Silicon Valley but to the people who celebrate it, invest in it and use its products,” said Margaret O’Mara, a historian of the tech industry and professor at the University of Washington. “She was made possible by a Valley business culture that celebrated and encouraged very young, marginally experienced people.”\n\nGeorge Demos, a former Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor and adjunct law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, called the verdict “a significant win for the government and sends a powerful signal to Silicon Valley that fraud cannot masquerade as innovation.”\n\nWhile much of Silicon Valley has tried to distance itself from Theranos for a variety of reasons, including that the startup was a medical device manufacturer, the power and control Holmes wielded over Theranos had all the trappings of a tech company, O’Mara said.\n\n“She was not just the CEO,” O’Mara said, “she was a very powerful CEO in the Silicon Valley model.”\n\nThe rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes\n\nHolmes, now 37, started Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 and soon thereafter dropped out of Stanford to pursue it full-time. After a decade under the radar, Holmes began courting the press with claims that Theranos had invented technology that could accurately and reliably test for a range of conditions using just a few drops of blood taken from a finger prick. The unveiling coincided with the company’s announcement in 2013 of a major retail partnership with Walgreens.\n\nTheranos raised $945 million from an impressive list of investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, Walmart’s Walton family and the billionaire family of former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.\n\nAt its peak, Theranos was valued at $9 billion, making Holmes a paper billionaire. She was lauded on magazine covers, frequently wearing a signature black turtleneck that invited comparisons to the late Apple CEO. (She has not worn that look in the courtroom.)\n\nElizabeth Holmes during an interview in September 2015. David Orrell/CNBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty Images\n\nO’Mara said Holmes was particularly beloved by the media as an intrepid entrepreneur working on a product that aimed to make the world better – and a rare female founder at that.\n\nBut the dominoes started to fall after a Wall Street Journal investigation in 2015 found the company had only ever performed roughly a dozen of the hundreds of tests it offered using its proprietary blood testing device, and with questionable accuracy. Instead, Theranos was relying on third-party manufactured devices from traditional blood testing companies.\n\nIn 2016, Theranos voided two years of blood test results. In 2018, Holmes and Theranos settled “massive fraud” charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not admit to or deny any of the allegations as part of the deal. Theranos dissolved soon after.\n\nThe scene inside and outside the courtroom\n\nFirst indicted in 2018, Holmes’ trial was delayed by the pandemic and the birth of her child. But public interest in Holmes has remained strong since then, with documentaries, podcasts, an upcoming TV miniseries and a planned feature film.\n\nThat fascination was apparent outside the courtroom. Members of the public and the press gathered as early as 2 a.m. local time on major days of the trial to get one of the 34 courtroom seats available. A ticketed overflow room sat another roughly 45 people. There was otherwise no way to view the events because audio and video recordings were prohibited.\n\nThe trial drew apparent friends of Holmes, some of whom showed up on the day of opening statements dressed in a look that resembled the former CEO at Theranos’ peak – clad in black attire with blonde hair pulled back at the nape of their necks. It also attracted an artist who set up a performance art display outside the courthouse, selling a very limited number of blonde wigs, black turtlenecks and “blood energy” drinks. She said she wanted to see “what it was like experiencing her energy.”\n\nDuring jury selection, the father of Holmes’ partner showed up early to snag a seat inside the courtroom. He assumed a nickname and claimed to be a concerned citizen, but on the first day of the trial he walked into the courtroom alongside Holmes. After his identity was revealed publicly, he wasn’t seen again at the trial.\n\nTheranos founder and former CEO Elizabeth Holmes arrives for her trial at the Robert F. Peckham Federal Building on December 07, 2021 in San Jose, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nFor her part, Holmes – wearing a work dress and jacket or skirt suit in greys, blues or greens with a green or blue mask – arrived each court day walking hand-in-hand with either her mother, Noel, or her partner, Billy Evans, or both. When Holmes took the stand, the group of friends and family sitting in reserved seating swelled. Her father was seen in the courtroom during closing arguments.\n\nAs the trial went on, three jurors were dismissed. One juror was reported by another for playing Sudoku during the proceedings. Another was excused after disclosing she was experiencing anxiety stemming from the prospect of sending Holmes to prison, and cited her Buddhist beliefs. The alternate juror tapped to replace her expressed some concern about sentencing Holmes because she is very young. She remained on the jury tasked with determining Holmes’ fate.\n\nThe government’s 11-week case against Holmes\n\nIn its closing arguments, the prosecution alleged that, faced with a business running out of money, Holmes “chose fraud” rather than “failure.”\n\nDuring the trial, federal prosecutors called 29 witnesses to testify, including former Theranos employees, retail executives and a former US Defense Secretary. Through these witnesses, the government attempted to show the layers of the alleged fraud, including how Theranos concealed its use of third-party manufactured machines to test patient blood, overstated its financials, misrepresented its work with pharmaceutical companies and the military, and used the media to perpetuate the untruths.\n\nIn his final remarks, prosecutor John Bostic said Holmes was “especially fond of using” half-truths, which he described as something that is “arguably technically correct, but still leaves the listener with an unmistakable incorrect understanding about what the truth is.”\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos Inc., left center, departs from federal court with, from left, husband Billy Evans, parents Noel Holmes and Christian Holmes IV in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAs an example of that, he pointed to journalist Roger Parloff’s recordings of interviews with Holmes done in conjunction with a 2014 Fortune Magazine cover story that were played in court during the reporter’s time on the stand. Holmes is heard rationalizing why some patients had their blood taken through venipuncture rather than solely its marketed fingerstick blood draws. “At no point during that conversation did she tell Mr. Parloff that the reason … was that the company’s own technology could not do the range of tests that she was offering,” said Bostic.\n\n“It does not matter whether Ms. Holmes had the intent to make the lie true or to avoid being found out. The problem is in making the misrepresentations on the day it’s made,” he added.\n\nBostic also said Holmes “borrowed the credibility” of others, through her startup’s high-profile retail partnerships, her magazine cover pieces and her board stocked with powerful names, including former Defense Secretaries and two former Secretaries of State.\n\n“By attaching herself to these individuals and organizations,” he continued, “she bolstered Theranos’ own credibility, and by exaggerating those contexts, she caused others to believe that Theranos must have the legitimacy of those other entities.”\n\nElizabeth Holmes listens as the clerk is reading the verdict and her family is clutching each other's hands in federal court in San Jose, California, on January 3, 2022. Sketch by Vicki Behringer\n\nHolmes testifies for 7 days in her own defense\n\nThe defense called three witnesses, concluding with Holmes. Known for her charm and charisma while CEO, Holmes’ testimony ranged from speaking emphatically about her belief in the company’s technology to pointing the finger at others – notably, her ex-boyfriend and former Theranos COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani.\n\nWhile the origin story of Theranos is well-known, Holmes shed more light on her decision to drop out of Stanford. She testified she had been raped as a student and was having trouble attending classes. She said she left school to throw herself into building what became Theranos, seeking business advice from Balwani, 20 years her senior, whom she had met after graduating from high school and whom she viewed as a successful tech executive.\n\nHolmes testified she and Balwani had a decade-long abusive relationship. She said Balwani tried to control nearly every aspect of her life as he sought to help her become successful. Balwani, through court filings, has denied the abuse allegations. (Balwani faces the same charges as Holmes and is set to be tried early this year. He has pleaded not guilty.)\n\nHolmes also testified that Balwani, whom she lived with, served as her most important adviser during her time at Theranos. She testified that he didn’t control what she said to investors, board members, retail partners, and the media during her time at the helm of Theranos. But his influence on her life loomed large.\n\n“He impacted everything about who I was, and I don’t fully understand that,” Holmes testified.\n\nHolmes’ defense team did not call an expert to testify about the possible implications of the alleged abuse on her role as CEO, despite having indicated it may do so. In his closing arguments, prosecutor Jeffrey Schenk told jurors they did not need to decide whether the abuse happened to reach a verdict.\n\n“The case is about false statements made to investors and false statements made to patients,” he said.\n\nAsked whether she ever led patients to believe Theranos could offer accurate and reliable blood tests while knowing it could not, Holmes testified: “Of course not.”", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/05/tech/clockwork-nail-robot-target/index.html", "title": "A robot painted my nails at Target for $10, offering a weird view of ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nOn a recent April afternoon I tossed a few things into a basket at Target — cereal, graham crackers, kids’ sunglasses — then sat down at the end of an aisle filled with beauty items, placed a hand into a box-like machine, and let a robot paint my fingernails.\n\nMade by a company called Clockwork, the robot is stationed at a Target store in Walnut Creek, California. Customers first book and pay for their appointment online, then stick a hand inside the machine (which looks a lot like a printer) that pipes polish onto the nail, leaving no brush lines. For now, at least, it’s not entirely on its own: A (human) attendant was present the two times I visited, helping explain the process and cleaning up any missteps by the machine, such as polish spillover or messy-looking edges.\n\nClockwork's fingernail-painting robot takes pictures of each fingernail then pipes polish onto the nail, leaving no brush lines. Jesse Meria/Courtesy Clockwork\n\nClockwork robots were added to three Target stores (two in the San Francisco Bay Area, one in Target’s corporate home state of Minnesota), starting in February, as part of a small-scale test to see how shoppers take to this sort of on-the-go beauty service. Clockwork CEO and founder Renuka Apte said the machines will be added to three more Target stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on May 11. Fingernail painting costs $10 (though Clockwork is currently offering first-time customers $2 off), and is meant to take about 10 minutes or less.\n\nRobots have been common in commercial settings for a long time, but they mostly remain a novelty with consumers (you may have encountered the occasional French fry-making robot, barista robot, or delivery robot, to name a few). Clockwork’s machines are an attempt to make such robots more common in everyday life; they’re aimed at people who want something in between a sit-down manicure (which can be costly and time-consuming) and do-it-yourself nail painting (which, if you’re like me, can be extremely messy).\n\n“I feel like most people who want to do beauty on a regular basis don’t always have time for it,” Apte told CNN Business.\n\nCameras, data, and algorithms\n\nApte said she came up with the idea for Clockwork, which she founded with Aaron Feldstein in 2018, in part to solve her own problem.\n\nCNN Business Senior Tech writer Rachel Metz recently tested Clockwork's fingernail-painting robot at a local Target store. Noah Brezel\n\nTo paint your nails, Clockwork’s machines rely on cameras, data, and algorithms. You place a digit on a finger rest and slide it into the machine, where two cameras rapidly take about 100 pictures of the nail. Apte said those images are used to create a 3-D point cloud showing the shape of the nail, and this data is used to figure out where the edges of your nail are located. This information is then used by algorithms that figure out things such as how (and how fast) the machine’s polish-dispensing pipette should move to apply paint to your nail.\n\nClockwork also labels and adds these nail pictures to a dataset that’s used to improve the company’s nail-painting software.\n\nIt might not sound that complicated, but Apte said variations in the steepness of people’s nails — combined with the changing viscosity of nail polish, depending on how it’s applied — make it a challenging endeavor for a robot.\n\nThe machine uses a disposable pipette that draws polish from tiny, prefilled bottles; Apte said that she and Feldstein originally experimented with using brushes to apply polish, but eventually eschewed them for a host of reasons (brushes tend to harden and can harbor bacteria if they aren’t cleaned properly, for instance).\n\nKelsie Marian, a senior director analyst at Gartner who covers large retailers and the ways they use technology, noted that retailers have been experimenting with robots for years, especially for tasks like inventory management and price checking. As a result, consumers are becoming more comfortable seeing these sorts of things in stores. Additionally, Clockwork’s nail-painting experience is one more choice that retailers can give customers, she said.\n\n“There’s an aspect here of, if I had the time to go in and sit down and have the full experience, I would do that, but I also want the option to very quickly go in and use something like that,” she said.\n\nSimilarly, Apte sees Clockwork not as a replacement for a traditional manicure, but as another beauty service.\n\n“It’s kind of like adding fast-casual restaurants or vending machines in a world that only has sit-down restaurants,” she said.\n\nThe robots aren’t perfect\n\nClockwork’s robots aren’t perfect: The first time I visited, the pipette that pushes out polish appeared to clog after painting a few nails, and several of my nails were painted so poorly around the edges that the machine’s attendant fixed them by hand. It took about 20 minutes to complete a coat in a honey-yellow hue, which is twice as long as the company’s goal.\n\nCNN Business Senior Tech writer Rachel Metz recently tested Clockwork's fingernail-painting robot at a local Target store. Noah Brezel\n\nThey also can’t do anything more complicated than paint a coat of colored nail polish — if you want your nails filed, or a protective top coat applied to keep your polish from chipping, you’ll have to do it on your own. (Apte said top coats are coming “pretty soon” to Clockwork’s machines.)\n\nApte said most of the painting issues Clockwork sees are due to people moving a bit after the machines takes pictures but right before their nails are painted. This may lead to problems like polish spillover.\n\nWith this in mind, I decided to go back to Target for a second polishing a week after my first trip. This time, I held my hands as still as possible. Maybe it helped: the painting process went a lot faster overall, and my nails (this time bright red) required hardly any touch-ups.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/business/mcdonalds-adults-happy-meal/index.html", "title": "McDonald's is selling Happy Meals to adults — with a twist | CNN ...", "text": "1.

Marcos, not just to read about history but to preserve it.\n\nThe rush to buy books documenting Marcos’ destructive 21-year reign comes as his son, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., assumes office after a landslide election victory in May.\n\nMarcos Jr. has never publicly acknowledged or apologized for the human rights abuses, corruption and theft that historians say took place under his father’s leadership.\n\nAnd there are fears that now he is in power, he will try to rewrite history.\n\nJournalist Raissa Robles, the author of “Marcos Martial Law: Never Again,” said after Marcos Jr.’s win she received emails from readers all over the world with requests to reprint the detailed dive on the victims of martial law.\n\n“The book price had nearly doubled and yet the people were buying the book by batches. They weren’t just buying one or two. They were buying five or 10 at a time,” Robles said.\n\nAuthor Raissa Robles saw a surge of interest in her book about the Marcos regime. From Raissa Robles\n\nThe main cause for concern came from the president himself.\n\nBack in 2020, when Marcos Jr. was preparing to run for president, he made clear a desire to revise textbooks that documented his parent’s corrupt and brutal regime.\n\n“We have been calling for that for years,” Marco Jr. said in a forum hosted by the National Press Club, as he accused those in power since his father’s demise of “teaching children lies.”\n\nHuman rights groups say during the Marcos regime from 1965 to 1986 tens of thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured or killed for perceived or real criticism of the government. Marcos Sr., who died in exile in 1989, and his wife, Imelda, 93, were also found guilty of widespread corruption including stealing an estimated $10 billion of public money.\n\nThe family has repeatedly denied using state funds for their personal use – a claim challenged in multiple court cases.\n\nCNN reached out to the new Marcos government for comment but has not received a response.\n\nDemand surges for books on the Marcos regime\n\nMarcos Jr. has previously asked “the world” to judge him by his actions, not by his family’s past. But during his inauguration speech on June 30, he praised his father, the late dictator, saying he had achieved much more than previous administrations since gaining independence in 1946.\n\n“He got it done. Sometimes with needed support, sometimes without. So will it be with his son – you will get no excuses from me,” he said.\n\nDuring his speech, he also touched on the issue of revising learning materials in schools, but said he wasn’t talking about history.\n\nFerdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. takes the oath as the new President of the Philippines on June 30, 2022.

I am not talking about history, I am talking about the basics, the sciences, sharpening theoretical aptitude and imparting vocational skills,” he said.\n\nBut those assurances ring hollow for people who suffered under his father’s dictatorship, and others who are skeptical of the new Marcos leadership.\n\nOne indication of that is through book sales.\n\nAlmira Manduriao, head of marketing at the Ateneo de Manila University’s publishing press, said the rush for Philippine history books began soon after Marcos Jr. won the May 9 election.\n\n“People were suddenly fearful that literature critical of the dictatorship would be banned,” Manduriao said. “Hence, the need to buy and safeguard the books (when) they still can.”\n\nAt least 10 titles covering martial law and the dark past of the Marcos dictatorship remain sold out at the university press, according to Manduriao.\n\nSome of the bestsellers at the campus bookshop were in reprint – namely “Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos’ Crony Capitalism” by Ricardo Manapat, “The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos” by Primitivo Mijares and “Canal de la Reina” by Liwayway Arceo Bautista.\n\nThe book 'Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism' by Ricardo Manapat is among the popular titles at the Ateneo de Manila University Press. Courtesy Ateneo University Press\n\nOn May 11, Adarna House, a publishing house founded by Philippine artist Virgilo Almario, offered a 20% discount on a #NeverAgain Bundle of five book titles about the Marcos regime.\n\nIn the days that followed, sales went through the roof and the pre-order waitlist grew, and the company announced it might take as much as eight weeks for orders to be delivered.\n\nThe offer was a hit with customers, but it also attracted the attention of the government.\n\nAlex Paul Monteagudo, director general of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency, accused Adarna House of “radicalizing Filipino children.”\n\n“The Adarna Publishing House published these books and they are now on sale to subtly radicalize the Filipino children against our government, now!” he wrote on his official Facebook page on May 17.\n\nMonteagudo said in the post that when topics such as martial law and the People Power revolution – a nationwide uprising that overthrew the Marcos regime in 1986 – are taught in schools, it will “plant seeds of hatred and dissent in the minds of these children.”\n\nThe People Power revolution ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. in 1986. Alberto Marquez/AP\n\nAdarna House declined CNN’s request for comment on the claims.\n\nOne of Adarna’s customers, Vanessa Louie Cabacungan-Samaniego, who lives and works in Hong Kong, put in a group order for around a dozen Filipinos in the city for books on the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nShe told CNN she worries the election will allow the Marcos political clan to “work to clear their name and revise history books or target the media.”\n\n“Buying books to educate ourselves and the next generation is just our small way to fight against injustices,” she said, when the first batch of orders was delivered in June.\n\nPreserving the truth\n\nIn recent years, politicians and government officials have demonized publishers and journalists, denouncing their credibility on social media and in public statements.\n\nThe day before Marcos Jr. took office, Nobel laureate Maria Ressa said the government had ordered her news organization, Rappler, to shut down.\n\nShe said she’d been repeatedly harassed over the past six years and targeted by legal action over alleged libel, tax evasion and violation of foreign media ownership rules.\n\n“This is intimidation.

Starlight is the first beverage from Coca-Cola Creations, a new innovation platform.\n\nUnlike “cherry” or “vanilla,” it’s not immediately clear how “starlight” is supposed to taste. So Redditors who spotted images of the new product online a few months ago shared some theories about the new drink’s flavor. Some say they spotted the mysterious new product on retailer websites ahead of the official launch, slated for next week.\n\nOne guessed raspberry, because “a quick Google search says that space tastes like raspberries.” (Astronomers do think that the center of the galaxy may taste like raspberries and smell like rum, according to a 2009 Guardian article. Delicious! And not a bad idea for Coca-Cola, which is launching spiked versions of its drinks left and right.) More recently, a YouTuber who tried the product noted after-tastes of “chocolate [and] graham cracker.” That led another Redditor to guess that the flavor is “s’mores.”\n\nCoca-Cola Starlight is a new limited-time product. courtesy of Coca-Cola\n\nOn Thursday, Coca-Cola finally cleared up the mystery. Sort of. The company’s explanation is … well, see for yourself: Starlight is “inspired by space” has “notes reminiscent of stargazing around a campfire, as well as a cooling sensation that evokes the feeling of a cold journey to space,” the company said in a release.\n\nSo yeah, maybe s’mores?\n\nAlso, it’s red. Or in the company’s words, “Coca-Cola Starlight combines great Coca-Cola taste with a dash of the unexpected, including a reddish hue.”\n\nTo this reporter, after tasting a sample of the zero-sugar version provided by the company, that last sentence just about sums it up. The beverage did not taste like space travel or sitting around a campfire. It did, however, taste like a sweeter version of Coca-Cola. And it is definitely red.\n\nStarlight is getting the full Coca-Cola Creations promotional treatment, which includes a digital marketing campaign featuring pop singer Ava Max.\n\nCoke’s new marketing strategy\n\nLast year, Coca-Cola launched a new brand platform called “Real Magic.” The idea is to take a slightly different approach to marketing Coke — one that tries to reach new consumers by focusing on gaming and music, among other things. Coca-Cola Creations, which will introduce new limited-time “products and experiences across physical and digital worlds,” is part of that platform.\n\n“When we launched ‘Real Magic,’ we wanted to connect with and celebrate the experiences that bring joy to young people today, and that has taken us to an exciting new territory,” Oana Vlad, senior director of global brand strategy at Coca-Cola, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nFor Coca-Cola, reaching young consumers is essential because interest in soft drinks has been declining for years. Exciting new campaigns and mysterious products could be a way to get potential new customers to pay attention.\n\nSo what does that entail? In the case of Starlight, it means a holographic concert by Ava Max, who has also performed in the gaming platform Roblox. The concert can be accessed via a QR code on the Starlight label. Plus, the sparkly packaging and that reddish hue.\n\nBut not everything about Starlight is new. It’s also a nod to when Coca-Cola actually sent a can of Coke to space in the 1980s.

The deal caps off a stunning news cycle in which the Tesla and SpaceX CEO became one of Twitter’s largest shareholders, was offered and turned down a seat on its board and bid to buy the company — all in less than a month — and puts the world’s richest man in charge of one of the most influential social networks. It also raises big questions about how Musk’s proposed changes for the platform, including loosening content restrictions, will take shape.\n\nAgrawal, who has been in charge of Twitter for only four months, told employees not to expect big changes before the deal closes, which is set to happen before the end of this year. He also said that “there are no plans for any layoffs at this point” and that Twitter’s remote work policies will continue until the deal closes.\n\n“Between now and closing … we will continue making decisions as we’ve always had, guided by the principles we’ve had,” he said. “That doesn’t mean things won’t change, things have been changing … I have been talking about driving positive change at the company, and I will continue doing so because it makes us better and it makes us stronger. Once the deal closes, different decisions might be made.”\n\nAgrawal said that Twitter’s leadership would seek to find time for employees to ask questions directly of Musk. He added that he expects to spend time with Musk and will tell the billionaire about the principles that have guided Twitter’s decisions.\n\nIn response to the question about whether Trump’s account — which was removed from Twitter early last year for violating its policies on inciting violence following the Capitol Riot — would be restored on the platform, Agrawal told staff that is something they should ask Musk and said, “once the deal closes, we will know what direction the platform will go.”\n\nOne employee asked what Musk’s takeover could mean for Twitter’s “commitment to responsible, ethical” artificial intelligence and machine learning, saying, “we’ve been viewed as industry leaders in this field and have attracted some of the field’s best and brightest minds, but it would seem that new ownership’s values are not in alignment.”\n\nAgrawal called such work “critical for Twitter to be able to serve our customers” and said “we need to continue doing that work.”\n\nOther employees asked what Musk’s takeover could mean for employee retention and attrition. The deal comes at a time when there is already heightened competition for talent in the labor market, especially in the tech industry.\n\n“This is indeed a period of uncertainty,” Agrawal said. “All of you have different feelings and views about this news, many of you are concerned, some of you are excited, many people here are waiting to understand how this goes and have an open mind … If we work with each other, we will not have to worry about losing the core of what makes Twitter powerful, which is all of us working together in the interest of our customers every day.”\n\nLater in the call, Agrawal said he was “optimistic” about the future of the company.\n\n“The way I think about what he has said … he wants Twitter to be a powerful, positive force in the world, just like all of us,” Agrawal said.\n\nFor his part, Musk said in a statement Monday that, “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.” He added that, “Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/business/coca-cola-new-flavor/index.html", "title": "Coke's latest bizarre flavor is here | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nCoca-Cola’s latest experimental, limited-time flavor is here.

Creations is a way for Coca-Cola to shine a spotlight on its core product, while trying to bring gamers and younger audiences into the fold.\n\nA few years ago, Coca-Cola cut its portfolio in half, ditching beloved products like Tab.

The third item, which launched earlier this summer, had a more traditional strawberry and watermelon flavor. While it didn’t have a mysterious-sounding flavor, it was developed in collaboration with Marshmello, a Grammy-nominated DJ and electronic music producer, and marked the first time the beverage company created a drink with an artist.\n\nEach Coca-Cola Creations flavor is launched along with a specialized online experience, and Dreamworld is no exception.\n\nDreamworld cans and bottles come with QR codes that provide access to a virtual, augmented-reality “music experience,” where people can listen to music from a DJ avatar and play games.

The $5.99 price gets you five bone-in wings that are coated in a queso seasoning and served with a spicy ranch dipping sauce.\n\nTaco Bell wings are only being sold for a week. Taco Bell\n\nLike many fast food promotions, the wings were always intended to be a limited time offer. The industry’s chains constantly tweak their menus with niche and oddball products that drum up excitement and social media attention. These specialty offerings are a way to cut through the noise.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) is the biggest proponent of the practice, with the McRib being sold in the fall, Filet-O-Fish and Shamrock Shakes appearing on menus in February and its McFlurry lineup constantly getting refreshed. And Starbucks (SBUX) has created a nationwide phenomenon with the annual release of its red-colored cups and complimentary seasonal menu during the holidays.\n\nLimited-time items are an important marketing tool for the food industry to draw in foot traffic and interest, according to Alexander Chernev, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.\n\n“When you have these exclusive products, which exist for a short period of time, it gives people a reason to come to the store,” Chernev previously told CNN Business.\n\nThese items offer consumers some variety — key for fast food, as it’s a notoriously thin-margin business with little customer loyalty. Offering something new gives people a reason to come back.\n\n“You need consistency because that’s the brand mantra,” said Chernev. “But no matter how much you like something, consuming something different increases the enjoyment of what you consumed before.”\n\nThere is a basic tenet of supply-and-demand economics behind limited-time releases, too: Scarcity can build hype. “It’s a way to create excitement for the menu,” R.J. Hottovy, a former consumer strategist for Morningstar, previously told CNN Business.\n\nAlso, the limited-time items can help chains experiment with a new food before launching it nationwide. Chipotle (CMG) commonly does that with a practice it calls a “stage-gate process.”\n\nThat’s what Chipotle did with its smoked brisket meat before taking it nationwide last September, a process it has also used for plant-based chorizo, riced cauliflower, carne asada and its popular quesadilla.\n\n-— CNN Business’ Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.\n\n-— An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed an item in a list of food the company was offering nationwide last year.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/business/kanye-west-ye-billionaire/index.html", "title": "Kanye West no longer a billionaire | CNN Business", "text": "1.

She passed away peacefully at hospital this morning, Wednesday, November 30th 2022, following a short illness,” the statement reads. “She was in the company of her family.”\n\nThe statement went on to read: “We kindly ask that you respect the family’s privacy at this extremely painful time, and we would like everyone to keep Christine in their hearts and remember the life of an incredible human being, and revered musician who was loved universally.”\n\nFleetwood Mac paid tribute to McVie in a statement, which was also posted on her account.\n\n“There are no words to describe our sadness at the passing of Christine McVie,” the band’s statement read. “She was truly one-of-a-kind, special and talented beyond measure. She was the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life.”\n\nBorn in Greenodd in the United Kingdom to a father who was a music teacher, McVie was a classically trained musician who performed under the name Christine Perfect with the British band Chicken Shack in the late 1960s.\n\nShe linked up with Fleetwood Mac after marrying its bass guitarist, John McVie, at a time when the band was being led by guitarist and founder Peter Green.\n\n“Chicken Shack used to open for [Fleetwood Mac],” she told The Guardian in June 2022. “I got to know John, fell in love with him and it was just sensational and exciting. Fleetwood Mac were fantastic and really funny.”\n\nThe group underwent several member changes before Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined in 1974 and the band shot to super stardom.\n\nMcVie wrote and/or sang several of their hits including “Don’t Stop,” “Over My Head,” “You Make Loving Fun” and “Say You Love Me.”\n\nFleetwood Mac underwent some instability with both the ending of the McVies’ marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks’ personal relationship.\n\nBuckingham opted to leave the band and go solo in 1987, followed by Nicks who went solo in 1990.\n\nMcVie also went solo and earlier this year released a compilation of her solo work titled “Songbird (A Solo Collection).”\n\nBut despite the band’s interpersonal struggles, their musical chemistry was undeniable and they did eventually reunite.\n\n“I just wanted to embrace being in the English countryside and not have to troop around on the road. I moved to Kent, and I loved being able to walk around the streets, nobody knowing who I was. Then of course I started to miss it,” McVie told The Guardian about her 16 year hiatus from Fleetwood Mac. “I called Mick and asked: ‘How would you feel about me coming back to the band?’ He got in touch with everybody and we had a band meeting over the phone and they all went: ‘Come baaaack!!’ I felt regenerated and I felt like writing again.”\n\nFleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nHonoring a ‘sweet soul’\n\nTributes for McVie poured in to social media on Wednesday.\n\n“We were so lucky to have a life with her,” Fleetwood Mac said in their statement. “Individually and together, we cherished Christine deeply and are thankful for the amazing memories we have. She will be so very missed.”\n\nNicks, meanwhile, shared a handwritten letter to her bandmate on Instagram, along with a photo of herself with McVie. “A few hours ago I was told that my best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975, had passed away. I didn’t even know she was ill… until late Saturday night.”\n\nNicks said since learning of McVie’s illness, the song “Hallelujah” by Haim, a folksy ballad about friendship and loss, has been “swirling around” in her head. “I thought I might possibly get to sing it to her, and so, I’m singing it to her now.”\n\nAnn Wilson, of the band Heart, told CNN in a statement: “Christine was a gem.

That the song hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Rock Digital Song Sales chart in October is testament to its generational pull.\n\nChristine McVie: Fleetwood Mac singer and songwriter dies at 79 after 'a short illness'\n\n'Hold Me’ (1982)\n\nSharing lead vocals with Buckingham, McVie offers a come-hither alternative to Buckingham’s bitterness – you can nearly hear him spit the “I’m the fool paying the dues” line – while Nicks’ contributions on the chorus showcase the magic of Mac. Buckingham’s singsong guitar solo is also a memorable beauty.\n\n'Be kind to each other':Emotional Elton John bids America farewell from Dodger Stadium\n\n‘You Make Loving Fun’ (1977)\n\nA rubbery groove leads into the succinct opening, “Sweet wonderful you/ You make me happy with the things you do,” and from there, listeners are engaged in this swoony tale of a woman who has discovered – or at least thinks she has – the kind of love that conjures images of rainbows and sunshine. The song was inspired by McVie’s affair with Fleetwood Mac’s lighting director at the time. To mitigate awkwardness while touring, McVie reportedly told John McVie it was about her dog.\n\n'Beautiful genius': Irene Cara, Oscar-winning 'Flashdance' singer and actress, dies at 63\n\n‘Don’t Stop’ (1977)\n\nFamously co-opted by Bill Clinton during his 1992 presidential campaign, the anthem of hopefulness with its message of “yesterday’s gone” – which McVie says she wrote after separating from John McVie – continues to be played at political rallies and graduations. McVie shares lead vocals with Buckingham again, and over a chugging rhythm, both urgently push the lesson that tomorrow “will be better than before.”\n\n‘Songbird’ (1977)\n\nConsidered McVie’s signature for good reason, the piano ballad is striking and sparse in its beauty. Her voice pure and faultless as she sings what is part heartbreaking farewell (“I wish you all the love in the world”) and romantic paean (“And the songbirds are singing, like they know the score”). Fleetwood Mac typically stationed McVie in the spotlight at the end of their concerts to leave the audience with this unpretentious creation of musical magic.\n\n'Guess I'm a rock star now': Dolly Parton joins Eminem, Duran Duran in Rock & Roll Hall of Fame", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/11/30/christine-mcvie-fleetwood-mac-tributes-stevie-nicks-duran-duran-eagles/10806557002/", "title": "Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac dies: Stevie Nicks, more pay tribute", "text": "A broad range of rockers took to social media to express their sorrow over the death of Christine McVie, co-singer, keyboardist and critical songwriter of Fleetwood Mac.\n\nThe 79-year-old “passed away peacefully at (the) hospital following a short illness,\" according to a statement posted to the singer's Facebook page on Wednesday.\n\nMcVie's bandmate Stevie Nicks posted photos of a handwritten tribute in which she called McVie her \"best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975,\" when Nicks and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham joined the long-running British rock group.\n\nFounding member Mick Fleetwood wrote that part of his heart \"has flown away today, I will miss everything about you Christine McVie.\"\n\nThe members of the Eagles released a statement saying McVie was a \"vibrant, soulful spirit, and her music was, and will remain, a gift to the world.

Following Fleetwood Mac’s 1990 Behind the Mask tour, McVie decided to stop touring with Fleetwood Mac, even though she remained a member of the band and continued to write songs for their records.\n\nAlong with Fleetwood Mac, McVie was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nShortly after their induction, the musician/singer took a lengthy reprieve from Fleetwood Mac – which she attributed to her fear of flying and panic attacks about performing – to live in the English countryside. She rejoined the band in 2014 for its On With the Show tour and returned to the stage with the Buckingham-less group in 2018 and 2019 for a worldwide run on the band’s most recent tour, An Evening With Fleetwood Mac.\n\nMcVie told Rolling Stone that during her time away from the band, she “enjoyed having my dogs, living in the country, going for long walks. I just wasn’t interested in playing music at that point.” She added that after she decided to return to Fleetwood Mac, she “never regretted it.”\n\nBorn Christine Perfect in Lancashire, England, on July 12, 1943, McVie was introduced to music at an early age, as her father, Cyril, was a concert violinist and college music teacher. Her grandfather was an organist at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThough McVie’s musical journey was initially steeped in classical music, hearing the songs of Fats Domino and The Everly Brothers shifted her focus to rock ’n’ roll.\n\nHer early band, the blues-based Chicken Shack, had a hit in the U.K. in 1969 with the blues staple “I’d Rather Go Blind.” That same year, she married John McVie, already the bassist for the similarly blues-rooted Fleetwood Mac.\n\n'Guess I'm a rock star now':Dolly Parton joins Eminem, Duran Duran in Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nLong a fan of the Peter Green-era of Fleetwood Mac – Christine played piano on the band’s second album, “Mr. Wonderful” – she officially joined the group in 1970 during a transitional period.\n\nAfter a few years of a rotating cast of musicians, the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks in 1975 kickstarted the commercial success of Fleetwood Mac, spearheaded by Christine-penned songs, “Over My Head” and “Say You Love Me,” on which she also sang lead vocals.\n\nThe intra-band drama of Fleetwood Mac has become legendary in the annals of pop music and much of it is documented in the band’s landmark 1977 album, “Rumours.” By then, a combination of drugs and fractured relationships – Buckingham and Nicks’ romantic tumult, the McVies' divorce – threatened to unravel the group.

When Nicks was added to the lineup in 1975, the two became fast friends.\n\nTheirs was not a competitive relationship, but a sisterly one – both women were gifted songwriters responsible for crafting many of the band’s best-known tunes. Though the two grew apart in the 1980s amid Nicks’ worsening drug addiction and the band’s growing internal tension, they came back together when McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac in 2014.\n\nAt a concert in London, shortly before McVie officially rejoined the band, Nicks dedicated the song “Landslide” to her “mentor. Big sister. Best friend.” And at the show’s end, McVie was there, accompanying her bandmates for “Don’t Stop.”\n\n“I never want her to ever go out of my life again, and that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with her and I as friends,” Nicks told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.\n\nOn Wednesday, McVie, the band’s “songbird,” died after a brief illness at age 79. Below, revisit McVie’s and Nicks’ years-long relationship as bandmates, best friends and “sisters.”\n\nMcVie and Nicks hit it off from the start\n\nThe story of Nicks joining Fleetwood Mac is legend now: Band founder and drummer Mick Fleetwood wanted to recruit guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, who stipulated that he would only join if his girlfriend and musician Nicks could join, too. McVie cast the deciding vote, and the rest is history.\n\n“It was critical that I got on with her because I’d never played with another girl,” McVie told the Guardian in 2013. “But I liked her instantly. She was funny and nice but also there was no competition. We were completely different on the stage to each other and we wrote differently too.”\n\nChristine McVie and Stevie Nicks were fast friends when Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac, protecting each other in a male-dominated industry. Aaron Rapoport/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nThroughout the band’s many personal complications – McVie married and divorced Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie and had an affair with the band’s lighting director, while Nicks had rollercoaster romances with Buckingham and Fleetwood – they were each other’s center.\n\n“To be in a band with another girl who was this amazing musician – (McVie) kind of instantly became my best friend,” Nicks told the New Yorker earlier this year. “Christine was a whole other ballgame. She liked hanging out with the guys. She was just more comfortable with men than I had ever been.”\n\nThe two protected each other, Nicks said, in a male-dominated industry: “We made a pact, in the very beginning, that we would never be treated with disrespect by all the male musicians in the community.\n\n“I would say to her, ‘Together, we are a serious force of nature, and it will give us the strength to maneuver the waters that are ahead of us,’” Nicks told the New Yorker.\n\nThe band succeeds but McVie and Nicks grow distant\n\n“Rumours” was the band’s greatest success to date when it was released in 1977. But the band’s relationships with each other were deteriorating, save for the one between McVie and Nicks. While the pair were enduring breakups with their significant others, Nicks and McVie spent their time offstage together.\n\nThe Guardian asked McVie if she was trying to offset the band’s tumult with her songs on “Rumours,” including the lighthearted “You Make Lovin’ Fun” and optimistic “Don’t Stop.” She said she likely had been.\n\nAs multiple members’ drug use intensified, the band’s dynamic grew tense. McVie distanced herself from the group in 1984 amid her bandmates’ addictions, telling the Guardian she was “just sick of it.” Nicks, meanwhile, was becoming dependent on cocaine.\n\nAfter Fleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, Christine McVie (third from left) quit the band. Jon Levy/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMcVie told Rolling Stone that year that she’d grown apart from Nicks: “She seems to have developed her own fantasy world, somehow, which I’m not part of. We don’t socialize much.”\n\nIn 1986, Nicks checked into the Betty Ford Center to treat her addiction, though she later became addicted to Klonopin, which she said claimed years of her life. She quit the prescription drug in the 1990s.\n\nAfter recording some solo works, McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac for their 1987 album “Tango in the Night,” and two of her songs on that record – “Little Lies” and “Everywhere” – became major hits. But Nicks departed the band soon after, and the band’s best-known lineup wouldn’t officially reunite until 1997 for “The Dance” tour and subsequent live album.\n\nThe reunion was short-lived: After the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, McVie officially quit Fleetwood Mac, citing a fear of flying and exhaustion of life on the road.\n\nMcVie returns to Fleetwood Mac – and to Nicks’ side\n\nIn the 2010s, after more than a decade of retirement, McVie toyed with returning to performing. She officially rejoined Fleetwood Mac after calling Fleetwood himself and gauging what her return would mean for the group.\n\n“Fortunately Stevie was dying for me to come back, as were the rest of the band,” she told the Arts Desk.\n\nIn 2015, a year after she’d rejoined Fleetwood Mac, McVie hit the road with her bandmates. Touring with the group was tiring but fun, the first time they’d performed together in years.\n\n“I’m only here for Stevie,” she told the New Yorker that year.\n\nChristine McVie (left) and Stevie Nicks perform together at Radio City Music Hall in 2018. Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\nNicks concurred: “When we went on the road, I realized what an amazing friend she’d been of mine that I had lost and didn’t realize the whole consequences of it till now,” she told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.\n\nDuring that tour, McVie wore a silver chain that Nicks had given her – a “metaphor,” McVie told the New Yorker, “that the chain of the band will never be broken. Not by me, anyways. Not again by me.”\n\nMcVie told the Arts Desk in 2016 that she and Nicks were “better friends now than (they) were 16 years ago.”\n\nTouring with Buckingham and Fleetwood could quickly get tumultuous for Nicks, McVie said, due to their shared history. “But with me in there, it gave Stevie the chance to get her breath back and not have this constant thing going on with Lindsey: her sister was back,” she said.\n\nTheir mutual praise continued: In 2019, McVie said Nicks was “just unbelievable” onstage: “The more I see her perform on stage the better I think she is. She holds the fort.”\n\nWhen their 2018-2019 tour ended, though – without Buckingham, who was fired – the band “kind of broke up,” McVie told Rolling Stone earlier this year. She added that she didn’t speak with Nicks as often as she did when they toured together.\n\nAs for a reunion, McVie told Rolling Stone that while it wasn’t off the table, she wasn’t feeling “physically up for it.”\n\n“I’m getting a bit long in the teeth here,” she said. “I’m quite happy being at home. I don’t know if I ever want to tour again. It’s bloody hard work.”\n\nNicks remembers her ‘best friend’ McVie\n\nNews of McVie’s death rattled Nicks, who wrote that she had only found out McVie was sick days earlier. She called McVie her “best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975.”\n\nOn her social media accounts, Nicks shared a handwritten note containing lyrics from the Haim song “Hallelujah,” some of which discusses grief and the loss of a best friend.\n\n“See you on the other side, my love,” Nicks wrote. “Don’t forget me – Always, Stevie.”", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/01/11/star-wars-brian-wood-comic-book-series/1827769/", "title": "Who's the Bossk? Brian Wood revels in 'Star Wars' world", "text": "Brian Truitt, USA TODAY\n\nNew Star Wars comic is set between the original film and The Empire Strikes Back\n\nPrincess Leia%2C Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are at a crossroads when the series opens\n\nWriter Brian Wood%27s personal nerd input%3F An appearance from reptilian bounty hunter Bossk\n\nWolverine and the X-Men doesn't do much for Brian Wood's father-in-law.\n\nHan Solo and the Rebel Alliance, though? Now he's interested.\n\nHe can access those guys, says Wood, who launched his Star Wars comic-book series this week for Dark Horse Comics. \"Not only these characters but that storyline of those original films is so deep in our culture. Everybody knows it.\"\n\nWhile Star Wars as a pop-culture franchise has grown far beyond the original 1977 movie, that is the era Wood returns to — and is his favorite — in the new book with artist Carlos D'Anda that debuted this week. And it's already an Endor-sized hit with fans — the first issue sold out within 24 hours of hitting comic shops Wednesday. (Can't find it? You can always get it online via the Dark Horse app.)\n\nWood catches up with Han, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia a week or so after the Rebels blew up the Imperial Death Star, which has led to the Emperor showing Darth Vader a little bit of his own dark side while chewing him out.\n\nLeia is tasked by Mon Mothma to head up a stealth team of X-Wing Fighter pilots to find a suitable planet for a Rebel base and to hide out from the Empire, but many find themselves at a crossroads.\n\n\"Wedge is probably suffering from survivor's guilt being the only one of his squadron to make it back\" from the run on the Death Star, Wood explains. \"Han hasn't lost on the same scale, but the Empire totally knows who he is now so he's lost a lot of freedom, and that's really what that guys' entire life has been about: moving around and doing his thing, and now he has a giant target painted on him.\n\n\"Everybody's dealing with that,\" the writer adds, \"and Leia the most, which is why I have her as the focus of the story. She's pretty much lost everything — she's like a kid, basically. And top of all that, she's like the figurehead of the rebellion. She has all this responsibility and everybody expecting leadership out of her. I find that to be really juicy stuff to write about.\"\n\nThey're all in a weird place because not only do they have to worry about their future, they have another concern: the Empire is still out there in the galaxy and building another Death Star.\n\nWhile fans don't see the second one until the third Star Wars movie, Return of the Jedi, Wood has construction already underway in his comic.\n\n\"It's established that these things take a couple of decades to build,\" he says.\n\n\"I sort of like the idea that the Emperor is already building a second one as a backup or a secret one. That old joke about government spending: Why build one when you can build two at twice the price?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vader's in the Emperor's dog house and he's been demoted in favor of an ambitious new Imperial officer named Colonel Bircher. Vader literally had his finger on the trigger of his TIE Fighter and couldn't hit Luke before one well-placed, Force-powered missile led to the Death Star exploding.\n\nWood's enjoyed exploring the relationship between Vader and the rest of the Empire because he had a hard time with the Sith lord in black at first in finding his voice.\n\n\"He's such a villain and he's almost like a two-dimensional villain. He's pure bad,\" he says. \"What do you do with this guy? All he does is walk around and kill people. So I was trying to find a way into his character to give him a journey to go on.\n\n\"Even though the Empire can absorb a loss a lot better than the Rebels can, they still lost an awful lot. Someone's gotta pay, there has to be fallout, and it's Vader.\"\n\nOne inconsistency that has annoyed Wood since he saw the original trilogy as a kid is how Vader doesn't know who Luke is in the first film, and by the second, The Empire Strikes Back, he's telling Luke that he's his father in the biggest paternity-test reveal in cinematic history.\n\nFor his part, Wood will be filling in the blanks on how Vader comes to that memorable conclusion.\n\n\"Obviously something happened there. You don't need to know how he found all that out to enjoy the film but this is a chance to give some context there,\" Wood says.\n\n\"That's heavily preying on Vader's mind. The Force is strong in this one. Luke blows up the Death Star, and now he's taking flak for it. He's going to want to find out why that happened.\"\n\nThe writer admits he's had to remain wary of penning the adventures of characters who change between the end of Star Wars and the beginning of Empire, plus events that happen much later in Return of the Jedi.\n\nFor example, Luke and Leia don't know they're twins, \"and they're kissing each other on the mouth multiple times, but the reader knows,\" Wood says. \"Obviously I can't go there — I can't keep that physical romance going because that's just gross.\"\n\nWhile he likes walking that line, \"I can't break continuity,\" he adds. \"It all has to match up. This story will eventually connect to Empire so I have to make sure I don't break anything. But I am given a lot of freedom as long as I don't break anything.\"\n\nWood is bringing in a whole bunch of new X-Wing pilots, but he also has a pretty big cast of characters who many fans had toys of back in the day. In addition to Luke, Leia, Han, the Emperor and Vader, Han's Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca plays a major role, Obi-Wan Kenobi's ghostly voice still appears to Luke, and bounty hunters Boba Fett and Bossk are up to no good.\n\n\"Bossk is kind of a favorite of mine,\" Wood says of the reptilian baddie who has a toe-wrinkling cameo in The Empire Strikes Back. \"He looks so cheap in the film, like such obviously a guy in a rubber costume, and I love it. But he also has that great ship called the Hound's Tooth, which is an awesome name and it looks cool.\n\n\"That's my one personal nerd input. I put Bossk in there really randomly.\"\n\nWhat's most appealing to Wood about Star Wars is that, unlike Star Trek, it's less about science fiction, tech and nebulas in space and more concerned with great human drama.\n\n\"It's all based on the hero's myth first. That's why I can connect to it now as a 35-year-long fan. That kind of stuff is timeless when it's done right,\" says the writer, who's constantly amazed by the range of fans, from 3-year-old kids to grandparents in costume at conventions.\n\n\"There's no comic that holds onto its fans like that. There's nothing in comics that would keep fans that enthused for their entire life, for 30 years, to the point where you're 70 years old and you want to dress up as a Jedi.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/2022-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "2022 In Review Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere is a look back at the events of 2022.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJanuary 3 - The US Food and Drug Administration expands the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine boosters to children ages 12 to 15.

In fact, he wasn't always Saul Goodman.\n\nViewers will learn about the earlier Saul — make that Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) — when AMC's Better Call Saul premieres Feb. 8 (10 p.m. ET/PT), following the midseason return of The Walking Dead (9 p.m. ET/PT). Saul will move into its regular Monday time slot (10 pm. ET/PT) the following night.\n\nFamiliar Bad faces will pop up in the prequel series, as fans find out how part of the constellation of characters who populated the Emmy-winning series met.\n\n\"Walt and Jesse don't show up in Season 1, but everything else is on the table,\" executive producer Vince Gilligan said, adding that Jesse, played by Aaron Paul in Bad, likely would have been in middle school when the new show begins.\n\nSaul starts six years before Bad, with Jimmy a much different person, a struggling Albuquerque lawyer who would like to do the right thing. He's desperate to find business and also is looking out for his older brother, Chuck (Michael McKean), who is on a leave from his law firm.\n\n\"You're remembering what a slippery, two-faced, unethical guy Saul was on Breaking Bad,\" Bad creator Gilligan told writers at the Television Critics Association winter press tour on Saturday. \"That was not the guy we're starting with.\"\n\nGilligan, who is producing Saul with Bad writer Peter Gould, added: \"I think Saul wants to be (good) but he also wants to cut corners when he can.\"\n\nOdenkirk says Saul will go into more detail about the title character, who was the shady lawyer for Bryan Cranston's Walter White in Bad. \"He's a different guy\" in Saul, he says. \"The guy you're going to meet in this show is a far more dimensional character than Saul.\"\n\nIntroduction of recognizable characters will have to make sense for the story, Gilligan said. \"We need to be as organic as possible. We need to have the story and characters dictate for us where to go. ... If it feels like a stunt, we have done something horribly wrong.\"\n\nJonathan Banks, who played Mike Erhmantraut in Bad, is a series regular, playing Saul's fixer. Others include Rhea Seehorn and Patrick Fabian, who play lawyers at Chuck's firm, and Michael Mando as Nacho Varga, a budding crime boss.\n\nGilligan acknowledged some anxiety about doing a prequel of such a revered hit. \"I had hopes and dreams. I feel so good about this show right now, but I don't think I necessarily did until the writing was over and we were in the editing room,\" he said. \"Not until I could see these wonderful actors embody these characters.\"\n\nSaul's first season consists of 10 episodes and a second season of 13 episodes has been ordered.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/10"}]}
