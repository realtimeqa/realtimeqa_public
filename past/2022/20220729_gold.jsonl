Kamau Bell” heads to California to discover how communities are learning to coexist with the frequent destruction. The Original Series airs Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nCNN —\n\nCalifornia’s Oak Fire has burned through more than 18,000 acres and destroyed more than 40 structures since it ignited near Yosemite National Park Friday, as fire crews in the air battle visibility issues and personnel on the ground work steep terrain.\n\nThe fire grew only slightly Tuesday – to 18,532 acres and containment remained at 26%, according to an update from state fire management agency Cal Fire.\n\n“Although good progress continues on the fire, there is much work to be done,” the update said. Officials said several evacuation orders had been changed to fire advisements.\n\nSome areas are not accessible to bulldozers so crews on foot cut in a fire line, and smoke from the fire hampered the response from the 24 helicopter units involved.\n\nOne firefighter stood Wednesday morning by a spot where they had been able to stop the flames from advancing.\n\n“For the past two days what we’ve been doing is coming back with hoes and … hand tools. We dig out all the smokes and hot spots to make sure that nothing ends up on … the green side (where vegetation wasn’t burned),” firefighter Travis Gooch told CNN’s Adrienne Broaddus. “It’s kind of a relief that everything is kind of looking like it’s holding up the way it’s supposed to.”\n\nGooch, who is from Manteca, said he and his team work overnight and slept for about an hour on their firetrucks.\n\n“The first night we were here, no one slept,” he said. “So, last night to get to sleep for an hour. It was nice. Everyone is looking forward to going back to camp and getting to sleep for today.”\n\nThere have been no firefighter injuries reported since the blaze began, the cause of which is under investigation.\n\nA total of 42 single residence structures and 19 outbuildings have been destroyed in the fire, the update said.\n\nMore than 1,100 structures remain threatened.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Cal Fire officials said in the overnight incident report: “Fire crews continue providing structure defense, extinguishing hot spots, and building and improving direct lines. Persistent drought, critically dry fuels, and tree mortality continue to contribute to the fire’s spread.”\n\nFirefighters mop up hot spots while battling the Oak Fire in the Jerseydale community of Mariposa County, California, on Monday, July 25.

Tracy Barbutes/Reuters Prev Next\n\nMore than 3,000 personnel are tackling the fire, deploying air and land efforts including two dozen helicopters, 286 fire engines, 68 water tenders and 94 bulldozers, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe challenging terrain and abundant dry vegetation fueling the fire has complicated efforts to tamp down its growth, Cal Fire spokesperson Cpt. Keith Wade told CNN Monday.\n\n“The footprint out here, the acreage of available fuels to burn when the fire gets going, along with the available topography – the canyons, the drainages – the wind that flows through these areas, can make the fire behavior erratic and it can explode … the ferociousness of that fire at times can be intense,” Wade said.\n\nThe Oak Fire is the largest of California’s fire season so far, Cal Fire data shows. But it remains relatively small compared to other California wildfires in recent years: It’s dwarfed, for example, by blazes like last year’s Dixie Fire, which consumed more than 960,000 acres, or the August Complex Fire the year prior that scorched more than a million acres – the state’s largest ever.\n\nThere have been 23 wildfires in California so far this month, according to Cal Fire, but only three have exceeded 500 acres. None have come close to the mass destruction of the Oak Fire, due in part to the exceedingly dry conditions in the area, Wade said.\n\nFirefighters mop up hot spots while battling California's Oak Fire. Noah Berger/Associated Press\n\n“I think the real difference that firefighters are experiencing on this one is how dry everything is, it’s definitely been (drier) as the years have been going on,” he said. “We’ve noticed that there seems to be less precipitation, less moisture and the available fuel load is definitely out there.”\n\nThe fire’s rapid growth has also made evacuation efforts more difficult, Cal Fire Battalion Chief Jon Heggie told CNN on Monday, noting officials and law enforcement are doing their best to notify residents when they need to leave.\n\n“The reality is, it’s moving so quickly, it’s not giving people a lot of time and they are sometimes just going to have to evacuate with the shirts on their back,” Heggie said.\n\nThe incremental progress made by fire crews has allowed officials to reduce evacuation orders in some areas to fire advisements, Cal Fire said.\n\nAn evacuation shelter has been set up at Mariposa Elementary School for displaced residents.\n\nMariposa County has been under a state of emergency since Saturday, when Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the proclamation.\n\nSouthern California fire officials have been expecting this summer to bring an especially challenging fire season due to the increased frequency of wildfires and the dry, hot conditions in much of the state.\n\nFirefighters work to contain hot spots from the Oak Fire, which began burning Friday. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nHeggie attributed the Oak Fire’s “velocity and intensity” to the state’s prolonged drought and human-caused climate change.\n\n“What I can tell you is this is a direct result of what is climate change,” he said. “You can’t have a 10-year drought in California and expect things to be the same. And we are now paying the price for that 10-year drought and that climate change.”\n\nCalifornia is among the western states that have been suffering under a prolonged megadrought that has been heavily exacerbated by the climate crisis.\n\n“That dead fuel that’s a result from that climate change and that drought is what’s driving these, what we are now calling, ‘mega fires,’” Heggie said.\n\nIt’s not just the Western US dealing with extreme fire conditions. Wildfires around the globe have intensified and become more commonplace, according to a report from the UN Environment Programme. The report’s analysis found the number of extreme wildfire events will increase by 30% by 2050.\n\nThe report suggested it’s time we “learn to live with fire,” urging authorities and policymakers to cooperate with local communities to use Indigenous knowledge and invest in planning and prevention efforts.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe Steve Almasy", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Steve Almasy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}]}
{"question_id": "20220729_2", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/student-loan-payment-pause-extension/index.html", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWith just over five weeks to go before federal student loan payments are set to restart after a yearslong pandemic pause, the Biden administration has yet to decide whether to push back the expiration date – again.\n\nAnother delay would be the seventh time the date has been rescheduled since the pause on payments and freeze on interest was put into place in March 2020.\n\n“The Department of Education will continue to assess the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economy on student loan borrowers,” wrote a spokesperson in an email to CNN Monday evening, adding that the agency will “communicate directly with borrowers about the end of the payment pause when a decision is made.”\n\nThe payment pause was meant to offer some temporary financial relief to those coping with the loss of income due to the pandemic. But each time payments were set to resume, either the Trump or Biden administration pushed back the expiration date.\n\nCurrently, payments are set to resume after August 31 – a couple of months before the midterm elections. Democrats are scrambling to try to avoid losing the party’s majority in Congress.\n\nWhen can borrowers expect a decision to be made?\n\nBorrowers may learn of an extension this week if the administration acts similarly to the last time it extended the payment pause. In April, the announcement came 24 days before payments were set to resume on May 1.\n\nIn the meantime, student loan servicers say they have been told by the Department of Education to hold off sending out billing statements, according to Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a nonprofit trade group whose members are responsible for servicing over 95% of all federal student loans.\n\nThe news was first reported by Inside Higher Ed last week.\n\n“We’ve basically been told to hold off sending out billing statements until at least 30 days prior to the resumption,” Buchanan told CNN.\n\nStudent loan servicers are contracted by the federal government to collect on federal student loans. They are required to send billing statements out at least 21 days before a payment is due. But typically, servicers send out those statements more than 30 days in advance.\n\nHow borrowers can prepare\n\nIt’s been more than two years since most borrowers have had to make payments on their federal student loans.\n\nWhen the payments finally resume, borrowers should still be in the same payment plan as they were before the pandemic and the amount due should, for most people, be the same.\n\nBut if a borrower is worried about affording the monthly payment, he or she can call the loan servicer now to enroll in a different payment plan. Those who may have lost income over the past two years may be eligible for a lower monthly payment than they were before the pandemic.\n\nServicers will also request that borrowers confirm that they want to continue to have their payments automatically debited from their accounts. If a borrower does not confirm that he or she wants those to resume, auto debit will not turn on once payments resume.\n\nBuchanan is encouraging borrowers who have questions to reach out to their loan servicers today, rather than wait until payments resume.\n\n“If they wait to call until the day payments actually resume, they may be on hold for a very long time,” Buchanan said.\n\nMillions of borrowers may also have a new loan servicer after several of the companies ended their contracts with the federal government during the past two years. Borrowers should have received notices from both their old servicer and their new servicer if a loan was transferred. The transfer does not affect the existing terms, conditions, interest rates, loan discharge or forgiveness programs, or available repayment plans on the loans.\n\nLoans serviced by Navient were transferred to Aidvantage, and loans that were serviced by Granite State were transferred to Edfinancial Services. Borrowers who have been serviced by FedLoan and are seeking debt relief from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program are currently being transferred to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, known as MOHELA.\n\nBiden is also weighing broad student loan forgiveness\n\nFacing political pressure from the left, President Joe Biden is also considering whether to take executive action to broadly forgive a portion of the balances for 43 million people with outstanding federal student loan debt. He told reporters last week that “the end of August” remains his timeline for making a decision on whether to take action.\n\nKey Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have been calling on Biden to cancel $50,000 per borrower. But Biden has consistently pushed back on canceling that much and has suggested he would support wiping away $10,000 per borrower.\n\nUntil now, Biden has taken a more targeted approach to student debt relief. His administration has authorized the cancellation of $26 billion so far – more than any other administration – largely for borrowers who were defrauded by their for-profit colleges and for permanently disabled borrowers.\n\nHe has also temporarily expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that forgives the debt of government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of payments, and made changes to the income-driven repayment plans, bringing millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness.\n\nBut it’s not entirely clear if the President has the power to broadly cancel student loan debt with an executive action. Biden initially urged Congress to take action to cancel student debt, but Democrats don’t have the votes needed to pass a bill doing so.\n\nA recent Supreme Court decision that limits the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to fight the climate crisis may complicate Biden’s decision-making process. The court’s ruling signals that the justices may be inclined to constrain the executive branch’s authority to make significant policy changes if its power to do so is not explicitly laid out by Congress.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}]}
{"question_id": "20220729_3", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/investing/spirit-jetblue/index.html", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nJetBlue Airways on Thursday announced it would purchase Spirit Airlines, a combination that would create America’s fifth-largest airline.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after Spirit pulled the plug on a deal to merge with Frontier.\n\nJetBlue had been pursuing a hostile bid for Spirit even while Spirit sought shareholder approval for a lower-priced deal with Frontier. Spirit had continually expressed concern whether regulators would approve a deal with JetBlue. But shareholders had balked at accepting Frontier’s less-valuable cash-and-stock offer when they had JetBlue’s all-cash offer on the table.\n\nJetBlue CEO Robin Hayes said the deal will be fruitful for investors and passengers.\n\n“We are excited to deliver this compelling combination that turbocharges our strategic growth, enabling JetBlue to bring our unique blend of low fares and exceptional service to more customers, on more routes,” he said in a statement.\n\nHigher fares\n\nBut industry experts have said the deal could lead to higher fares across the industry. A Frontier-Spirit deal, by contrast, would have brought together two airlines that have very low base fares. Neither airline has first class or business class seats.\n\nThe presence of Spirit or Frontier on a route typically forces larger airlines, such as American (AAL), United (UAL) and Delta (DAL), to offer more seats at their similar bare-bones basic economy fare. JetBlue may argue that it charges less than the larger network carriers, but its airfares are higher than Spirit and Frontier’s. And JetBlue plans to reconfigure the Spirit planes if it acquires the airline to add first class seating.\n\n“Spirit and Frontier play a big role in the fare you pay, even if you never fly either one,” said Scott Keyes, founder of Scott’s Cheap Flights, a web site that helps passengers find cheaper fares. “When Delta announced the basic economy fare in 2012, they described it to investors as a ‘Spirit-matching fare,’ because their lunch was getting eaten by the budget carriers of the world. I’m not a fan of either merger, but I like the JetBlue option even less.”\n\nFor that reason, it’s possible that the JetBlue deal for Spirit will face strong antitrust scrutiny from the US Department of Justice, particularly if the Justice Department views the acquisition as harmful to consumers.\n\nThe proposed JetBlue Spirit deal is smaller than many airline mergers of recent decades, which turned the 10 largest US airlines into four mega-carriers that control 80% of US air traffic. But the Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive stance on questions of antitrust law and vowed to promote greater competition within the airline industry.\n\nBiden’s Justice Department sued to block an alliance between American and JetBlue that allows each airline to book passengers onto the other’s flights. Spirit pointed to that legal action when arguing a JetBlue deal wouldn’t get the necessary approval.\n\nMore competition?\n\nBut those doubts about a deal with JetBlue were nowhere to be found in Spirit’s comments Thursday.\n\n“We are thrilled to unite with JetBlue through our improved agreement to create the most compelling national low-fare challenger to the dominant U.S. carriers,” said CEO Ted Christie.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC Thursday, Christie was pressed about the criticism he had about JetBlue’s offer in the past, and his doubts about regulators approving the deal.\n\n“We’ve learned a lot over the last few months,” he said. “They’ve got an aggressive strategy to get this deal done. We’re going to be right by their side making sure it happens, because it’s good for our group. Some of the narrative is this is going to create a big national competitor to the Big Four.”\n\nJetBlue’s Hayes said the best argument for regulators is that this deal will provide another major national carrier and create more competition, not less.\n\n“We’re focused on getting this deal done,” he said on CNBC. “We’re focused on bringing more airplanes in, offering more low fares and great product to customers in more geographies than JetBlue or Spirit could do alone.”\n\nWhile passengers might like the low fares offered on Spirit and Frontier, they typically did not like the service. Spirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints in 2021, with 11.45 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.38, while Frontier came in third with 5.78. Frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints in 2020, when it recorded 49.31 complaints per 100,000 customers.\n\nThe deal\n\nThe deal announced Thursday would pay Spirit shareholders $33.50 per share in cash, including a prepayment of $2.50 per share in cash payable upon Spirit stockholders’ approval of the transaction — even before the deal closes.\n\nJetBlue will pay Spirit shareholders an additional 10 cents a month for any delay in closing after December of this year, which could raise the price to $34.15 a share. And if regulators block the deal, JetBlue will pay Spirit $70 million, and its shareholders would get an additional $400 million.\n\nSpirit will have to pay Frontier $25 million to cover costs Frontier incurred during merger discussions. If JetBlue is able to close its deal for Spirit within the next 12 months, Spirit will owe Frontier an additional $69 million.\n\nWednesday evening when its deal with Spirit was terminated, Frontier expressed regret but vowed it will be able grow even without a merger.\n\n“With JetBlue seeking to convert Spirit Airlines into a high-cost airline, Frontier will be unmatched as the ultra-low cost leader,” it said.\n\nIf JetBlue (JBLU) closes the deal this year at $33.50, it’ll be a 38% premium over Spirit (SAVE)’s closing price Wednesday and about $1 billion more than Frontier’s offer had been worth. Shares of Spirit (SAVE) were up 4% in premarket trading on the news, while JetBlue (JBLU) shares gained 1%. Frontier shares were little changed.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "http://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/investing/spirit-frontier-airlines-merger/index.html", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSpirit and Frontier Airlines on Monday announced a $6.6 billion merger, a combination of low-fare carriers that would create America’s fifth-largest airline.\n\nThe companies have yet to say what brand they’ll fly under or who would lead management of the new airline. The combined company would offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations.\n\nThe merged carrier would leapfrog JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) in the number of miles flown by paying passengers, according to 2021 statistics, putting them behind the four major airlines that control about 80% of the nation’s air traffic – American, Delta (DAL), United (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n“This transaction is centered around creating an aggressive ultra-low fare competitor to serve our guests even better, expand career opportunities for our team members and increase competitive pressure, resulting in more consumer-friendly fares for the flying public,” said Spirit CEO Ted Christie.\n\nThere are only 519 routes currently served by both airlines, out of 2,832 combined routes, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. That’s equal to just 18% of their routes, suggesting a combination will have only limited impact on reducing competition for passengers.\n\nLike most of the US airline industry, Spirit and Frontier have been struggling with losses the last two years as air travel plunged during the pandemic. On Monday, Spirit reported a 2021 loss of $440.6 million, excluding special items, such as federal assistance that went to all US airlines. That was an improvement from the $719.6 million it lost on that basis in 2020. Frontier reported it lost $299 million on that basis in 2021, roughly the same as in 2020.\n\nBut the two airlines’ combined fourth quarter revenue was down only 2% from their combined revenue in the final three months of 2019. That’s much closer to pre-pandemic levels than at the four major airlines. Much of that is due to the fact they depend primarily on leisure travelers, not business passengers, who have been slower to return to flying.\n\nLow fares, low approval\n\nThe combination would bring together two airlines that have very low base fares, but charge passengers extra for most things, including carry-on bags. Although their passengers might like the low fares, many don’t like the experience of flying with them.\n\nSpirit had by far the highest number of passenger complaints, with 13.25 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to stats from January through September 2021 kept by the US Department of Transportation. JetBlue had the second most complaints on that basis with 6.85, while Frontier had the third most in the industry with 5.76. Frontier had by far the worst rate of complaints in the same period of 2020, when it recorded 60.24 complaints per 100,000 customers.\n\nFrontier and Spirit also had the industry’s worst customer satisfaction ratings, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index.\n\nFrontier suffered some badly-timed service problems Monday morning, soon after it announced the planned merger. A technology issue temporarily resulted in all of its flights being grounded, the FAA disclosed. The statement from the airline said the problem was quickly fixed.\n\n“Earlier today, we experienced a technology issue which led to some flight delays and cancellations,” it said in a midday statement. “The issue was identified and has been resolved. We are working to restore our flight schedule for the balance of the day.”\n\nRegulatory hurdles\n\nWhether or not the merger will be approved by federal antitrust regulators remains uncertain. The Biden administration has taken a much more aggressive approach on antitrust issues. It recently blocked an alliance between American and JetBlue that fell short of a full merger. Increasing competition in the airline industry is one of the issues that the Biden administration has cited as a priority.\n\nExecutives involved in the proposed Spirit-Frontier deal say they believe the merger will bring more competition to the industry.\n\n“This is the type of transaction the administration should in fact support,” Bill Franke, chair of Frontier’s board and the managing partner of Indigo Partners, Frontier’s majority shareholder, said in an interview Monday on CNBC. “It’s beneficial to the consumers. It’s beneficial to the employees. It’s beneficial to the communities that the airlines serve. And at the end of the day, even in combination, these two airlines will control less than 10% of the market.”\n\nBut experts aren’t sure the regulatory approval will be as easy as the airlines hope.\n\n“In a normal environment we would not expect any regulatory hurdles given the relatively small market share of each airline. But given the Biden Administration’s ‘big is bad’ approach we would expect some objection,” said Savanthi Syth, airline analyst with Raymond James.\n\nThe US airline industry has been greatly reshaped by mergers in the last 25 years. The four largest airlines today were formed from a series of mergers of 10 airlines. This would be the United States’ first airline merger since Alaska Air purchased Virgin America in 2016.\n\nThe $6.6 billion value of the deal includes assumed debt, such as aircraft leases. The value of the stock and cash being exchanged would be $2.8 billion, based on Friday’s closing price.\n\nFrontier would be the purchasing airline in this deal, as Spirit (SAVE) shareholders would receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each of their shares. That would represent about a 20% premium based on Friday’s closing price. But Spirit (SAVE) shares are up only 13% in midday trading, while Frontier shares were little changed, suggesting investor uncertainty about the deal being completed.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}]}

{"question_id": "20220729_5", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/cnn-poll-january-6-trump/index.html", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter the eight public hearings held by the House Select Committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, the American public’s views on the state of democracy and the threat posed to it by that event have changed little, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nAt the same time, a public consensus has emerged that former President Donald Trump acted at least unethically in trying to hold on to his office after the 2020 election (79% feel he acted either unethically or illegally, including 45% who believe his actions were illegal), that he encouraged political violence in his public statements ahead of January 6 (61%) and that he could have done more to stop the attack once it had begun (77%).\n\nAll told, the poll finds that 69% of Americans consider the January 6 attack to be a crisis or major problem for American democracy. That’s up slightly since earlier this year, when 65% said the same. More broadly, 54% say they see American democracy as under attack, about the same as the 52% who felt that way earlier this year.\n\nAlthough there was little movement on each of these questions, partisans appear to be moving in opposite directions. While Democrats are becoming more likely to say democracy is under attack (55% now, up from 46% earlier this year) and that the January 6 attack is a major problem or a crisis (96% now, up from 91%), Republicans are now less likely to feel that way than earlier this year, before the select committee’s hearings. Just 36% of Republicans now say that January 6 was a crisis or major problem, down 7 points since February, and 54% feel American democracy is under attack, down from 66% earlier this year.\n\nRoughly 4 in 10 overall have been closely following news about the select committee’s hearings (41%), with attention concentrated among Democrats (55% of Democrats are following at least somewhat closely, compared with 40% of independents and 28% of Republicans).\n\nAbout half of all adults say they think the investigation the committee has carried out has been a fair attempt to determine what happened (47%), while 34% say it’s been a one-sided effort to blame Trump, the rest feel they haven’t heard enough to say. Those figures are largely unmoved compared with polling earlier this year.\n\nMost (60%) doubt that the committee’s work will result in changes that help protect American democracy. Democrats are the most optimistic here, 65% think it will lead to meaningful change, compared with just 37% of independents and 17% of Republicans.\n\nAlthough there are divisions by party in how Americans view Trump’s behavior around January 6, majorities across party lines agree that his conduct in trying to remain in office was at least unethical and that he could have done more to stop the attack. Nearly all Democrats (97%) and a broad majority of independents (83%) say Trump acted unethically or illegally in trying to remain in office, but so too do a majority of Republicans (55%). And likewise, 55% of Republicans say Trump could have done more to stop the attack once it began. Eight in 10 independents (81%) and 93% of Democrats say the same.\n\nAsked whether then-Vice President Mike Pence or Trump did more to act in the best interests of the country on January 6, most Americans (67%), including broad majorities of Democrats (91%) and independents (64%), say Pence had the nation’s interests more at heart. Republicans split on the question, however, with 52% saying Trump did more to protect the country’s interests and 46% saying Pence did.\n\nAnd Republicans do not agree that Trump’s statements leading up to January 6 encouraged political violence. About 8 in 10 Republicans (79%) say Trump’s statements did not encourage violence, while 66% of independents and 94% of Democrats say they did.\n\nThat said, a broad majority continue to reject the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen: 69%, a new high in CNN’s polling, say that Biden legitimately won enough votes to win the presidency in 2020. Still, most Republicans continue to say that Biden’s win was not legitimate (66%).\n\nRepublicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to say that the GOP should be accepting of candidates who believe the 2020 election was stolen (72% say it should be at least somewhat accepting of those candidates) than they are to say that the party should be accepting of those who say the election was legitimate (63% say so). Combined, 30% say the party should only be accepting of candidates who say the election was stolen, 22% only those who think it was legitimate, and 42% say the party should accept a mix of both.\n\nThere are broad divides on these questions between those Republicans who want Trump to be the party’s nominee in 2024 and those who do not. Among those who say Republicans ought to nominate someone else, there’s wide acceptance of those of all perspectives on 2020: 79% say the party should be accepting of candidates who believe the election was legitimate and 62% say it should be accepting of those who believe it was stolen. Trump’s backers within the party, though, mostly say to accept those candidates who think the election was stolen (86%) and not accept those who think it was legitimate (57%).\n\nStill, a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters now say they do not want Trump to be their party’s presidential nominee in 2024 (55% say they want a different candidate), a slight shift away from Trump compared with earlier this year (49% preferred someone other than Trump in a poll conducted in January and February). An increasing number say they feel that way primarily because they just don’t want him to be president (27% now, up from 19% earlier this year).\n\nTrump’s standing among Republican-aligned voters in advance of the 2024 campaign, though, is not as perilous as President Joe Biden’s position among his partisans. The new poll finds three-quarters of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (75%) want the party to nominate someone else in 2024, a sharp increase from 51% earlier this year.\n\nThinking more generally about 2024, the poll finds that most Americans (57%) express at least some confidence that the nation’s democracy would be able to withstand a losing presidential candidate’s attempt to overturn the election results in 2024, but that confidence is tepid. Just 19% say they are very confident that US democracy could survive such an effort, with confidence stronger among Republicans (26% very confident vs. 17% among Democrats). In overall confidence, younger Americans are notably skeptical about US democracy’s ability to withstand an attempt to overturn the results of the 2024 presidential contest: While 63% of those age 45 or older express at least some confidence, only 49% of those under age 45 agree.\n\nThis CNN poll was conducted July 22 to July 24 by SSRS online, using sample drawn from a probability-based panel.

We’re changing that, and it starts with making sure that rural communities are connected to affordable, reliable high-speed internet,” White House Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Coordinator Mitch Landrieu said on a call with reporters. “Thanks to the hard work of the President, (Agriculture Secretary Tom) Vilsack and the team at USDA Rural Development, our administration is providing more than $400 million in loans and grants to fund high-speed internet infrastructure for rural communities this week.”\n\nMany rural areas across the country lack access to high-speed, affordable internet largely because installing the infrastructure isn’t worth the investment for internet service providers to take on. The new projects’ funding, which will come through the USDA ReConnect loan and grant program, is aimed at the construction, improvement and acquisition of facilities and equipment to support rural broadband access. Additional announcements for program funding are expected over the course of the summer.\n\nVilsack said that the $401 million in funding that is being announced today will support 20 projects in 11 states – Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, North Dakota and Texas.\n\n“This is a tremendous opportunity for us over the course of the next several months to roll out over a billion dollars of investment in connecting people to a better and more modern future,” he added, highlighting how connectivity will give support farmers, expand access to telemedicine in remote areas and expand access to distance learning opportunities.\n\nNevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on the call that a portion of the funding will go to projects in her state, including $27.1 million grant awarded to Uprise Fiber, which “will go to improve broadband access in rural Lovelock, Nevada.”\n\nThe project, she said, will connect some 4,000 people, 130 businesses, 22 farms and seven public schools across rural Nevada to high-speed internet.\n\nEarlier this month, the White House announced that 1 million American households have signed up for broadband internet credits through the Affordable Connectivity Program since the introduction of GetInternet.gov in May.\n\nThrough the program, eligible participants can receive a $30 monthly credit toward the cost of their internet service plan, or a $75 monthly credit for households living on Tribal lands. The administration estimates that a staggering 40% of American households are eligible for the credit.\n\nThursday’s announcement marks the latest effort by the administration to highlight infrastructure projects spurred since the start of President Joe Biden’s time in office.\n\nUnlike the rural internet projects announced on Thursday, the Affordable Connectivity Program is funded through a provision of the massive bipartisan infrastructure bill passed last year.\n\nIt will take some time for many of the infrastructure projects funded by the bipartisan bill – new roads and bridges, for example – to come to full fruition due to planning and approval processes and getting shovels in the ground. But the Affordable Connectivity Program is a rare effort yielding nearly immediate and tangible benefits, a critical win the administration can tout ahead of the midterm elections this November.\n\nAdditional funding through the bipartisan infrastructure law for rural internet projects is expected to roll out next year.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the grant amount awarded to Uprise Fiber. It is $27.1 million.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}]}
